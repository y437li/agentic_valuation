Berryman - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Shelley Young - Director of Investor Relations Analysts :  Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Faiza Alwy \u2013 Deutsche Bank Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Operator : At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances First 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Shelley Young : Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF\u2019s first quarter 2014 conference call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our first quarter results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com. This call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.  Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements which I will read out loud. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the second quarter and our outlook for the full year of 2014. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 2015 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and is on our website. With me on the call today is Doug Tough, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nicholas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Matthias Haeni, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Matthias joins us for the first time in his new role, so welcome, Matthias. I would now like to turn the call over to Doug. Doug Tough : Thank you, Shelley. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Before I start my formal comments, I would like to extend a warm welcome to Matthias Haeni. As of April 1, Matthias assumed the role of Group President, Flavors after serving as Regional General Manager of Flavors for our EAME region for the past three years. Prior to that, Matthias was the Regional General Manager for Flavors of our greater Asia region. Under his leadership, IFF expanded our manufacturing network in Asia and Europe. We opened new plants in China and Singapore for Flavors, and more recently, we have been expanding our strategically located facility in Gebze, Turkey which will serve the fast growing emerging markets in the region, region, including the Middle East and Africa. We also achieved consistently strong sales and operating profit growth in both EAME and greater Asia in Flavors. Matthias is a 23-year veteran of the flavors and fragrance industry, and we are pleased and excited to have someone with his experience and insight in this role. Turning to the agenda for today's call, I will provide an overview of the first quarter for consolidated IFF, followed by Nicolas Mirzayantz and Matthias Haeni, who will provide their perspective on the performance of our fragrances and flavors business segments, respectively. Then Kevin Berryman will provide you with a financial overview of our first quarter and turn the call back over to me for a balance of the year outlook and some concluding comments before we open the call to your questions. Turning now to the first quarter of 2014, our local currency sales growth was 7%, which reflects balanced growth between flavors and fragrances and includes a percentage point of growth from our Aromor acquisition, which we acquired on January 15. This quarter, fragrance delivered growth of 8%, which includes 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor, and flavors achieved growth of 5%. Growth this quarter was also more balanced between the emerging markets, which grew 7%, and the developed markets, which grew at 5%. Our organic growth this quarter reflects a higher level of new wins, consistent with our performance in 2013. The level of new wins was strong across both business units due to our emphasis on innovation and technology, and the strength of our teams in leveraging our consumer insights, R&D, and creative capabilities to provide outstanding, high-performance products for our customers. As you may recall, on our fourth-quarter call we said we expected to see more moderate top-line growth in the first quarter following a strong Q4. We were pleased that we were able to deliver 7% growth for the second consecutive quarter. Due to some seasonal order patterns, we had stronger than expected sales in the final few weeks of the quarter, which accounted for a large portion of the upside to our original forecasts.  On a regional basis, our strongest local currency growth was achieved in greater Asia, where we are investing in new facilities and capacity and technology in order to support our customers. We saw continued strong double-digit growth in many of the countries where IFF has committed capital, such as Singapore, China, and Indonesia. We also delivered high single-digit growth in EAME and positive growth in Latin and North America. All of our regions are seeing positive growth, which added to our overall sales growth. Turning to our profit margins, our gross profit margins improved 150 basis points versus the prior year. Our strong growth and favorable mix of business contributed to the margin expansion. Our adjusted operating profit in the first quarter of 2014 increased 14%. This is primarily due to our strong growth, combined with margin expansion and disciplined cost control. The results of Aromor were not significant to our consolidated financial performance. IFF's adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.32, in line with our long-term growth targets. We did not benefit from the R&D tax credit this quarter, which resulted in a higher effective tax rate than our adjusted tax rate in the primary year. In summary, we started the year with strong top-line momentum, which resulted in favorable gross and operating margin expansion and enabled us to grow our adjusted earnings per share by 11%.  I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas and Matthias, so they can provide more detail on their respective business units. Nicolas, it's over to you. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Thank you, Doug. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our fragrance business, we had a very strong first quarter with many highlights. Fragrance net revenue of $404 million increased 9% this quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, fragrance delivered local currency sales growth of 8%. This includes 2 percentage points of growth from our recent Aromor acquisition. The strong overall organic growth of 6% reflects a continued high level of new wins, resulting in continued momentum and broad-based growth. The developed market had local currency growth of 9%, and the emerging markets had local currency growth of 2%, indicating the benefits of our geographic and customer diversity. Regionally, our strongest region this quarter was greater Asia, with local currency growth of 16%, and our EAME region had local currency growth of 12%. North America had growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong momentum from new wins and increased coalesced participation. With our stronger move this quarter in our developed markets, a reversal of what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters, due to a higher volume of fine fragrance sales, in particular to customers in North America and Western Europe, we delivered double-digit growth in fine fragrance in both our North America and EAME regions. Regarding our decline this quarter in Latin America, I would like to put our results into perspective. We are comparing to very strong growth of 15% in Latin America in the first quarter of 2013, including 37% growth in fine fragrance and 11% in consumer fragrances, both higher than the market growth. The overall fragrance business unit growth of 8%, even with the decline in Latin America, points to the strength and diversity of our portfolio. In regard to our end-use category of commercial (inaudible) with fragrance compounds, were recently realigned. Starting with our first-quarter results, we are reporting our top-line sales growth consistent with our new organizational structure. Fragrance compounds consist of two newly-defined market categories : fine fragrances and consumer fragrances. Fine fragrances needs no further explanation. Consumer fragrances consist of five end-use categories, including fabric care, home care, personal wash, toiletries, and hair care. Fine fragrance achieved 10% local currency growth this quarter compared with growth of 1% in the first quarter of 2013. This growth reflects very strong performance with our customers in Western Europe and the United States. We are seeing continued momentum in some of our prior launches, such as Invictus for Men by Paco Rabanne from Puig and La Vie Est Belle by Lancome from L'Oreal. Due to the ongoing longevity and popularity of our classic fragrance launches, which are still in high demand by global consumers, we continued to have strong usage volume in addition to our strong win rate. Consumer fragrances had steady growth of 4%, led by double-digit growth in hair care and high single-digit growth in fabric care, offset in part by a small decline in home care. Our hair care category was up double digits in North America, Europe, and Latin America; and single-digit in greater Asia, in large part due to our success in providing our customers with consumer-preferred fragrances. Our performance was very strong in fabric care, particularly in greater Asia, which accounted for more than half of the upside due to a high level of new wins in both global and regional customers in the region.  Our fragrance ingredients business, which now includes the results of Aromor, had local currency growth of 22%. Aromor added 14 percentage points to the ingredients end growth. The business growth of 8% benefited from sales of unit product families, including specialty ingredients. We also saw the continued planned migration of some of our volume in fragrance compounds. Excluding the impact of both Aromor and the planned migration, which had a 4% negative impact on growth, fragrance ingredients had growth of 12%. Next quarter will be the final quarter of the planned migration of volume from ingredients to compounds.  In summary, we achieved very good top-line growth, thanks to the strength and diversity of our portfolio, customer base, end-use category, and consumer insight in our key markets. Here you see both our top-line and operating profit growth. As you can see, we were able to leverage our 8% local currency sales growth into higher segment operating profit expansion of 28% due to gross profit improvements combined with improved cost control. Our gross margin this quarter benefited from strong volume gains and improved end-use category mix, as well as a favorable impact of price to input costs and continued focus on cost reduction through multiyear programs, which have resulted in productivity enhancements. The extreme margin growth combined with the higher growth units resulted in a $19 million improvement in segment profit to $87.2 million. Our segment profit margin improved 320 basis points to 21.6%. For the second quarter, we are expecting continued momentum in the business. We are anticipating a modest amount of inflationary pressure in the input cost environment in the second half of the year. And we have been focused and continue to focus on driving efficiency into our portfolio to reduce our overhead cost structure. To that end, over the past few years we restructured and streamlined our organization. We reduced our manufacturing footprint both in compound and ingredients and realigned our organization to increase go-to-market and offer improved alignment with customers. By implementing these actions, we were able to minimize price increase to our customers.  Before I conclude, I would like to make a few comments about our recent acquisition of Aromor. We are very pleased they have joined IFF, and all of our teams, R&D, creative, commercial, operations, and finance, are working closely with our new colleagues to ensure a successful integration. Our combined R&D pipeline is very strong, and we are working collaboratively to capture synergies between the two organizations.  I am also pleased that some of our new launch in the second half of the year will include fragrances formulated using our new molecules, which you may recall were only recently launched internally. This signifies not only our consumers\u2019 confidence in our new molecule pipeline, but also shows our faster speed to market, which is a testament to the collaboration of the entire team and improved processes. Before I turn the call over to Matthias, our new President of Flavors, I would like to welcome him to the new role and wish him continued success. Matthias Haeni : Thank you very much, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to be here on today's conference call. I joined the team in New York. Turning to our sales performance, in the first quarter Flavors achieved local currency sales growth of 5%, led by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, which continued to be a strong and important driver for our business. We achieved solid growth within our long-term targets despite weakness in North America, thanks to the diversity and breadth of our portfolio and customer base. Notably, we achieved strong performance in many of the countries where we committed or are committing capital to add capacity or technology. In particular, the growth we are seeing in emerging markets of greater Asia, Latin America, and central and southeastern Europe clearly supports our investment strategy. In total, Flavors grew 12% in the emerging markets, led by Latin America, where we had growth of over 20%; and greater Asia, which achieved high single-digit growth. Turning to the regions, in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as you see on the slide, we had solid growth of 4%. This was supported by growth in all categories. In greater Asia there was widespread growth across all end-use categories, resulting in total local currency sales growth of 8%. There was double-digit growth in many countries, and we were extremely pleased to see the continuation of strong trends. In North America this quarter we saw a decline reflecting overall market weakness. It resulted in lower volumes on existing business, and new wins were not sufficient to offset these volume losses. Our customers have been impacted equally to softer market environment we are seeing in North America, and we are closely monitoring the situation. Finally, turning to our strong performance in Latin America, I know Hernan talked about Latin America in the past and the improvements that IFF was making in this market. Our people in the region have been working hard to leverage our technology and creation capabilities to develop new growth opportunities. And we are seeing the results of their efforts in terms of strong new wins, especially in beverages, where our technologies are opening new avenues for growth. Latin America increased 23% in the quarter and was up double digits for the second consecutive quarter. The accelerated positive momentum is based on the strength of our product offerings; based on our creative and application know-how; and customer intimacy, which is ultimately the hallmark of IFF. We also look at our performance through the lens of end-use categories. Flavors delivered double-digit growth in beverages and mid-single-digit gains in savory and dairy, all supported by our health and wellness platform. As you know, our Flavors' creative and applications teams worked with customers across end-use categories to develop high-performing products that address the needs of health-conscious consumers who want great-tasting food and beverages that have less fat, less salt, and less sugar. In summary, Flavors achieved solid and widespread growth, with emerging markets, again a key growth driver. Turning to our financial performance, local currency growth of 5% included high levels of technology-driven wins and double-digit growth in the emerging markets. Historic volume growth, combined with mix gains, net favorable pricing inputs, costs, and manufacturing efficiencies resulted in enhanced gross margin again this quarter. At the same time, we exerted tight control over our fixed expenses, resulting in increased growth leverage. The margin gains combined with disciplined spending resulted in a 6% or $5 million improvement in our segment profit performance this quarter. Put another way, our segment profit margins expanded by 70 basis points to 24% in the first quarter. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2014, we expect moderate growth as we compare to strong like-for-like growth of 8% in the second quarter of 2013. We expect continued growth in the emerging markets, where we have made significant positive investment in capacity and creation capabilities to better serve our customers.  In summary, our performance this quarter was solid on top and bottom lines. We continued to make focused investments to better serve our customers and to provide growth for the short, medium, and long term. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, our CFO. Kevin Berryman : Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see on the slide, our performance was certainly strong in Q1. Our net sales of $770 million were up on a reported basis by 6%. Excluding the 100 basis point negative impact of foreign currency this quarter, our consolidated local currency sales growth was 7%. As noted earlier, our consolidated sales included the results from our recent acquisition of Aromor, which added a percentage point to our consolidated growth. We are pleased with the initial results from this strategic acquisition and welcome our Aromor colleagues to our global organization. This quarter, fragrance represented 52% of our sales, and flavors comprised the remaining 38%. Our growth in the quarter was well balanced between flavors and fragrances. We had a strong mix of business between the emerging markets and developed markets, up 7% and 5%, respectively. Our adjusted gross margins this quarter improved by 180 basis points to 44.7%, which reflects gross margin expansion in both business units due to very strong volume gains, certainly driven by growth from the wins, sales mix improvements, as well as some favorable impact of price to input costs and cost reduction initiatives. Strong margin growth and disciplined cost control resulted in a 14% increase in our adjusted operating profit to $159 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter of 25.5% was above our effective rate of 24% in the first quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting loss of tax benefits relating to the U.S R&D tax credit this year. As a result, our adjusted EPS growth of 11% brought our first quarter adjusted EPS to $1.32, resulting in an EPS growth in line with our long-term targets. Turning to our Research, Selling, and Administrative costs, RSA as a percent of sales increased 10 basis points this quarter, from 23.9% of sales to 24% of sales, for an increase of $11.5 million. The increase reflects the addition of Aromor to our operating results as well as slightly higher incentive compensation accruals for the quarter. We remain focused on maintaining cost discipline while investing in research and development and other strategic growth opportunities. Importantly, our research and development spending was 8% of sales in the quarter, consistent with our continued focus on driving our innovation agenda.  Here you see our customary chart showing the change in the strength of the euro relative to the dollar. This quarter, despite the strengthening of the euro, foreign exchange had a 100 basis point negative impact on our top-line growth, as favorable foreign exchange rates were more than offset by a significant weakening of some currencies during the quarter, including the Indian rupee, the South African rand, the Japanese yen, and the Australian dollar. As it relates to our bottom line, however, as a result of our hedging programs and proactive management, FX had a slight positive impact on our EPS, reflecting our continued focus on reducing volatility in our results through our cash flow hedging programs or other measures. At this point in the year the full-year impact on our bottom-line growth is expected to be somewhat favorable versus year ago at current foreign exchange rates. As a reminder, for 2014 the majority of our euro exposure is hedged at a rate of $1.32, close to the average for 2013. Turning to our cash flow, our operating cash flow in the first quarter of 2014 was $35 million compared with an operating cash flow of $19 million in the prior-year quarter. The prior year cash flow included a $30 million incremental U.S pension contribution. The year-over-year increase reflects the $16 million improvement in net income, partially offset by increased incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013. As a percent of sales, the current-quarter operating cash flow is 4.5% of sales compared with 2.6% in the year-ago quarter. Core working capital improved in absolute dollars to support our business growth; however, it declined on a percentage of sales of the business. Turning to our capital structure, capital spending for growth in infrastructure and newer technology continued to be our most important use of cash. Over the past few years we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and provide newer technologies to our customers in all markets. As Matthias mentioned, we are in the midst of building out our manufacturing capacity and building a new creative center in Turkey. At the end of 2013, we also announced a $50 million investment in Indonesia to build a new manufacturing facility in the Jakarta area and install a new creative center on our existing site in Jakarta for our customers. We are also committed to returning capital to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and cash. We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $0.39 a share. In addition, in the first quarter of 2014, we spent $20 million on share buybacks, representing 227 million shares at an average price of $88.70, which brings our total spending program to date to $71 million through the end of the first quarter. Based on the current share price, we continue to expect that we will spend more our share buyback in 2014 than we did in 2013.  Subsequent to quarter end, we also completed the extension of our $950 million credit facility to April 4, 2019, at more attractive rates than our previous revolver. This provides IFF with continued financial flexibility and a lower cost than the Company's previous facility. Finally, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities such as Aromor and other entities, and we are targeting those opportunities that will provide us with access to new technology, geography, or business adjacency that will make strong strategic sense and leverage our expertise in science and technology.  Before turning the call back over to Doug, I would like to provide you with an update on the performance of our portfolio as it relates to economic profit. This slide highlights the progress we have made in improving the return profile of our overall portfolio. I would like to highlight that while improving the return profile, we have been delivering against our sales growth objectives, consistent with our long-term financial targets. This demonstrates our ability to both grow the business while improving the profitability of our portfolio.  The pie chart on the right shows the breakdown of our portfolio at the end of 2013, while the pie chart on the left shows the breakdown of our portfolio at the end of 2009, the year immediately preceding the initial implementation of economic profit as a management tool. At the end of 2013, 80% of our invested capital was supporting EP positive categories, up from 65% in 2009. Furthermore, a full 95% of our portfolio is now EP breakeven or positive, up from 85% in 2009, or an improvement of 10 percentage points.  As you may recall, as part of our objective to strengthen our overall portfolio, we identified in 2011 approximately $50 million of operating profit opportunity that we believed we could realize while applying the principles of economic profit and driving efficiencies into the underperforming parts of our portfolio. By exiting lower-margin sales activities, focusing on profitable growth, and driving operating efficiencies, by year-end 2013 we had exceeded our going-in target of $50 million -- two years ahead of our original estimated time. This has been reflected in our improved operating margins and results. Today, we still believe there are additional opportunities to improve certain parts of the portfolio further while delivering meaningful product innovation. While we expect that this will represent additional profit opportunities, we also expect that certain growth investments will be made that will offset this benefit over the next few years. These ongoing, continuous improvement efforts are a fundamental part of our three-pillar strategy. I will now turn the call back over to Doug discuss our outlook and provide a wrap-up. Doug Tough : Thank you, Kevin, Matthias, and Nicolas. As you heard from the team, we had a strong start to the year based on our operating performance. Our local currency sales growth of 7% was higher than our original forecast. Given the strong start to the year, we are reconfirming our expectation for local currency sales growth of 5% to 7%, which includes a percentage point of growth from the Aromor acquisition. Due to the volume growth and the improved mix of business, we delivered strong gross and operating margins. Our adjusted operating margins achieved growth of 14%, while our adjusted earnings per share increased 11%. We\u2019re also reconfirming our expectation to deliver double-digit operating profit and earnings per share growth for the full year. For the second quarter we expect more moderate sales growth. However, given our emphasis on productivity savings and other margin improvements, we expect to see continued gross margin expansion, but at a lower rate of year-over-year improvement, especially as we compare the improved gross margin performance of the prior year in quarters two, three, and four. In addition, we are also closely monitoring input costs and expect to see some inflationary cost pressure in the second half of the year. Certain input costs are expected to increase. Our emphasis on our 10 key research and development platforms has resulted in a stronger pipeline for the Company, and we continue to invest in our programs and subject them to a disciplined review process to make sure they are proceeding on track. For the second quarter of 2014 we are expecting to achieve sales, operating profit, and earnings per share growth within our long-term targets. I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, we achieved strong momentum in both business units, with more balanced growth between our emerging and developed markets. We also achieved growth in both our local global and regional accounts. This diversity provides us with greater stability and enabled us to achieve 7% growth, even when some areas of our business are facing a more challenging set of circumstances. Second, we have made and continue to make strategic investments in the business to expand our footprint and make sure we have the necessary capacity to grow with our customers in the regions and to continue to work with new customers who have strong local positions. We are able to work with global, local, and regional customers and provide them with consumer insight, R&D expertise, and fragrance and flavors that they can sell to consumers anywhere in the world.  Third, we continue to grow our gross and operating margins by focusing on productivity, efficiency, and quality improvements and we have seen the benefits in our strong profit growth. Fourthly, our strong performance reflects the collaborative efforts of our people to leverage our consumer insights, R&D, and creative capabilities to provide outstanding results for our customers and our shareholders. We are making investments in our people to make sure they have the necessary training and development to better serve our customers and anticipate future trends. And fifth, we continue to execute against our three strategic pillars to leverage our geographic reach, to strengthen our innovation platform, and to maximize our portfolio. We continue to believe execution of our three pillars will enable us to drive profitable growth for our shareholders. Thank you for your participation today. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) and your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus : Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Matthias. I guess just couple -- few questions. One just sort of broader question on the developing markets, so a bit of a slowdown relative to 2013 growth. I guess we\u2019ve heard from some of your larger customers that they are starting to see a slowdown. I guess maybe sort of quantify what you've seen year-to-date in 2014, and how you are thinking about that growth going forward -- and maybe even talk about specific markets, countries where you may be seeing a bit of a slowdown. And then Matthias, can you talk a bit about the North America business? I know you haven't been there that long, but maybe talk a bit about what you are thinking about expectation-wise in terms of potential improvements, since it's not just this quarter. It\u2019s been a bit weak over the last year or so. Doug Tough : Okay, Mark, I will start off, and then I'll ask both Matthias and Nicolas to weigh in with their perspectives. I think the overarching comment is we still have great confidence in overall emerging market opportunities, the celebrated next billion consumers. We believe that trend is inexorable, and we remain committed to it. I'd also say that -- and you will get more specifics in a minute, but to the degree that some of our customers are sensing or mentioning some of the slowdown, it's been marginal for us. And the buoyancy continues pretty good across almost all of the major emerging markets. So we haven't seen the trend to the degree they have, and we remain bullish. But you\u2019ve asked specific questions and I\u2019ll ask Matthias to start, and then Nicolas can weigh in with thoughts from fragrances. Matthias Haeni : Thank you. Let me tell you that we are really pleased to see development which we see with the emerging markets. We have seen very strong momentum in Latin America, but also in most of the strategic key markets in Asia Pacific as well as in central southeastern Europe, and strong, focused markets for our folks in Africa. As such, we don't see a slowdown. I believe we have continued to put solid momentum going forward in these markets. Coming back to your question on North America, indeed we are disappointed with our performance in the first quarter this year. We have experienced lower volumes on existing business; and new wins, which we had particularly in key categories like beverages could not offset the weakness we have experienced with our sales in many key accounts. I tried to outline that we will be up against very strong comparables. Also, in the second quarter in North America we will expect a different order pattern and a change in our performance in the second half of this year. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Mark, good morning. This is Nicolas. Sentiments overall regarding our confidence in the emerging markets, they have been a growth engine for many quarters in the past. You see we have continued momentum in greater Asia following last year's momentum, and coming from a very, very good -- increased new wins and increased penetration of the market, and also leveraging our encapsulation technology. So maybe the additional comments will be about Latin America. The decline that we saw is coming after nine consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. I think that -- let me chart it through drivers. First of all, we are comparing to very strong growth of 15% in the first quarter last year, and as I indicated 37% including fine fragrance and 11% in consumer fragrances. It would be sure to say that we are seeing in major countries, such as in Brazil, with the market slowing down a bit, and also some inventory correction from some of our customers. Two important factors moving forward; first of all, the level of new wins is comparable to our historical average. So our momentum and our coalesced participation and success is continued. And also, we are early in the quarter. And we are seeing a reversing of the trend in Q2. So it's really one quarter which will be impacted by the factors I just shared with you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Good morning, guys. Great start to the year. Nicolas, you talked about three to four areas that drove the improvement in operating margin this quarter, pretty impressive there in the low 20s. Can you maybe give us a feel of which of those 3 to 4 areas were most pertinent and sustainable for the rest of the year? Is this sort of a new level of profitability we should expect going forward? And then one for Matthias. Congratulations on the new spot there. Anything different that you are going to drive going forward? I think Hernan had a great run. Anything new that you expect to do to drive growth and keep that business on track? Thank you. Kevin Berryman : Okay, Mike. This is Kevin. Thanks for the call, and let me make a couple of comments as it relates to some of the drivers on margin, and then I can turn it over to Nicolas to provide further clarity. Look, I think at the end of the day we have continued to be driving the maximization of the portfolio, which is about a lot of initiatives throughout the organization to help drive incremental profitability into the portfolio. That really was the primary driver to our improvements in margin on a total basis for the Company. If you think about growth leverage, you think about the benefits of mix, you think about the cost reduction initiatives that are in place, those were the majority of the driver for the gross margin improvement. Of course, that was really the big driver to our operating profit improvement as it relates to the combination of the two, the volume, the growth at the top line as well as the gross margin improvement. So, the road from -- slight benefit as it relates to the net benefit of input costs and pricing options that had been taken, are really the big drivers. And the material part of the improvement was relative to the growth leverage, the mix, and the cost reduction initiatives. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Mike, this is Nicolas. Just to add to Kevin's comment, you have already talked about the extreme focus on the productivity initiatives, and we've really reduced our footprint. We've been focusing on some of the most effective parts of our portfolio. We invested. It's the result of innovation and really driving the innovations of our portfolio faster. And now you are on the level of execution. So all these productivity initiatives, along with the focus on really maximizing our portfolio and driving innovation have been some of the key drivers of the improvement. Matthias Haeni : Thank you very much, Mike. We have made significant investments over the last few years in key strategic markets and added infrastructure to increase capacity, but also in our creative skillset. We have a very strong innovation pipeline in our health and wellness portfolio, where we are addressing the demands to reduce sugar, fat, and salt. I am very confident we will capitalize on the many investments which we have made in the past in our fold. I\u2019m very proud that I have a very strong management team which I can take over from Hernan. Doug Tough : And, Mike, it might be fair for me to weigh in, having worked with Hernan and now Matthias for a short while. Matthias is focused on technology, and technology being a driver of growth and innovation is probably something I have really noticed. And it fits and aligns really well with what we are trying to do. Matthias's knowledge of the industry and technology is going to be a real plus for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy \u2013 Deutsche Bank : So I have a couple of questions. First of all, I wanted to get an update on the input costs. I know that you talked about a benefit this quarter, but then the back half is expected to be -- it's supposed to be more expensive on the input costs side. But then it looks like you took some pricing this quarter. So was that pricing related to the expected increase in input costs in the back half? Or -- and then more specifically, where exactly are you able to take the pricing this quarter? And then my second question was on for selling and admin costs. It looks like those increased -- and I know you highlighted the incentive comp increase. Was that really the only thing that drove that increase? Or were there any costs associated with, for example, the Aromor acquisition that you may have considered as part of adjusted operating profit, but may really be extraordinary? If you could just comment on that. Thanks. Kevin Berryman : Thanks for the question, Faiza. I think, first thing, on pricing, we really didn't take any pricing in the quarter. So if you look at our top-line performance, it's really related to volume and mix, which is driving the top line. So, no real fundamental change in pricing levels for the quarter. The second point as it relates to input costs, we feel pretty comfortable as we sit here today that our current inventory levels plus contractual arrangements won't result in there being a material change and any pressures on gross margins this year, per se. But we do know that current pockets of areas of input and material are in fact at elevated levels versus what we would be enjoying at this particular point in time in terms of our costs. So once we get back into the market and are purchasing those new inventory levels, they will be at higher prices. And we expect that to be occurring over the back half of this year. I would call out a couple of areas. I would call out citrus. I would call out onion. I would call out patchouli as some areas where we know that there are some increases in costs coming. So as we realize those costs, we will be having targeted discussions with certain customers to understand those pressures that will be developing. And certainly, as we enter into 2015 we\u2019ll start to see some of that flowing through the P&L. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yang with Oppenheimer. Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Good morning and congratulations a nice quarter. Just following up on the question about pricing. How often do you go back and talk to customers now on pricing? Back in the day in the industry, I think generally you kept prices pretty stable and tried to get higher prices on new products. But I think that changed during some of the raw material inflation we saw in the last five years or so. So how often do you have these conversations at this point in terms of pricing? Kevin Berryman : Let me take a stab. This is Kevin -- at the question. I think it really is depending upon the specificity of the issues that are involved and the magnitude of the increases. And we could have targeted discussions with one group of customers because of the mix of the materials that they use, and no discussions with other customers, because they are not faced with the same dynamic. Look, if in fact there is a general minor cost increase, I think generally speaking, we don't look for pricing relative to that, because we look to drive efficiencies into our portfolio on an ongoing basis. So we try and limit our asks for price increases for our customers. But when we look at the increases that we are expecting in the areas I called out, they are high enough where we are going to need to have a discussion with certain customers, and that will be occurring probably over the back half of the year, as we see those costs developing. Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: And do the customers, Kevin, come back and initiate pricing discussions on their own? For example, if you are getting raw materials relief, do they ask for -- have they been asking for concessions? Kevin Berryman : I think as in any buy/sell relationships, our customers always ask for lower prices. I think that's a continuous kind of process. But certainly, it becomes a little bit more elevated if, in fact, they believe there are input cost reductions that we are able to realize. But I would remind you, though, at the end of the day, the input costs where we are today are still at very extraordinary levels versus historical. And so at the end of the day, we are still underwater in terms of gross margins, just from the input cost increases we saw over the course of 2011 and 2012. We\u2019ve recovered the gross profit, but not the gross margin impact of that. So as we look at these input costs going forward, we\u2019ll be having those targeted discussions with customers. Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And just some final cash flow questions. Buyback activity -- you said that would be up year over year. Could you give a sense of the range there? Is it still going to be targeted towards primarily offsetting options creep? And the CapEx was up 13% year over year. What's your expected spending for 2014? Kevin Berryman : Sure. Our expected spend is consistent with the message that we have been delivering over the last actual few years. We will be in the neighborhood of 4.5%, so between 4% and 5% of sales. And I would say probably closer to 4.5%, kind of in the middle of that range in terms of CapEx. In terms of the share buyback, certainly at current share price levels, I would say it will be slightly above the amount of the share buyback that we had last year. But certainly, that's dependent upon what's happened on the share price going forward. If we see significant increases, we\u2019ll probably be buying a little bit less. And if we see significant decreases, we\u2019ll be buying more. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Doug Tough : Thank you very much for everyone's participation on today's call, and we look forward to talking to you again in early August, when we have our Q2 results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's International Flavors & Fragrances conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin. Shelley Young : Thank you. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our second quarter results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com. This call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements, which I will read out loud. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the third quarter and our outlook for the full year of 2014. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors outlined in our 2013 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and is on our website. With me on the call today is Doug Tough, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Matthias Haeni, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the call over to Doug. Douglas D. Tough: Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start my formal comments, I would like to say how much I have enjoyed being part of IFF's journey these past 5 years. You will have read that as of September 1, I will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer and turning the reins over to Andreas Fibig, who is currently an IFF board member and was most recently with the German pharmaceutical company, Bayer. I will make additional comments about the transition at the end of the presentation. Turning to the agenda for today's call. I will provide an overview of the second quarter for consolidated IFF, followed by Nicolas Mirzayantz and Matthias Haeni, who will provide their perspective on the performance of our Fragrances and Flavors business segments, respectively. Then Kevin Berryman will provide you with the financial review of our second quarter and turn the call back over to me for a balance of year outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions. Turning to the second quarter 2014. Our local currency sales growth this quarter was 4%. As a reminder, our overall growth includes a percentage point of growth related to Aromor. We are comparing to strong like-for-like growth of 8% in the second quarter of 2013, supported by a high level of growth in both business units. This quarter, our Fragrances business delivered growth of 6%, which includes 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor. Our Flavors business, up against a very challenging comparability period of 8%, delivered growth of 1% this year. Growth was again void by a healthy level of new wins, which is indicative of the company's emphasis on innovation and technology and the work we are doing with our customers to deliver superior products that will delight their consumers wherever they may be. The emerging markets, which comprise 49% of our sales continued to outpace the developed markets with mid-single-digit growth of 5%. We saw some softening this quarter in the developed markets, which contracted 1%. It is worth highlighting that we achieved high-single digit and even double-digit growth in many of the emerging market countries, including Indonesia, China, India and Argentina, along with solid growth in Brazil and Russia. Looking at our growth on a 2-year basis, our overall growth was 6% comprised of 5% in Flavors and 7% growth in Fragrances, including Aromor. This growth is within our long-term targeted growth range. Our profitability remains solid. The company's gross profit margin improved 90 basis points versus the prior year and reflects our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross profit margin improvements. This quarter's improvement was primarily due to ongoing cost improvement initiatives, the net impact of price to input costs and favorable currency impacts in certain markets due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to emerging market currencies. Our adjusted operating profit increased 8%, reflecting the benefits of margin expansion and lower incentive compensation accruals versus the high year-ago levels, which reduced our overall cost structure. The results of Aromor were not significant to our consolidated financial performance. Notably, this quarter, our adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.37. EPS benefited from excellent organic profit results, a lower tax rate, reduced interest expense, foreign exchange gains on working capital and a slight reduction in the number of shares outstanding due to our share buyback program. In summary, we continue to deliver strong profitability metrics above our long-term targets even with moderate sales growth. It is important to note that 1 quarter is not indicative of a year. Our second quarter top line growth of 4% was weaker-than-expected. That said, I remind you that we had a very strong first quarter with local currency sales growth of 7% and adjusted operating and EPS growth of 14% and 11%, respectively, all metrics above our long-term targets. Let's review our first half of the year results. Our local currency sales growth was 5% comprised of 7% growth in Fragrance and 3% growth in Flavors. The 5% growth is within our long-term targets. On a year-to-date basis, our profitably metrics are above our long-term growth targets. Adjusted operating profit increased 11% during the first half of 2014. This was driven by significant gross margin expansion of 160 basis points, primarily due to cost savings initiatives, as well as the benefit of net price to input costs and reduced incentive compensation accruals versus higher year-ago levels. Our input costs continue to remain at elevated levels. Adjusted operating profit growth was supported by increased segment profit in both business units. Our adjusted earnings per share grew 16% in the first half of 2014. The double-digit growth in our adjusted EPS reflects our expanded growth in operating margins, lower interest expenses as a result of refinancing and the benefits of our share repurchase program, as well as favorable trends on foreign exchange so far this year. Of note, our operating and earnings per share profitability growth metrics are above our long-term growth targets. I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas and Matthias so they can provide more detail on their respective units. Nicolas? Nicolas Mirzayantz : Thank you, Doug, good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to our Fragrance business units. Fragrance had local currency sales growth of 6% this quarter compared with 8% growth in the second quarter of 2013, which was our highest growth quarter last year. Our 6% growth includes approximately 2 percentage points of growth from our Aromor acquisition, we said are captured in Fragrance Ingredients. On a 2-year basis, excluding Aromor, our sales growth is also 6%, which compares quite well with our long-term growth targets. This quarter, the emerging markets grew at 6% or twice the rate of our developed markets and represented 51% of our Fragrance Compounds sales. We achieved strong growth in the emerging markets of China, Indonesia and Brazil, which is one of our strongest Fragrance markets and where we have a leadership position. Our overall sales performance was a result of a strong pipeline of new wins in our Compounds business, which includes both our Fine Fragrances and Consumer Fragrances end-use categories. Fine Fragrances grew 14% in both Latin America and Greater Asia. This growth was offset by declines in our EAME region due to customer order patterns. Let me remind you that year-to-date, sales in the EAME increased 5%. North America was flat this quarter compared with a 13% growth in the year-ago quarter. That said, North America grew by 11% for the first 6 months of 2014. Although our overall Fine Fragrance category was flat this quarter on a 2-year basis, Fine Fragrances had growth of 7%, which is above our long-term targets end-market performance. Turning to Consumer Fragrances. This category had solid growth of 5% compared with 8% growth in the prior year quarter. Growth this quarter was led by high-single digit growth in Toiletries and mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care, Personal Wash and Home Care. Hair Care also grew this quarter. North America and Asia delivered double-digit growth, and Latin America was also positive. This was offset by a slight decline in EAME. Turning to our Ingredients business. Fragrance Ingredients delivered local currency sales growth of 21%, which includes 17% of growth from Aromor. The growth in Fragrance Ingredients reflect continuous strong sales of key IFF product families. Excluding the planned migration of some volume from Fragrance Ingredients to Compounds, Fragrance Ingredients would have grown by 9%. This quarter marks our final quarter of the planned migration of volume from Fragrance Ingredients to Compounds. In summary, we achieved solid top line growth thanks to the strength and diversity of our portfolio, customer base and end-use categories. On a year-to-date basis, our Fragrance business grew 7%, which includes 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor and is within our long-term targets. Turning to our profitability. We were able to leverage our 6% local currency sales growth into higher segment operating profit to achieve very strong business unit performance. Our gross margins benefited from volume gains and productivity savings combined with a favorable impact of price-to-input cost and currency benefits, offset by a small negative mix impact due to the reduced growth in Fine Fragrance. Our input costs continue to remain at elevated lead levels. The gross margin expansion, combined with decreased incentive compensation accruals from the high year-ago levels drove an improvement in our segment profit margins. These benefits were offset in part by increased RSA spending to support business growth. For the quarter, our segment profit increased 19% or an increase of $14 million. Year-to-date, our segment profit has improved by $32 million or 23%. Here are a few additional areas I'd like to highlight : Number one. We're seeing the impact of some higher raw material costs in our inventories, especially in naturals and petrochemicals. We expect input cost pressures to impact our P&L around the end of the year and to be developing headwind for 2015. We are proactively engaged in pricing discussions with select customers to offset the inflationary pressure. Number two. This quarter, we completed the purchase price accounting related to Aromor. And as a result, we will now have a modest ongoing amortization expense in our P&L. Number three. As planned, this quarter we closed our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Augusta, and we will see the cost benefits in H2. As always, our focus is on efficiency and making sure our operations are cost-effective and competitive. These recent initiatives support our strategic focus to drive improvements in our Ingredients business. Turning to our third quarter outlook. For the third quarter, we're expecting continued top line momentum in the business. We expect the rate of improvement in year-over-year gross margin to moderate in H2, especially when compared with the improvements we made in gross margins in the first half of 2014. We look forward to updating you next quarter. I will now turn the call over to Matthias, our new group President of Flavors. Matthias Haeni : Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Against challenging comps of 8% a year ago, flavors delivered local currency sales growth of 1% in the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2013 was our strongest like-for-like quarter of last year. New wins, which were at historical levels in the second quarter, continued to be a growth driver of our business. The volume from new wins was offset by a higher level of erosion on existing business, especially in North America where we had several very large new product launches in the second quarter of 2013. Looking at the 2 years average, Flavors had solid growth of 5% on a like-for-like basis for Q2. The emerging markets continued to drive growth for our business, representing 52% of sales. The emerging markets grew by 5%, led by double-digit growth of 15% in Latin America. The BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, all performed well, reflecting our ability to work with both global and local customers in these markets. Solid growth in the BRICs was offset by losses in other countries, including Thailand, which was pressured by geopolitical risk. On a year-to-date basis, we grew by 8% in the emerging markets, with 90% of our growth coming from these markets. From a regional perspective, in Europe, Africa and in Middle East, local currency sales increased by 2% on top of 5% growth in the second quarter of 2013. Growth was strongest in Beverages, Sweet and Dairy, partially offset by softness in Savory. In Greater Asia, this quarter we were disappointed in our flat growth versus 8% like-for-like growth in the year-ago quarter. Gains in the Savory and Sweet end-use categories were offset by declines in Beverages and Dairy. In North America, the operating environment continues to be challenging. Volume erosion on existing business was significant and more than offset our growth from new wins. As mentioned, this was driven by several large product launches last year and we were comparing to growth of 11%, which is the most challenging comp of the year. Finally, we saw continued very strong growth in Latin America of 15%, driven by our proprietary technologies in Beverages, which resulted in very strong growth in the category, reflecting a very high level of new wins. On a year-to-date basis, Latin America has grown by 19%. The second quarter is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our Latin America region. Turning to our profitability metrics. Flavors' gross margins remained strong at prior year levels as a result of our technology-driven wins and creative capabilities. Our segment profit improved by 1% or $0.9 million to $91 million or an increase of 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. The improvement reflects flat gross margins combined with decreased incentive compensation provisions versus the high level of a year ago. Our input costs continue to remain at elevated levels. On a year-to-date basis, our segment profit increased 3.5%, or $6 million, or an increase of 40 basis points. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2014. We expect growth to be moderate given the ongoing challenges in North America and Western Europe. We are carefully monitoring the situation, yet we remain confident we can continue to leverage our innovation and technology to grow our business. I also want to highlight that we have begun to see input cost pressure on some items in our inventory. We are expecting to see the increased cost pressures in our P&L around the end of the year, and we will likely see headwinds in 2015. As a result, we have been proactively working with customers on price increases to help mitigate these inflationary pressures. As of 2014, our current strategic initiatives and other cost savings should offset any cost increases in 2014. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin, our CFO. Kevin C. Berryman: Thank you, Matthias, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to turn back to our consolidated results. And on the slide, you can see that we delivered again strong operating metrics again in the second quarter on a consolidated basis. Our net sales of $788 million were up 4% on a reported basis and also on a local currency basis. Our consolidated sales includes the results from Aromor, which added a percentage point to our consolidated growth. This quarter, Fragrances comprised 52% of our sales and Flavors, the remaining 48%. Our growth was the result of our diversity in terms of regions, end-use categories and customers. Emerging markets grew 5% this quarter and the developed markets declined by 1%, reflecting a challenging environment in North America for Flavors and a slower growth in Fine Fragrance in Western Europe during the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin this quarter improved by 90 basis points to 45.1%. This primarily reflects gross margin expansion in Fragrance due to volume gains, certainly a result of strong new wins, currency benefits, as well as the favorable impact of price to input costs and internal improvement initiatives across both business units. The strong margin growth combined with lower incentive compensation and favorable currency resulted in an 8% increase in our adjusted operating profit to $156 million, resulting again in our operating profit margin rising to 19.8%, up 60 basis points from the year-ago figure of 19.2%. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter of 24.9% was favorable to our adjusted figure of 26.5% in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions and the effect of favorable tax settlements, partially offset by higher repatriation costs and the absence of the R&D tax credit in the current quarter. The strong operating profit growth, when combined with foreign exchange gains, lower interest expense and the positive impact on earnings per share of our share repurchase program, this resulted in a year-over-year improvement of 21% in our [indiscernible] $1.37. Importantly, the growth in all of our profitability metrics in the second quarter are all at or above our long-term growth targets. Now that we are halfway into the year, I wanted to put things into perspective by looking at our operating performance for the first half of 2014. It's important to note that on a year-to-date basis, all of our growth targets are in line with or above our long-term growth targets. Our net sales of $1.6 billion increased 5% on both a reported and local currency basis, and of course, that includes approximately 1 percentage point of growth from Aromor. This is clearly within our long-term growth target of 4% to 6% organic growth. Our adjusted gross margins also increased 130 basis points to 44.9%. Regarding adjusted operating profit, it increased 11% in the first 6 months of 2014, reflecting in part lower incentive compensation accruals. This equates to 110 basis point improvement in our operating profit to 20.2%. Finally, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $2.69 for the first 6 months of 2014, ahead of our long-term growth targets. Turning to our research, selling and administrative costs. RSA, as a percent of sales, increased 30 basis points from 25% of sales to 25.3% of sales or an increase of $10 million. The primary drivers of the increase include Aromor-related cost, including operating and amortization and acquisition costs, investment in commercial resources to support our 3-pillar strategy, currency impacts and several discrete items. These higher expenses were partially offset by reduced incentive compensation accruals versus the very high levels in the second quarter of a year ago. We remain focused on maintaining cost discipline while investing in R&D and other strategic growth opportunities. This quarter, R&D spending was 8.4% of sales versus 8.5% in the prior year. The prior year figure, as you may recall, includes an initial payment to Amyris, as well as other investments in research and development. Importantly, our emphasis on R&D has resulted in a stronger pipeline of innovation, and we continue to invest in our R&D platforms and the programs that support them. Our strong cash flow position and margins provides us with the continued flexibility to do so. Turning to currency. Here, you see our customary chart showing the change and the strength of the euro relative to the dollar as the movement in the euro represents the large variable relative to currency impact on our results. As noted earlier, foreign exchange movements had a negligible impact on our top line growth. As it relates to our adjusted operating profit and EPS results for the quarter, year-over-year currency impacts were positive. And at the operating profit line, we continue to proactively manage our gross margin profile through our cash flow hedging programs. During Q2, we specifically benefited from a stronger U.S. dollar versus several of the emerging market currencies, which favorably impacted local expenses. Finally, EPS growth also benefited from the absence of foreign exchange losses and working capital, which we experienced in the second quarter of 2013 due to the high level of volatility in foreign exchange markets in the second quarter of last year. As a reminder, the 2014 -- for 2014, the majority of our euro exposure continues to be hedged at a rate of 1.32%, close to the full year average of 2013. Turning to our cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the first half of 2014 was $154 million compared with an operating cash flow of $118 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year cash flow included a $30 million incremental U.S. pension contribution and the year-over-year increase reflects the $34 million improvement in net income, partially offset by increased incentive compensation payments in the first quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013. As a percent of sales, the current quarter operating cash flow is 9.9% of sales compared with 7.9% in the year-ago quarter. Core working capital increased in absolute dollars to support business growth, however, declined on a percentage of sales basis and is on-track for targeted improvements that we outlined at the beginning of the year. Turning to our capital structure. Capital spending for growth and infrastructure and newer technology continues to be our most important use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and to ensure that our proprietary technologies are available to our customers around the globe. We are also committed to returning capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized a 21% increase or $0.08 in the quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share, up from the $0.39 per share a year ago. This dividend is payable on October 7 to shareholders of record as of September 25. Including this authorization, IFF's quarterly dividend payment will have grown by a compound annual growth rate of 15% over the last 4 years. The current authorization importantly reflects the board's confidence in the company's ability to continue to execute on its 3-pillar strategy based on the notable progress we've made in expanding our geographic footprint, developing our R&D pipeline and improving the margin profile of our portfolio. The double-digit increase in the dividend also reflects our strong cash flow position. This enables us to maintain a competitive dividend yield, continue to execute against our share buyback program, all while maintaining a strong amount of financial flexibility to aggressively explore M&A opportunities. Regarding our share buyback program. On a year-to-date basis, we have spent approximately $34 million on share buybacks. Total program spending since the first quarter of 2013 is $86 million through the end of the second quarter. Based on our programmatic share buyback program, we continue to expect that we will spend more on share buybacks in 2014 than we did in 2013. Finally, as noted, we continue to evaluate business development opportunities. We are targeting those opportunities that would provide us with access to new technology, geography or business adjacency that would make strong strategic sense and leverage our expertise in science and technology. We have the financial flexibility to invest in both external business development activities, as well as our organic growth programs. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Doug. Douglas D. Tough: Thank you, Kevin, Mathias and Nicholas. As you've heard from our teams, we've had a good first half of the year with local currency sales growth of 5% and adjusted operating profit and earnings per share growth of 11% and 16%, respectively, all in line with or above our long-term targets. As you have heard, volume erosion on base business in Flavors put pressure on our top line growth despite a level of new wins that was in line with historical norms. We expect to see continued erosion in the third quarter in Flavors. For the third quarter, we expect sales growth to be in line with our Q2 results as market conditions for Flavors will remain challenging. We expect to see continued gross margin expansion, but at a lower rate year-over-year, especially as we compare to the improved gross margin performance of the prior year and the improvements we saw in the first half of the year. In addition, we are closely monitoring the input costs. And as Mathias and Nicolas indicated in their remarks, we expect to see some inflationary cost pressure around year end, which will have an impact on our 2015 P&L. As a result, we have been proactively working with customers on price increases to help mitigate these inflationary pressures. As to 2014, our current strategic initiatives and other cost savings should offset any cost increases in 2014. Turning to the full year, given our current visibility, we now expect our full year local currency sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%. Our full year profitability metrics remain intact. Cost control and manufacturing efficiencies will continue to drive our operating profit growth. We are reconfirming our expectation for double-digit operating profit and earnings per share growth for the full year. The investments we are making in R&D have resulted in a strong pipeline of innovation. We are confident that the commercialization of these technologies will result in continued sales growth and margin gains for the company. As most of you know, in late May, we announced IFF's CEO Succession Plan. Effective September 1, I will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer and will remain active as IFF's Chairman. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at IFF but have always said that at some point, I would scale back my involvement to make time for other activities. I have just celebrated my 65th birthday and I am looking forward to doing other things, including more time with my family, children and grandchildren. The board has selected Andreas Fibig as the next CEO of IFF. Andreas has been a member of our board since 2011 and has been actively involved in setting our strategy and charting a course for the future. Andreas comes to us from Bayer Pharmaceutical, where he has successfully introduced new pharmaceutical solutions and drove a profitable growth agenda. Importantly, he is known to the Board of Directors and to our senior management team who value his insight and his input. He understands the value of R&D and driving the innovation agenda, understands and help develop our emerging market strategy and has previous operating experience in the emerging markets. Finally, Andreas has a successful track record with merger and acquisitions and will be a great addition to IFF as the company looks to further drive its profitable growth strategy, both organically and through business development activities. We welcome him to IFF and look forward to working with him, and I look forward to introducing him to many of you. Here are the key takeaways from our second quarter call. In summary, our overall growth of 4% in the second quarter and 5% year-to-date reflects strong results in Fragrances and mixed results in Flavors. Our sales growth slowed in Q2 on account of greater erosion on existing business. We expect to see continued erosion in the third quarter in Flavors, which has led us to reduce our full year top line sales forecast. The breadth and diversity of our portfolio provides greater stability to absorb variations in a particular region, category or customer. We can really see how effective this business model was for us this quarter as our overall growth of 4% had some great success which offset areas of weakness. The second quarter compares to our most challenging quarter in 2013 from a top line growth standpoint. We continue to believe strongly in our strategy and long-term growth potential, and we are positioning IFF for future success. Our commitment to innovation, portfolio enhancement and internal improvements support our strong gross margin profile. We remain focused on our 3 strategic pillars : Leveraging our geographic footprint, enhancing our innovation and maximizing our portfolio. I thank you for your participation today on our Q2 earnings call, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I'm curious, given recent M&A in Flavors and Fragrances and adjacent categories, are there still value-accretive deals for IFF? And have you had to change the way you define value in terms of looking at that? Douglas D. Tough: Good question, Mark. There's certainly been a recent spate of activity in a couple of areas. I think the broader question is, are there still opportunities there? And we believe the answer to that would be yes, conceivably both within the organic footprint, but also adjacencies which would leverage off the some of the skills and competencies we have, particularly in R&D. Some of the recent price points that have been achieved on a couple of the deals have certainly exceeded previous transactions, and that will weigh in on value. But I think as we've talked about in our 3-pillar strategy and the opportunities to continue to grow in the emerging markets as that middle class comes forward, we think there's still robust opportunity for growth. So it's not a prerequisite that we have M&A activity, but we are certainly, as Kevin pointed out, we have the financial firepower to do so if the opportunity presents itself, and we remain eager and we'll evaluate things. But you have used a critical word in there, which is, are there still value opportunities? And the economic profit discipline that we've instilled in the company will be germane to all the things we look at, and so we will have to have value in order to go forward. But we're confident there will be opportunities. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Got it, okay. And then just one follow-up for Matthias. Could you talk maybe a bit more about what's driving Flavors erosion? Is it large customers? Is it local customers? Is it specific categories of weakness? And maybe even talk about how that flowed through the quarter? Matthias Haeni : Mark, this is Matthias speaking. As I tried to outline in the call, we had a significant erosion, particularly in North America. In North America, we were also up to significant comparables of last year as we have seen a few very large product introductions last year. These were seasonal, probably more trendy product launches, heavily supported by our customers and commercials. And we see in our shortfall versus prior year, approximately 2/3 of our shortfall is driven by a few select products and customers. Going into Q3, I think we will see some continued softness not only from these introductions and the comparables, but also from the market situation, which turned to be a bit more challenging, and that has also been supported and communicated by many of our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I did just want to follow-up, I guess, first, on Asia. You've mentioned specifically that China and India were still quite strong, Thailand being the source of weakness. But just for the math to work, I mean Thailand is about, I think, 2% of company sales, which just seems like there may have been something else that was a drag, maybe it was a collection of things, but a little bit more color there would be really helpful. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Lauren, this is Matthias speaking again. Thank you for your question. I really tried to outline in Asia. We had seen a mixed picture. We had seen China, India grow strongly and we have seen some challenges in Southeast Asia. Not only Thailand, which is very much impacted by geopolitical situations and unfavorable market situations. We have also seen some challenges in Indonesia in the second quarter. However, I would like to remind, in the first quarter in Indonesia, we had very strong double-digit growth, and we expect to see a normalized pattern going forward. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then overall, at least in the way that I was modeling the quarter, North America actually was a little better than I expected. It was really EAME that kind of stood out as weaker-than-expected. At least as far as Western Europe goes, a lot of your customers, at least the publicly traded ones, have been talking about things maybe seeming a little bit better from a consumer standpoint there. So if maybe we could get a little bit of color on both Flavors and Fragrances, what you're seeing in Western Europe, and if the sources of weakness there was more developed or developing markets? Matthias Haeni : This is Matthias again. In Western Europe, we experienced some of the challenges. I think it's not across-the-board. It is in a few -- with a few select customers. We keep on winning, thanks to our technology program, in particular, where we helped customers to reduce calories in products, but also to reduce sodium. We have a strong approach to pipeline, but as I outlined, we see some challenges relative to erosion of the business. Nicolas, do you maybe want to add something? Nicolas Mirzayantz : Lauren, it's Nicolas here. I will separate, obviously, the trend in Fine Fragrance in the Consumer Goods. As you saw, we had a very strong Q1 in Fine Fragrance of plus 18%. I think it's more related to order patterns, which had affected our performance in Q2. So overall, 5% growth for the first 6 months, which is above market performance. So I think that it's there, but -- we obviously watch out the overall environment and the economic situation. When I look at Consumer Fragrances, we have seen some pocket, obviously, of instability in the region, especially Middle East, Africa but also Eastern Europe, which is impacting the demands on our customers affecting consumer demand, which has created some pocket of headwinds. So we're seeing some improvement as our customers are mentioning. Would it be a meaningful improvement? I don't expect so. But at least we will see some improvement. So it's really a mixed performance according to the countries or subregion that you're talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : In terms of your outlook for 2014, from double-digit EPS growth, you don't really need a lot of growth in the second half to get there. Can you maybe give us a little bit of help of how you see the second half? I know you don't like to give guidance on a quarterly basis, but are you implying that maybe the second half isn't double digits because your first half was pretty impressive. Kevin C. Berryman: Mike, this is Kevin. I'll make just a few comments. We don't imply anything as it relates to what the second half of the business actually looks like in terms of performance level, but I think the mere fact that we are calling for strong double-digit growth in both operating profit and the EPS, I think is indicative that, again, we feel that our second half of the year is going to warrant good performance. At the end of day, we do have, as outlined, kind of a reduction from what we would have originally said on the top line. We had a 5% to 7% range. Now, we're a 4% to 6%. That doesn't mean anything other than probably the high end of our range before is probably unlikely now. And so consequently, we continue to believe that we have a good second half of the year. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Right, great. And then a quick question on Fine Fragrances. Latin America still seems to be an area that continues to do well. I've heard Brazil is kind of a sore spot for some folks. Any worries there that, that business will slow down? Or do you have a pretty good backlog of new products to keep that momentum going as we head into the second half of the year? Nicolas Mirzayantz : Mike, it's Nicolas again. As you know, last year, we had a very strong first half where we grew 29%, which was far above the market performance. Here, you saw that after some challenge, but it was mostly due to strong comp, minus 15% in Q1 versus plus 38% last year. We have a lag on new good growth, 14% above 20% last year. So we have a good strong pipeline of new wins. But it is fair to say that across categories, Brazil has faced some slower growth rate across customers and product categories. So our pipeline of new wins is strong, and now, it will be -- we have to see other market, and the consumer demand will develop in the next few months. But our performance related to the market is strong. Now, we'll have to see what will be the impact of overall consumer demand. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And one quick one in North America Flavors. In terms of the market sentiment, are customers opting not to launch as many new products as we head into the second half of the year? Or is it maybe some attrition of the base business that's maybe going away faster than you would have thought? Matthias Haeni : This is Matthias speaking. Frankly, I cannot tell what our customers are going to launch in the second half of this year. I can tell you that we have a strong project pipeline. Our commercial performance, which means the wins are in line with historical levels, yet still need the pressure on a few select customers, and volume remains strong. And we firmly believe we have the ability to win. We have a significant project pipeline, a very strong innovation pipeline that will make a significant difference, which is a lasting difference for our customers and IFF. Douglas D. Tough: Now this is just an augmentation to what Matthias is talking through. If you look at the top line in the second quarter, you -- our growth from the new wins continue to be very solid. Where we saw the weakness, as Matthias outlined, really is more Flavors-specific and it's the erosion on existing business, which Matthias has already outlined, and some of that is associated with some discrete items on specific customers. So there is some other general erosion that we've seen in Flavors, but the thing that is most important and what we're driving relative to our innovation programs continues to be robust, and we see that pipeline being -- continuing to look pretty solid. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. I was wondering if you can indicate how much of the gross margin contribution this quarter came from volume price mix and how much may have been from a favorable pricing over raw materials? Kevin C. Berryman: We haven't disclosed that information, Silke, but ultimately, we had drivers of volume mix because of the amount of our growth was more limited this quarter. And especially, as a Nicolas outlined, mix was not as positive as it normally is because of the Fine Fragrance situation that he suggested, but we saw good cost reduction initiatives. We saw some benefits on net pricing, and there was some currency all were adding up to be some positives as it relates to the gross margin. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And in terms of the savings that you expect going forward, there are the benefits from the plant closure in Augusta, and my recollection is that was on an annual basis, maybe to deliver something like $6 million to $8 million. Do you think you may be able to get half of that in the second half? And what was the effect of the amortization expenses from Aromor that are falling away? Kevin C. Berryman: The -- a couple of things. The $6 million to $8 million is still the expectation on an annual basis. So we would expect, given the timing of the closure, that we will get roughly half of that. Most of the costs as it relates to the acquisition, which we'll refer to, are really relative to the amortization cost. So those will be ongoing. Regardless, the net impact to Aromor on a total basis is immaterial within the context of the profitability of the company. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then lastly, I guess ultimately, just like to revisit the North American Flavors issue one more time. So the comparisons are really -- in North American Flavors were very difficult. And I agree, your commentary wasn't different than what your competitors said. Though, in the second half, the comparisons are becoming noticeably easier. And so one of the question is, will you -- is there 1 more quarter of headwinds because there's something customer-specific? Or is it going to be 2 or 3 more quarters of headwinds? Matthias Haeni : Well, I thank you for your question. We will see continued softness in the third quarter in North America. You are right. We see ease -- comparisons easing in the fourth quarter. And we also expect the third quarter to improve relative to our second quarter performance in North America Flavors. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rohini Baza [ph] with Deutsche Bank. Rohini Nair - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Rohini Nair from Deutsche Bank. Doug, wishing you all the best as you move on to the next adventure. A few more questions for me on North America Flavors. I guess I'd just love to understand whether you are actively taking any steps towards stemming this volume erosion that you're talking about? Or is it just that you eventually anticipate an improvement in the consumer environment? Along with that, what are you seeing from those specific challenged customers that you think they can improve on? Is it that their new product development is really not up to par? Are they not managing their inventories correctly? It'd just be great to have your thoughts around that. Matthias Haeni : I think in North America, as we see some pressure overall in the market, we see more and more customers also being very cautious in product launches, and cautiousness is often the result of the seasonal launches. And if the seasonal launch is not going to be a big success, they will take it off the market. I think we see and we'll see continued situations in North America where very large customers are bringing a so-called limited time offerings to the market. We see it in many of the categories. And if this limited time offerings are not very strongly supported by commercials and marketing advertisements, you will see erosion quickly. Now I'm confident that with the project pipeline, which we have, and what we are working with our customers, we are working much more on iconic brands again, brands which are in the marketplace for quite some time, extensions of brands which will stay for a longer period of time. And it remains to be seen what we will get as new product launches in the fourth quarter. We have some visibility on the third one and we feel confident. As for the fourth and beyond, we will see what type of dynamics we are going to experience. Douglas D. Tough: I would just want to build on something Matthias said, which is in the context of what are the actions being taken, and there's probably a couple. There's obviously a financial discipline associated with cost and investments. But we actually see some significant opportunities in the North American market, particularly with some customers. So both account management and focus on innovation, as well as opening of offices to support these customers, that's actually on our horizon because of the confidence we have in the innovation pipeline. So there's as much, if not more, offensive-based activities as they are defensive in terms of returning the business in North America to growth. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : That's helpful. If I could have just one quick follow-up. Those categories that you're seeing that are weak, is it basically across-the-board, Sweet, Savory, Dairy, Beverage, or are you seeing it more concentrated? Matthias Haeni : I think it is more concentrated towards Savory and Beverages. And we keep on making very good inroads in other categories. I -- the isolated cases I was referring to from last year, they're in probably 2 categories only, and this is mainly related to Beverages. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : Just one question I had. With some of the pressures in developed markets, Flavors business specifically, what's the competitive landscape end like? Has there been an uptick in bid activity or in competitive shuffling, as presumably, your competitors in Flavors are feeling some of the trends you're feeling right now? And to the extent you could mention the pricing environment as it relates to that competitive activity, I'd appreciate it. Matthias Haeni : I think the -- I tried to outline -- we see some pressure in North America. We see some pressure in Western Europe. Nevertheless, given our opportunity and ability, coupled with the very strong project pipeline and our innovation programs, we are obviously -- these opportunities materializing for us very positively going forward. We have a lot offer to our customers. And what our offering is not only adding great flavors. In our offering, we also are in the position to add taste to products, and with taste, we are also, at the same time, engineering, together with customers, on lower-cost recipes for their own consumers. So overall, I'm very confident that we see opportunities in both in the developed markets, but also in the developing markets, and our growth and model and growth thesis remains strong. And we have a very sound, solid foundation in the Flavors business unit. Operator : Your next question comes from Edward Yang. Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : A question on pricing and raw materials. What percentage type of price increases do you need from your customers to offset some of the raw material prices -- pressures you're seeing? Kevin C. Berryman: Ed, this is Kevin. We haven't disclosed that. And as you know, at the end of the year, when we talk to our Q4 results, we'll give a perspective on what the expected inflation levels are, and that may give you a better indication as to what kind of pricing may be required to help offset that pressure. But at the end of the day, we don't believe that we're faced -- just to make a few comments, we don't believe we're faced with the situation back in 2011, where we had double-digit input cost, but we do fundamentally believe that there are areas where we're going to have to take pricing to help offset input cost pressure beginning in 2015. So we'll talk more about that at the end of the year during our Q4 call. But not to be an alarmist, there's no need for us to be thinking along the lines of what would have happened in 2011. Your competitors will also, I would assume, be taking the same kind of positions because they'll be interested in trying to recover some of the input cost pressures they would see as well. Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Got it, and that's helpful, Kevin. And along that vein, I'm still -- I am surprised that you are talking about raw material pressures because, in general, it doesn't seem like the raw environment or the commodity environment is necessarily very heated right now. Raw material price pressures, are they driven by capacity reductions in certain areas, or drought, because I don't really see energy prices up all that much. And are there any offsets -- you mentioned naturals as the place where you're seeing raw material pressures, but in synthetics, are you seeing price declines to offset some of those pressures? Kevin C. Berryman: I think that you're right. The good thing about the diversity of our spend is that there's often times pieces of the portfolio that will go up, and it's often times offset to at least, to some extent, by other pieces of the portfolio that will go down. I would say the one area, and you've already outlined it, which we expect to in general have higher levels, is in the naturals area. We've already called out in the past, Citrus, as one particular area where we know that there's going to be some increases versus our current levels, and there's a few others. But in general, the majority of the pressure points are seen in the naturals area. There would be some others in the Fragrance Ingredients side, but ultimately, it's more in the naturals area at this particular point in time. And that's where we are focusing most of our discussions with our customers right now in terms of those future price increases. Operator : Our next question comes from Sarah Donnelly with Gabelli & Co. Sarah Donnelly - G. Research, Inc.: I just wanted to ask about some of the weakness which you mentioned in Savory and Beverages. Can you just talk a little bit about demand and the technology you have around sodium and sugar substitution and whether that continues to drive demand around new product or project -- your new product pipeline in North America and how it's impacting it globally? Matthias Haeni : Yes, Sarah, this is Matthias again. I mentioned before, in North America we have seen pressure on few select customers. So it's not across the Savory market or it's not across the Beverage market. Where we have seen pressure are product introductions that were very trendy, very fashionable, heavily supported last year. And also, we have seen our customers building up inventory for such a significant launch. And this is why we are also coming under pressure relative to last year's performance. Coming into the project pipeline, I mentioned to you before, we have a very strong project pipeline in both of what you've described in sodium, as well as in sweetness or in calorie reduction. We are very active, actively engaged with our customers with large global accounts, as well as with regional accounts to take calories out of recipes, not only in beverages but also in other product offerings, in other categories. And we got very positive response. And our win rate typically is significantly higher once we can allocate technology into the recipe design with our customers. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to go back to the earlier M&A question. Curious how you would describe your customers' reception to your competitors to do more business with those that have engaged in M&A and sort of adjacent categories and offering more of a one-stop shop, so in other words, you go beyond Flavors and Fragrances. Are customers more or less willing to engage with them? And how do they sort of think about things broadly, their reception to those deals? Douglas D. Tough: Well, it's a broad question, Mark, and maybe I'll take the first swing at it and then Matthias can weigh in with some second thoughts. It seems to be a bit of a mixed bag. Some -- there will be a certain degree of receptivity from some customers, probably smaller ones who are looking for a one-stop shop, but almost to the contrary, some of the other larger ones have unbundled things and aren't necessarily looking for that opportunity for a one-stop shop, and as I say to the country, actually going the other direction. So I think it's certainly early to tell. Some companies have that as their business model. It's not the IFF business model that would be the one-stop shop. Matthias, do you want to say anything? Matthias Haeni : I can echo what Doug outlined. I think medium-sized, or probably small-sized companies, they will appreciate a total product offering. It helps them in the facilitation of their recipe engineering, recipe design. And they also got a lot of probably additional technical advices from companies offering a total solution. When it comes to larger and above all, global accounts, they would typically ask you, Mark, to unbundle your total solutions and systems as they want to have control over individual ingredients and there will be very limited appreciation for what we think is the total solution for it. It may change from account to account. But if you want the experience, then this is what we are working with our customers on. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the call back over to Doug. Douglas D. Tough: Thank you very much, operator. Thank you, all, for your participation on our Q2 call. And we'll look forward to our discussion in early November with our Q3 results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Shelley Young, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Shelley Young : Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our third quarter results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com. This call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statement, which I will read out loud. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2014. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 2013 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items which we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today and is on our website. With me on the call today is Andreas Fibig, our CEO; Nicolas Mirzayantz, our President of Fragrances; Matthias Haeni, our President of Flavors; and Kevin Berryman, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Shelley. And good morning, good afternoon to everyone. This is my first earnings call as CEO of IFF, and I wanted to say how I -- pleased I am to be part of this great organization. During my first 2 months, I've had the opportunity to travel to many parts of the IFF world visiting customers and employees in Latin America, Europe and the United States; and just returned from an exciting trip to India and the Middle East, where I saw firsthand how we combine our core values of passion, creativity and expertise to partner with global and local customers to provide them with products that will delight their consumers. I've also had the chance to speak with several of our analysts and investors, and I look forward to meeting you all in person in due course. I also want to acknowledge our former CEO and current Chairman, Doug Tough, for providing a seamless transition. His insight, guidance and advice have proven beneficial, and I thank him for all of his support. As you may know, my career has been devoted to biopharmaceuticals, a different industry but one with many similarities to the flavors and fragrance industry. Both industries operate on a global scale. Both depend on constant innovation to deliver success. Both demand consistent focus on productivity and excellence in implementation. And both require extremely close collaboration with customers and consumer insight. IFF is a company with extensive global reach, a successful culture of innovation, strong financial results and passionate employees. I personally believe we can continue to improve our long-term business performance and increase shareholder value by executing our 3-pillar strategy of leveraging our geographic reach, strengthening our innovation platform and maximizing our portfolio. We are currently refreshing our strategy to make sure we have the necessary road map to drive our future growth. To put this in context, like any healthy company, we will regularly pressure test our priorities. All that being said, IFF has a strong foundation, and therefore, you can expect an evolution of strategy, not a revolution, as we look to how we can best work in close collaboration and partnership with our customers and their brands, continue to win in the marketplace and provide value for our shareholders. Turning to the agenda of today's call. I will provide an overview of the third quarter results for consolidated IFF; followed by Nicolas and Matthias, who will provide their perspective from the performance of our Fragrance and flavor business segments. Then Kevin will provide you with a financial overview of our third quarter and first 9 months of the year, and he will then turn the call back over to me for balance-of-year outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call for your questions. Turning to the third quarter of 2014. We continue to report solid growth, thanks to the diversity of our business and continued momentum in the emerging markets, where we now have 50% of our sales, more than any of our competitors. Our local currency sales growth of 4%, which includes a point of growth relating to the Aromor acquisition, was in line with our expectations and similar to the second quarter. Fragrances reported local currency sales growth of 5%, while Flavors reported local currency sales growth of 2%. We achieved solid growth in every region, with the exception of North America where we continued to face a challenging environment. In general, the trend on volume erosion improved over the prior quarter, but new win performance was at the low end of historical levels. Latin America was our best-performing region, increasing 9% in local currency. Flavors continued its very strong momentum, posting double-digit growth, while Fragrances grew high single digits in the region. Greater Asia increased 4% in local currency. Double-digit growth in Fine Fragrances and improved flavor results drove our performance in this region. EAME was up 6% in local currency as a result of strong performance by both business units in the Middle East. North America continues to be challenging market for both Flavors and Fragrances. The adjusted operating profit increased 7%, reflecting an increase in gross profit dollars, combined with reduced research, selling and administrative expense, while third quarter adjusted EPS increased a percentage point faster than our adjusted operating profit, growing 8% to $1.32. On a year-to-date base, our local currency sales increased 5%, reflecting 6% growth in the emerging markets and 1% in the developed markets, in line with our long-term sales growth targets of 4% to 6%. Our business unit Fragrances was up 7% on a year-to-date base, in part due to the Aromor acquisition, while Flavors had local currency sales growth of 3%. Our fastest-growing regions on a consolidated basis for the first 9 months in 2014 were Greater Asia, Latin America and EAME, which were strong growth in many emerging market countries around the world which are large markets for IFF. Sales growth, combined with year-to-date gross margin improvement, resulted in the company's adjusted operating profit increase of 9%, at the upper end of the range of our long-term target of 7% to 9%. Our adjusted EPS of $4.01 is up 13% year-over-year, reflecting our expanded gross and operating margins, as well as lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. Overall, we feel we are very well positioned versus our full year forecast as we head into the fourth quarter. I would now like to turn the call over to Nicolas and Matthias so they can provide greater details on Fragrances and flavor results and operating performance. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Thank you, Andreas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Fragrance local currency sales growth this quarter was 5%, including 2 percentage points of growth from Aromor. The overall performance reflect growth in all regions, except North America due to market challenges. The emerging markets continued to be a driver to our growth, up 7% overall. And 51% of our fragrance compound business, which include Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances, were to the emerging markets more than any of our competitors in the industry. Our performance validate the continued work on the part of our teams globally to collaborate and partner with our global, regional and local customers to provide them with innovation and fragrances that will delight their consumers; as well as our investment and expertise in consumer insights. In addition, we continued to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end use product categories, geographies and customers. In that way, new wins in one part of our portfolio can offset challenges in other areas. Our compound business was up 3% in local currency, led by 6% growth in Latin America, 5% growth in Greater Asia and 4% growth in EAME. Turning to our end use categories. Consumer Fragrances increased 4% in local currency this quarter, with widespread growth across all regions led by 7% in EAME and 5% in Latin America. The overall increase was primarily driven by double-digit gains in our Fabric Care category, further solidifying our leadership position in this category. Our strong performance in Fabric Care, in large part, reflects market acceptance of our unique encapsulation technology, which has been a strong driver to our consumer fronts business for many quarters Home Care and Toiletries also experienced growth this quarter. It is also important to note that, on a year-to-date basis, Consumer Fragrances is up 5% in local currency, with growth in all of our end use categories due to our strong consumer insight, partnership with both global and local customers and our pipeline of new products. Moving into Fine Fragrances. Local currency sales declined by 1% this quarter. Strong growth in Latin America and Greater Asia was offset by market weakness in North America, which is facing challenges. On a year-to-date basis, Fine Fragrances is up 3%, which is above market growth in volume. Turning now to our ingredient business. Fragrance Ingredients delivered growth of 16%, including sales from Aromor. Ingredient organic growth was 2%. This performance reflects strong growth of specialty ingredients, including Aromor; as well as key IFF product families, including naturals. On a year-to-date basis, Ingredients are up 20%, including sales growth from Aromor. In summary, we achieved good growth this quarter fueled by the emerging markets and double-digit growth in Fabric Care. From a profitability perspective, productivity improvements and cost-savings initiatives were marginally offset by mix due to a decline in our Fine Fragrances sales. In addition, our operating cost reflects lower level of incentive comps. The net result was positive, as segment profit increased 7% or $5 million year-over-year and segment profit margin expanded 20 basis points to 20.9%. On a year-to-date basis, our segment profit has increased by $38 million or 17%. I'd like to add more color on the state of our business before turning to our forecast. I am pleased to report that we gain entrance into a new core leased in North America, reflecting months of work by our teams. We made progress on our Fragrance Ingredients Rationalization plan that started in the second quarter of 2013. We closed our Augusta, Georgia ingredient manufacturing facility during the quarter, and we are beginning to see the cost savings, which we -- are being used to offset the startup cost associated with our newer plants. We also made progress on our sustainability journey this quarter. IFF was identified as a leader in climate change reporting, and we will now be included in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project. You may recall that, over the summer, we opened the largest solar installation in the flavors and fragrance industry in our facility in Hazlet, New Jersey. This put us at the forefront of using renewable energy in the flavors and fragrance industry. We continue to make progress in our integration with Aromor. We are meeting key milestones, and we are pleased with the collaboration and progress, especially on the innovation front. Turning now to our fourth quarter outlook. We are comparing to a very strong Q4 in 2013, which was driven by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrances and high single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. Against this comparable, we are expecting to have modest organic growth in the fourth quarter. I will now turn the call over to Matthias, our Group President of Flavors. Matthias Haeni : Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Against a challenging global environment that many of our customers have commented on, Flavors had local currency sales growth of 2% this quarter, up sequentially from 1% growth in the second quarter. The overall performance reflects new wins, which continue to be healthy but were offset by higher volume erosion on existing business. The Flavors business delivered local currency sales growth in Latin America, in Greater Asia and in EAME. The performance in these big regions was offset by a sales decline in North America. Thanks to the emerging markets, our growth drivers to the business increased 6%, while sales to the developed markets declined 2%. Looking at each region in greater detail. EAME had favorable local currency sales growth of 3% this quarter, a sequential improvement over Q2. High single-digit growth in Beverage and low single-digit growth in Dairy were only partially offset by declines in sweets and in Savory. Greater Asia also experienced a sequential improvement over Q2. Local currency growth of 3% was led by high single-digit gains in Savory, only partially offset by declines in Beverages and in sweets. Our performance in North America improved sequentially this quarter due to lower volume erosion in Beverage, as we communicated last quarter. We also saw double-digit gains in Dairy this quarter in North America. Latin America continues to be our strongest-performing region, up 12% in local currency sales. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to a very strong level of technology-driven wins in Beverages. Our performance overall reflects our strong collaborations with our customers as well as our focus on health and wellness solutions. Our segment operating profit declined 2% to $79.7 million this quarter. Our segment profit margin was 22.2% compared to its 23.2% in the third quarter of 2013. The decline in segment profit and profit margin was driven primarily by weaker operational performance, including less-favorable absorption and new plant costs. Our operating costs reflect a lower level of incentive comp. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect a positive local currency sales momentum in the fourth quarter, with positive growth in North America. Our expectations for improved growth in Q4 is indicative of the positive trends, especially when comparing to the very strong performance of 7% growth in Q4 of 2013. As you know, over the last few years, we have made significant commitment to step up our investments in the emerging markets in order to provide us with the critical capacity-creation capabilities in sales offices to successfully compete in these faster-growing markets. In keeping with these plans, in 2012, we opened a new facility in Singapore, and last year, in the third quarter, we opened our Guangzhou, China facility. With our new investments in manufacturing capacity in Gebze, Turkey and in Jakarta, Indonesia, we will have substantially completed our investment activity. These investments will support our growth for the foreseeable future and position us well with customers in the regions. Due in part of lower sales growth this quarter, we were not able to fully absorb the additional costs related to the startup and opening of our China facility. Given the expected improvement in Q4 sales, the impact of these incremental costs will be reduced. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin, our CFO. Kevin C. Berryman: Thank you, Matthias. And good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Net sales of $774 million were up 4% on a reported basis and also 4% on a local currency basis, which excludes the effects of foreign currency impacts. Our consolidated sales include the results of Aromor, which added a percentage point to our growth. This quarter, Fragrance comprised 54% of our sales, and Flavors comprised the remaining 46%. Our continued growth in a turbulent, economic and customer environment is again a testament to the strengths and diversity of our portfolio in terms of regions, end use categories and customers. Our diversity and capabilities allows us to realize growth in both challenging and more robust times. The emerging markets grew 6% this quarter and the developed markets declined by 1%, reflecting continued challenges for both Flavors and, Fine Fragrance in North America during the third quarter. Regarding gross margin, productivity and cost savings in the quarter, including the benefits of the closure of our Augusta facility, were offset by the impact of unfavorable mix and operational performance, including lower absorption benefits and new-plant-related costs. The slight decline in gross margin was more than offset by ongoing control of our research, selling and administrative costs and lower incentive compensation costs versus the prior year, reflecting lower top line and operating profit growth versus plan. As a result, our adjusted operating profit increased 7% to $153 million and our adjusted operating profit margin improved 40 basis points to 19.8% this quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of 24.5% was favorable to the prior year's rate of 26.2%. The tax rate reduction reflects higher earnings from lower-tax jurisdictions, favorable provision to return adjustments and lower loss provisions, partially offset by higher repatriation costs and the absence of the research and development tax credit in the U.S. in the current quarter. We fully expect the drivers of our lower tax rate, including the greater mix of earnings from lower-tax jurisdictions, to continue to be a driver to our improved effective tax rate for the full year versus year ago. Our operating profit growth and lower effective tax rate drove the year-over-year improvement of 8% in our earnings per share, bringing our adjusted EPS to $1.32. Turning to our 9 months year-to-date results. Note that the growth in all of our metrics for the first 9 months of 2014 are within or above our long-term growth target ranges. Our net sales of $2.3 billion increased 5% on a reported and local currency bases, including approximately a point of growth for Aromor. Supported by improved gross margin, our adjusted operating profit increased 9% in the first 9 months of 2014, reflecting, in part, lower incentive accruals. This equates to a 90 basis point improvement in our operating profit margin to 20.1%. Finally, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 13% to $4.01 for the first 9 months of 2014, a performance level that is well positioned versus our long-term growth target. Turning to our research, selling and administrative costs. RSA as a percent of sales decreased 60 basis points from 24.8% to 24.2% of sales. The decline as a percent of sales was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by several discrete items and the addition of Aromor. We have instilled discipline in our cost controls so that we can continue to invest in research and development and position ourselves for continued acceleration in the development of our innovation pipeline. R&D investments will remain a focus to spend remaining above 8% of sales. Here you see our customary chart showing the change in the strength of the euro relative to the dollar, as the movement in the euro represents the largest foreign exchange variable relative to the impact on our results. As noted earlier, foreign exchange movements had a negligible impact on our top line growth. As it relates to our adjusted operating profit and EPS results for the third quarter, year-over-year currency impacts were slightly positive. And at the operating profit line, we continue to proactively manage our gross margin profile through our cash flow hedging programs. As a reminder, the U.S. dollar strengthening versus the world's currencies does not materially impact IFF in many emerging market countries, as 2/3 of our sales are tied to harder currencies in the emerging markets, including the U.S. dollar. Relative to the recent weakness in the euro, as you may know, the euro declined nearly 5% during the month of September and reached a low of $1.25 on October 6. Due to our hedging activities, however, where we've hedged to the euro at a rate of $1.32 for the full year 2014, the majority of our exposure remains protected in 2014. And as a result, the results in Q3 were not again materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. And importantly, for 2015, nearly 60% of our euro exposure is now hedged at a rate of $1.34, close to the effective year-to-date average for 2014. This effectively significantly reduces our exposure for 2015. At current rates, we believe the impact to earnings in 2015 to be immaterial. Our operating cash flow in the first 9 months of 2014 was $318 million or 13.6% of sales compared with $257 million or 11.5% of sales in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven by an increase in net income in the first 9 months of 2014, lower amounts of Spanish tax payments this year versus last, lower year-over-year pension contributions, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation payments in 2014 versus 2013. Importantly, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q3 are down 90 basis points to 29.8% of our trailing 12-month sales versus the same metric year ago. Turning to our capital structure and our uses of cash. As you know, capital spending for growth and infrastructure and newer technology continues to be our most important use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and to ensure that our proprietary technologies are available to our customers around the globe. We would expect that our spending will again be in the 4% to 4.5% of sales range for the full year 2014. Regarding our share buyback program, on a year-to-date basis through Q3, we have spent approximately $52.5 million on share buybacks. Clearly, we now expect to spend well above our buyback program spending of $51 million in the prior full year as we will continue to buy back shares during Q4. Finally, as noted, we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. We are targeting those opportunities that would provide us with access to new technology, geography or a business adjacency that would make strong, strategic sense and leverage our expertise in science and technology. We have the financial flexibility to invest in both these external business development activities as well as support our core organic growth programs such as our \"high value at stake\" initiatives and other programs designed to drive growth, all while still providing meaningful returns of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. I will now turn the call back to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Kevin. As you've heard from the team, we've had a solid first 9 months of the year with local currency sales growth of 5% and adjusted operating profit and EPS growth of 9% and 13%, respectively, all very much in line with our long-term targets. Our emphasis on R&D has resulted in a stronger pipeline of innovation. Coming from a pharmaceutical background, I understand how important that is, and I support our continued investment in our key R&D platforms and the programs that support them. Our strong cash flow position provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in growth-enhancing R&D. We have a strong pipeline of innovation that will continue to fuel our growth. We are also studying shifts in the industry in both of our business units to anticipate the future of food and beverage and the future of scent in everyday products so that we can continue to focus our R&D efforts on future-going trends to position IFF well as a strong partner to current and future customers. While our overall performance this quarter puts us on track to deliver our most recent full year estimate of 4% to 6% top line sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, our outlook for top line growth for the fourth quarter is similar to the third quarter. And given the strong 7% growth we had in total in both business units in the fourth quarter of 2013, our outlook is indicative of improving trends, especially in Flavors. The fourth quarter will also benefit from an additional week in our 2014 financial calendar. We continue to leverage our innovation and technology to sustain our long-term growth performance. So our key takeaways from this quarter results are as follows. Our quarter 3 sales growth of 4% was driven by continued momentum in the emerging markets and solid new win performance. The strengths and diversity of our portfolio in terms of our customer mix, regions of operations and end use categories provides us with greater stability and allows us to drive growth in challenging times. We continue to expand our operating profit margins due to our culture of passion, creativity, expertise and innovation, and the solid execution of our 3-pillar strategy. We have leveraged our geographic reach, making emerging markets increasingly more important and valuable. This quarter, our emerging markets contributed 50% of our sales growth. We are on target to continue to see this percentage grow. We have opened new manufacturing facilities in China and Singapore and have added new creative centers and sales offices in India and Dubai. As Matthias mentioned, we will be opening additional flavor plants and creative facilities in Turkey and Indonesia. Our global footprint is bigger and better. We intend to win in the emerging markets. IFF is strong on innovation. Our delivery technologies across both businesses continues to expand, with strong commercial acceptance. Aromor and IFF have helped each other more than originally envisioned. We are commercializing innovative solutions, such as our proprietary FlavorFit brand and our fragrance encapsulation technology. We are also partnering with biotech firms to have accesses to sustainable source of cost-effective ingredients in both Flavors and Fragrances. We have continued to support our technology investment priorities by spending a good portion of our money in a very disciplined manner to secure the future and make certain we remain at the forefront of our industry by fueling a pipeline of growth and innovation and making continued investments in consumer insights. Over the past 5 years, under Doug's leadership, IFF has been building its current position of strengths. We are now poised to take advantage of new opportunities for growth across our divisions and markets around the world. We have heard from many of our customers that they are struggling in the current environment. We are continuing to grow in line with our expectations. Our continued volume growth is a testament to the innovation, creative capabilities and consumer insights. We continue to deliver innovation to our customers in both good times and more challenging times. It is an honor and privilege to be part of this wonderful organization, and I'm looking forward to meeting each of you on the phone or listening via webcast. A final note before I close. I'm very pleased to tell you that IFF will be participating at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York, or CAGNY conference, which is the largest consumer conference in the world. It is held in Boca Raton, Florida during the third week in February. IFF will be presenting on Thursday, February 19, and co-sponsoring a dinner that evening. This will be my first investor conference as CEO, and I'm looking forward to meeting many of you there. We are also conducting our biannual Investor Day on June 2, 2015, to be held at a venue in New York City, and we are already gearing up for that event. You will be hearing more about it in the coming months. We will now open the call up to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's Silke Kueck, for Jeff. A couple of questions. The first is, what gives you the confidence for like positive volume growth in the fourth quarter in Flavors given that you're running up against 7% local currency growth? But even if you could do flat growth, it would be pretty good. Matthias Haeni : This is Matthias speaking. Thank you very much for your question. While we are still early in the quarter, we see definitely a very positive strength for the fourth quarter, and we are confident that we will further build on the momentum which we have built on already in Q3 over Q2. We see a positive momentum in North America. As you may recall, in Q3 we shared with you that we will see some continuous pressure in Q3 in North America, particularly because of Beverages, yet we also see improvements. And we are confident that we will see a continued momentum going forward. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Can you quantify what the effects are of the extra week, like, either by the segments or for the company as a whole? Because normally, at the rate of sales per week, this is probably something like $55 million. And even if it's the very end of the year and you used half of that amount, like -- that's like 3% or 4% of growth right there. Is that the reason why you're more confident about the fourth quarter sales growth? Or maybe you can just give some thoughts around that. Kevin C. Berryman: Sure, Silke. This is Kevin. A couple of comments to make as it relates to the last calendar week in any particular year : The sales that normally occur in that last week are very, very limited. The reason is a variety of things, one of them being the fact that, oftentimes, our customers aren't even open to be able to receive shipments that we would be wanting to make. So the last week of the year, of the calendar week in any year is the smallest week by far as it relates to the particular issue that you're alluding to. Having said all of that, it's somewhat volatile because it's kind of depending upon which customers will need an extra top off in inventory, which don't, and so there is a volatility in the numbers. And so the benefit is certainly probably less than what you're alluding to. I would say, in general, as both Nicolas and Matthias have already outlined, our comparables for year-ago fourth quarters certainly are very, very strong, and so that's going to place some overall headwinds as it relates to how our numbers will look for Q4 this year. Having said all of that, we do fundamentally believe that the improving trends in the business, as certainly outlined by Matthias, combined with any other potential benefits associated with the extra week, which are probably a lot smaller than what you're suggesting, all of that translates into an in-line quarter, let's say, versus what we've been showing over the last couple. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. If I can ask a last question, and I'll get back into queue. Do you have any view yet on what your corporate expenses may look like in the fourth quarter? Do you expect a similar ramp-down of incentive comps of a couple of million dollars? Kevin C. Berryman: Well, perhaps we can take it, a more detailed question, offline, if you'd like to go, but I would say that Q4 is -- probably, if you're talking about the unallocated piece, it's probably somewhat in-line, as we will show lower incentive comps in Q4 versus a year ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I just wanted to ask a question about North America and the relative weakness there, in particular in Fine Fragrances. I know Nicolas mentioned that the category has been weak, but we haven't really been hearing that too much from any of the large beauty players, so I'm wondering if there is a timing issue there or what your sense of -- what your sense is of Christmas. And then just generally, I think Andreas had mentioned that the new win level in North America were lower than historical levels, so if you could just expand on that a little bit, that would be great. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Yes, this is Nicolas. And thank you for the question. You're right. There is definitely a sequential performance that we have to take into consideration. If you look at our Q1, North America in Fine Fragrance grew by 29%, which is definitely far above the market performance. So some customers had ordered early, so I think that we need to take this into consideration because, on a year-to-date basis, Fine Fragrance in North America is still positive, growing by 1% and globally by 3%. In addition, I think it is fair to say that some of our customers are facing challenges in different type of channel distribution. And also, one key component for us, we had some disappointing results on a very important launch that took place in 2013, where we did not see the repeat purchase that we had expected. So if you take the 3 components into consideration, it gives you a better perspective on the performance in Q3 in North America more specifically. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, so do you think Q4 is going to be -- is going to improve relative to year-to-date trends? Nicolas Mirzayantz : In North America, I mean, Christmas -- were you asking some questions about the Christmas performance? As you know, it's too early to anticipate what consumer will be doing. It will be starting soon. So I think that, versus the performance that we had in Q3, it will be an improvement. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then do you think your -- I think, what do you think of your new wins level in Fine Fragrances? Nicolas Mirzayantz : It is strong. I mean now that the pipeline of new product is for next year so we have a strong pipeline for 2015 and even 2016. And so we're strengthening strategic partnership with some of our customers, and the pipeline of new wins of what we have already secured so early in the period is actually quite strong. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just generally, like I said, Andreas had mentioned that new wins have been below historical levels in North America, so can you just talk about which categories that might be in? Nicolas Mirzayantz : I mean, if you look at the performance of Consumer Fragrances, it has been still very, very good in North America, so if you look at the year-to-date performance. So I think that it's -- if you look at North America, for year-to-date, it's a plus 7%, so I think it shows to the strengths of the portfolio. We have in some pockets in different parts some lower volume of wins, so it's not so much the win rate but the size of the business which has been secured. So I think that we need to see the absolute performance and relative performance. And so we're still very confident about the pipeline of new product and the win rate in relationship to the business we're working on. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then, Kevin, if I can just ask about the gross margin. I think it was lower than what we had expected, and it was down year-over-year. So is there -- can you just update us on input costs? I know you'd previously mentioned that you were looking to take some pricing next year. If you can just update us on that, that would be great. Kevin C. Berryman: Yes, probably not a lot of new, news here. Things are trending as we would have been saying over the last couple of quarters, actually. So I think, at the end of the day, we do see pockets of items that are showing inflation pressure, and those are the areas that we're certainly going to be having discussions with customers relative to pricing. The inflation that we're talking about is a very different level of inflation than what we experienced back in 2011 and 2012, so again we're talking more modest levels and well within our ability to work with customers on a fact-based discussion relative to pricing needs to help offset some of those pressures. As it relates to Q3 and Q4, we always said that our improvement or gross margin profile was going to be moderating in terms of the year-over-year improvement, and I think you saw that obviously in Q3. And now it's further challenged in Q3 specifically because of some of the operational items that were alluded to by Matthias. So at the end of the day, we still feel good about our ability to continue to drive gross margin longer term, but there is certainly some things that we're going to need to work on as it relates to pricing to help offset some of those pressure points that would -- will be further developing as we enter into 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So I wanted to follow up on the last question, gross margins, and just sort of think about it bigger picture, longer term. So oil prices down, obviously a positive. The natural piece, I would suspect, doesn't really change that much, but maybe talk about puts and takes of those two, relatively speaking. And then more broadly, what needs to be done longer term to achieve gross margin expansion going forward 2015 and '16 and '17, beyond the measures that you've taken already? And so sort of holistically, how do you think about gross margins from here and step progression? And then price increases that you've previously discussed, I think that was probably more in the natural side. Related to the first part of the question on oil versus naturals is, if you get some relief there, do you have to give back some of that pricing? Or is that going to offset prior input cost pressures that you've talked about historically? Kevin C. Berryman: Let me take that, Mark. This is Kevin. So a couple reactions to your question and specific comments : First thing, you're right. Oil has been falling in terms of price points, where I don't know what the numbers are today but we've gotten close to the $80 figure. So that will ultimately provide some benefits, hopefully, to us longer term as it relates to synthetics that are oil derivatives, but keep in mind that those oil derivatives are second and third derivatives, and they probably have some impact long term. They don't have immediate impact. Many of our items as it relates to oil, for example, freight and what not, are priced through to customers regardless. So if freight costs go up, customers pay for it. If freight costs go down, they get the benefit, so it's not really -- it's a pass-through cost more versus a kind of item that needs to be priced to. So I think that, summing up kind of the dynamic as it relates to oils, the naturals still are the areas where we see the pressure points developing, which tend to be focused in certain areas that will require the pricing that we've talked about. Wrapping that up into a longer-term comment, as we've said historically, and I think Andreas would certainly agree with the comment, what's going to enable our ability to continue to drive healthy gross margin is healthy innovation. And if we effectively are able to do that, that translates into our ability to have the robust gross margin longer term. All of the other things, opening of plants, all of these other things, will put some pressures potentially on a quarter or 2, but at the end of the day, if we can deliver against that innovation, we will see good gross margin levels long term. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Great, and that's helpful, Kevin. And then secondly, so Andreas, welcome, first of all. And I wanted to get your commentary on the M&A outlook. So progressively, the commentary has changed over recent years. The commentary about going into adjacent categories sort of crept through commentary beginning, I guess, last year, more so through the summer. What do you think about that sort of broadly? Obviously, your background is a bit broader than just consumer products, from Kevin and other managers in the business, past and present, so how do you think about what that means? Is that still a focus going forward? And I guess, how do you think about M&A broadly? Andreas Fibig : Yes, Mark, thank you for the question. First of all, I would say we still have a good runway in terms of growth in the F&F business, which I think is important. But if you look at the F&F business, then you have seen with the Aromor acquisition that we have made a move forward in one of our core areas. And that's certainly always a possibility, and we are illustrating [ph] basically every quarter what kind of opportunities we have. But we are not desperate on this front, so it has to be an opportunity which really makes sense for us from the strategic point of view and from the financial point of view as well. I think that's important. And we will be very disciplined in executing on M&A. We will not do it at every price. So that's in the core area. In the adjacent areas, that's something where we certainly look as well because we have seen that there might be some opportunities and growth. And if you look at some of our competitors, then you have seen these kind of moves, but having said all of that, it has to make sense, sense in a broader picture that it matches with our R&D capabilities. I think that's important. And it should match with our customer segmentation and our customer base as well. So these are there 2 prerequisites for us. So in short, certainly, we are looking. We are evaluating our opportunities, but we will be very disciplined in executing on them. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And I just wanted to follow up on what you mean by saying your R&D capabilities. So what do you think IFF does best? What do you think could be areas for improvement? Andreas Fibig : I would say, and as you know, we are executing on our 10 R&D platforms, and I think we are doing very well. I have had the chance in my first 2 months to spend time in our laboratories with our R&D people. And we are looking at -- I think it's really impressive, what I have seen here, even with my different background. And I think we are doing very well. And if we look at some of the innovation which came out of the research that -- like the encapsulation technology, I think that's really a best-in-class technology we have here. So I think we are doing very well. And if I'm saying this in the context of an acquisition, then I take just Aromor as an example because, with the collaboration between our chemists and the Aromor chemists, we are coming up now with really interesting solutions. And that's even above what we have expected. So when we go for an M&A target, then it should fit into our R&D capabilities as well. Does it make sense for you? Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : It does, perfect. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I know you talked a little bit about win rates and momentum in the Fragrance business, but I was curious as to the same question in terms of Flavors and if you're starting to see the impact from commercializing the vanillin innovation. Matthias Haeni : This is Matthias speaking. Thank you for your question. I would like to outline, first we had -- and we always report in the last 2 quarters we have seen significant pressure on our base business, on erosion, and we partly offset it by very strong new wins. And we had wins across the region and also strong wins in North America. These wins will allow us to continue the momentum when we move into Q4. Coming to your question on our technology on natural vanillin, we also outlined that we will not see the commercial performance before Q1 or Q2 next year. We are -- right now, we are working in our labs. We have successfully scaled up in our research labs. And our flavorists, they are working in it and building it into the new recipes for our customers. So coming back to your question, I think we will report back to you when we are meeting again or calling again in Q1 next year. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, great. And then I also wanted to just ask in general a very broad question around the health of emerging markets. I think, last quarter, Kevin, you'd mentioned some destocking in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. So I just wanted to just check in on that issue. Has that kind of run its course? Have any other markets popped up as areas of modest destocking? Kevin C. Berryman: This is Kevin. I think that the emerging markets are holding firm versus kind of what we saw earlier in the year. And as a matter of fact, you saw the 6% growth, which was in line or improving actually versus previous orders. So overarching, we feel good about the continued growth opportunities in the emerging markets. Pluses and minuses here and there, but in general, it is still going to continue to be the growth driver, all else being equal. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Curt Siegmeyer from KeyBanc Capital. Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just wanted to follow up on the Flavors growth in Latin America with regard to the new business wins in Beverage. That's obviously driven some pretty good growth there. Could you guys maybe give us a sense how that double-digit growth compares to the underlying market in that region? And do you feel like you have enough opportunities in that market to continue to outperform, assuming that you are, longer term? Or should we expect that level of growth to sort of moderate here going forward? Matthias Haeni : Curt, this is Matthias speaking. We have seen significant new wins; significant success with new technologies which we have launched, started to launch 5 and 6 quarters ago. We saw very good momentum. And we do see continued good, strong momentum, with new wins coming in. I cannot tell you exactly what the underlying market growth will be. We reckon it's going to be in the area of 4%, 5%. And we are very pleased with the performance which we have. I'm confident we will see a strong momentum going into Q4 this year. And we are excited in the approach of [ph] pipeline which we have. And we are really very pleased that we can make a significant difference with our technology programs in Latin America. Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Great. And then just to follow up, if I could, also in the Flavors segment. You talked about the plant costs for you guys that was in the quarter. Do you have a sense where margins would have been, excluding the absorption issues and the new plant costs? And you mentioned sort of a moderation in fourth quarter. Should we maybe expect this to be behind us by the time first quarter rolls around? Or should the issues continue to persist somewhat? Kevin C. Berryman: Yes, Curt, this is Kevin. Let me take that. I think that, if you think about some of the issues that we saw in Q3, we think there will be a lessening impact as it relates to some of those issues going forward. But certainly, the investments in the new factories and the cost structures that will be coming on board as it relates to those new plants, obviously, that's going to be there. So we still feel good about that long-term historical algorithm relative to gross margin, which again is driven by the innovation comment that we were talking to earlier. That's still a picture that we like and we support and believe will happen long term. There will be some improvements in the short run as it relates to probably some of the items that we saw in Q3 will not repeat and some of the other items that continue -- will continue to be a headwind that we're going to just have to overcome through good productivity and innovation longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : Kevin, you gave us a couple of helpful details, particularly around research and development spending being down a little bit. I'm wondering if your decline in maybe the prospects medium term for developed markets, not for emerging markets but for developed markets, maybe, is that giving you an opportunity to maybe spend a little bit less on R&D over the next couple of years? And was that -- aside from that, are there any other areas of incremental cost savings? And I'm talking just at the margins over the past 6 months that have maybe cropped up because of the underperformance in maybe the prospects for the developed market business in both -- particularly in Flavors but I mean -- really mainly in Flavors but also maybe in Fragrances too, given the weaker consumer environment. Kevin C. Berryman: Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. Kevin here. I guess the first comment about R&D is the commitment to spend on future innovation remains steadfast. And at the end of the day, while R&D may have been year-over-year not a big increase or maybe even flattish or in the range of that number, the bottom line is that it's driven more by some investments we were making last year relative to some of the R&D initiatives that we had which had milestone payments and not a fundamental change in terms of our commitment level. So at the end of the day, our research and development continues to be an area we focus on. It continues to be an area that we believe is going to be a fundamental driver to our success today and in the future. And so at the end of the day, it's an area that we will continue to support. Now to your bigger question relative to costs, look, I think, at the end of the day, we are always evaluating any ways to be more cost effective and productive as it relates to our spend and to the extent that there are those things we continue to be disciplined in terms of the management of our short-term costs, at the same time, ensuring that we're supporting our long-term growth outlook. So a little bit long winded, but what that effectively means is when we do see pressure points in a short-term basis, we are diligent and disciplined in the management of our costs to recognize those pressures but without sacrificing the long-term growth aspiration, which even for the developed markets, we think, is still robust. Jonathan Patrick Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : If I could ask one more detailed question. It seems like a lot of the capital spending and spending in general has been outside the US. You mentioned some repatriation expenses. Could the -- are those typical in your tax rates? Are those typical, or what kind of drove that at the margin? And that's it. Kevin C. Berryman: As you think about the CapEx, yes. The investments, I'm going to call them, outside of the U.S. is certainly in more emerging markets. So it's more than just being outside the U.S. It's really more emerging market focused, associated with our drive to ensure, as Andreas mentioned, that we're going to win in the emerging markets. So it's certainly a core plank of our strategy, a pillar of our strategy. As it relates to servicing buybacks or servicing dividends, to the extent that we want to do that, that continues to have a requirement that the cash that is generated across the world outside of the U.S., is some percentage of it is brought home and combined with any cash for benefits we have here to be able to supply that. And that's really what it's driven by. So to the extent that we continue to have opportunities to bring that cash home, we do. Operator : Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Welcome, Andreas. Kevin, I think this is the seventh time the R&D tax credit has initially been dropped, but it's always been retroactively put back in. Assuming that happens again, what would that do for your fourth quarter? Kevin C. Berryman: I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but it would be certainly a headwind. I would say it's probably at least $0.03 or $0.04. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : It would be a tailwind, wouldn't it? You get -- typically, it would go back in. Kevin C. Berryman: I'm sorry, tailwind. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then how is Aromor itself doing? You talked about how much it's added to there, but if you looked at Aromor by itself, is it up meaningfully year-over-year, or it has much higher margins as part of IFF now that it's being integrated? Kevin C. Berryman: It is very much in line with what our expectations were. And if anything, the benefits, as we're talking about, relative to technology is about the ability to drive incremental value long term, which is actually very much part of why we did the deal and very exciting. Perhaps, Nicolas, you might want to add a comment. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Yes. It's Nicolas. And also, one of the key benefit of Aromor and the reason for the acquisition is the ability to drive higher win rates over time in our Compounds business because we will gain access to very unique materials at very attractive cost structures. So really, the end game is to accelerate our growth in our Compounds business; and also with the collaboration between our R&D and the very strong R&D team at Aromor, to accelerate the pipeline of new molecules. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then lastly, in fabric softener encapsulation, have the new wins been recent enough that this will carry forward for a few more quarters? Or do we start comping more difficult quarters sometime soon? Nicolas Mirzayantz : I think that the momentum, due to our expertise in driving consumer preference with our fragrances but also in combination with our unique technology, is providing us a very good pipeline moving forward. It is solid. And now the -- we did give the outlook. It's how do we leverage the technology across all the categories. So the pipeline is strong, the win rate is strong, and we are not expecting a slowdown in that respect. Kevin C. Berryman: So operator, this is Kevin. Perhaps we can cut it there. We're past our end time. Let me turn it back over to Andreas for any final comments. Andreas Fibig : Yes, thank you, Kevin. And thank you, all, for your time and the questions. And we will have our fourth quarter earnings release at the 12th of February next year. And I hope that we see many of you during the CAGNY conference the 19th of February in Boca Raton. So thank you very much for your participation. Thank you, and have a good day. Operator : This does conclude IFF's Quarter 3 2014 Earnings Conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Feeney - Athlos Research LLC John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Conference Call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at www.iff.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2015. These statements are based on how -- based on what we see today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 2013 10-K filed on February 25, 2014, and our press release that we filed this morning, all of which are available on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued this morning. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig.; our Group President of Flavors, Matthias Haeni; our Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz; and our Interim CFO, Rich O'Leary. With that, I would like now to turn the call over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start by providing some introductory remarks and then pass the call to Matthias and Nicolas, who will provide their perspectives on performance of the individual business units. Then Rich will review our consolidated financial performance in greater detail and finally turn the call back over to me for our 2015 outlook and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions. To begin, I want to share some of my on-boarding experience over the past 5 months. During that time, I focused my attention on getting to know many constituents inside and outside of IFF. As part of this process, I was fortunate to tour 19 IFF sites around the world. While at each location, I took the opportunity to meet with many of our global and strategic customers. It was an invaluable opportunity to learn about our relationship with our customers and, more importantly, understand where we are successful and where we have opportunities to improve. The tour also provided an excellent opportunity to meet with approximately 80% of our employees via 24 local town hall meetings, which engaged with all of these people on a personal level, to get their feedback on our business, strategy and future opportunities. Coming away from these visits, one thing is extremely clear : without the passion and dedication of all of our employees, we would not have achieved as much success as we did over the history of IFF. I deeply value all of their feedback, and I'm glad to have met and spoken with so many of them. Finally, I also had the great fortune in meeting much of the investment community. It was terrific to hear their insights and perspectives on our performance, strategy, capital structure and M&A. So for those of you whom I have spoken with, I thank you for taking the time to share your opinion, as it's helpful to gain insight into what matters most for our shareholders. For those of you who are new to the IFF story, our organization has had a lot of success over the past 5 years. Through our 3-pillar strategy, we are now much stronger strategically, innovatively and financially. We will continue to drive performance through sustainable profitable growth, which in turn will lead to incremental shareholder value. To that end, we have embarked on a strategic refresh, where we are pressure testing our current 3-pillar strategy to ensure we are maximizing our performance. Incorporated into this process is much of the insight I mentioned earlier, but it also includes guidance from an external consulting firm to ensure a deep and broad range of perspectives. This refresh is currently underway and will continue for the next couple of months. We expect to communicate our 2020 vision at our June 2 Investor Day in New York City. Turning now to the full year 2014 results. We are pleased to report that for the fourth time in 5 years, IFF achieved its long-term financial targets. We met or exceeded our sales, operating profit and EPS goals and, at the same time, continued to invest in R&D, manufacturing and commercial resources to strengthen our business. Local currency sales grew 5% on a consolidated basis, driven by new win performance and the acquisition of Aromor. The emerging markets, which grew 3x faster than the developed markets on a local currency basis in 2014, now represents approximately 50% of total sales, which we believe is best in class within our industry. Excluding item impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit increased 11%, led by a 60 basis point improvement in gross margin, disciplined cost control and lower incentive compensation expense. The net impact was positive, as adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 19.5%. From an EPS perspective, we benefited from a lower tax rate and gained incremental leverage via our share repurchase program. As a result, adjusted diluted EPS improved 14% to $5.08 per share, which is a company record. Beyond financial results, 2014 was a year of achievement and progress. For example, we are very proud of our accomplishments in the area of sustainability. In 2014, we were included in the CDP Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and opened the largest solar field in our industry. And just recently, Aromor, our in-house naturals facility, and its partner in Turkey, were awarded the For Life Social Responsibility Certification for IMO. 2014 also saw some key investments into the business. We opened our new creative facility in Jakarta and a new sales office and lab in Chile. And just last week, we opened our new Flavors facility in Chicago, expanding our coverage in the Midwest of the United States. On the R&D front, we have made advancements in our external collaborations and continued work with our Scientific Advisory Board. And with the successful integration of Aromor into our Fragrance business, we are already seeing positive results and expect this positive momentum to continue in the coming year. Finally, 2014 was also a year of celebration. Globally, it was IFF's 121st anniversary, an event celebrated in IFF sites around the world. It was our fifth anniversary of our membership at the New York Stock Exchange. And what a perfect year it was formally to launch our core corporate values of passion, creativity, expertise and empowerment, which was a grassroots campaign directly from our employees themselves. Overall, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in 2014 and look forward to continue the success. With that, I would like now to pass on to Matthias. Matthias Haeni : Thank you, Andreas, and good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that Flavors local currency sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which was our strongest performance in 2014. Our overall growth was driven by 7% increase in the emerging markets, including double-digit performance in India, the South Cone of Latin America, Africa and selected markets in Southeast Asia as well as a 6% improvement in the developed markets. On a category basis, Beverages grew double digit with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was the result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions that are differentiating and satisfy consumer desires for healthier and better-for-you products. Growth in Savory was also solid, improving mid-single digits globally, led by strong new wins. EAME[ph] local currency sales growth was strong, increasing 7%, as our performance continued to improve sequentially versus Q2 and Q3 over 2014. Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverages and mid-single-digit increases in Savory and Sweet, all a result of new win performance. I would like to highlight also that within EAME, the mature markets of Western Europe were up mid-single digits. Greater Asia was solid, posting a 3% local currency sales growth, led by mid-single digit improvement in Savory and in Beverages. Southeast Asia and Japan continued to post solid growth, yet was offset by softness in China, where overall consumer sentiment and weaker economic conditions impacted results. In North America, conditions continued to improve. As we said, even earlier this year growing 7% year-over-year in Q4. This improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in Dairy and in Beverages, which were both a result of strong innovation geared to support our customers' need for healthier, better-for-you products that maintain consumer preference. Latin America continues to be our strongest-performing region, up 13% on a local currency basis, as a result of our successful delivery systems. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is a clear indication of the value innovation has on our business. From our -- from a profitability perspective, segment profit increased 5% and segment margin improved 10 basis points to 20.4%. On a full year basis, local currency sales grew 4%, led by Latin America and EAME. Full year segment profit totaled $331 million versus $323 million in the prior year and our segment profit margin remained constant at 22.7%. In addition to our solid financial results, it has been a great year for Flavors in terms of geographic expansion, as we opened or improved facilities in all 4 regions over the last 12 months. Last week, I joined the North America Flavors team for the opening of a brand-new facility in Chicago, where we now have applications and flavors labs as well as a culinary center. In November, we announced the opening of a new site in Chile in Latin America and a new creative center in Indonesia, Greater Asia. And in EAME, we invested in a new regional dairy center in Hilversum, the Netherlands. These new facilities enhance collaboration and allow us to partner more closely with our customers, building differentiating taste solutions. As we also launched our Always Vanilla campaign, which many of you, you will see at the CAGNY next week, showcasing our expertise with this key ingredient. In addition, our consumer insights team developed new tools such as trend evaluation [ph], powerful programs to help our customers win in the marketplace by identifying key consumer trends at the very early stage. I'm proud of all our 2014 achievements as we build strong for years to come. In 2015, we expect growth to continue to drive -- to be driven by new win performance. Looking at Q1 specifically, while it is still early we are seeing indications of strong growth. I will now turn the call over to Nicolas. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Thank you, Matthias. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Fragrance local currency sales grew 7% this quarter, including 2 percentage points of growth related to Aromor acquired earlier in the year. Our overall performance reflects mid to high single-digit growth across all regions. The developed market for our Fragrance Compound business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrance, was strong, growing 7%. This was led by high single-digit performance in North America where we continue to benefit from being added to a new core list. On a category basis, Consumer Fragrance performance was stronger, growing 8% as Fabric Care, Home Care and Hair Care all grew double digits. North America and Latin America both grew high single digits, followed by mid-single digits in EAME and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 13th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrance growth. Fine Fragrance local currency sales declined by 1% against a very strong 13% growth reported in the year-ago period and 24% growth in Q4 2012. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by weakness in EAME, which compared to a 32% growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as softness in Latin America. Turning now to our Ingredients business. Local currency sales increased 13%, including incremental sales from Aromor. This performance reflects strong growth of specialty ingredients, including Aromor as well as key product families from IFF, including naturals. From a profitability perspective, Fragrance segment profit increased 23% or $14 million to $76 million. This strong improvement in segment profit and segment margin reflects top line growth, lower incentive compensation expenses versus a strong year-ago period and productivity initiatives, including savings from the closure of our Augusta, Georgia Ingredients plant, which all combined to offset rising input costs. The net result was robust. Our segment profit margin expanded 290 basis points to 19.1%. On a full year basis, local currency sales growth was strong, growing 7%, led by a double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in EAME, along with the addition of Aromor earlier this year. Every region and every category in our Fragrance Compound business had positive growth. On a category perspective, Fine Fragrances increased 2% on top of the 8% we reported for the full year of 2013. And consumer fragrance sales grew 5% against an 8% comparison, supported by advancements in our market-leading encapsulation technology. Fragrance Ingredients, which benefited from the addition of Aromor, was up 18% in 2014. Looking at profitability for the full year, segment profit grew 18% and segment profit margin expanded 210 basis points year-over-year. 2014 was a very strong year for Fragrances outside of our financial results. We launched 2 new captives fragrance molecules, received the For Life designation for our Aromor naturals portfolio. We successfully integrated Aromor. We strengthened our leading encapsulation technology. We established a new strategic insight group, and we were acknowledged for climate leadership by the Carbon Disclosure project. From a customer perspective, we successfully gained access to 3 new core lists, secured meaningful wins with key customers leveraging our leading encapsulation technology and created the #1 men's fragrance in the U.S., Invictus by Paco Rabanne, which was previously launched with great success in Europe in 2013. All in, 2014 was a year of accomplishment, and I would like to thank the entire IFF team for their many contributions. In 2015, we expect continued growth, driven by strong new win performance. With respect to Q1, we believe we can deliver modest growth as we are facing our most challenging year-ago comparison. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rich. Richard A. O'Leary: Thank you, Nicolas. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Looking at our Q4 results, net sales in the fourth quarter were up 7% on a local currency basis, led by a high single-digit growth in Latin America, North America and EAME. This quarter also benefited by approximately 2 percentage points associated with an additional week of sales or the 53rd week, which generally occurs every 6 years. The emerging markets grew 6%, while developed markets increased 5%. While local currency sales grew 7%, net sales increased 4%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. Slight decline in gross margins year-over-year, which was driven by higher input costs, was more than offset by ongoing control of our research, selling and administrative expenses and lower incentive compensation costs versus the strong prior year results. As a result, our adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $133 million and our adjusted operating profit margin improved 210 basis points to 17.5% this quarter. Finally, adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.07, as year-over-year gains and adjusted operating profit were partially offset by a slightly higher adjusted tax rate and interest expense. To factor in year-over-year comparisons in looking at our top line growth, I thought it would be helpful to include a 2-year average local currency sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trends. As you can see, in Q4, local currency sales growth accelerated sequentially, growing 7% on a 2-year average basis. If we exclude the impact of the additional week of sales in the fourth quarter, the 2-year average growth rate is 6%, which is in line with the trends we've seen in the first half of 2014. The improvement versus Q3 is primarily attributable to Flavors, which was more in line with historical norms. Quickly putting our full year results into perspective, I want to highlight that our 2014 performance was within our long-term targets and continue the strong trends we've seen over the past 3 and 5 years. RSA as a percent of sales decreased 220 basis points from 28.3% of sales to 26.1% of sales. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense. Our continued focus to control cost and drive process improvements remains a priority, and by doing so, allows us to reinvest in R&D and commercial resources to build competitive advantage for our business long term. In Q4, R&D as a percent of sales remained within our 8% to 9% target range at 8.2% of sales. Now taking a look at currency. Here, you see our usual chart showing the change of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, as the movement in euro represents our largest exposure relative to the impact on overall results. Foreign exchange movements in Q4 had approximately 3% negative impact on our top line performance. While on a full year basis, it was negligible. As a reminder, the U.S. dollar strengthening versus the world's currencies does not necessarily materially impact IFF in many emerging markets, as 2/3 of our sales are tied directly or indirectly to hard currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar. Looking to 2015, approximately 2/3 of our euro exposure from an operating profit perspective is now hedged at $1.32 rate, a little bit below the full year average for 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure for 2015, at current rates of around $1.13, we believe it will have a little more that 3% -- 3 percentage point negative impact on operating profit in 2015 based on an almost 15% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. In addition, at a current rate of $1.13, we would expect to see approximately 5 percentage point negative impact on our 2015 reported sales, as we do not hedge the translation impact on our top line but rather protect our overall operating profit by hedging our raw material purchases. This impact is included in our full year 2015 guidance that Andreas will speak to more about momentarily. Now turning to a cash flow perspective. Our operating cash flows in 2014 was $518 million or 16.8% of sales compared to $408 million or 13.8% of sales in the prior year period. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven primarily by an increase in net income, lower amounts associated with Spanish tax payments and lower year-over-year pension contributions. Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our 5-quarter rolling average figures through the end of the quarter are down 60 basis points to just above 29% of our trailing 12-month sales. From a capital structure standpoint, capital spending focused on growth and infrastructure was a significant use of cash. Over the past 3 years, we have been investing approximately 4.5% of sales on adding capacity and new technology where it's needed to optimize our geographic footprint and deliver winning solution to our customers around the globe. In 2014, we are in line with our target as CapEx as a percent of sales was 4.6%. For 2015, we expect a similar level between 4% and 5%, and then we believe it will revert back to a more normalized level of between 3% and 3.5% going forward. Finally, regarding our share buyback program. In 2014, we have spent approximately $88 million on share buybacks. This, combined with our dividend payments, resulted in total cash return to our shareholders of $221 million or 53% of net income. I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich. As we look ahead to 2015, we believe our business is well positioned for continued performance that generates returns for our shareholders, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and increasing currency pressure. We have a well-balanced geographic profile, a diverse product portfolio and a very strong innovation pipeline that sets us apart from the competition. We believe this breadth and diversity provides our investors with an attractive combination of sustainable growth and strong cash flow generation. As such, our local currency sales are expected to grow in line with our 4% to 6% long-term target, with balanced growth across both businesses. We also expect to see operating profit in 2015 grow in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%, albeit at the low end of the range given the impact of our unhedged portion of our euro exposure. We set up our expected incentive-based comp and expense to 100% target level and modest inflation in our raw material costs. Given that we are at the low end of our operating profit range, we expect to see EPS grow high single digits on a reported basis or double digits on a constant currency basis. In summary, 2014 was a successful year. We achieved our long-term financial targets for the fourth time in 5 years, continued to invest in R&D to drive innovation and differentiation, made great strides in sustainability, benefited from the integration of Aromor and advanced external collaboration, all critical for future success. On a full year 2015 basis, we are confident that we should be able to deliver top line and operating profit growth in line with our long-term targets, despite some headwinds, such as the macroeconomic uncertainty, currency pressure and modest raw material inflation. Before I close, I want to remind everyone that we will be presenting at CAGNY next Thursday, February 19. I hope to see many of you at the presentation, but also at our correspondents' dinner, where we will showcase some of the art and science aspects of our business. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I guess, one housekeeping question first. What was the benefit to EBIT and EPS in the quarter from the extra week, Rich? And then secondly, sort of broadly, I'm trying to understand the sales growth expectations for 2015, given the volume weakness that many of your customers are seeing. What gives you the confidence -- obviously, you had a good fourth quarter on tough comparisons, but what gives you the confidence that, that's going to continue? And then sort of related to that, how are you thinking about pricing as a contributor absolutely and relative to the benefit in 2014 that's embedded in that number? Richard A. O'Leary: Mark, I'll start with the first one and then let Andreas talk to the top line. As we noted earlier, the impact from the top line perspective was about 2% -- 2 percentage points of additional growth. But when translating that into operating profit -- in fact, you need to remember that the fourth quarter is our weakest quarter in terms of overall gross margin profile. And in December -- within the quarter, December is generally weaker within the quarter. This, combined with some RSA expense -- higher RSA expenses in December, I'd say that the overall impact from an operating profit standpoint was marginally positive. Andreas Fibig : Okay. And I'll take it Rich on the sales growth. Mark, I would answer the following as first of all, we have a very good and balanced portfolio across our 2 business units. We have good innovation right now, which we can offer our customers. We have a good balance between the emerging markets and the established markets. And actually, if you look at our customer base, it's not just the big global customers, we have -- almost 50% of our sales was local and regional customers, and here we see growth as well. So all in all, we believe it would be a good perspective, 4% to 6% growth in local currency for 2015. Richard A. O'Leary: And Mark, can we go back to the third question around the pricing impact? Since, what, the middle of 2014, we've been talking about pricing pressure and input cost pressure, particularly in the naturals. Key items such as orange, lemon-lime, vanilla and patchouli are all up significantly. These increases have started to flow through our cost of sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we actually saw that impact our fourth quarter gross margins pretty significantly. We've been continuing to proactively work with our customers and address these pricing pressures. On the other side, from an oil perspective and how that impacts our results going forward, it's important to remember that we're 2 or 3 or 4 steps down the chain from a derivative standpoint off of oil. And so I think overall, based on what we see today, that impact coming in later in 2015, we still expect to see overall input costs up on the order, I'm going to call it, about 1% for 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I was hoping you could give a little bit of color to the Fragrance margin expansion because that was really significant and just whether or not that is -- I guess, sources of it and whether or not that should be sustainable going forward. Richard A. O'Leary: Lauren, a couple of things. It's Rich. I mean, first, good top line growth and leverage throughout the P&L were certainly a key driver of that. As we mentioned in the commentary, that more than offset the impact of higher input costs, which were up significantly or noticeably in the fourth quarter. And then another big driver was incentive compensation expense. Last year, results in both businesses were quite strong. On the Fragrance side this year, I'd say they were closer -- or more closer to normal levels, so we also have a benefit of incentive comp. So top line growth, incentive comp benefit more than offset input costs. Nicolas Mirzayantz : And Lauren, it's Nicolas. Also to add to this, we also continue to see the benefit of the multiyear productivity initiatives that we have put in place, number one. And number two also, we are getting the benefit of the closure of our Augusta facility. So all the restructuring are for manufacturing footprint that we had shared with all of you of our Ingredients business is also paying dividend. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, great. And then also, Nicolas, you mentioned -- I know there were 3 new core lists this year. But then I think the commentary for Q4, you specifically, I think, like talked about one of them. So when do -- is it the right way to think about it that you kind of lapped that benefit? Because it sounds like the access to core lists or the wins that came with it. Or is it more just it's ongoing because of access to more business? Nicolas Mirzayantz : I think it's ongoing. As you start, you're building up your portfolio of initiatives and you are increasing your ability, so you're increasing your market access and you're increasing your growth opportunities. But we are very pleased with the initial start, with the engagement with these -- with new core list. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. I was wondering whether you can talk about the product launches on the Flavors side in Latin America. I noticed that the volume growth was up, I don't know, 16% in local currency this year and I think that's on top of maybe like 11% last year. So what are the new proprietary delivery systems? And is that something specific to the region? Maybe you can give us clarity. Matthias Haeni : Yes, thank you. This is Matthias speaking. Well, as we communicated on our Q2 and Q3 calls, these are higher than normal volume growth and also due to select few customers cycling product launches last year. As you cycle those few products, performance in Q4 significantly improved in North America led by strong new wins, particularly in Flavor, taste solutions for healthier products, which really made a significant difference to the new win performance throughout in North America. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : How about the growth in Latin America? Matthias Haeni : In Latin America, our growth was very strong, in large driven by a new proprietary IFF technology solutions. We mentioned to you in earlier calls that we very successfully launched new delivery systems, but it's not only the delivery system, which gives a more authentic performance of the flavor. We were also very successful with very strong inroads in many new product launches, which are reducing calories, which are processing again better-for-you performance products. Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And I had a follow-up question on share repurchases. My memory is that there was -- there's like a $250 million share repurchase program that was launched and -- that was initiated in early 2012. Is it sort of completed? Is there anything left to continue to repurchase shares in '15? And is it part of your earnings guidance? Richard A. O'Leary: Silke, it's Rich. As you said, the original authorization was $250 million. We have approximately $100 million, maybe a little bit less, remaining on that authorization. So we will expect that -- to continue that into 2015. As we've talked about on prior calls, we have a very structured approach in terms of how those -- how the share repurchases are implemented based on the price of the -- stock price in the marketplace. If the stock price is higher, we'll buy back less. If it's lower, we'll buy back more. But our guidance does reflect the expected share purchases in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I just wanted to follow up on 2 things. One was the new wins in Fragrances. One, I just wanted to clarify, is that mostly in developed markets? And then sort of what's driving those new wins? Is it your encapsulation technology? Or is it -- I just want to think about like what your competitive advantages are versus your other large competitors. And then just on the Flavors side, if you could talk about -- maybe is there a way to think about what percentage of your Flavors portfolio now is geared towards better-for-you or health and wellness products? Nicolas Mirzayantz : Faiza, it's Nicolas. So regarding the new wins, actually, we have a very well-balanced portfolio of new wins in both developed and emerging markets. And we spoke about it last quarter as we were going to 2015, the newly gained access to core lists, which are giving us a benefit also in Europe and North America. As you had correctly identified, our leading encapsulation technology has given an access the new wins and will continue to give us growth with the technology in both '15 and 2016. So the pipe is stronger. We're expanding into new categories and we're supporting very interesting and attractive growth opportunities with our customers. Matthias Haeni : Coming back to your question on the portfolio or the innovation program on what we can capitalize on the many investments we have done for health and wellness. I cannot share with you exactly what is the mix and how much really of new product which we have in the portfolio that are geared for health and wellness. But I can confirm to you that more than half of all the new wins are geared towards health and wellness not only in the developed markets, but also in developing markets. And when I'm referring to health and wellness, I'm referring to reduced sugar content, less sodium, less fats. I'm referring to mouthfeel. I'm referring to many other very innovative taste solutions as the industry moves more and more from flavors into taste. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on guidance for next year, like what's going to drive some of the margin growth? Because this year, it seems like it was -- there was some pricing, there was better commodities and then there was incentive comp rolling over and some of the productivity savings. So is that going to go through next year? Or is it really just better sales leverage? Richard A. O'Leary: No. There's -- I mean, embedded in our model in the guidance is leverage through the P&L. That 4% to 6% growth translates into 7% to 9% operating profit growth, and we talked about some of the pressures at the EPS level that make that the last leg at the lower end of our guidance. The leverage will be a little bit less this year, as we've talked about early, given currency pressures and incentive comp reset. But we build into our expectations leverage at -- throughout the P&L and that we would expect that to continue next year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : A couple of questions. Is there any way, first of all, of giving us a sense how much of the sales here -- in the places where you're really growing, that's across the board in Fragrances and in the emerging markets within Flavors. How much of that is share gain versus your big global competitors versus you coming up with new products in the pipeline, if you will, for customers that we just haven't seen yet maybe? Richard A. O'Leary: This is Rich. I'll start with some general comments and I can turn it over to Nicolas and Matthias to fill in where they feel appropriate. I think overall, as we mentioned earlier, the growth -- in Q4, we saw an improvement in terms of our commercial performance, the win/loss fulfillments compared to particularly the third quarter. So that's a component of the driver. Volume erosion on existing business was again a little bit more favorable in Q4 compared to Q3. So I think it's -- those are some of the drivers. Ultimately, longer term, as we've said in our commentary, our growth going forward is going to be largely driven by commercial performance and our wins in the marketplace. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich. I can outline on this as well. Over the last few years, as you may know, we have made significant investments in our geographical footprint. We invested in many new locations and creative centers to be closer to our customers. We also expanded significantly our account base in many of the markets and not only into the emerging markets, but also in the more developed markets. And including U.S. such with the opening of Chicago. You may understand that we want to have a different proximity to our accounts. We want to engage at a much earlier stage. And as a result of the many investments in our geographical footprint, in the expansion of it, we are engaging with more customers at the earliest stage. I cannot tell you to which extent we will be gaining market share. But I can share with you when we measure our performance, as expressed by Rich, in the commercial performance, so we are eliminating the volume erosion or volume increase. We are very satisfied with the performance in Q4 and overall in 2014. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Jon, it's Nicolas. I think it's a combination of different factors. Number one, we're able to leverage our longstanding presence and leadership in emerging markets; also, the newly gained access to core list, which are really impacting our performance in developed markets. And then it's really the results of the consumer insights, excellence and investment that was done over the last decade. And combined with the technology, especially the leading encapsulation technology, providing superior performance, but also superior consumer acceptance for the brands we engage with. So it was a lot of investment in fundamentals that are now all combined that are actually providing that momentum. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : Okay, great. And, Rich, just I'm relatively new. I've only covered stock for a couple of years. I wasn't around for the last extra week. I'm trying to understand why a business -- most of the food and beverage companies I've covered, they have a 14th week that it's something more like a 7% or 8% effect on sales in a quarter as opposed to 2%. Is there -- what is it about the sale cycle or the linearities of the weeks in the fourth quarter particularly that makes it only a 2% impact? And how did you -- when was the last extra week? Because I couldn't find it looking through. And how did you handle it last time? Richard A. O'Leary: Okay, a couple of things. It happens generally every 6 years, depending upon the cut-offs. But it's generally, I would say, every 6 years. Within our industry as we're more B2B than consumer oriented, the second half of December by itself is quite light as it is. In the case of this week, you think about this week, it ended on January 2. You've got maybe 2.5 days at most of true shipping days available, and our customers are also looking at their supply chains. And that -- those are probably the key drivers on why it's not going to have a comparable impact that you might see in a consumer products company. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research LLC : And I guess, I mean, there's a second half of December that you're lapping as well. Is it -- do people change their order cycles or something like that, I mean, in the quarter? And I just -- you -- do I just have to go back and look? I don't -- do you know off the top of your head when the last extra week was, last time you did a 50... Richard A. O'Leary: Yes. I'll go back and look. But I would say it's 6 years ago. When you think about -- why you probably don't see it is when you translate that into a full year impact, we're talking about plus or minus 50 basis points on a full year basis, so that's probably why we haven't -- that's why it's not going to be highlighted. Operator : Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Andreas, this is maybe an industry question or you can answer it as IFF. But ADM bought Wild recently. And after Investor Day, it sounded like they're targeting several billion dollars more of specialty food ingredient acquisitions higher than the legacy ADM. Do you think the Flavors business is going to have to have ancillary products or bolt-ons to broaden their portfolio? Just a few minutes ago, you mentioned this move from flavors towards taste. And I don't know if you go even broader than that in the food ingredients area. Andreas Fibig : John, thank you for that question. It's certainly a good industry question. And we see that with the acquisition of Wild by ADM that they move, sort of say, into like a new player on the lower end of the flavors market. And we will see how the integration of Wild in ADM will work out and what they do next. So that -- actually, we don't see any impact at the moment on our business. Particularly, if we look at our business, it's more in terms of specialization. It's more based on our innovation and technology. So at the moment, we don't see too much overlap with our business. But nevertheless, we will monitor the situation. We will see how that comes out. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then for Rich, since you hedge, the potential eventual impact of the current foreign exchange rate is pushed out. How far out are you hedged? And at that time, if you go out beyond the hedges, what would be the run rate headwinds of foreign exchange versus 2014? Richard A. O'Leary: Well, as I said, in the early commentary, we're about 2/3 hedged for 2015. We've got -- we start -- we layer in the hedging month-by-month in a very programmed, disciplined approach. We're hedged -- we're partially hedged certainly not to the 2/3 extent that we are in 2015 for 2016. Then the impacts of the hedges roll through. And as we're hedging raw material purchases, the impact in terms of when it affects our P&L, there's a time lag difference between when the contracts are closed out and then we offset the impacts on a P&L perspective. So I think the best I can tell you is what I've talked about earlier in the commentary, which given the current euro exposure rates and assuming $1.13, we think it's about a 3% headwind on the operating profit level versus a 5% headwind on the top line. John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. That was a 2015 comment right? Richard A. O'Leary: '15. Beyond... John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes. And I was kind of looking what kind of run rate number would be further out. Richard A. O'Leary: I think we want to focus our commentary and feedback on '15. That's too far out beyond that. Operator : And you have a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Two questions as follow-up. So one, Rich, just on RSA expenses x R&D, x incentive comp, is there an opportunity for leveraging the remaining piece of that since it's still fairly large as a percentage of sales? And then Andreas, I was sort of intrigued by your -- how much about this health and wellness are driving growth in the quarter or the new business wins. Any idea where the adoption of health and wellness by geography is? It seems like Europe might be a little bit further along in the adoption curve. Any idea where North America is versus Latin America, Asia? If you can separate it between developed and developing markets that would be sort of helpful. Andreas Fibig : Rich? Richard A. O'Leary: Mark, let me just start with your first question. Again, from a leverage standpoint, we expect to have leverage throughout the P&L. And as I think in addition to that, we are constantly looking for ways to drive process efficiency and savings in the organization that allows us to then reinvest in R&D, commercial, business development-related expenses to grow the business. So I would expect to continuously leverage in 2015. Andreas Fibig : Matthias? Matthias Haeni : Coming to your question on the activity level from health and wellness launches or health and wellness programs, I would say that Western Europe and North America is significantly more advanced versus many other geographies. Yet when it comes to sugar, we also see a lot in Latin America. A few countries have introduced the so-called sugar tax introduction. So you're paying additional taxes if you have a high sugar content or a high calorie content in products, and it simply forces a lot of manufacturers to take calories out and the overall advantage also for the consumer is changing dramatically. I don't think that in many parts of Asia health and wellness in form of reduced sugar is much advanced. We see though first signs, particularly in India and some other markets. I think it will take probably a few more years there until we see the same engagement and activity level as we would -- as we right now see in Latin America, in Western Europe or in North America. I hope this answers your question. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : It does. Is there any impact on the Fragrances side as you sort of shift in the same fields? Andreas Fibig : Nicolas? Nicolas Mirzayantz : Mark, a few things, I think, that you see in terms of wellness, a lot of promoting, better hygiene overall. So it's what are the different habits that the brands can be promoting. But we are, obviously, looking at what are the solution, following the flavor trend in that respect that can be supporting the needs for consumers. So within our sustainability initiatives, we're also strengthening our portfolio in R&D to meet future consumer demand. Operator : And your next question comes from Curt Siegmeyer with KeyBanc. Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just a couple of quick ones. You guys had some costs associated with the new plant in the third quarter in the Flavor segment. Is it -- that doesn't seem to have repeated here in the fourth quarter. Is that safe to say that's behind us now? Richard A. O'Leary: Yes. I think the other thing that you start to see in the fourth quarter is some of the productivity savings that Nicolas talked about on the Fragrance side of the business. So I think the impacts of that, as we exit 2014, we're then going to be on an apples-to-apples basis. Curtis Alan Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just one other one on North American flavors market, which you guys sort of touched on some new product introductions that sort of helped in the quarter. What's kind of the health of the underlying market? I know you said that, that seems to have gotten a little less bad. But is it the right way to look at it the underlying market is down and you guys are growing maybe low to mid-single digits all from new product introductions? Or what's kind of the delta there. Matthias Haeni : Well, we are mainly growing, thanks to new product introductions. I cannot tell you that our volume is really increasing a lot. I think the conditions in North American market as such, they are not really that encouraging overall from -- in the food and beverage industry as reported by many of our customers. We are, however, really satisfied with the traction which we have, with the inroads we made, thanks to differentiating flavor technology. Andreas Fibig : So then I would like to close the call here. Thank you very much for your questions, and I hope I see many of you during the CAGNY conference next week in Boca. Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you for joining today's International Flavors & Fragrances conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporation Communication and Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - Vice President-Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2015 conference call. Earlier today, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the second quarter and full year of 2015. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 2, 2015 and our press release that we filed this morning. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued earlier today. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; our Interim CFO, Rich O'Leary; our Group President of Flavors, Matthias Haeni; and our Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz. We will start with prepared remarks from Andreas and Rich, and then the entire team will be available for questions that you may have. With that, I would like now to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Michael. And good morning, good afternoon to everyone. I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. Then Rich will review our consolidated financial results in greater detail, and turn the call back over to me for comments on the balance of the year and some concluding comments before opening the call to your questions. We are pleased with our operational performance in quarter one. On a currency-neutral basis, we delivered mid-single digit sales growth and double-digit increases in both adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business to support our strategic goals by bolstering our Flavors business with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the opening of the new sales and creative facility in Chicago, and the expansion of our creative center in South Africa. Currency neutral sales this quarter grew 6% on a consolidated basis, primarily driven by new win performance across both businesses. Currency neutral sales to the emerging markets, which now represent 51% of total company sales, grew 9%, twice of the rate of sales of the developed markets, which grew 4%. Adjusted operating profit grew 10% on a currency neutral basis to $163 million, and adjusted operating profit margin was 21%. This improvement was driven by strong sales growth, combined with manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate, interest expense and shares outstanding. The net result drove a 13% improvement in adjusted EPS, on a currency neutral basis, to $1.45 per share in the quarter. In Fragrances, currency neutral sales grew 5% in quarter one, as most regions delivered mid to high and single-digit growth. In the emerging markets, our Fragrance Compounds business, which includes Consumer Fragrances and Fine Fragrances, grew 8% while the developed market grew by 4%. On a category basis, Consumer Fragrances continued to be our strongest performer, growing 9%, as Fabric Care and Home Care grew strong double-digits. EAME and Latin America both grew high single-digits, followed by mid single-digits in North America and Greater Asia. It should be noted that this marks the 14th consecutive quarter of Consumer Fragrances growth. Fine Fragrances currency neutral sales declined by 2% against a very strong 10% growth reported in the year-ago period. Our double-digit performance in Greater Asia was more than offset by softness in North America and EAME, both of which compared to a strong double-digit growth in the prior-year period. If you recall, our quarter one performance was our strongest of 2014, as it benefited from a customer pre-building inventory before implementing SAP. In Fragrance Ingredients, currency neutral sales declined 2%, as it compared to their strongest year-over-year comparison. From a profitability perspective, Fragrances segment profit decreased 6% to $82 million, and segment profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 20.5% as the unfavorable net impact of price to input cost and currency pressures more than offset productivity and cost control initiatives. Turning to Flavors. For 41 consecutive quarters, Flavors reported positive currency neutral sales growth, increasing 9% in the first quarter. While overall market performance was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, the developed markets also posted gains, increasing 7% year-over-year. On a category basis, the strong trends we saw last quarter continued, as Beverages grew double-digits with broad-based growth across all regions. This strong performance was a result of our creative team's ability to provide innovative solutions that are satisfying consumer desires for healthier products. It also should be noted that all other regions within our Flavors business achieved solid growth, led by high single-digit increase in Dairy and mid single-digit increase in Sweet and Savory. From a regional perspective, Greater Asia posted 4% currency neutral sales growth, led by a double-digit improvement in Beverages and a high single-digit increase in Savory. Southeast Asia, India and Japan, all reported growth, while China continued to be soft. In EAME, currency neutral sales growth was strong, increasing 9%. Results were driven by strong double-digit growth in Beverage and high single-digit increase in Sweet, all a result of new win performance. In North America, conditions continue to improve relative to the middle of 2014, growing a robust 10% year-over-year in quarter one. This improvement can primarily be attributed to a strong double-digit growth in Dairy, Sweet and Beverage, all of which were a result of strong innovations and our recent investments to drive consumer intimacy in this key market. For the sixth consecutive quarter, Latin America grew double-digit, up 21% on a currency neutral basis. This performance continues to be driven by innovation, in particular our successful proprietary delivery system. From a profitability perspective, Flavors segment profit increased 5% to $93 million in quarter one. Segment profit margin improved 60 basis points to 24.6% from 24% in the prior year quarter, as top line growth, mix benefits, productivity and cost control initiatives more than offset currency pressure. Before turning the call over to Rich, I wanted to provide some commentary on our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors. For those of you who have not heard of Ottens, they were a privately held company headquartered in Philadelphia, with approximately $60 million in annual sales and 170 employees. They are all well known for their diverse flavor technologies, strong talent base and long-term reputation for high-quality customer service. IFF and Ottens Flavors share rich histories, world-class and complementary R&D capabilities, and a strong commitment to innovative quality products, with a keen focus on the customer. The deal will strengthen our operations in North America, improving our market share in this key developed market and increase our ability to meet the needs of our customers, especially the faster-growing strategic accounts. The impact of this transaction is not included in our guidance for 2015. With that, I would like to now introduce Rich. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Andreas. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Net sales in the first quarter were up 6% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in both EAME and Greater Asia. Overall, performance was driven by new wins across both businesses and lower volume erosion on existing business, mainly in our Flavors business. While currency neutral sales were strong, net sales on a reported basis rose 1%, reflecting a strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most global currencies. Adjusted gross profit margin remained constant at 44.7%, as sales growth, cost savings initiative and mix benefits were offset by an unfavorable net impact of price to input costs and foreign exchange headwinds. Our adjusted operating profit grew $4 million, or 2%, to $163 million, and adjusted operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 21%, driven by sales growth and expense leverage that more than offset currency headwinds. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% to $1.45, driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, foreign exchange gains on working capital and other income, a lower adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense, as well as reduced shares outstanding. As I did on our Q4 earnings call, I wanted to show the two-year average currency neutral sales growth chart by quarter to highlight the underlying trend. As you can see, in Q1, currency neutral sales continued to grow at the upper end of our long-term guidance range, increasing 6% on a two-year average basis. Relative to the market, we believe we are outperforming, which is indicative of market share gains. We continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end use product categories with strong growth in Flavors and Consumer Fragrances, and in geographies with growth in three of four regions. Adjusted RSA expenses, as a percent of sales, declined 20 basis points from 24% to 23.8%. The year-over-year decline was driven by cost control initiatives, and a favorable impact from currency, which was partially offset by higher amortization and incentive compensation expense. Maintaining cost discipline and implementing process improvements remain a priority, and by doing so allows us to reinvest into R&D and commercial resources to drive longer term growth. In Q1, R&D as a percentage of sales remained within our 8% to 9% range, at 8.2% of sales. From a currency perspective, Q1 was challenging as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. We have a natural hedge, given our considerable operations in Europe, along with pricing mechanism in most emerging markets. In addition, we proactively hedge our net euro exposure to raw material purchases. However, the recent volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our results. In particular, the weakening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure, had the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound and Japanese yen, weakened versus the U.S. dollar, further pressuring Q1 results. We did experience a modest gain from our transactional euro hedging program. However, the benefits of this program are more back-half-weighted based on the phasing of the program this year. As a result, foreign exchange movements in Q1 had a five percentage point impact on top line compared to a seven percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit and three percentage point impact on adjusted EPS. For the full year 2015, we remain approximately 70% hedged on our euro exposure at a rate close to the full year average of 2014. And while this significantly reduces our exposure in 2015, based on the April rate of $1.08, we believe it will have approximately seven percentage point impact on sales and approximately four percentage points to five percentage points impact on operating profit. This impact is included in our full-year guidance, which Andreas will speak about momentarily. Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $31 million, compared to $35 million in the prior-year period. Improvements in net income and inventory during the quarter, as well as lower incentive compensation payouts, were more than offset by a $50 million incremental pension contribution, which strengthened the funded status of our largest plans. Our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percent of sales, as our five-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q1 was down 70 basis points to approximately 29.1% of our trailing 12-month sales. From a capital structure standpoint, we expect to spend between 4% and 4.5% of sales in 2015 on growth and infrastructure initiatives, specifically our new plants in Turkey and Indonesia. After this year, we expect capital spending to begin to revert back to more normalized levels at 3% to 3.5% of sales for this foreseeable future. Regarding cash returned to shareholders in the first quarter, we've spent about approximately $38 million on dividend payouts and $11 million on share repurchases. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Rich. Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. On a currency neutral basis, we expect all of our key financial metrics, sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to be in line with our long-term targets. Yet, if global currencies remain where they were in April for the balance of the year, we expect adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS to grow low to mid single-digits, including the impact of currency as well initiating investments in R&D and commercial resources based on our new strategy to drive long-term growth, which will be communicated in June. For second quarter of 2015, we expect currency neutral sales trends in Flavors to continue, albeit at a level more in line with our long-term target range. In Fragrances, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business and continue to see good growth in Consumer Fragrances. And while we expect to see improved volume trends in Ingredients over the course of the year, we still expect year-over-year declines in the second quarter. From a profitability perspective, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind in quarter two, which will pressure our reported results. In summary, we have started the year well, as we have achieved all our key financial objectives on a currency neutral basis, while simultaneously investing for the future growth of our business. In addition, with the acquisition of Ottens Flavors, the new site in Chicago and the renovation of South Africa, we continue to reinvest in R&D and commercial initiatives to build competitive advantage longer term. Diversity is not only a strength of IFF, it is a source of our stability. It begins in the way we operate, what we offer and where, and extends to consumers around the world who have made our customers' products part of their everyday lives. This unique profile provides us with the confidence that we should be able to deliver financial results in line with our long-term targets on a currency neutral basis. Before I open it up to questions, I want to take a moment to explain how excited I am about the opportunity to unveil and discuss our refreshed strategy with you on June 2 at our Investor Day here in New York City. It will be a great chance for us to share our 2020 aspirations and speak to the opportunities where we can further differentiate ourselves from the competition and provide innovative solutions for our customers to win in the marketplace. For those interested in attending, I ask that you reach out to Michael to register for the event. My hope is that you will not only have a chance to hear Vision 2020, but also provide you with an opportunity to experience some of our excellent R&D capabilities. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wanted to ask about the FX impact to your expectations for the year. So the last time you had talked publicly about numbers, it was mid-to-late March, and now current FX rates are what they are, which is to say actually slightly improved relative to then. So could you talk a bit about sort of the dynamics at play between then and now to the impact that seems to be more significant than previously expected, and specifically talk to anything underlying that within the actual operating results in the business getting worse that would contribute to that? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rich? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Yeah, Mark, when we talked in March, at that point in time we were probably in a $1.10, $1.12 range \u2013 $1.12 or $1.15 range based on the forecast at that point in time. As we indicated in the call, the current outlook is based on a euro rate, based on the April forecast and the April period in time which is about $1.08. So there is a bit of a strengthening. As you said, since the beginning of May, the euro has recovered a bit. That has not been reflected yet in our outlook, in the guidance that we just gave. The underlying fundamentals have not changed significantly in terms of where we are across the business. There can be some mixed impacts country by country. Also, the phasing of the \u2013 as I mentioned in the call, the phasing of the hedging contracts are more back-end weighted, and so that's why you're going to see more pressure in the first quarter and the second quarter. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And switching to specific geographies, what's causing the weakness in recent quarters in China and what are your thoughts on when and how it can look as we go through this year? Could it improve or what's sort of the impact there? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Mark, I'll give this to Matthias. Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Thank you, Mark. Well, in China, in line with what we hear from our own customers, we are positively optimistic. We see particularly larger accounts being softer in the overall performance. We see, however, also greater opportunities with smaller sized companies. As you know, we have expanded our footprint in China. We are now closer to smaller sized companies as well, and we are positively optimistic for the remainder of the year. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So maybe just broadly on China then, cautiously optimistic, what is the base that you're coming from? I guess, without a comment specifically on a country if you don't want to, it seems to me at least that sales may have declined in recent quarters. Is that a fair assumption? And then as you say cautiously optimistic, does that mean for a slight positive growth? Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Yes, for a slight positive growth, Mark. In China, we did not experience quarter-over-quarter declines, with the exception of what we had in Q1, but it was a very modest decline. We also had some discontinued business, which we have started in Q4 last year as we had some business which cost (22:36) very profitable, but we are not going to report it separately. Overall, again, we remain positive. We have some challenges, and I think we are in line with probably what you will hear from our customers across the categories as well. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Hi, Mark. It's Nicolas. Regarding Fragrances, very solid performance in Q1 for China, and we remain also cautiously optimistic for the remainder of the year, with good performance with global \u2013 regional and global accounts. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay? Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yep. Great. Thank you, guys. Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Lauren. Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First, I just wanted to know, in the Q, I noticed there was a mention of extra selling days in the quarter. So did that have any kind of financial impact on the local currency sales growth reported? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Lauren. It had, I'll call it, a modest impact. The estimate is probably about a point impact in growth on the quarter. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then if I hear correctly that the Ottens Flavors is not included in the outlook right now? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Correct. It's not in the outlook. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So 4% to 6% top line is ex Ottens? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Ex Ottens. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then Latin America on Beverages, I know you had broad-based strength everywhere in Beverages, but that was the one market where you mentioned proprietary delivery systems. So I was just wondering if some of the wins you've had in Latin America, if that's reflected globally yet with those proprietary systems or if that's still isolated to Latin America, and should we think about that materializing this year if it's something that would come further out? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Matthias? Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Thank you, Lauren. Well, in Latin America, it was one of the first regions where we deployed our new technology. That's why also we had a much stronger growth performance versus other regions. We are seeing good traction in other regions as well. In Latin America, it's mainly for Beverages, but the technology as such is also very impactful when it comes to other categories such as gums, for example, where customers constantly are looking for differentiation, but also in Savory. We are very positive that we will see a good traction going forward also in other regions, though I have to say, even the last few quarters, the impact of new wins through this technology is material. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just in that Latin America business in particular, was there any kind of pipeline fill, like that up 21% -- would you expect that moderates from here, that there was just some initial stocking on that (25:48). Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: I think it will moderate, but it's not a pipeline filling; it's just a lot of new wins which we had. Unfortunately, I'm not expecting the very same growth dynamics of 20% for the quarters to come. But frankly, while still early in the quarter, we also expect a very solid momentum in Q2 going forward in Latin America. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just one last thing, if I may, on the guidance. Where I'm a little bit confused on including FX is that at least my recollection is that previous guidance was for 7% to 9% operating profit growth, emphasizing the low end of the range, but that included a 4% headwind from currency. So you said it was only 4% to 5% from currency, so it's one point worse, but I don't know why low single digits would be on the table for EBIT growth unless there's something I'm missing. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Lauren; you're right. I mean it's probably somewhere between a point \u2013 it's probably 1.5 point additional currency headwind based on the current outlook. As Andreas already talked about, reflected the outlook is initiating some of the investments that we've identified to drive long-term growth associated with the strategy. That's now been incorporated into the forecast that was not in the outlook at the beginning of the year as the work had not been identified yet. And I think the other part of it is that we're being, I'm going to say, cautious about some of the pressures that we're seeing in terms of price and input costs, particularly on the Fragrance business, as well as Fragrance Ingredients top line and a little bit of pressure on Fine Fragrances. And so there's a mix impact there also. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Good morning, Silke. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So the Ottens acquisition closed in May. And as the average operating margin is similar to what IFF reports, like it should contribute like a $0.05 to your earnings this year. Is that the way you see it? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : No. Silke, you also have to remember that we have to look at it on our basis and, basically, the purchase accounting related to the price we paid for it. So there's step-up in the assets and then there's amortization related to that. So I think the impact \u2013 we believe that the impact \u2013 we still have to finish that assessment -- but we think the impact from an operating profit standpoint will be a modest impact. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A modest impact. Okay. In terms of the negative price raw material issue, is the issue that the raw material cost curve is sort of flattish and your prices are down? Like I'd be surprised if your raw materials are up. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : As we talked about on the last call, where we're seeing the greatest amount of pressure is on the naturals in both businesses and then there's things like patchouli. But the biggest part of our portfolio are the natural ingredients. And that's where we're seeing upward price pressure, particularly in the Fragrance business, and that's more than offsetting any potential benefit we see down the road from oil-related derivatives. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Are your pricing trends generally flattish? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : There's some pressure on the Ingredients business, on the commodity end of the business. So it was not significant, but was down slightly in the quarter. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess I have two last questions. So do you expect the Fine Fragrance business to be up year-over-year on a neutral currency base for 2015? And secondly, I was wondering whether \u2013 what your share repurchase goals are for the year. Thank you very much. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Nicolas? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Hi, Silke. It's Nicolas. As you remember in Q1 last year, we came out at a very, very strong Q1 performance of 10%, and it was our very strong year-ago performance, especially in Europe of 19% and 29% in North America. So, Q1 faces a tough comparison. Moving forward, we expect momentum to improve in our Fine business. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Michael DeVeau - Vice President-Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations : Silke, I think there was one more question you had. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. And I was wondering whether you \u2013 what your share repurchase goals were for the year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : We repurchased \u2013 as I said, we repurchased about $11 million in the first quarter. Our authorization at this point is based on a share price value matrix. And so for the time being, I would expect that that rate would continue given the current price levels or we expect that to continue certainly into the second quarter. We do our annual capital structure review with the board mid-year. But at this point, I would count on a similar rate than what we saw in the first quarter. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. I'll get back into queue. Operator : And your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about Fragrance margins. So I think there might be two dynamics at play, one is sort of the weaker Fine Fragrance performance, and then some of it might be ingredients. So I was wondering if there is a way to quantify how much was the impact from both of those factors, and then if there's anything else at play? And then how we should view Fragrance margins sort of going forward through the rest of the year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : I think, Faiza to your point, I think the year-over-year performance for Fragrance is there's certainly an impact on the Fine Fragrance side from a mix standpoint. We had very, very strong growth in the year-ago quarter versus negative growth in the current quarter. So that's \u2013 I'd say that's probably the biggest impact of it. Second is, as I mentioned earlier, there is pricing input cost pressures which had a negative impact in the quarter. Those are probably the two biggest drivers of year-over-year margins. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So as Fine Fragrance performance improved through the rest of the year, we should see margins improve also? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think you also have different comparables in the second \u2013 for the balance of the year last year, some of that will spin to offset each other going forward. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then... Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : (33:06) Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the increased investments that you mentioned in R&D. So should we expect the R&D ratio to be above the 9% range for the year or if you could just expand a little bit more on that? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Faiza, this is Andreas speaking. No, we \u2013 you should not expect that because it's early days of our, let's say, implementing some of the steps for our refreshed strategy and it will certainly not go above 9%, that's very clear. But we do a couple of strategic hires for the programs we have selected and that's what we will present second of June to you, but it's not that this is crazy for the rest of the year. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : And part of it also, Faiza, is on the commercial side also. It's both commercial and R&D resources. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just one last question, if you could just talk about currency impact for 2016, I know you told us before how much you were hedged and at what rate for 2016. So, I wonder if there's an update on that. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : At this point, where we are \u2013 our hedge program has obviously extended forward from where we talked about earlier in the year. Right now, we're about 40% hedged for all of 2016 at a rate a little bit above $1.10. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Faiza, it's so volatile at the moment, the whole market that I think it would be a bit early to talk already about 2016. But let's talk about it when we are later in the year and we know a bit more when particularly the euro will develop. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. My one question is you called out some strength in the Beverages business. And it's \u2013 I guess I know there's some new technology at play, but I kind of wanted to parse how much was that and how much was maybe other technology or innovation versus sort of the base business in your global Beverages business within Flavors? Thanks. Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Good morning. This is Matthias speaking. Well, I cannot give you an exact rate, but I can tell you that majority of new wins are the results of health and wellness solutions. We have fantastic proprietary tools, which help taste \u2013 calories-reduced beverages taste better and we constantly make progress. It's not like we have few molecules and we only deploy them and we rely on the success of few of them. Over the last few months and quarters, the teams have made significant progress to come up with additional new solutions. And frankly, we feel really excited. So, first of all, the opportunities which we have; second also on the success rate; and third, on partnering much closer with our customers together. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Got you. Thanks very much. Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: You're welcome. Operator : And your next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : The decline in the North American Ingredients business, is that sales out of the U.S. or sales into the U.S. that declined? I should know that, but it's a simple question. And how much of the decline is, you're using more ingredients internally, or is the decline really all external market? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Hi, John. It's Nicolas. It's purely external sales and here it's very much targeted towards one specific segment of the market. So, we had some visibility into it and what we decided is not to participate in some lower margin business. And as you know, we have been rationalizing both our portfolio and our footprint in Ingredients, especially in North America. You remember that we had closed our manufacturing unit of August last year because we knew that we will be facing some pressure. So, it was a decision for us not to participate in some specific contracts. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : And, John, from a definitional standpoint, it's sales in the U.S. market, not exports from the U.S. market. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And I thought we were largely through that, so we'll have this comp issue now for another three quarters, sort of? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : For the year, you will see some pressure in North America for Ingredients and then that will be a new base for the future. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And you have a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, again. Which quarter will be impacted by the extra selling days this year to offset the first quarter benefit? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Fourth quarter, Mark. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, it's similar expected impact, roughly 1%? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think, yes. I mean, that's the best way to think about it. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then Andreas, not to steal your thunder from the strategic refresh event in a month, but I guess you just need to think about FX being incrementally worse than where you were when you joined the company and then now to use incremental investments as it relates to refresh. Should we be thinking that there will be some offsets to come in terms of efficiency programs and like to basically be able to redeploy some of that? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Mark, good question. We certainly look what can we do to fund the journey internally so that we reallocate some of our resources towards our new programs. And that's what we are doing. Secondly, we certainly look at, let's say, our footprint. And we already have, I would say, a pretty good natural hedge, but we have to look into it whether we can do some of these programs in areas where we have at the moment a euro exposure, like in Europe. And as you well know, we have around about one-third of our employee base in Europe anyway. So that's certainly in the cards to look into it, how we do it in the most efficient and effective way for us. So these are the things we are looking into. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Okay. The last question comes from the line of Curt Siegmeyer with KeyBanc Capital. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, just a couple more on the Fragrance side. You mentioned \u2013 I thought that you do expect a little bit of improvement on the Fine Fragrances piece of the business. Is there anything, I guess, a little bit more tangible or is it just more a function of easier comps as we move through the year? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: I think it was easier comp. I mean, if you look at the growth of 10% last year in Q1, you know very well that the market did not grow 10%. And that growth really was primarily driven by new wins, but also by a customer pre-building inventory before the implementation of SAP, something that reversed itself over the course of 2014. So factoring that comparison and looking at the business over a two-year period, performance in Q1 2015 actually accelerated on a two-year average. As such, we will expect our performance to return to growth going forward. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just maybe one more on the margin for the segment as a whole. Are there any other levers you guys can pull? Or if you don't see any raw material relief, if it kind of stays at these levels, should we anticipate margins down year-over-year over the course of 2015? Or you mentioned productivity in sort of other maybe areas where there might be pricing opportunity, I guess. Is there any other levers you guys can pull there to offset some of the raw material pressure? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Curt, I mean, I think there's \u2013 we're always looking at \u2013 I mean, I think the levers that we can pull are looking at the spend and trying to be focused in terms of where that spend occurs and make sure it's focused on driving the business, whether it's on the R&D innovation side or in the commercial side to drive and accelerate the growth. From a productivity standpoint, we look at opportunities day-to-day in our manufacturing operations, whether it's the capital investments or process improvement, to try to gain some leverage and that's inherent in our model. And so I think those efforts will continue. We may have some pressure near term when you combine currency and in some of these new investments. But long term I think the model still works. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So you think then for the year, is it going to be tough to offset sort of the hole that we're in after the first quarter in terms of keeping that margin flat year-over-year. Would that be too difficult to get back to? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer : Well, we're flat year-over-year as it is in the first quarter. So I think we've always said, look, we're not going to expect to have kind of margin expansion that we had in prior years, that's not possible. I think we're going to be challenged by some of the mix impacts on the Fragrance business, but I think there are some opportunities that we'll look at, but there is some challenges from a timing standpoint. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. Great. Thanks. Operator : This does conclude. I will now turn the call back to the speakers. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay then, let me conclude the call. So we are pretty pleased with our first quarter performance, very robust in terms of 6%, which is certainly outperforming the market, which we expect 3% growth. We have given you our outlook for the rest of the year, so we expect that in currency-neutral terms, we will stick to our guidance. And we certainly have an opportunity, 2nd of June to update you on our, let's say, five-year strategy for 2020. Thank you very much for participating. And I hope I see many of you in New York here on 2nd of June. Thank you and good-bye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's International Flavors & Fragrances' conference call.

We will start with prepared remarks from Andreas and Alison and then the entire team will be available for any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. I also want to take this opportunity to reiterate our Vision 2020 strategy for those of you who were not able to attend our recent Investor Day, and then provide an update on the execution of our four-pillar strategy. Once finished, I will ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit, and take us through our outlook for the balance of the year. Before opening the call to questions, I will come back to finish up with some comments. Our financial results for the second quarter remains solid as we delivered results in line with the guidance we provided at our recent Investor Day. Currency-neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately 1 percentage point relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins, which remains strong as both businesses reported solid growth. Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis grew 7% as we achieved gross margin expansion that when combined with lower research, selling and admin expense led to 40 basis points improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit margin. Currency-neutral adjusted EPS improved by 10% as we gained additional leverage below the line with a lower effective tax rate and a year-over-year decrease in average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. As we are now at the midpoint of 2015, I felt it was appropriate to highlight our first half result. As you can see on the slide, all our key metrics are at or above our currency neutral long-term targets of 4% to 6% sales growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth and 10% EPS growth. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 6%, with 8% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 9% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong sales growth, benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. The net result was positive as our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 11% in the first half of 2015. At our Investor Day in June, we unveiled our Vision 2020 strategy which focuses on building greater differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. Our strategy has four pillars, the first one, win where we compete. Our goal to achieve the number one or two market position in key markets and categories and with specific customers. For example, the North America our home market, we have an opportunity to increase our market share. We also identified that we want to win in Africa and Middle East, a new frontier in the emerging markets, relatively small now but one of the fastest growing areas in the world. There are also categories such as Home Care and Fine Fragrances as well as several customers which I cannot name but are growing well. The second pillar, innovating firsts. We are also looking to strengthen our position and drive differentiation and priority R&D platforms. During our strategy review process, we evaluated our investment in both existing and new platforms. The disciplined approach starts with our ability to determine the market size and based on the consumer need states. Next, we have (5:52) our ability to deliver innovation for each opportunity, taking into account a technical likelihood of success and commercial potential. We then conducted a full evaluation of the technology's degree of fit was in our strategy and made the decision to focus on the highest return opportunities. This includes doubling down and focusing on key initiatives such as delivery systems, modulation, new molecules and naturals across both businesses. The third one, become our customer partner of choice, IFF has always been committed to growing our customer intimacy. In Vision 2020, our goal is to take that one step further, so that we obtain commercial excellence by further providing our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest-quality product. This, in turn, should allow us to become an essential partner and ultimately lead to incremental business opportunities for our customers as well as IFF. The fourth pillar is strengthen and expanding the portfolio. As you have seen over the past couple of months, we have actively pursued value-creating, pursue partnerships, collaboration and acquisition, both within our industry and adjacencies. These opportunities, some of which I will touch on in a moment, will allow us to tap areas of expertise beyond the walls of IFF, leading to more innovation and ultimately, additional growth. The three enablers to the strategy include : talent and organization with investment in our people and R&D continuous improvement with a relentless focus on finding efficiency and screening processes to invest in the business; and sustainability, strengthening sustainable practices and becoming the leader within our industry. While we are still early in days of execution, we are seeing that our identified strategies, imperatives, are the right ones. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are seeing accelerated growth. We continue to leverage our longstanding presence in the emerging markets as they grew 7% on a currency neutral base, led by 22% increase in the Middle East and Africa, and strong growth in India, Brazil and Argentina. We also improved our market share in North America, achieving the number two position in Flavors after successfully closing the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Home Care, another strategic priority for us, has increased high-single digits globally on a currency neutral basis. Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continue to drive growth. The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverages continued in the second quarter, led by our encapsulation technology in fragrances and proprietary delivery system in flavors. In Fragrances, Fabric Care grew mid-teens on a currency neutral basis driven by our encapsulation technology. We are expanding this technology into other categories, such as Toiletries, Home Care, and Personal Wash, which all grew double digits in the second quarter. In Flavors, Latin America continued its double-digit trend for the seventh consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system. We are very pleased with our sales of Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio improved strong double digits, an example that we are providing our customers with innovative solution that win in the marketplace with consumers. Our continued commitment to provide our customers with in-depth consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service, and highest quality product allow us to capture the growth potential of faster-growing regional accounts, most noticeably in Flavors in the second quarter which outpaced the growth of global accounts. We broadened our product offering, expanding it to more rapidly growing cosmetic actives with the recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics offering our customers greater option to support the strategic growth initiatives in skin and hair care. In addition, in Fragrance Ingredients, we launched and marketed Amber Xtreme, an unique and innovative olfactive ingredient that was previously captive for the exclusive use of IFF perfumers and is now available for broad use within the fragrance industry. In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, we successfully completed the Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisitions. We recently signed a partnership with Duke University, focusing on finding effective flavor modulators that are novel to our industry, and we are collaborating with University of Liverpool to enhance our delivery system capabilities and fragrances. Before turning the call over to Alison, I wanted to provide some additional commentary on our recent acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is headquartered in Quebec City, Canada with operations in France and Australia. They develop, manufacture and market innovative ingredients for the cosmetics and personal care industry. Their products are designed to maintain the body's natural reactions, strengthen its defense against environmental aggressions, delay the signs of aging, and address other contemporary cosmetic challenges. Some of the benefits of the active ingredients include; wrinkle reduction, skin firming and protection from free radicals, among others. We target Lucas Meyer as a partner as it is an award-winning company with strong proprietary portfolio and great customer relationships. We believe they have a strong fit with IFF's core competencies and strategic assets, including a similar customer base allowing us to build greater customer intimacy and drive penetration into the skin care and hair care businesses, soon expanding product offering. Innovation is critical to both industries and we expect that we can cross leverage shared expertise and analytical research, sensory signs, and consumer insights. We also can combine IFF's industry leading natural products, LMR with Lucas Meyer Southern Cross Botanical platform. And they have a strong brand recognition, one that stands for the highest level of quality and trust. The acquisition will allow us to enter an attractive and fast-growing market with approximately $44 million in annual sales and EBITDA margins much higher than in the flavors and fragrance industry, we believe Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is sustainable on a standalone basis, and also a great foundation for further consolidation in cosmetic actives. It's truly a great business and we are excited to have it within the IFF portfolio. With that, I would like to turn over to Alison. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Andreas. I would like to start out by saying how happy I am to be here at IFF. It is a great time to be part of a company with the history that IFF has, especially as we embark on Vision 2020, where we are looking toward building greater differentiation, accelerating profitable growth, and increasing shareholder value. I've been fortunate enough to speak briefly with some of you, but for those of you who I have not met, let me quickly go through my background. I joined IFF from Covance, a global drug development company with $2.5 billion in sales and 12,500 employees located in 60 countries where, as the Chief Financial Officer, I was responsible for all financial management, including financial reporting and analytics, capital allocation and strategic planning. During my tenure, there are several areas I'm proud of, but most notably is the fact that we accelerated revenue growth, improved operating performance, streamlined processes and developed talent. These are all areas that I believe are transferrable to IFF, and I'm excited to get started. Prior to my time at Covance, I spent 19 years with AT&T and held leadership roles of increasing responsibility, among them, leading finance for a $30 billion division as Vice President-Forecasting, Performance and Investment Analysis. I look forward to getting to know many of you over the next few months as I get acclimated to the company and support the execution of Vision 2020. To provide a greater level of transparency, I thought I would lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to adjusted currency-neutral results, highlighting the impact of currency and showing results with and without the acquisition of Ottens. Focusing in on the second column, Q2 was a challenging quarter from a currency perspective as the U.S. dollar strengthened against many global currencies. From a sales perspective, the translation impact represented approximately 8 percentage points. On an adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS basis, despite our natural hedge given our considerable operations in Europe in currency hedging program, the volatility in exchange rates negatively impacted our adjusted operating profit by 8 percentage points and adjusted EPS by approximately 11 percentage points. Including the acquisition of Ottens, which you can see in the third column, currency-neutral sales increased 5%; adjusted operating profit, 7%; and adjusted EPS, 10%. This included a lower tax rate due to higher earnings from lower tax jurisdictions, lower loss provisions, and lower repatriation costs in 2015 and the benefit of lower shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. The acquisition, which only included two months' worth of business, added about 1 point to the top line and was a slight benefit to adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS. Excluding the acquisition, our organic business performed well and was in line with the guidance given at our June 2 Investor Day. We managed to achieve good leverage down the P&L, with sales improving 4%; adjusted operating profit up 7%, and adjusted EPS increasing 9%, all on a currency-neutral basis. Before moving forward, I want to take a moment to note that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens acquisition represented about $1.2 million in the quarter. If we added this back to understand the cash component of the business, growth from a profit and EPS perspective would have improved another 1% to 8% and 11%, respectively. As we begin to execute Vision 2020, M&A is expected to play a larger role. Going forward, we will continue to provide analysts and investors with visibility to the amortization of intangibles of acquisitions so you have a better idea of what the actual cash generation is of the business. From an evaluation perspective, we hope it provides an understanding of the returns of any deals we pursue. Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency-neutral sales grew 7%, including approximately 3 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest results in Beverage and Savory. Greater Asia was up 6%, driven by mid-single-digit gains in Savory, Beverage and Dairy. On a country perspective, strong growth was achieved in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This performance more than offset a slight decline in China, where we temporarily stopped production to install new odor abatement equipment. The plants have since reopened and we continue to ramp up production, working with the government to ensure we are in full compliance. As of last week, our backlog of orders returned to normal levels, and we are either servicing all accounts from our plant in China or other facilities around the world. Keeping with the subject of China, we have recently been notified by Chinese authorities of a compliance issue pertaining to the emission of odors in our Fragrance Ingredients plant. We are working to address these issues by making investments in additional odor abatement equipment, similar to what we did in Flavors, but expect to operate at a reduced capacity until the equipment is installed and fully operational sometime in Q4. Our full-year 2015 guidance, which I will touch on in a moment, is inclusive of this matter, both from a top-line and cost perspective, based on returning to normal production later this year. Turning back to Flavors, in our Europe, Africa and Middle East regions, sales increased 6%, led by a double-digit gain in Savory and mid-single-digit growth in Beverage. As Andreas mentioned, the Middle East and Africa reported our highest growth, improving over 20%, driven by strong new win performance. North America improved 5% as a result of additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy. Excluding the transaction, the core North American business was soft, as we previously communicated at our Investor Day, principally due to underlying trends with select customers. Latin America increased 14% as all categories reported positive growth. The double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the seventh consecutive quarter, and Savory and Dairy also grew double digits as a result of strong new win performance. Flavors currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 1% as top-line growth, productivity and cost control initiatives were reduced by a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. Q2 operating profit margin was also impacted by approximately 50 basis points or about 2 percentage points in terms of growth relating to China. Based on what we know today, we would expect a similar impact through the remainder of the year, which is included in our full-year 2015 guidance that I will discuss momentarily. Fragrance currency-neutral sales improved 4%, led by double-digit growth in Europe, Africa and Middle East regions and a mid-single-digit improvement in Latin America driven by Consumer Fragrances. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was up 2% as Europe, Africa and Middle East grew 17% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins and volume growth. This strong growth more than offset softness in Latin America where economic conditions, particularly in Brazil, have an impact on discretionary spending. While the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rates remain high, which ultimately will continue to support our market leadership position. For the 15th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continue to grow, up 6%, led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care, thanks in large part to our strong encapsulation technology and high-single-digit growth in Home Care. In addition, Hair Care increased high-single digits as a result of new win performance. As previously communicated, Fragrance Ingredients was weak, down 3% as we made the strategic decision not to engage in lower-margin businesses, and, more importantly, to supply and further strengthen our Fragrance Compounds business as our internal demand for our own ingredients is up double digits. It should be repeated that this weakness is primarily related to one customer whom, if we exclude, the rest of our portfolio would be up mid-single digits. On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 5%, driven by volume growth, continued cost savings initiatives and continued productivity programs. Segment profit margin on a currency-neutral basis increased 20 basis points to 20.2%. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales as our five-quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q2 was down 120 basis points to approximately 29% of our trailing 12-month sales. Much of our gains came from lower payables as our days payable outstanding increased 15% versus the same period a year ago. The net result of our working capital improvement and net income growth led to an $11 million increase in operating cash flow to $166 million and a 35% improvement, excluding pension contributions. We're also making progress on our share buyback program. Year-to-date through the end of July, we have spent a total of nearly $60 million on buying back roughly 525,000 shares at a price of $112. At our Investor Day, we provided an update on our uses of cash. We said we want it to remain an attractive investment for our shareholders for providing a consistent competitive return of cash. Leveraging our strong cash flow generation and commitment to Vision 2020, we increased our targeted cash return to shareholders to 50% to 60% of adjusted net income. As a follow-up to that, late last week, our board of directors approved a 20% increase in dividend. This increase provides us with a more competitive yield while simultaneously balancing our growth objective. In addition, our board authorized an incremental $250 million share repurchase through the end of 2017 on top of $50 million remaining under the current authorization. At the current market price, this new program plus the remaining authorization will enable the repurchase of more than 2.5 million shares or approximately 3% of the shares currently outstanding. This combination is expected to lead to approximately 65% payout ratio of our estimated adjusted net income in 2015 while still providing financial flexibility for M&A. Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2015. We will now provide guidance inclusive of Ottens and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisition on a preliminary basis. We expect currency-neutral sales to grow approximately 6% including approximately 2 percentage points related to acquisitions. Fragrance Ingredients is expected to remain soft as we have two more quarters where we're managing through pressure from the one customer I noted earlier. In Fine Fragrances, we expect a modest improvement in the back half of the year as economic softness in the large fragrance market of Brazil could have an impact on our results. In addition, we expect to see decelerating trends in our Europe, Africa and Middle East regions versus a strong first half due to order patterns and high erosion rates on last year's wins. The solid trend seen in Q2 for Flavors are expected to continue in the second half, with an improvement in Flavors North America anticipated in Q3. We expect this top-line growth combined with our continued cost control to lead to approximately 9% adjusted operating profit growth and about 10% adjusted EPS growth, assuming a 24.5% to 25% full-year tax rate, all on a currency-neutral basis. This guidance includes approximately $8 million relating to the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions. If we exclude this impact, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS would grow approximately 100 basis points higher. Like many U.S. multinational companies, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will impact our results. In this chart, we are highlighting the expected profit impact of key currencies within our foreign exchange basket by multiplying the year-over-year percentage change through July of 2015 by the portion it represents on our operating profit. As you can see, the weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our largest currency exposure, is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currency, while small in terms of profitability exposure, have all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect a gain from our transactional euro-hedging program, which I identified on the last bar of the chart. As discussed in Q1, the benefits of this program will be more back half weighted based on the phasing of our program. The net result is we expect foreign exchange movements to have approximately 7-percentage point impact on sales and an approximately 5-percentage point impact on adjusted operating profit on a full-year 2015 basis. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full-year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately 7-percentage point drag from currency. Adjusted operating profit is expected to rise about 4%, inclusive of approximately a 5-percentage point headwind of currency. Before turning the call back over to Andreas, I just want to reiterate how pleased I am to be part of IFF. I look forward to making positive contribution in the coming months as we continue to create incremental shareholder value. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing comments. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Alison. I briefly want to reiterate that we have started the first half of the year well as we delivered strong currency neutral operational performance. We increased our cash return to shareholders while simultaneously initiating the executing of Vision 2020. Our strategy is a natural evolution and the logical next step that will provide the fuel we need to accelerate our growth and increase differentiation, which in turn should lead to sustainable profitable growth for the years to come. With that, I would now like to open the call to questions. Operator : And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about North America. So, growth slowed in Flavors, excluding acquisitions, also has remained remaining weak in Fragrances. I know you talked about expecting an improvement in Flavors. So maybe talk a bit about company category dynamics, drivers, expectations over the balance of the year, including that improvement. And did that improvement include the benefit from the acquisition in terms of having a full three months' worth of benefit? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Mark, thank you for the question. I give it to Matthias. Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Good morning, Mark. This is Matthias speaking. Excluding the transaction, the core business was soft, as we previously communicated at Investor Day, principally due to underlying trends with select customers. I also would like to mention here that we have comparables not only relative to last year in Q2, but also in Q1 this year. We were posting a 10% growth in Q1 this year. When it comes to the overall performance by category, we mainly faced some challenges in the category of Savory and we are well confident that in Q3 we are getting back to growth and we will be posting low single-digit growth, and I would be also very confident for the entire balance of the year that we are going to be positive for the year. And this is organically, this is all excluding Ottens. So what we shared with you was like-for-like excluding the acquisition of Ottens. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then on the Fragrances side, maybe talk a bit about that too, please. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Nicolas? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Yes. Good morning, Mark. It's Nicolas here. So first of all, I will divide the dynamic between the two segments. North America, for Consumer Fragrances, we had a very, very strong growth last year of 8.2% for the full year. So we knew we had gained market share. Here, we expect to be still positive for this year. And so we will be growing above market. So I think that we have gained market share. Here, we see that we came also after a very, very strong growth of 15% last year in Q2, so we know that the market is not growing at that speed. So it was really difficult comp for Q2. In Fine Fragrances, we are facing with some of the launch that took place last year that were not as successful as expected. So we had a very, very strong pipeline last year and we didn't have the same reorder leading to these wins from last year. So it's putting pressure on our top line. But obviously, as you know, most of the activity and market share growth in North America is taking place with European brands. And as you can see, we've been able to capture a significant part of the new launches, and we know that all our European-based customers are manufacturing in Europe for the world including North America. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And just following up on that, Nicolas, so the Ingredients piece, weak now for a couple of quarters, you talked about a specific customer. So is it fair to assume that that business doesn't improve until you start cycling the loss of whatever that piece of business is of that customer? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Yes. That is correct. We don't expect growth for the remainder of the year, and so we will be still challenged. I think what was important in what Alison shared with you is that if you exclude that customer, we will be up mid single-digits. So that's very, very good. And also regarding the strategic linkage between Ingredients and Fragrance Compounds, overall volume in our plants of ingredient is up double-digits. So you can see that there is a significant benefit of having the vertical integration, and I think that what is really important is that the continued performance and success that we're having in Consumer Fragrances is largely supported by our Ingredients. So the focus of our Ingredients business is really to support our continued growth in Compounds. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And just switching gears, global expenses has been extremely volatile in the last few quarters. How much of the decline year-to-date has been due to incentive comp? How should we think about that in the back half of the year? And then is it fair to assume that assuming the top line trends get back into sort of the midrange of the 4% to 6% organic next year that that resets and potentially is a higher number on a go-forward basis sort of more in line with what we've seen in recent years? Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'm asking about global expenses. So they have been down a lot year-to-date in terms of that line item. So I'm trying to figure out how much of that has to do with incentive compensation. And then trying to think about how much this year is an exception relative to what should be more of a normalized run rate for that segment going forward? Richard O\u2019Leary - Interim Chief Financial Officer, International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, Mark. It's Rich. Two things, I think. The two biggest \u2013 two big drivers that are in that corporate category. One is the AIP and the incentive comp piece. The second is the cash flow hedging. And so I think there's a couple of things you got to think about. I think the AIP differential, I think the second quarter, that'll continue through the third and fourth quarter relative year-over-year performance. The cash flow hedging impact, as we've talked about, is back-ended, so that'll grow in the second half of the year relative to where it was in the first half of the year. So I think when you look at 2015 as a whole, it is below \u2013 I'll call it below normal, given the incentive comp trends trending below expectations and cash flow hedging being positive compared to prior years where it was negative. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Great. Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you... Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. I was hoping you could bridge the gap for us between reported sales being down 1% and EBIT being up 4%. I'm guessing obviously incentive comp is a piece of it, but even still the implication is some pretty big acceleration on profits and productivity. So if you can give us a little information on that it would be great. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Lauren, it's a combination of incentive comp, as you mentioned. Our raw materials are down. Our productivity savings are up. So those are the main drivers. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I mean, is there anything specific, though, because honestly I would have thought that with the Vision 2020 being laid out that the bias is to invest sooner rather than later. And so the implication for currency-neutral EBIT growth is the high-end of your long-term range. So, I guess, wondering if there's any sort of holding back on some of those investment plans, given how rough currency is. Also, maybe the magnitude of how much the compensation is really driving that swing in expenses? And then also I would have thought there would have been greater expenses given the plant issues, the emissions thing you're putting in, in China, that that would have been incremental expense. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So let me chunk it up a bit. So our forecast for China \u2013 full year forecast plus our second quarter includes everything we know about it at this point in time. So we're closely monitoring what's going on in China. We have plans in place too for the odor abatement as quickly as possible, but everything we know at this point is included in our forecast. The other items impacting the difference is also hedging, which I neglected to mention, so I want to include that in terms of the things that are positively impacting bottom line performance. But then also I want to address in terms of our investment. I mean, we're fully committed and fully moving forward on Vision 2020 investment, and so there's no holding back associated with that. I think it's really just the combination of multiple factors that are helping the bottom line appear much greater. But nevertheless, I think each item has a support in and of itself. I think it's really just in combination you get the outcome. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then I know it is very early, but knowing what you know today about how your hedges work, if currency stayed at today's levels, do you have a sense for what the drag from currency would be next year? Because I know the hedging kind of gives you a lagged effect. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I would say 3% to 4% headwind. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: On EBIT next year? Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : 2016, yes. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Okay. Great. At today's spot. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. I was wondering whether I could touch one more time on the issues in North American Flavors. And that is if you strip out the acquisition benefit, the North American Flavors business was down, put us back maybe 4%. And I know you grew very strongly in the first quarter. But even if you averaged it out, it means that maybe you grew 3% on a local currency basis excluding acquisitions and last year you were down 4%. And your comparisons in the fourth quarter are becoming difficult again because there was volume growth of 7%. And obviously, there are some implications to the \u2013 to EBIT level as well because your sales \u2013 your overall flavor sales this quarter dropped $3 million, but your EBIT was down 7%. And so, I was wondering whether you can sort of like \u2013 shed some thought on that as like what the issues are in the North American Flavors business and why you're confident that \u2013 outside of cost control, things should be better in the back half of the year. Secondly, I was wondering like how much of your share repurchase program you made complete in 2015 and in 2016. Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Okay. This is Matthias speaking. Let me answer the first question. H1, year-to-date, our number for North America will be up. They are growing at low-single digits. We had challenges in the second quarter, indeed and particularly as outlined before in the category of Savory. We also recognized that the larger accounts, the very large international accounts where we have a very high index in North America they are not growing as fast as the smaller, more agile companies which are probably more the mid-tier manufacturers in the food and beverage industry. It's exactly the reason that part of the strategic rationale why IFF has a very strong interest and we feel very pleased and privileged to have Ottens being part of our portfolio. It will give us a vehicle where we can differentiate ourselves, where we can keep the agility, the speed, the responsiveness and the ownership for those accounts to make tailored solutions which have a faster growth rate in North America. So overall, I feel confident that we will be posting full-year growth, excluding Ottens like-for-like sales. And I believe together with Ottens, we will further accelerate in the quarters to come. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Share repurchase? Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Sure. In terms of share repurchase, for the remainder of 2015, we would expect to spend about $40 million to $50 million and then $100 million each year thereafter. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to talk about Latin America. I know you mentioned that this was the seventh quarter of double-digit growth in Flavors, in particular. And I know you talked about the delivery systems. So I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. I know the categories you mentioned were Beverages in particular, but it would be helpful to learn more about who these customers are. Are you gaining share or is market growth just as strong, just anything else that you can add to that? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you for the question. I firmly believe we are gaining share in Latin America. It's not a coincidence that we are posting the seventh consecutive double-digit growth. We are really travelling well. Our approach of pipeline is very strong. And when I was referring to our unique delivery system technology, I'm referring here to a product which increases authenticity, naturalness of the taste and it's mainly used, not only, but mainly used in beverages. In addition, we have a lot of great inroads we made in other categories such as Savory, thanks again to our technologies in Savory Modulation. And frankly, I feel very good about our performance even going forward and it makes us feel good that we are investing in Vision 2020 in exactly those areas which are truly differentiating ourselves in competition. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And other customers \u2013 is it a mix of multi-national and local customers or is there more contribution from one of those? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have very strong growth across the account base irrespective whether these are the strategic accounts or the larger accounts or even smaller accounts which are more local in Latin America. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, Alison, just a clarification from you and also the local currency operating profit growth you said was going to be 9% including acquisitions. And then, I think you said it was 8% excluding acquisitions, is that right? Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : For the outlook or \u2013 I mean, for the... Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. For the year \u2013 for 2015. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So currency neutral is 9% growth and adjusted operating profit... Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations : Ex the acquisition... Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Ex the acquisition is 8%. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, John. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Are cosmetic actives sold in a briefing process? And for cosmetic active that's fragrance as well or a cosmetic product that is actives and is fragrance, would a customer brief the actives and fragrances together as a package? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. John, I'll give it to Nicolas. Nicolas? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Yes. Good morning, John. You have a briefing process, but the active ingredient is very much innovation-led. So, you really create the opportunity through a consumer insight and really a development of very specific solution leading to the trend in the market. So, you create the growth opportunity instead of really waiting for a brief. So, it's slightly different than ours. And if you look at the dynamic, because the customer base is very, very similar, we believe that through encapsulation technologies, through our consumer insight, we will be able to actually increase the market access of the Lucas Meyer portfolio and provide additional solution for the future. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : So, just as a follow-up, if you brought a new active for cosmetic product to a customer, will they still brief the Fragrance part of it? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: It can be. Usually, it's in separate activities. But today, the fact that we can provide a joint solution might create some new opportunities. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And if you could just remind me, the year-over-year increase in the performance comp in Flavors that was primarily because of the year-ago being below plan? It was not really related to a change in the accrual rate for the current year? Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, that's correct. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Correct. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.: Wondered if you could update us on the cross listing, please. What was the rationale, and are you taking any actions to improve liquidity there? Thank you. Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations : Hi, Heidi. It's Mike. Yes, we absolutely are. As we discussed, we begin trading on, I think early June with our cross-listing in Euronext. I think now we're in the process of working with several banks in Europe based in Paris to see if we can improve our liquidity. We would expect through the balance of this summer to probably have some news in September, probably middle to end of September. Heidi M. Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Sison, KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter, guys. I wanted to just to ask about in Flavors, currency neutral, operating income growth was up 1% despite currency-neutral sales up 7%, so can you talk about some of the headwinds that sort of took away from the operating leverage? Clearly, you tend to have better operating leverage, so I think you flushed out some, but I don't know if you could share any specifics. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : This is Alison. So there was an impact \u2013 I'd say the biggest impact in terms of offsetting that profitability going to the bottom line was increased incentive compensation. Beyond that, we had the intangible impacts of $1.2 million, was also mentioned. And that was somewhat offset by productivity and cost control initiatives, but that was the biggest \u2013 those were the two biggest impacts. And then we also mentioned China, which is also included as a negative impact from the bottom line. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. And would you think that the currency-neutral growth would be better in the second half for Flavors? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Mike, we expect to have continued additional cost in China also in Q3 and for H2 in general, i.e., it is all factored into our forecast though. They will not be higher than what we had for the quarter in Q2. In terms of productivity, it is very high on our agenda. It obviously stands or falls a lot on how much we can possibly further accelerate our top line. While we are still early in the quarter, I feel good that we will deliver a solid top-line growth that can offset some of the pressures Alison has alluded to before. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mike, just another comment. So for the second half of the year too, AIP will continue to be a headwind from a profit perspective. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then, just a quick one on encapsulation. That business sounds like it's really gaining some momentum here. Where do you think you're at in terms of penetration in sort of these other markets like toiletries and personal wash? And is that an area that's going to continue to grow double digits for the next, whatever, quarters or several years? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Nicolas? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Yes. Good morning, Mike. As you know, encapsulation has been really one of the key drivers of the continued growth and success in Consumer Fragrances. So I will say the majority of the revenues from encapsulation at this stage are really in Fabric Care. But it's really one of the key pillars of the driver and a driver of our Vision 2020. That's where we are really investing significantly right now in resources and in capacity, and with the goal, obviously, to enlarge the offering to other category. So we have early success in other categories, we're pleased. That's why it's growing fast be it on a small base. So, for the foreseeable future, really the growth will be coming from Fabric augmented progressively with the other categories. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : You have a follow-up question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up. Two questions. One, Alison, if you could give us an update on interest expense over the balance of the year, inclusive of the two acquisitions. And then just broadly, wondering if you could comment on category growth dynamics. Overall, you plus your competitors seem to have slowed a little bit second quarter relative to 1Q and relative to growth in 2014. So, I guess, just curious what you're seeing from a customer standpoint just sort of broadly, and then an expectation on a go-forward basis relative to where you were maybe a quarter or so ago? I know you have slightly revised the sales guidance towards the low end. So obviously, within that, what you're sort of seeing today relative to what you were seeing maybe three or six months ago and how you sort of think about that normalizing over time? Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Mark, on a total company question for your part two, on guidance? Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So, first, let me answer the interest-related question. There will be a $2 million increase, which was included in our guidance. So that's reflective. In terms of overall outlook, at our Investor Day, we've guided toward a currency-neutral range of 4% to 6%, so we expect this year's performance to be in line with our long-term guidance of 4% to 6%. We still believe that's the case, albeit at the low end of the range due to pressure from ingredients, which Nicolas had spoken about, as well as some uncertainty in Fine Fragrances. Operator : Your next question comes from Alec Patterson with AGI. Alec Patterson - Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of quick ones. The Latin America mid-teens growth in Fragrances and Flavors, is it all volume or volume mix? I know you tend to price in dollars, but I just wanted to get clarification. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Matthias? Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Thank you for the question. In Latin America, as I outlined before, we are really travelling very well and very strong. We have a lot of new win. We have also good volume growth, but a lot is driven really by new wins, even new customers. We are moving into new geographies also in Latin America. You may recall that we have opened a new affiliate in Chile, for example. This gives us leverage and we feel very good with the traction which we gain. Thanks to technology, increased customer intimacy and additional accounts. Alec Patterson - Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC: And just curious, China has been an issue especially for wholesale inventory management for a lot of your customer base. What are you seeing there? And then lastly a question, just could you round out or update us on some of the gross margin drivers, the raw material trends, that sort of thing? Matthias Haeni - Group President-Flavors: Talking about China, frankly we see the same, we see challenges as well and we see mainly very large international accounts being challenged. We see volumes decreasing. We see retail destocking and we are (55:22) mainly have a similar symptom as we have in North America that smaller accounts seem to be more agile and probably have a softer, innovative resolutions which are more tailored for the market in China. As we're aware of it, we try to expand. We work with the commercial teams in China to increase our customer portfolio and to ensure that we are again more relevant in the marketplace. I however would like to remind, as we see challenges in China, we have comparables of what we are comparing to last year irrespective whether it's Q2 or even H1 we are comparing to very solid single-digit growth. So, we mainly had slown down the last three quarters in China. Alison A. Cornell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And in terms of the \u2013 your second part of your question, in terms of raw materials, we expect to see a relatively stable raw material environment for the remainder of 2015. Michael DeVeau - VP, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations : Anymore questions, operator? Operator : You do have a question from the line of Jeff Zekauskas. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Jeff? Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It's Silke Kueck one more time for Jeff. I was wondering whether you can just share your thoughts on sort of like the competitive environment and that is the \u2013 there is obviously now, like, a new entrant in the industry with ADM acquiring Wild Flavors. Like, it seems there's a little bit of like a roll-up on the \u2013 in the food industry, like, Heinz acquiring Kraft, and like, Tyson is acquiring Hillshire Brands. In the fragrance industry, P&G is divesting its beauty care business, and that's going now to Coty. So, I was wondering whether you can discuss a little bit on what the competitive trends are like. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you for the question. I think what we experience these days is what will probably start using a long time ago, we see consolidation on the account base. I think consolidation is such on the accounts is also a great opportunity for us. It's really an opportunity to ensure that we are truly partnering at a very early stage. And I outlined once at the Investor's Day, as soon as we are partnering at the very early stage with our customers, our win rates and the chance that we are really submitting a value creation and value addition to them is much higher. Nowadays, our customers, they are not looking for vendors and suppliers anymore. They are really looking for two partners, and I really see this as a great opportunity. When it comes to North America, what we outlined with Ottens, we all said that we want to create a vehicle for us to truly differentiate ourselves to keep the agility, the speeds, the ownership. But above all, the very longstanding history Ottens has built here in North America and to back it together with latest technology from IFF. We are firm of the belief that this will help us to accelerate our growth rate to penetrate into a segment that is growing faster of what we believe in the very large account here in North America and see it as a great opportunity. Maybe, Nicolas, do you want to add something, provide some color to Fragrance? Nicolas Mirzayantz - Group President-Fragrances: Yes. Silke, it's Nicolas. A very similar trend in terms of the customer dynamic moving to strategic partnership. So every consolidation provide additional upside opportunities. And here, it is obviously \u2013 or you need to support and provide consumer insight, and to identify growth opportunities for the portfolios and reaching significant scale. So, we believe it is a positive outlook for us. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. Operator : We'd now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much for the question. As we said, we had a good first half year. We're in the middle of the execution of our Vision 2020 which works very well. We basically finished the two acquisitions for this year as well which will help us to differentiate and accelerate our growth going to the future. So, thank you very much for the questions again, and let me end the call right now. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2015 conference call. Yesterday we distributed press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2015. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 2, 2015 and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes those items that we believe affects comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Alison Cornell; our Group President of Flavors, Matthias Haeni; and our Group President of Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz. We will start with prepared remarks from Andreas and Alison and then the entire team will be available for any questions that you may have. Before turning the call over to Andreas, I would like to let you know that we continue to explore options to improve our liquidity on Euronext Paris. We remain optimistic that we can enhance our liquidity on Euronext to allow more European investors access to our shares. We will continue to keep you updated on our progress as we move forward. With that, I would now like to now introduce our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. I would like to start by providing an executive overview of our operational performance this quarter. In addition, similar how we structured the quarter two conference call, I want to provide an update on the execution of our four-pillar Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I'll ask Alison to review our financial results in greater detail, including the specifics on each business unit; as well as our cash flow statement and our outlook for the balance of the year. I'm pleased to report that our financial results for the third quarter accelerated versus our second quarter performance. Both in terms of currency-neutral sales and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth, as we continue to benefit from diversity of our business as well as our recent acquisitions. Currency-neutral sales in the third quarter improved 7%, including approximately 3 percentage point relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Organic top-line performance, which increased 4% this quarter, continued to be driven by new wins, particularly in Fragrance Compounds by the contribution of new wins were the highest level in nearly two years. This was favorable to profitability as adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS both grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis. On a year-to-date base, results remain strong, as currency-neutral sales growing 6% comprised of 8% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. For the first nine months in 2015, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 9% on currency-neutral basis, driven by sales growth, the benefit of productivity programs and manufacturing and RSA cost leverage. Complementing our expansion in gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin, lower interest expense, a more favorable effective tax rate and the reduction of our shares outstanding led to an 11% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS. From a strategic perspective, I would like to talk about a couple of areas. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position defined by number one or two market share position, we believe we are taking the right steps to deliver on our ambition of accelerated growth. North America, the Flavors team has done a nice job integrating our recent acquisition of Ottens Flavors, leveraging their defined go-to-market strategy, which focuses on winning with key regional accounts in the U.S. Our Flavors North America business was up 19%. In Flavors Latin America, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well, as evident with its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The third quarter growth was very strong, up 20% on a currency-neutral basis. Within Fragrance, North America Fragrance Compounds grew 7%, with 8% growth in Consumer Fragrances and a 4% growth in Fine Fragrance. The quarter three sub category performance that we're most notable in North America were Hair Care and Home Care both of which grew double digits, plus Fabric Care which grew high-single digits. The third quarter, China Fragrances, another area where we have ambitions to accelerate growth grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis, as we continue to have success with many of the strong regional Consumer Fragrance brands. From a category perspective, Home Care, another area of focus for us, improved high single-digits globally, on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in North America and Latin America. Delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrance continues to drive growth. The strong trends in Fabric Care and Beverage continued in the third quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in Fragrances and proprietary delivery systems in Flavors. Fabric Care grew double-digits on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter, with all geographic markets posting strong growth. This is a direct result of our differentiated encapsulation technology. Given our success in Fabric Care, we have begun to expand into other categories as well. In the third quarter, while still early in terms of strategic execution, we have seen strong results in encapsulation-related sales in Toiletries and Home Care, both which grew double digits. Supporting the expansion of this technology into more categories, our R&D team developed the next generation capsule technology that allows us to further penetrate personal care applications. This technology should allow us to efficiently customize solutions to deliver Fragrance at the points desired by consumers. In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge, when creating the next-generation fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently launched two new highly-anticipated ingredients to our perfumers, cosmo fruit (07:48), which is a high impact complex fruity note with spicy undertones and crystal fizz, which is a watery, fresh, aldehydic note to be used internally by our perfumers as exclusive IFF molecules, which we are not selling externally. And as we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to commercialize two additional molecules, which would bring our commercialized molecules to four this year. If successful, this would effectively put us on track to double our annual Fragrance molecule output average over the past decade, providing us with greater confidence in our accelerated growth ambition. As I mentioned, moments ago in Flavors, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well. This technology expanding beyond just Latin America with proprietary delivery system-related sales growing strong double-digits globally. Sales of our Sweetness and Savory Modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, increasing strong double-digits. The categories where we had the most success were Savory, Dairy and Beverage, as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of the consumers who are looking for better-for-you products, including reduced sugar and salt. To complement this, I'm pleased to announce that we have also commercialized a new natural taste modulator, the second one this year, which is a sour masker designed to reduce the salt perception without the changing the product's acidity, particularly useful for yogurts and juice applications. This addition will strengthen our modulation capabilities as it provides our flavors, a more competitive palate to build winning solutions. Building on our robust technology pipeline is critical. The third quarter is an example that we're making strong progress against key initiatives that will lead to greater differentiation and ultimately accelerated growth. In addition to the strides we have made from market share and innovation perspective, we also made progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. To meet the growing trends in naturals, in October 2015, IFF-LMR Naturals received its fourth For Life Social Responsibility designation, this time in cooperation with our Vetiver partner in Haiti. The For Life designation recognizes an organization's adherence to specific sustainability criteria, including transparency, environmental responsibility, fair working conditions and positive relations with producers and local communities. This recognition comes after the certification of IFF-LMR Naturals for the rose supply chain in Turkey and its patchouli basil supply chain in Madagascar. When it comes to sustainability, we won't accept the status quo. Recently we became the first Flavors and Fragrance company to join TfS and enter into growing consortium of multinational companies committed to ensuring sustainable practices throughout the supply chain. We also were recognized by the CDP, earning a perfect score of 100 in disclosure and an A in performance for its strategies and actions to mitigate climate change. Sustainability is foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, and we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture for the years to come. We also won the North America innovation award with one of our largest Flavors customers, which recognizes partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Est\u00e9e Lauder also presented us with their Supplier Excellence award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top performing business partners. I'm pleased to also announce that at the 2015 In-Cosmetics Asia Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won the Gold Award for the Innovation Zone Best Active Ingredients with Exo-P, a patented ingredient designed to rapidly improve dull skin for healthy looking complexion in only seven days. And also won the Gold Award of Innovation Zone Best Functional Ingredient with Lecigel, an ingredient scientifically measured using various techniques developed by specialists in psychology and neuroscience, which provides a positive emotion upon application. With a focus on the future and in terms of business participation in the years to come, we also reaffirmed and expanded our core list status with key Flavors customers, two based in North America and one globally; and also our largest Fragrance customer in the third quarter. As you know, core lists are paramount to winning future business within our industry. Being added to a new core list shows that we are able to bring the right R&D capabilities, consumer insights, regulatory requirements and customers' trust needed to create the winning products in the marketplace. During the second quarter and third quarter, we completed two acquisitions, which focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio. I'm pleased to report that both acquisitions are performing very well. Ottens Flavors' organic sales on a standalone basis increased low double-digits, above our North American base business, which improved sequentially. And Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved strong double-digit currency-neutral sales growth on a standalone basis. We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance in terms of growth and return. Following the end of the third quarter, we also announced the partnership with Vapor Communications to pioneer the digital future of scent. Combining certain Vapor software and hardware scent platform with IFF scent technology and expertise, the collaboration is anticipated to bring mobile scent experiences to consumers. And while this is an initial step, we believe the technologies developed by Vapor Communications to play an important role in our larger digital scent journey and Vision 2020. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alison, who will take you through the financials in greater detail. Alison A. Cornell: Thank you, Andreas. Looking at our third quarter results, similar to what I did on our Q2 conference call, I want to continue to lay out a bridge from our adjusted financial results to our adjusted currency-neutral results. In the first column, which is inclusive of currency, sales contracted by 1%, while adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew 5%. Consistent with what we communicated previously, in the third quarter, we benefited from our euro transactional hedging program, which ultimately protected our euro-denominated profits. Including this benefit, our growth rate in terms of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS accelerated to 7% and 5% versus the 1% and 4% we reported in the first half respectively. Yet, even with the benefits of hedging, foreign exchange still proved to be a headwind in the third quarter, as the U.S. dollar remains strong against many global currencies. From a sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS perspective, currency represented an 8 percentage point, 3 percentage point and 5 percentage point impact respectively. On a currency-neutral basis, we continued to deliver strong results, achieving leverage within our P&L with sales improving 7% and adjusted operating profit growing 10%. The increase in adjusted operating profit was driven by gross margin expansion and cost leverage, which led to an approximately 50 basis point improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit margin. Currency-neutral adjusted EPS also improved by 10%, as the year-over-year decrease in our average shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchase program offset a slightly higher effective tax rate and an increase in interest expense relating to both of our acquisitions. The acquisitions we made earlier this year are adding to our performance, evidence that we are investing in strategic value add opportunities that deliver high returns. In the third quarter, the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer added approximately 3 points to currency-neutral sales growth, about 2 points to currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, and 3 points to currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth. It should be noted that the amortization of intangibles relating to the Ottens and Lucas Meyer acquisitions represented about $3.5 million in the quarter. If we add this back to understand the cash component of the business, adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS growth would have improved another two percentage points to 12% respectively on a currency-neutral basis. Pausing here, I would like to provide you with some insight into the trends we saw throughout the quarter. In September, while at a sell-side investor conference, I made some cautionary comments relating to our organic business. Following the Chinese currency devaluation, we saw several customers take a more cautious approach to managing their inventory, which ultimately meant sequential softness as we progress through the quarter. This perpetuated, particularly in emerging markets, which while still positive, up 3% in Q3, was slower than our first half performance of 8%, despite relatively strong performance in Latin America. And while we remain fully committed to the long-term growth of these key markets, in the short-term, we're working to manage the uncertainty and focusing on the levers we can pull to deliver results and strengthen our business. Fortunately, we experienced strong orders the last week of the quarter, leading to the 4% organic growth rate we reported in Q3, ahead of where we thought we would finish the quarter. Turning to business unit performance; Flavors posted its 43rd consecutive quarter of growth, increasing 8%, including approximately 4.5 percentage points relating to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth, with the strongest results in Beverage and Dairy. In our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, sales increased 4%, led by high-single digit growth in Beverage. Western Europe reported the highest growth, improving 9%, driven by strong new win performance. North America grew 19%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and high double-digit growth in Dairy. If we exclude the benefit of Ottens, organic performance improved sequentially versus Q2, up low-single digits. Latin America increased 20%, as all categories reported positive growth. The strong double-digit trend in Beverage continued for the eighth consecutive quarter, led by our proprietary delivery system. Savory and Dairy also grew double-digits, as a result of strong new win performance, which leverages our proprietary delivery system, as well as our modulation portfolio. Greater Asia remained constant, as growth in Indonesia, India, Singapore and Japan was offset by softness in China, which was primarily driven by a challenging economic environment. Flavors' currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 9%, as gross margin expansion and cost and productivity benefit more than offset the inclusion of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Ottens Flavors. This led to a 10 basis point improvement in operating profit margin, despite incremental cost in Q3 relating to the China order issue. If we exclude this impact, our operating margin would have expanded by 80 basis points in the third quarter, or growth would have been 12%. It should be noted, however, that we expect a portion of this expense to continue as we work through this issue. Specifically in Q4, we would expect the similar impact in terms of expense as we experienced in Q3. Fragrances' currency-neutral sales improved 6%, including approximately 2 percentage points associated with the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, with all regions posting growth, led by high single-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single digit improvement in Greater Asia. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance was up 1%, led by Europe, Africa and the Middle-East, which improved 5%, as a result of very strong pipeline of new wins, including Olympea by Pouge (21:23) from Paco Rabanne; Bosta Scent (21:25) by Procter and Gamble; La Vie Belle Intense by Lanc\u00f4me from L'Or\u00e9al; and Jimmy Choo Illicit by Interparfums. In Latin America, economic conditions, particularly in Brazil continue to have an impact on discretionary spending and ultimately our Fine Fragrance performance. Yet, while sales were down, they improved versus the second quarter. And even as the economy is soft, we continue to see our win rate remain high, which we believe will support our market leadership position as the economy stabilizes. I also want to put our Fine Fragrance results in Greater Asia into perspective relative to our global Fragrance business. Proportionately, Greater Asia Fine Fragrances represented approximately 2% of our global Fine Fragrance sales, which means quarterly order patterns can have a substantial impact on growth rates as it did in Q1, when Fine Fragrance in Greater Asia was up almost 40%. And as the market is relatively small in terms of per capita usage now, we believe it will increase over time as we stated in our Vision 2020 strategy. For the 16th consecutive quarter, Consumer Fragrances continued to grow, up 7% with mid-to-high single-digits in every region in broad-based category growth led by double-digit growth in Fabric Care and high-single-digit growth in Hair Care. In Fabric, thanks in large part to our local knowledge as a consumer and our encapsulated technology, growth was the strongest in Greater Asia, where we are wining with local customers. And in Hair Care, growth was the best in Latin America, as we have the ability to offer exceptional fragrances in non-traditional categories that meet the consumers' desire for lower-cost alternatives. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 6%, driven by the acquisition of Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, which closed on July 30. Sales related to cosmetic actives grew high double-digits in Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and the U.S., all a result of new wins. Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which as a reminder are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production, remained soft, reflecting more challenging market conditions, including our largest Fragrance Ingredients customer rationalizing their portfolio, as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by high-single digit internal demand growth. On a profit perspective, Fragrance currency-neutral segment profit improved approximately 15%, driven by volume growth and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. This performance, plus lower incentive compensation expense, led to over 150 basis point improvement in operating profit margin. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continued to show improvement as a percentage of sales versus the same period in 2014, as our five quarter rolling average figure through the end of the third quarter was down 80 basis points to approximately 28.8% of our trailing 12-month sales. All of our gains versus the first nine months of 2014 came from lower payables, as our days payable outstanding increased 9% versus the same period a year ago. Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the third quarter was $295 million, including an incremental $27 million pension contribution so far this year. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, operating cash flow would have increased to $322 million, or 40 basis points in terms of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales, from 13.6% during the first nine months of 2014 to 14% for the equivalent period in 2015. Looking at our uses of cash, capital expenditure on a year-to-date basis have been $67 million or 2.9% of sales, as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives. Principally, as we finish our plants in Turkey and Indonesia, and while we are a little low on a capital spend year-to-date relative to our full year guidance, we expect to finish approximately 4.5%, as spending traditionally flows through during the fourth quarter each year. For cash returned to shareholders, we expect to continue to deliver a total payout ratio in line with our 50% to 60% target, all while maintaining financial flexibility to capitalize upon organic growth opportunities and value-creating M&A. Dividend payments year-to-date have been $114 million, following our 20% increase this past August. Share repurchases at the end of the quarter were $81 million, allowing us to buy back approximately 726,000 shares at an average price of $111.88 per share. Please note that as of Friday, we have repurchased approximately $21 million of shares since the end of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $102 million. From a guidance perspective, we are reconfirming our full-year 2015 guidance, despite the challenging year ago fourth quarter comparison, which includes approximately 200 basis points of growth related to the 53rd week, as well as continued market uncertainty, which is leading to volatility in order patterns for many of our multinational customers. Despite continued growth in Latin America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East driven by new wins, our core Flavor business is expected to be soft in the fourth quarter. In North America, we expect pressure due to a higher level of volume erosion as businesses we won in previous years are not performing at the same levels as they have historically. We are also seeing general volume weakness in North America, with several of our food and beverage customers reporting volume challenges. In Greater Asia, we expect similar trends through the third quarter as we believe the economic uncertainty in China will continue to impact our business. In core Fragrances, we expect continued pressure in Fragrance Ingredients, primarily related to the largest customer continuing its rationalization of their portfolio. In Fragrance Compounds, we expect our strong year-ago comparison, the weakness in the Brazilian economy, and our strong year-to-date performance, particularly in Consumer Fragrances will lead to growth moderating in Q4. Fortunately, we expect a benefit from our recent acquisitions, which we believe should lead to moderate currency-neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter. In terms of profitability, on a full-year basis, we continue to believe we can achieve approximately 9% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The drivers for our profitability performance include top-line growth, benefits of productivity initiatives, lower incentive compensation expense and the inclusion of acquisitions. Bridging our performance to include the impact of currency, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus many global currencies will have an impact. The weakening euro versus the U.S. dollar, which represents our large currency exposure at about 40% of operating profit is expected to have the greatest impact. In addition, several other currencies were small in terms of profitability exposure as all weakened considerably versus the U.S. dollar and are collectively pressuring profitability. Mitigating this exposure, we expect approximately a 3 percentage point gain from our transactional euro-hedging program. Incorporating the foreign exchange impact on our full-year guidance, we would expect reported sales to be down approximately 1%, including approximately a 7 percentage point impact from currency, as we do not hedge our translational exposure. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect about a 4% increase, despite an approximately 5 percentage point headwind of currency. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Alison. I briefly want to reiterate that despite ongoing volatility in several key markets around the world, we were able to deliver strong financial results in the third quarter, thanks in large part to the diversity of our business, as well as the benefits associated with our recent acquisitions. Also, based on our strong year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe we can deliver 6% currency-neutral sales growth and approximately 9% adjusted operating profit growth both on a currency-neutral basis. Going forward, continuing our execution of Vision 2020 is a top priority for us. Vision 2020 is focused on increasing differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and creating shareholder value. All three of which we believe are achievable in the years to come. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : . And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan: Yeah, thanks and good morning everybody. Wanted to get some clarity on the fourth quarter expectations from a revenue standpoint. So, if you back out the benefit of acquisitions, are you talking about flattish organic like-for-like, however you want to think about it, sales growth? And then sort of more broadly elaborating on sales growth, I know it's early, but how do you think about 2016 just broadly given continued pressure from customer volumes, as well as the tough first quarter comparisons? Alison A. Cornell: So, Mark, from a Q4 perspective, we expect to be flat to slightly positive. We have our first month of orders in, which are positive and although one month doesn't make the quarter, it reflects positive results there. If we look into 2016, specifically Q1, while we're still in our budget process, remember in Q1 of 2016 we're facing our toughest comps year-on-year in terms of growth comparison, specifically in, say, Flavors where we grew 9% in Q1 of 2015. So at this point in time as we enter the year we're facing our toughest comps and so we expect Q1 to be challenging. But as we traditionally do expect to share more in our February call regarding our 2016 full-year guidance. Mark S. Astrachan: Okay. Just elaborating on that though, again preliminary as it is, do you expect long-term targets to be attainable given what's going on from a customer standpoint? Alison A. Cornell: I mean, at this point, as I mentioned, we're still in our budget process and we really don't want to comment further on 2016. Mark S. Astrachan: Okay. Fair enough. Just quickly on gross margin. So ex the hedge gain this year, will gross margin \u2013 would it still be positive in 2015 and then how do you think about expansion on a longer-term basis if you normalize for that and say on a longer-term basis how should we think about gross margins? Alison A. Cornell: So, Mark, let me talk first about \u2013 so in Q3, our adjusted gross profit margin expanded 170 basis points. And this was driven by our currency heading benefits, as we hedge our raw material purchases to protect our transactional exposure, as well as our cost and productivity savings, volume growth and mix improvement. In Q3, there was roughly a $9.5 million benefit from our hedge, which was included in the gross \u2013 in our gross profit. This accounted for the majority of the expansion, but there was also benefit, as I mentioned, from cost and productivity savings, volume growth and mix improvement. As we move into Q4, we expect our currency hedging benefit to be a little less than half of the expansion in Q4, with the other half coming from cost and productivity savings initiatives, minus volume growth and M&A. We believe that our \u2013 there is sustainability of gross margin expansion, excluding the FX hedge, as we enter into Q4. As we look in 2016, from a raw materials' perspective, based on what we've seen so far, it's similar to 2015, where we've seen naturals are up, synthetics are slightly down and if anything we're probably flat to slightly up. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. Andreas Fibig : Good morning. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Good morning. So just speaking following on that question. In the Q, there was a mention of some derivative gains that are going to be reclassified as income next year. So does that also flow through gross margin, so maybe kind of takes the place of these raw material hedging gains? Alison A. Cornell: So, Lauren, let me talk a bit about that. And so, we indicated on our Investor Day that we intended to finance our M&A activity through balance sheet leverage. And so between Ottens and Lucas Meyer acquisitions, we executed about $500 million in acquisitions. Initially these were paid for using our existing credit facility and on-hand cash, and now we're looking at longer-term financing opportunities to better align our maturities with the nature of those acquisition. So in September, we entered into interest swaps in anticipation of a long term debt financing and the deferred charges in that table and our 10-Q are being accounted for right now as a hedging instrument, as they are related to these swaps. We still are in the process of evaluating our options for financing and at this point, we haven't finalized the timing or nature of the financing and we expect to have more clarity on that in Q1 of next year. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay. That's great. But is that also \u2013 does that conversation cover, I think there was like $8.7 million that was in comprehensive income that was called out as being reclassified over the next 12 months. Are those the swaps? Michael DeVeau : Lauren, it's Mike. It's okay. Maybe just as I go through the Q, maybe we can touch base offline on that, I'm not sure... Lauren Rae Lieberman : Yes, absolutely. Michael DeVeau : We're following from that point (37:02). Okay. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Absolutely. Okay. And then just on Asia Flavors, so I was surprised that flat just felt very strong to me given the commentary at our conference in September and I know, Alison, you talked about strong orders the last week of the quarter. Was that comment specific to Asia Flavors and what have you seen from those customers in the first month? You said that overall orders were up, but I just wondered about the volatility or choppiness of orders from that particular customer base you've been concerned about. Alison A. Cornell: So, Lauren, you did comment \u2013 we did experience softness in China, so if you looked at China by itself, as a subset for Greater Asia in Flavors, it was negative growth. Why it looks flat is because there was offsetting growth in Indonesia, India, Singapore and Japan. And so that's really why it looks flat. I'll ask, Matthias to comment on what we've seen so far in October in terms of the customer make-up. Matthias Haeni : Well, Lauren, good morning. We have seen a very similar pattern also in the first month of the quarter. I think we made good in-road with new business in all the markets, Alison just referred to, yet we see also continuous challenges in China. We expect that these challenges will continue throughout the quarter, and we're working very diligently with the team, with our customers to strengthen our business in China. And we're still good and confident that we will see a reverse situation in the quarters to come. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay, great. And then just finally on Fine Fragrance, you called out some of the strength, some of the pipeline still on really great new wins in Europe. So does the outlook sort of assume that all the sell-in is kind of done that would cover holiday sell-through of those wins? Andreas Fibig : Nicolas? Nicolas Mirzayantz : Hi, Lauren. This is Nicolas. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Hi. Nicolas Mirzayantz : Yes, you're right, very strong pipeline of the new wins, and as you pointed out, it's really to cover the period of Christmas. So according to the way the sales progress at the retail level, we will see what will be the replenishment (39:17) from our customers. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay, great. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Thank you. Alison A. Cornell: Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Michael J. Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter. Andreas Fibig : Good morning. Alison A. Cornell: Thank you. Michael J. Sison: Just trying to getting a feel for the tempo of demand. It looks \u2013 I think you sort of noted that fourth-quarter currency adjusted sales growth will be slower. So what are your customers telling you? Are things actually slowing or stable? Just trying to get an understanding in both Flavors and Fragrances where the tempo of demand is headed. Andreas Fibig : Mike, this is Andreas, I'm taking that. What we see is that for some of our \u2013 particularly our global customers the volumes are slowing, but it's actually not a one-fits-all answer, because we see in some areas like still Latin America on the Flavor side, we see strong growth as in the third quarter, which is really double digit. We see countries in Asia with strong growth for both businesses. And we see Europe at least on, for our business, recovering as well. So at the end of the day, it's a very mixed picture region-by-region. The only thing which is probably universal is that the volume for some of the global customers is really challenged. So that's how I would comment on that one, so it's very different and it depends also on the technologies and let me elaborate on that. If you have a technology, which helps the customers to grow the business like our Sweetness Modulation for example, which we are selling very well or the encapsulation on the Fragrance side, then the wins are strong and you really can even against the market trends make great strides. I know it's probably not a general satisfying answer, but it's a very diverse picture we are dealing with here. Michael J. Sison: Okay. I understand. And then your acquisitions have performed really well, it seems. Can you talk about your pipeline given that could be a good use of cash and growth going forward? Andreas Fibig : So, you mean the pipeline for M&A? Michael J. Sison: Of acquisitions, yes. Are you seeing good opportunities out there? Andreas Fibig : So what we do is, we look at with different lenses at the market, what kind of technology would be valuable for us? Second, where do we need, let's say, a local or regional strengthening of our presence or with certain customers, and in general, good quality companies like we have done with Ottens and Lucas Meyer. So we have a good pipeline, I can't comment further on this one, but we are further looking. And the good thing is that the acquisitions are going very well in terms of the integration. So it means after many years with very little M&A activity, I think, the organization is doing very well to get these quality assets into our portfolio, and they performed actually very well. Just one remark on the skin care or active cosmetic ingredients side, we are very pleased what we see in this market segment because it has just a higher growth than our core markets. So, all-in-all very positive, we have a pipeline and we will, let's say, continue our path here. Michael J. Sison: Great. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I just want to be sure that I can interpret your results reasonably. So what you said was that your adjusted sales were down 1% and your operating profit was up 7%. I assume that that includes the hedge gains and that if the hedge gains are excluded the operating profit is probably flat to up and in your adjusted currency neutral, where you grow sales 7% and your operating profit 10%, I assume that that excludes the hedge gains and other currency gains. Is that correct? Alison A. Cornell: So I'm going to ask Rich O'Leary to answer that. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Sure. Richard O\u2019Leary: Hey, Jeff, it's Rich. So, yeah, I think there's two things to think about. When we talk about the margin evolution because the hedge gains are in there on a reported basis, we'll show the year \u2013 we'll talk to the year-over-year impact. When we're going to currency neutral, we did what we basically do is restate last year's to reflect the current year gains. So we're stripping out the year-over-year impact and we're making consistent year-over-year from the cash flow hedging impact. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: So the hedges are \u2013 so again, so the hedges and the currency gains are stripped out of currency neutral, but the hedge gains are included in the first presentation, in the sales contracting 1% and operating profit up 7%? Richard O\u2019Leary: Well, on a sales basis, we don't hedge the sales line. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Exactly right. It's really the operating profit that's the issue. Richard O\u2019Leary: Yeah. So on an operating profit when we talk reported-to-reported, it will have the year-over-year impact of the cash flow hedging, either gains or losses; in the case of 2015, it's gains. When we go to currency neutral, we just reflect the current year impact of the gains, so we're not having a year-over-year impact because last year's cash flow hedging impact is really related to 2013 and so we're stripping that two-year basis out. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Right. And then in the course of the call you talked about a $9 million benefit, but when you go to the Q, it looks like it's something more like a $7 million benefit in terms of the cash flow hedging. Why the $9 million instead of the $7 million or what's the extra amount that's added on to the cash flow hedge benefit? Richard O\u2019Leary: Again, that's the difference between \u2013 it's more or less \u2013 it's the difference between when we're trying to reconcile \u2013 when we're trying to talk to the change year-over-year for example in gross margin. Those are reported-to-reported and that's where you have the year-over-year impact, which is the higher number. When we talk to the operating profit impact, we strip out the last year's impact. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi, good morning. Andreas Fibig : Good morning. Michael DeVeau : Good morning, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : Good morning. So I just had a few clarifying questions first. One, I think at the Back-to-School Conference you had talked about local currency sales growth of 6% for the year with even contribution from acquisitions and organic growth. So does that still stand or should we expect a larger contribution from organic growth now? Alison A. Cornell: So, when I talked about even distribution at the Back-to-School Conference, I mean, some of it was relative to rounding as well. So, I would think about it as a 3.5% organic, about 2.5% acquisition related, to get to the 6%. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to talk a little bit more about Latin America, particularly on the Flavors side. Some of your competitors have been talking about a potential pricing benefit in Latin America. I don't know if that's because they're euro denominated and it's different for you. So maybe if you could talk about are you able to take some pricing in certain markets or categories to offset currency? Alison A. Cornell: So, let me start by making a comment in terms of comparison. And so when looking company-to-company, we need to make sure that things are compared on an apples-to-apples basis, organic-to-organic basis and comparable currency related to FX, because I think as reflected in reports, taken as written, they're not comparable. So I think you need to make sure before you compare two companies, you make sure that they are comparable. So with that let me ask Matthias to talk about Latin America market dynamics. Matthias Haeni : Faiza, we're really traveling well with the many new wins, which we had this year. We also feel very confident that we will continue to commercialize many of the projects, which we have. We have an exciting project pipeline throughout the region. Yes, we face some challenges on current volumes and we will offset it however with new wins, we feel good about it. We always reported that we had very good in-roads in Beverages. We're now expanding more also into Savory, into the Dairy category. And frankly overall, we'll feel pretty good about it also in Q4. Alison A. Cornell: If I could, just one more comment, just so you know what we do in your apples-to-apples comparison. We fully restate all currency. Faiza Alwy : Okay. And then could you maybe just tell us what percentage of the Flavors business is LatAm or maybe what percentage of the LatAm business is Flavors just so we could size it because the growth just seems really strong at 20%, so I'm just wondering is it \u2013 if you could talk about are these local customers, sort of what the size might be, maybe expand a little bit more on that? Michael DeVeau : Yeah, Faiza, it's Michael. I mean, we traditionally don't disclose from a Flavor standpoint our percentage of business. I think as you think about it, it's probably our smallest region with respect to the other regions that we have globally, but from a business standpoint maybe Matthias, if you want to provide additional commentary. Matthias Haeni : Yes, Mike outlined the smallest region, yet from a growth perspective for us very sizable, very impactful. We feel very good about the in-roads we make and I'm confident that we are gaining great market share in Latin America. Again what we are reporting here is the all like-for-like, this is currency neutral, there is no element of pricing in it, but volume and new wins. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Feeney with Athlos. Andreas Fibig : Hi, Jon. Jonathan P. Feeney: Could you give us a sense how large right now the naturals business is globally for you and what its growth is and what sort of growth rate are you expecting in the naturals business across categories over the next couple of years? Matthias Haeni : Well, from a Flavor perspective, we have probably more than 50% of all the new briefs, which we are working on are calling for natural solutions, natural Flavors. We feel excited about the many requests for natural modulators. I cannot exactly give you an indication of the overall market growth. The underlying market growth of naturals, we only realize that definitely naturals are outperforming any other product offerings in the marketplace. It's not only here in North America where more and more consumers they're looking to organics, (51:24) organic and natural. We see very same trends around the world, in Western Europe but also in many mature markets in Asia, in particular. We have also a higher win rate in naturals as such, as we are well positioned for it and frankly, we see all these requests and all these briefs as exciting opportunities for us to accelerate growth. Jonathan P. Feeney: I got you. Thank you. Just a couple follow-ups on that, if you don't mind. You said more than 50% of all new briefs, but of the existing business can you give me a sense of how much revenue right now is going from \u2013 is in products that are already sort of meeting those kinds of natural specifications. And the second question is typically with these new briefs, does that involve a higher pricing or fully developed margin to IFF in the Flavors business as you reformulate with naturals? Matthias Haeni : Let me take first the question on the margin profiles. Whenever we are in a position to bring technology into a product offering, we typically have a higher margin profile. When it comes to 50% plus on naturals, keep in mind that we still have a lot of developing markets where natural as such may not necessarily be the major call. I'm referring here to many developing markets also in Africa and Middle East and in many other parts of the world. To the question on what the total percentage of the portfolio of natural is all about and we are not sharing this information. We feel good about what we currently have and frankly we made very good in-roads. Alison A. Cornell: And just to further comment in terms of model, we have a cost-plus model and relative to naturals as well. Jonathan P. Feeney: Cost plus. So that's actually very helpful, Alison. So when you say cost plus meaning your margin in terms of dollars tends to stay flat and you charge up on that, so you might see higher \u2013 same or higher penny profit, but lower percentage margin or do you actually \u2013 when you say cost plus, is it a percentage of cost? Alison A. Cornell: Yeah, so essentially what it means is if costs go up, the price goes up. Jonathan P. Feeney: Right. Alison A. Cornell: We maintain the margin. Jonathan P. Feeney: Okay. But your \u2013 is that \u2013 I guess that's a simple question. Is it a margin expansion opportunity in terms of total dollars coming into IFF when someone replaces, typically speaking, replaces an artificial with a natural product. Alison A. Cornell: No, not in and of itself. Matthias Haeni : It is more important, Jon, what kind of categories, whether it is Beverage or Savory that makes a difference in terms of the portability or margin perspective. But not whether it's synthetic or natural. Jonathan P. Feeney: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And your last question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John E. Roberts: Good morning. Can you hear me? Andreas Fibig : Yes, good morning, John. John E. Roberts: Sometimes your incentive compensation accruals in a quarter can be different from the other quarters, but the change in business tone in the fourth quarter, would you expect to under accrue or reverse any incentive compensation in the fourth quarter? Alison A. Cornell: So we can say this about incentive compensation, because we do not enclose our incentive compensation numbers other than calling out a variance and so I can't give you an exact number. I would say, it's marginally favorable in Q3, but will be a larger benefit in Q4, based on our projected performance. John E. Roberts: Okay. And then, secondly, when you talked about your global customers seeing some slowdown, it sounds like in the developed markets you're still seeing the smaller customers outperform the larger customers. I think that's a trend we've seen for several quarters now. Andreas Fibig : Yeah. Absolutely, John. That's what we see in many markets that the smaller and regional customers have just good growth rates. And if you're with these customers and then you really can do very well \u2013 very good business. And that was actually one of the reasons why we acquired Ottens here for Flavors in the U.S. and just participating in that segment of the market, a bit better in the U.S. John E. Roberts: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Heidi, your line is open. You may need to un-mute on your end. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Sorry, hi, I'm back. I wanted to go back to the naturals question. I heard from some other ingredients company, slightly different for Flavors, but still in naturals that a lot of the smaller companies have been faster at reformulating into naturals and we've seen a lot of reformulation announcements from the globals, but they still tend to be in the discussion or testing stage and we haven't actually seen the big volumes come through. Would you agree with this or are you already benefiting from this trend? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Good morning, Heidi. I totally agree and support this, I think we have seen that smaller companies are faster in the implementation and they're also much faster in the replacement of either artificial nature identical (56:56) into natural. We see them launching more innovative product solutions and we expect that the larger accounts they will follow in the quarters to come. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Thank you. Andreas Fibig : You're welcome. Operator : Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you much for your time. Good quarter, quarter three, we are on track for year 2015, and I believe we will have a good trajectory for years to come. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook to the first quarter and full year 2016. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig, and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Alison Cornell. We will start the call with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. Then I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Allison to cover our financial results in greater detail, including a comprehensive review of our fourth quarter, cash flow statement, and cash return to shareholders. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2016 and finish by taking any questions that you may have. Starting with a financial review of our consolidated results for the full year 2015, I'm pleased to report that currency-neutral sales grew 5%, which encompasses 6% growth in flavors and 4% growth in fragrances. Overall, top line growth benefited from a two percentage-point contribution from the acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. In addition, our organic business, which grew 3% on a currency-neutral base, continued to benefit from strong new win performance, particularly in fragrance compounds, as sales related to new wins finished above our five-year average. For the full year 2015 and on a currency-neutral basis, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 8% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded by 50 basis points as a result of our sales growth, the benefit associated with cost savings and productivity initiatives, mix gains related to acquisitions, and lower incentive compensation expense. This improvement in operating profit, when combined with a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction of shares outstanding, led to an 11% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS in 2015. While I am pleased with our results on a full year base, I'm not satisfied with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. That is driven by a combination of a challenging year-over-year comparison due to an additional week of sales or the 53rd week in 2014, a concentrated effort by some of our larger customers to manage inventories in advance of year-end, a portfolio rationalization of one of our largest fragrance ingredients' customers, and an increased economic pressure in key emerging markets, such as China. We did not perform as well as we would have expected. Alison will go through the specifics in greater detail in a moment. Before doing so, I want to highlight the strategic progress we have made as it relates to our Vision 2020 strategy. Since the communication of our strategy in June 2, 2015, we have taken steps to deliver on our ambition to achieve target market leadership, defined by number one or number two market share positions in key markets, categories, and customers. Within the emerging markets, we've identified the Middle East and Africa as an area of focus, given the robust economic trends and the impact on our consumer disposable income in the future. I'm happy to report even as we are very early in our journey that for the full year Middle East and Africa we are up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Similarly, with fragrance compounds, China grew high-single digits as the local teams continued to leverage our long-standing presence and in-depth consumer knowledge to win both global and regional customers. Consumer fragrances continued its mid to high single-digit growth trend in 2015, and within that segment, homecare, an area of focus for us, grew high single digits for the full year on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America. In flavors Latin America, we delivered 16% currency-neutral sales growth, driven in part by key customers and our proprietary delivery systems. In 2015, in North America we believe we are now the number two flavors company with our acquisition of Ottens Flavors, which will be adding approximately $60 million in annual sales to our business. Over the course of the year, we also made strong progress against our innovating first pillar, as we believe our robust technology pipeline is critical to building greater differentiation and ultimately accelerated growth. In quarter four, we commercialized two additional captive fragrance ingredients molecules, bringing our total output to four in 2015. In addition, the [indiscernible] and crystal fizz, which I spoke about last quarter, in quarter four we commercialized Amber Tonic and [indiscernible]. Both molecules are strong performers in all applications and give our perfumers the competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance for our customers. We are proud of these accomplishments as we successfully doubled our annual fragrance ingredients molecule output average. We believe this is very critical in terms of differentiation and it provides us with greater confidence in our growth ambitions going forward. The strong trends in fabric care and beverage continued in the fourth quarter, driven by our industry-leading encapsulation technology in fragrances and proprietary delivery system in flavors. The growth trend of encapsulation-related sales continued in 2015 as currency-neutral sales improved mid-teens, led by fabric care and homecare. For the full year 2015, fabric care grew high single digits on a currency-neutral basis, with all geographic markets posting strong growth, led by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. Leveraging our success in fabric care, we developed a new capsule in 2015, which will allow us to expand this critical encapsulation technology into personal care categories, such as hair care and body wash. Sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, increasing double digits in 2015. The categories where we had the most success were savory, dairy, and beverage, as our innovative solutions are allowing our customers to meet the demands of consumers who are primarily looking to reduce sugar and salt. Building on those strengths, we also commercialized two natural taste modulators in 2015. A vision of these modulators will further strengthen our capabilities and it provides our flavors the more competitive palates from which it builds winning solutions for our customers. In addition to the strides we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we've also made progress in our never-ending quest to become our customers' partner of choice. In December, we launched our refreshed branding where we unveiled the new website, purpose statement, visual identity, and tone of voice, all of which are geared towards showcasing IFF's vision, imagination, and innovative focus for customers, employees, and, of course, shareholders. I'm proud of the recognition we have received from our customers in 2015. Over the course of the year, we won the North America innovation award with one of the largest flavors customers, which recognizes partners for their thought leadership. In addition, Estee Lauder presented us with their Suppliers Excellence Award, an achievement designed to acknowledge their top-performing business partners. Also, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, who we acquired in August, won the 2015 In-Cosmetics Asia Gold Award for best active ingredient innovation and best functional ingredient. More recently, they also received first prize at the first cosmetic ingredients show of 2016. When it comes to sustainability, at IFF we will not accept the status quo. We believe it is foundational to our Vision 2020 business strategy, which is while we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our business practices and our corporate culture. As you can see on the slide, 2015 was a very successful year in terms of accomplishment. While the first three pillars focus on leveraging or improving our existing capabilities and infrastructure, the fourth pillar strengthening and expanding the portfolio aims to support our organic business through M&A partnerships and collaborations. During the second and third quarter of 2015, we completed two acquisitions, one focusing on growing our market share in North America and one focusing on expanding into new adjacencies which have strategic value. Both acquisitions in 2015 have performed well and are ahead of our business case in terms of sales growth and margin enhancement. We believe that performance is a good indication that we are allocating capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we have made from a strategic perspective and I'm committed to continuing this momentum as we move through 2016. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison. Alison Cornell : Thank you, Andreas. Given the softness that we experienced in the fourth quarter, I want us to reconcile to what we communicated on our third quarter conference call to actual Q4 results. On November 11, we stated that we expect to have moderate currency-neutral sales growth in the fourth quarter with organic sales flat to down slightly in Q4. At that time, as shown in the chart, currency-neutral sales on an organic basis was up 2% in October. As we moved through November, our growth trajectory continued with currency-neutral sales up nearly 3% for the month. Then, unfortunately, our performance in December came in softer than we expected. While we knew we faced a strong year-ago comparison that included an extra week of sales, which we quantified to be 200 basis points in the quarter or approximately 600 basis points in the month of December, there were a few other factors that further pressured results. First, in flavors, we experienced unprecedented fluctuations in terms of customer order patterns. While traditionally we have good visibility around the commercialization of products and our customers\u2019 recurring order patterns, we ultimately are dependent on our customers in terms of launches and inventory levels. In December, we unexpectedly experienced several large flavors customers reducing their overall order intake, which impacted results. This was also the case in consumer fragrances, where customers did not reorder at the same level as they did in the year-ago period excluding the 53rd week impact. In fragrances, our ingredients business remained under pressure as one of our largest fragrance ingredients customers continued to rationalize their product portfolio. In Q4, the impact was even more pronounced, which further pressured results. And lastly, we continued to see pressure in flavors in China, partly due to a weaker economic environment, but also some lost business relating to the manufacturing issues we faced earlier in the year. In light of our challenging currency-neutral sales growth, we still managed to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth. In the quarter, acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to overall growth. There are two areas that I want to highlight in terms of our top line in the quarter. The first is Latin America flavors, where we continue to benefit from our industry-leading delivery system technology and take market share from our competition. Also in Latin America, fine fragrance has returned to growth in the fourth quarter as volume erosion appears to be normalizing and we continue to win new business as we significantly outperform the market. From a profit perspective, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis increased 3% and adjusted operating profit margin expanded 40 basis points, as gross margin expansion, the benefits of productivity initiatives, M&A, and reduced incentive compensation drove results. Below the line, currency-neutral adjusted EPS increased 9%, thanks in large part to a lower adjusted effective tax rate, down 210 basis points and an 830,000 share reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program. Despite the softer-than-expected sales and operating profit performance in Q4, we still delivered a solid financial performance on a full-year basis. Currency-neutral sales improved 5%, currency-neutral adjusted operating profit grew 8% and currency-neutral adjusted EPS increased 11%. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels continued to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales as our five quarter rolling average figures through the end of Q4 was down 40 basis points to approximately 28.7% of our 2015 annual sales. Much of our gains came from higher payables as a result of the concentrated efforts to improve our days payables outstanding. On a full-year basis, our DPO increased by nine days to 54 days from 45 days a year ago. Operating cash flow from operations at the end of the fourth quarter was $434 million, including an incremental $24 million pension contribution. Excluding the incremental portion of the pension contribution, adjusted operating cash flow would have increased to $458 million or 15.2% of adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of sales. Capital expenditures for the year finished at $101 million or approximately 3.3% of sales as we continue to make investments to support our growth initiatives, principally as we finished our plants in Turkey and Indonesia. CapEx in 2015 came in below original expectations as the timing of several vendor payments will now occur in 2016. As a result, we expect 2016 CapEx will increase to around 5% of sales as we plan to make incremental investments for manufacturing in a new flavor site in China and to improve our site in India. For cash returned to shareholders, dividend payments in 2015 were $160 million. This is a direct result of a 20% increase in August as our intention was to provide a more competitive yield, approximately 2% while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. Supplementing our dividend and remaining flexible to pursue M&A opportunities, we spent $122 million in share buybacks. Over the course of the year, we've repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares and lowered our diluted shares outstanding to 80.4 million shares. When combining both dividends and share repurchases, we achieved a 66% total payout ratio of adjusted net income, exceeding our targeted range of 50% to 60% and significantly ahead of prior year. Looking ahead for 2016, we can reiterate our targeted total payout ratio range of 50% to 60%. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thanks, Alison. As we look ahead to 2016, I want to provide an assessment of our vantage point as we stand here today. Basically, there are four key themes that we believe are relevant when planning our financial goals for 2016. From an economic perspective, there's a lot of fluidity around the world. While the developed markets of the U.S. and Western Europe appear to be improving slowly and the emerging markets, the volatility we experienced in the second half of 2015 continues. Large markets like China appear to be decelerating and Brazil continues its decline. These two markets account for approximately 15% of our total sales. With regard to multinational consumer product companies, volume expectations seem to be muted as many organizations appear to be focused on improving margins while taking pricing actions in emerging markets to protect profitability. Fortunately, regional players continue to exhibit stronger volume trends, whether it be in the U.S. or in the emerging markets. This economic uncertainty has led to sharp declines in hard commodities such as oil, which is beneficial in terms of costs. This large decline in petrochemical should help in terms of input cost, although we continue to see naturals, such as vanilla and citrus, remaining elevated. Finally, in terms of foreign exchange, the US dollar continues to strength against world currencies. This continues to be a challenge for most multinational companies based in US, both in terms of translation and transaction exposure. With all that as context, we are preparing ourselves for even more challenging conditions, given the higher level of economic uncertainty and the more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. We expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency-neutral sales growth, including approximately a 1.5 percentage-point contribution on the acquisitions of Ottens and Lucas Meyer. From an organic perspective, growth is expected to be largely driven by consumer fragrances, as well as Latin America and EAME and flavors. From an operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of the contribution of M&A. This improvement should be a result of gross margin expansion and productivity initiatives, that more than offset the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program and investments in our strategy 2020, both of which Alison will touch on in a moment. Currency-neutral EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. Longer term, we continue to believe that over the 2016-2020 horizon we can deliver our Vision 2020 financial targets. We believe our emphasis on building greater differentiation, specifically in R&D, should ultimately lead to higher growth rates in the years to come. And in light of the recent instability in the financial markets around the world, I want to take a moment to reemphasize that IFF is a diversified and competitively advantaged organization. Whether you analyze our portfolio by category, region, or customer, the breadth and diversity of our portfolio is great and our innovative solutions are key components of consumer staple products that enjoy long-term growth stability. We believe that our management team, as well as all IFF employees are capable of executing on our strategy 2020, to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that we can deliver organic currency-neutral growth - term targets of 4% to 6% growth, 7% to 9% operating profit growth, and 10% EPS growth over the course of 2016 to 2020. With that, I would like to ask Alison to provide some additional remarks on our profitability outlook and foreign exchange exposure. Alison Cornell : Given the many moving parts, I wanted to provide additional insight and transparency into our expected profitability goal for 2016. In the table, we anchored on full-year 2015 adjusted operating profit and built out a reconciliation to bridge to 2016 operating profit. Starting with the second bar, you will note that we expect approximately a 4.5 percentage-point headwind related to the resetting of our annual incentive compensation program. For those of you who are not familiar, we at IFF are highly incentivized to deliver on our financial commitments. From time to time, there are variations in incentive compensation, as it is based on our performance relative to our annual plans. If we achieve our full-year financial targets, which are comprised of currency-neutral sales growth, gross margin as a percentage of sales, and absolute level of operating profit, and working capital as a percentage of sales, we will receive 100% of our designated payout. Should we over-perform or underperform our annual plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower, respectively. Since in 2015, we underperformed on a few components of our plan, our payout was below 100%. Now, as we reset our targets in 2016, we budget for 100% payout, which ultimately is a driver behind the year-over-year variance. In the third bar, we've identified the incremental investments we are making in Vision 2020. These are critical strategic investments, for example, R&D, application and commercial, geared toward delivering our long-term strategic and financial objectives. As we communicated at our Investor Day, we committed to self-fund our reinvestment opportunity. In the fourth bar, you can see that we are aggressively attacking our cost base to not only cover our incremental investments, but also help to deliver on our short-term profitability objectives. In addition to our standard cost and productivity initiatives, which include the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings, and manufacturing efficiencies, we identified incremental savings opportunities via our [indiscernible] journey programs. During the fourth quarter, we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure, simplify decision-making and accountability, better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization, and improve our global manufacturing and operations network. As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge of approximately $8 million to cover severance and related costs associated with expected termination, a portion of which are subject to consultation processes. The Company expects to realize pretax savings of $7 million to $9 million once fully implemented in the second half of 2017, half of which is expected to be realized in 2016, which is included in our 2016 guidance. Separately, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $7 million associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the Aromor acquisition that was triggered by certain of the affected positions noted above. Then, the combination of our operational performance, inclusive of M&A, is expected to deliver 4% to 7% currency-neutral operating profit growth. We expect foreign exchange, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment, will have a five percentage-point impact, bringing our reported operating profit to be flat to up 2% in 2016. Before concluding, I would like to provide some additional insight into our foreign exchange exposure. Although 51% of our sales are to the emerging markets, not all of these sales are denominated in local currencies. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in US dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to price in local emerging-market currency. As you can see in this chart, of the 51% of our sales in 2015 that were to emerging markets, approximately 70% were denominated in US dollars or other hard currencies, leaving only 30% that are denominated in emerging-market currencies. As a result, our foreign-exchange exposure to emerging-market currencies is rather limited. This is important, especially as we continue to see the US dollar strengthen versus most emerging-market currencies. Given that fact, it's clear that the key hard currencies have the most impact on our profitability. Starting with the top box, we've listed our profitability exposure. As we progress into 2016, while the Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Thai baht, and Australian dollar are presenting modest headwinds in terms of currency, the euro is clearly the largest driver. As you can see, the devaluation of the euro versus US dollar is expected to represent approximately four out of our five percentage-point headwind in 2016. While we are hedged approximately 75% at [114] in 2016, the impact on profitability is about 2.5%, plus the year-over-year variance of the hedging benefit in 2016 versus 2015. To allow you to more accurately forecast the exchange-rate volatility, I've included our 2015 exchange rate, as well as our planning rate for 2016. We hope that by giving you these details you have greater visibility into our currency exposure, as you can calculate the percentage change in each specific currency and then multiply by the percentage of profit each currency represents. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some concluding remarks. Andreas Fibig : In summary, 2015 was a successful year for IFF. We were able to deliver solid financial performance, while also implementing our new Vision 2020 strategy, geared towards accelerating profitable growth, building greater differentiation, and maximizing shareholder value. Our focus now continues to be on the execution of our strategy. In addition in 2015, we integrated two acquisitions, strengthened and further prioritized our R&D initiatives, achieved our sustainability objectives, grew our talent, and invigorated IFF's brand with the launch of our new purpose statement and enhanced branding elements, all of which helps spotlight our vision, imagination, and innovative focus. Looking forward, we are committed to our long-term targets and continue to believe that over the 2016-2020 horizon we can deliver strong financial results. And while 2016 is more challenging in terms of the operating environment, we believe we can deliver solid financial results, while simultaneously reinvesting in our business. With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Hi, good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask on cost savings. So is the plan still to have the previously announced cost savings of 1% to 2% of sales fully reinvested back into the business, given what looked in the slide that Alison was walking through that there is a 2% benefit to EBIT growth embedded in 2016 guidance? In other words, does the benefit become a drag to EBIT in 2017? And then, just more broadly on the same topic, does the current macro environment, which is clearly worse than it was in June 2015 when those original savings were outlined, require more cost savings to grow in line with long-term targets today? Andreas Fibig : Mark, thank you for the question. Let me start and then I hand over to Alison. First of all, what we have started to be - and you have seen it in the call in terms of pretty aggressive, let's say, savings targets to make sure that we have good cost base, which will help us going forward in the years to come as well. And we will take part of it to reinvest in particular in R&D because we believe we have to build differentiation and new molecules. And as I hopefully have shown you during the presentation that we have already some early successes in terms of our pipeline, just mentioning going from two fragrance to four fragrance and new patented molecules, which will help us to grow our base over the years to come. I agree with you. The economic environment has worsened compared to, let's say, eight to nine months ago and that's the reason why we are cautious in terms of our outlook as well because the volatility is just very, very high right now. Let me hand over to Alison. Alison Cornell : Hi, Mark. In addition to what Andreas said, the other thing that - we are being very aggressive from a cost-cutting perspective. And what you see on the bridge chart that we provided from 2015 to 2016 is one of the items that we need to cover is our bonus reset back to 1X. And so the cost-cutting is not only to cover the Vision 2020, but also to cover our bonus reset, and so we don't anticipate having that same issue as we move into 2017. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Mike Sison : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andreas Fibig : Hi, Mike. Good morning. Mike Sison : Andreas, when you think about 2016 and what you are hearing from your customers, is the slowdown in terms of the demand coming from less new-product starts? Is it basically just customers, their customers not buying as much? Can you maybe touch on some of the underlying dynamics of what you are seeing in terms of the slowing in the markets? Andreas Fibig : Okay. Mike, thank you for the question. It's probably a bit of a long one to answer because a couple of the puzzle pieces we have to piece together. So if we look, for example, to fine fragrance, we can say it was a good Christmas season, so we basically saw good performance here, so we don't expect that we see a restocking effect here, so that's the first part of the business. We have a good project pipeline, particularly on the fragrance component side and also on the flavors side, so we see that this is good and very, very solid. In compounds fragrance, I would see it even over the average we have seen before. So that's good. On the flavors side, we see that projects are happening and we have projects that we have always executed by our customers, and it depends how, let's say, how much they are selling them of the product, especially on the category side. On the geographic side, what we see is US and Europe are actually pretty okay and coming back. We see a bit of a softness in particular in some of the emerging markets, like China, and we should not forget that if we look at our customers, in particular the big CPG customers, that the outlook for volume is relatively muted. The good thing is, we don't see this with all of our regional and local customers, and as you know our customer split is 50-50 with the big clients and the small ones. So bit of a long-winded answer, but they are really different pieces to be looked at for 2016. I hope that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. Just first following up on that, my sense is that the CPG customers, that at least over the last six months, I mean, their outlook certainly haven't improved, but I don't really feel like there's been that much change in their outlook in terms of global market growth or volume growth. Maybe that it's not getting better as quickly as they had hoped, but it certainly doesn't sound to me like it's worse. So, I'm wondering if you are also seeing end-market demand slow for those regional and local customers that the macro is now trickling into total market demand, not just a bit of the share shift that you had seen happening. So that was my first question. The second was on the decision to invest in the new China flavor facility. How does that tie into the existing manufacturing plant or I guess there's two, but the one where you had kind of the emissions issues this summer? If you can just give us a little more color on that, it would be great. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Let me start probably with the flavors plant first in China. We have made the decision that we will invest in the second plant. We plan to start groundbreaking at the end of the year and that will deliver us with, let's say, a backup plan for China for a market where we still believe we have to be present with a second plant for the volume. So that's actually on track. On our existing flavors plant, you know we had \u2013 earlier last year, we had the odor issue and we have salted so far on the flavors side, so that's working. We are back with our manufacturing. But having said all that, that has cost us some business over the course of 2015. Coming back to your first question, what we see is a deceleration of order patterns with our global customers and that's something which is certainly impacting the business. It depends certainly customer by customer and region by region, so we really have to go into more of a detail. But still for the smaller regional and local customers, it's \u2013 I would say the assessment stage that you have a couple of companies which have passed their growth here, and that's actually good for us because we do significant business with these customers as well. I hope that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Heidi Vesterinen : Hi, if you could go back to slide 10, please I wondered if there is any chance you could break out how much growth you lost from each of the headwinds that you've identified, just to get some color on what had the most impact please. Thank you. Michael Deveau : This is Mike, Heidi. So on slide \u2013 just to confirm, greater insight into Q4 2015 sales, okay. So we will address it that way, just from a deceleration perspective. I think, Alison, the question was about, in the bullet points we have here, kind of a standard value associated to each one of them to show part of the [indiscernible] in the quarter. Alison Cornell : I'd say from an attribution perspective, the 53rd week we said in the quarter accounts for a 200 basis point deterioration and of that, there's 600 basis points associated with the month of December. And then beyond that in terms of timing of order patterns, that's about I'd say one percentage point, and then I'd say the difference between the portfolio rationalization I'd say \u2013 China flavors is maybe 1.2 and then the difference is the portfolio rationalization. So those are the big chunks that we tried to outline. Operator : And your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning. So I have a couple of questions. The first question is, do you think you are losing share to some of your larger competitors? Because I know we talked about before how if you look at their organic growth, their definition is a little bit different than yours. But in talking to them, we've tried to quantify the difference and it seems like they are doing a lot better than you even on a two-year stacked basis in various sort of geographies and categories. And I'm particularly interested in China because they have been talking up China and telling investors that China is coming back and they are doing a lot better with the local regional players. So that indicates that you are losing share, so I just wonder if you can shed some light on that and if you are concerned about that. Andreas Fibig : Let me start and then hand over to Alison. Faiza, thank you for the question. First of all, we don't believe that we are losing share. In contrary, we believe that we win share. Particularly in some of the major categories, we are actually very, very strong. If we factor in the year-ago comparison, so for the year, and we believe actually that going forward that this trend will continue. In particular regarding China, we see a slowdown in the economy, but maybe Alison might comment on this one as well. Alison Cornell : So I'd say it's probably two pieces from China. We see a deceleration of orders and we think that initially had to do with our odor abatement issues that we experienced. But beyond that, our current pipeline is lower from a new brief perspective because we believe our clients are concerned a bit about not having a backup site in China and looked for alternative suppliers in the short term. We believe once we rectify that issue, there will be no issue from a volume perspective. I think beyond that, I wanted to add to Andreas' comment about giving on FX. Because the way that our clients or our competitors measure, they actually take the benefit of pricing in terms of their growth rate and so it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison as reported. So you need to essentially factor the results down by maybe one-third to have an apples-to-apples comparison. If you do that, you will see on a full-year basis we are in fact performing better than our competition. The other distinction I wanted to make was when commenting in terms of China and share and briefs, the comment is in particular to flavors and not fragrance because we are growing in the fragrance space in China. Operator : And your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Good morning. Michael DeVeau : Hi, John. Andreas Fibig : Hi. John Roberts : Do we have any other contingent payments from Ottens or Lucas Meyer ahead, and is Aromor now fully paid for? Alison Cornell : So to answer your question, no, there are no other contingent payments associated with any of that \u2013 any of our acquisitions and Aromor is fully paid for. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. I have a question about your current assets. Your sales growth year-over-year was down 5%, but your receivables are up 9% and your inventories are up 4%, 4% and 9%. Why is that? And does that mean you have to really produce a lot less in the first quarter to get your inventories back in line? Alison Cornell : So a couple things, so we had the impact of acquisitions. That was one item related to that. We had an increase in inventories \u2013 one associated with acquisitions, but also associated with the building of our Turkey and Indonesia plants where we ramped up over time and we expect to ramp that back down. And then from a receivables perspective, we also had an additional DSO increase associated with the extra week of sales that we had in 2014 versus 2015. So those are, I would say, the big three moving parts. Andreas Fibig : There were a couple of events, which will be not repeated in the current year, like the inventory from the acquisitions, for example. Alison Cornell : Right. Operator : You have a follow-up question from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Hi, John. John Roberts : Hi. That\u2019s okay. Fragrance ingredients seems like it's stepping down again here. Do you think it will decline further sequentially, or is it going to stabilize quickly and we go through four quarters of difficult comps and then maybe we'll start to see some growth after we anniversary the step-down? Andreas Fibig : A very, very good, good question, and we have a lot of, let's say, focus on our fragrance ingredients business here. First of all, let me say that it's around about 9% of our total sales and the majority of our production, so greater than 60%, is used for internal consumption, which is kind of a strategic vertical integration component of the fragrance compounds business. And the base fragrance ingredients business was negative and of course were largely related to the portfolio [indiscernible] by one \u2013 actually, our largest fragrance ingredients customers, and that will be not repeated. So, we don't expect another big step-down coming our way. Alison Cornell : Just to clarify, Q1 will continue to be challenged, and then you will see the lapse, if you will, that you spoke to in your question occur in Q2, and then we should be good from there. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks for the follow-up. I'm curious what underlying assumption is embedded in your sales growth outlook for the overall flavor and fragrance category for 2016. And then, just wanted to try to understand a bit on the progression as well. So I get it \u2013 October and November are better, December worse sequentially, but that was sort of before some of the global markets started to do what they've done over the last six weeks. So curious to what you're seeing from a quarter standpoint and maybe how you think about progression of sales growth through the year to get to your guidance. Andreas Fibig : Okay, Mark. Let me start with the first piece on the market growth. What we certainly see is the deceleration in the flavors market in general followed by 0.5% to 1%. The market on the fragrance side is kind of stable. That's what we see in the environment. And let me comment on the first, let's say, the first quarter of 2016 is we started actually off the month, January, well, growing low single digits, but this is month of January and we remain cautious in the first quarter as we are comparing to our very strong year-ago period where we had the growth of flavors 9% and fragrances of 5%. So we had an okay start, but, as we said before, we have to be very cautious because the volatility is very high at the moment. Alison Cornell : And to comment as well, we talked about changing order patterns from a client perspective. I'd say we are experiencing more volatile order patterns, and so our visibility is, I'd say, a bit lower than we've historically experienced. Operator : And we have a question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. If I could follow up, could you compare the pricing trends in the flavor business and the fragrance business? Sort of which pricing trend does better and which is worse, and just some rough idea of magnitudes. And then, secondly, the euro is now $1.13. So if the euro stayed at $1.13, how does that change your FX calculations for 2016? Alison Cornell : So, let me start with your second question\u2026 Jeff Zekauskas : Sure. Alison Cornell : \u2026 with the euro. We would see upside of a few million dollars in our forecast, based on an average rate of $1.05 for the year, and so it depends on how long the euro stays at $1.13 and really how it plays out across the year. But just assuming at this point it stays at that, it is a potential upside of a few million dollars. Going to your first question in terms of flavors versus fragrance, I would say fragrance from a pricing perspective is more pressured on the ingredients side, where flavors, I'd say, has more opportunity to increase. Operator : At this time, I will turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yeah, thank you very much for all the good questions, and I would like to close the call right now and wish you a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal the question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2016 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the full-year 2016. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 1, 2016 and our press release that we filed yesterday, all of which are on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Alison Cornell. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the first quarter. Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I'll ask Alison to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks and we'll finish by taking any questions that you may have. I'm pleased with how we started 2016. Given the volatile global operating environment and against our strong year-ago growth comparison, currency-neutral sales grew 6%, which was comprised of 5% growth in Flavors and 8% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top-line growth benefited by approximately 4 percentage points related to the contribution of our recent acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics. Our organic business, which had stronger performance than we anticipated, grew 2% on currency-neutral basis. The driver of out-performance can be attributed to improved volume trends versus what we have experienced in the fourth quarter 2015. In addition, we also benefited from an increased contribution of commercial performance, as new win growth was strong, particularly in fragrance compounds. On profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested and our business was simultaneously delivering 7% currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 20 basis points expansion in adjusted operating profit margin. The driver of our profit improvement was strong gross profit performance driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits of productivity initiatives, and contribution of acquisitions. Currency-neutral EPS improved 11%, as we gained additional leverage from a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding. With respect to Vision 2020, we continue to make progress each quarter. Differentiation through innovation is crucial to our success. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that one of our key R&D focus areas, delivery systems, continued to be a growth driver in the first quarter. In Fragrances, the strong trend from encapsulation-related sales continued as currency-neutral sales improved high-single-digit led by Fabric Care and Toiletries. In the first quarter, Fabric Care grew high-single-digits on a currency-neutral basis with all geographies posting strong growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high-single-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia. In Flavors, another key focus area for us is modulation, as sales of our sweetness & savory modulation portfolio continued to post strong growth, improving strong double-digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. This is further proof that our innovative solutions are allowing us to meet our customers' demand for healthier and better-for-you products. In the first quarter, we also commercialized two new flavor molecules and one new natural sweetness modulator to give our flavors more novel technologies to build winning solutions for our customers. We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership positions. In North America, we saw 11% currency-neutral increase for the first quarter 2016, driven by our recent acquisitions and strong growth in Fragrances. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrance improved mid-single-digits and Fine Fragrances grew double-digits, led by strong new win performance. Leveraging our longstanding presence and in-depth consumer knowledge, we are focused on the Middle East and Africa as a growth driver. In the first quarter, we achieved strong growth across both Flavors and Fragrances to deliver a double-digit improvement on a currency-neutral basis. The mid to high single-digit growth trends we have seen in recent years in Consumer Fragrances continued into the first quarter of 2016. Within that segment, Home Care, a strategic area of focus for us, grew mid-single-digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Latin America. In Flavors Latin America, we delivered 8% currency-neutral sales growth or 14% on a two-year average basis, based on our continued success leveraging innovation with key customers. We continue to position ourselves to be a customer's partner of choice and to-go supplier. In the first quarter, IFF | Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics won a Silver Innovation award at the In-Cosmetic Conference held in Paris for Miniporyl. For those of you who have not had a chance to experience this product, Miniporyl is an active ingredient which is extracted from a red clover flower and is a natural pore minimizer designed to rebalance skin conditions responsible for pore enlargement. Because of our continued commitment to sustainability and focus on weaving it into all aspects of our business and corporate culture, we were rated gold and ranked a top supplier by EcoVadis. EcoVadis aims at improving environmental and social practices of companies by leveraging the influence of global supply chains. During quarter one, we also joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which is an organization of forward-thinking companies that stimulate the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. We are excited to be part of an organization that works together across sectors, geographies and value chains to explore, develop and scale up business solutions to address the world's most pressing sustainability challenges. In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm happy to report that our two recent strategic acquisitions continue to perform well. IFF | Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a standalone basis and IFF | Ottens Flavors posted solid growth for the quarter on a standalone basis, led by regional customers. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities. Let me conclude by saying how pleased we are with the strategic progress we have made so far this year. We look forward to building on this momentum as we progress through the balance of the year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison. Alison A. Cornell: Thank you, Andreas. I would like to reiterate our strong financial performance for the first quarter. I am pleased that we were able to deliver sales growth of 6%, adjusted operating profit growth of 7%, and adjusted EPS growth of 11%, all on a currency-neutral basis. Our performance can be attributed to improved volume trends, which we believe includes the timing of orders from fourth quarter of 2015 to first quarter of 2016, and strong new win performance. I would also like to take an opportunity to provide commentary on our adjusted EBITDA, given M&A has become a larger component of our strategy and is a key indicator of comparison to our largest competitors. We continue to see profitability and margin progression as our adjusted EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior-year period, inclusive of currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a very strong 120 basis points, principally driven by volume leverage, the benefits of cost and productivity initiatives, and mixed benefits resulting from the inclusion of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and IFF | Ottens Flavors. Turning to business unit performance. Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 4%, primarily driven by approximately 4 percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF | Ottens Flavors. It is important to note that this growth was on top of strong 9% currency-neutral growth in the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was led by high-single-digit increases in North America, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF | Ottens Flavors, and Latin America, reflecting double-digit growth in Savory, Sweet and Dairy. Greater Asia posted low-single-digit growth, as increases in India and Thailand were more than offset by softness in China, although trends in China improved sequentially. Within Greater Asia and on a category perspective, growth was driven by new win performance, particularly with relative strength in Dairy and Sweet. Europe, Africa and the Middle East decreased 1% against 9% growth from the comparable year-ago period, as softness in Western Europe more than offset a strong, high-single-digit improvement in the Middle East and Africa. Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 1%, primarily resulting from the contribution of IFF | Ottens Flavors and strong benefits from productivity initiatives. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 8%, including approximately 4 percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics with all regions posting growth, led by a double-digit increase in North America and high-single-digit growth in Latin America. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 7% as a result of a very strong pipeline of new wins, led by North America which achieved strong double-digit growth followed by mid-single-digit growth in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and low-single-digit growth in Latin America. Consumer Fragrances grew 6% with broad-based growth across all sub-categories. Technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and Personal Wash contributed high-single-digit increases. Within Consumer Fragrances, on a geographic basis, all regions delivered growth, led by a double-digit increase in Latin America and a mid-single-digit increase in North America, both on a currency-neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 15% driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our base Fragrance Ingredients business, which as a reminder are the external sales that we do not use for our internal compounds production, remains soft, reflecting continued challenging market conditions as well as our prioritization of capacity to further strengthen our internal Fragrance Compounds business as evidenced by our mid-single-digit Fragrance Compounds growth. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency-neutral segment profit was very strong, growing about 15% year-over-year, driven by robust volume growth, the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives, and more favorable mix. This performance led to over 130-basis-point improvement in currency-neutral operating profit margin. Our operating cash flow in the first quarter was $32 million compared with $31 million in the prior-year period. Our core working capital levels were challenged, principally driven by the timing of payables. We expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016. From a capital structure standpoint, we spent approximately $23 million in expenditures, and continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As noted on our year-end call, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia, primarily related to a new Flavors manufacturing plant in China, which was disclosed on our Q4 conference call, and investments in technology expansions. With regard to China, I'd like to provide some additional commentary as it relates to our Fragrance Ingredients plants. We, as well as other chemical plants in the same industrial zone, received a request from the Chinese government to relocate our Fragrance Ingredients plant in Zhejiang. Currently, we are in discussions with the government regarding the intent, purpose and timing of the request of relocation. If we were ultimately required to move, our company and government authorities would need to agree upon the amount and nature of government compensation, including adequate timing and financial support. This is similar to a move required a few years ago when we worked in partnership with the Chinese government to relocate one of our Fragrance Ingredients plants from one industrial park to another over an extended period with minimal business impact. Please note that the relocation request is an evolving situation. We will continue to keep you updated. Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in Q1, we spent approximately $45 million on dividend payout and $40 million on share repurchases. Given these levels and our outlook for the rest of the year, we expect to meet our total payout ratio objective of 50% to 60% of adjusted net income. Looking to the balance of the year, we continue to believe we can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. While there are some indications that the global environment has marginally improved, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic with respect to achieving our previously-stated financial guidance for 2016, given the persistent volatility in the market. And it is still early in the year, and we believe that the first quarter 2016 partially benefited from timing of orders from Q4 of 2015 to Q1 of 2016. We do not think it is prudent to extrapolate results. In the second quarter, I'd like to remind everyone that we are comparing to a low effective tax rate in the prior-year period when we benefited from the timing of an R&D tax credit. That benefit is not expected to repeat itself again this year. As a reminder, for the full year 2016, we expect 3.5% to 4.5% currency-neutral sales growth, including approximately 1.5 percentage point of contribution from the acquisitions of IFF | Ottens Flavors and IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5 percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5%, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. Given the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, I would also like to address the impact of currency on our financial results. While our currency-neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our guidance to reflect the movement of the U.S. dollar to other world currencies since the beginning of the year. As I have discussed in the past, the euro is clearly the largest driver in terms of our currency basket, representing approximately 35% of our profit exposure. Previously, we expected the devaluation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar to represent approximately 4 percentage point out of our original 5 percentage point headwind to profit in 2016. Now, given the euro-USD exchange rate in Q1, the fact that we are hedged approximately 75% at $1.14 in 2016 and assuming a spot rate of $1.13, we expect about a 3 percentage point impact from the euro as our expected weighted average exchange rate for 2016 is $1.135 versus our average rate of $1.25 for 2015. The rest of the currencies within our basket have improved versus our original guidance and now are expected to effectively offset one another on a profitability basis. As such, we expect currency to have a 2-percentage-point impact on sales versus 2.5 percentage points previously assumed. We expect a 3 percentage point impact on operating profit and EPS should current rates remain constant for the balance of the year. The increased volatility in duration of the currency movement continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. We measure the impact of currency on various fronts, including translation and transaction impacts as well as timing effects associated with our supply chain and inventory movement. We recognize that there are potentially different approaches that can be used to measure this impact and that the methodology differs amongst our industry and peer group. We regularly review our methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight to our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how the business is run, or information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are in the process of our current review, we believe that if we were to adopt a different methodology, it would likely have a positive impact on our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth in 2016. With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Alison. In summary, I am pleased with how we started off the year. Financially, the entire organization collectively achieved strong results as evident by our 6% sales growth, 7% adjusted operating profit growth, and 11% adjusted EPS growth all on currency-neutral basis. As Alison just commented, we are on a pace and have increased confidence to achieve our previously stated currency-neutral financial guidance for 2016. Simultaneously, we continue to be focused on the execution of Vision 2020 as we believe our emphasis on building great differentiation and accelerating profitable growth will create incremental shareholder value over the long term. With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions. Operator : And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan. Mark S. Astrachan: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate the color on the benefit to first quarter results from the 4Q weakness in terms of some of the pull-forward or push-back. I guess, modeling-wise, is there anything we should be aware of that would impact the two-year stack in sort of thinking about how the second quarter trends would be shaping up? And if you don't want to specifically comment on that, how do we think about progression relative to 4Q/1Q levels through 2016, would be helpful. Alison A. Cornell: Thanks for the question, Mark. So, from a second quarter perspective, we do not plan to comment on second quarter. If we think about the fourth quarter, fourth quarter especially if we neutralize for the 53rd week was abnormally low. We did have relative strength in the first quarter, our volumes improved sequentially, we had strong commercial performance. But despite that, as you look at the relatively low performance in Q4 to Q1, we do think that it was impacted. So, with respect to Q2, we think it's too early to talk about it as we're only one month in and especially given the volatility in our customer order patterns. Having said that, though, we do expect growth to accelerate as we progress throughout the year and remain committed to our guidance. Mark S. Astrachan: Great. And just to follow up on that, if you look at the two-year CAGR average 4Q 2015 to 1Q 2016, it's somewhere in the high 2%s. So, I guess, the question is, A, that's relative to 2% to 3% that you've talked about for the year organically. But in that context, what does it say about the current end demand general in terms of what you see from a customer standpoint, maybe even specifically comment on global versus local/regional. You've talked about that dynamic in the past. And then, if you could tie it into the acceleration needed to get back to your long-term targets of 4% to 6%, will be helpful. Alison A. Cornell: So I think if we step back, coming into 2016, we noted that our organic business would be softer than our long-term targets overall given the macroeconomic conditions, customer order volatility, limited volume growth from our customers, as indicated. Having said that, if we bifurcate first half versus second half, we expect our growth to accelerate throughout the year as we exit our 2016 business based on additional access to new business, strong new win performance that we know that we already have that will manifest itself in the second half and also the benefits that we're seeing from our innovation, continued benefit. And so, feel good as we exit 2016, going into 2017 and believe that we are on target to deliver our long-term targets that we indicated. Mark S. Astrachan: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Great. Thank you. First, I was wondering if you could comment, though, overall on market growth trends. Throughout last year, acknowledging it was very choppy, there were points at which you felt that local customers were still kind of performing relatively well and their consumption was up versus the global. So, where do you think things sort of stand now in terms of market growth? Andreas Fibig : Lauren, This is Andreas. Thank you for the question and, unfortunately, we believe that the global environment is still pretty volatile and choppy, as you were saying, because we see in some areas of the world, we see actually very good growth trends. We just came back, Alison and myself, from the Middle East and Africa. We see good double-digit growth in the region despite the political unrest. We have other areas, for example in China, where we are seeing basically a slowdown in growth. So you see from the geographic point of view, it's very volatile at the moment and even in the U.S., it's not super consistent what we are seeing. On top of it, we see differences in between the different categories. Let me give you an example. If you look, for example, to modulation, our sweetness modulation, that's something which is certainly facilitating our growth, because we see more countries moving in towards sugar tags. UK just did it. South Africa is going to bring to do it. So that's something which is driving growth in the category. But in other categories, we don't see as much growth because it goes against it. So it's a very complex picture, and that's the reason why we say we really have to deal with that kind of volatility around the globe. So we believe that the market probably has a growth for Flavors and Fragrances between 2% and maybe 3%, but that's very much on the high end. On the active Cosmetics, we still see much higher, higher growth trends between, let's say, 5% and 6%. So it's a pretty difficult picture at the moment. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay. And then, if you could offer a little bit more color on North America Flavors performance, both excluding Ottens, organic still down as expected. But at what point do you think that turns? I believe there have been some big wins on sweetness modulation around this time last year, so maybe we are starting to lap tough comps. And then also on Ottens, I think the language in the deck changed, that previously you have been talking about that business growing double-digits and now it's sort of, quote, solid. So, anything that changed there would be helpful as well. Andreas Fibig : Let's talk about the organic business first. We believe it will change in the second half of the year, so that's very, very clear. And Ottens is still performing, let's say, above our business case, and we have actually pretty tough comps here as well on the Ottens business. And what we have said before is that we see, in particular with the customer base we have with this business, a higher growth rate than with some of our more bigger and more established customers. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay. And then just one last one, if I may. Latin America was just very strong seemingly across the board. And in the press release, anyway, you didn't specifically mention Beverages. I believe that had been \u2013 the Beverage encapsulation had been a driver of the Flavors growth there. So if you can talk anything more specifically about what's driven Latin America to be so strong in obviously such a very tough macroeconomic environment would be great. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Absolutely. So we still see it in the Beverage category for us on the Flavors side, and we're actually pretty proud, because it looks like this category in particular is a certain delivery system for powders. It's helping us because it facilitates growth in a population category, which is lower middle class and lower income, which is really helping us to drive our growth there. And we see it basically on the modulation as well. And here again, the scene comes back. I just touched on it with the sweetness modulation. So, replacement of sugar and helping with sweetness modulation is something which is a big trend and which helps us with our sales in that category. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay. Thanks so much. Andreas Fibig : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Michael J. Sison: Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. Any thoughts on when you think Flavors can sort of turn the corner in total for currency-neutral sales growth this year, excluding acquisitions? Andreas Fibig : It's second half, very, very clearly. Michael J. Sison: And back to the kind of normal growth rates we've seen historically, and what's driving that? Andreas Fibig : I would say normal growth rate depends on how you define the normal, because what we are seeing is a bit of a slowdown in market, and I think that's what you hear from many of our competitors as well. The new normal might be, let's say, 2.5% market growth and we believe that we can outperform the market. But the question is how much it is at the end. And we see certainly a softer trend in greater Asia, which is certainly driven by China, because remember, we had for many years, we had high double-digit growth rates in China. And these times might be over. And Western Europe is certainly also not a super bright spot here. So we are probably back to the new normal. Michael J. Sison: Okay. Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Acquisitions seem to have worked out well for you this year and just in general. How is the environment, particularly in the Cosmetics active? That seems to be an area where there could be a lot of opportunity to buy attractive assets. Andreas Fibig : Yeah. So, first of all, we are very happy with the two acquisitions we did last year because they are performing very, very, very well and driving revenue growth. So when we look at M&A in general, we look what could provide technology to us, because we really believe that differentiation comes through technology and through innovation. So that's something. We really look whether it could provide us access to customers and regions where we are right now not very well representatives. And we're certainly looking at adjacencies. And you just mentioned the active Cosmetics, and that's certainly one of the areas where we ventured in and where we want to build our position, first of all, through high organic \u2013 double-digit organic growth, but through some more M&A activities here as well. We are certainly screening the market as usually and we are conducting due diligence on a number of potential opportunities and, if it makes good sense, like last year, we are moving forward. And we certainly have a good financial discipline, but Alison might comment on that one. Alison A. Cornell: Yeah. So in addition to the strategic filters that Andreas went through, we also have a series of financial filters, one being EPS-accretive year one, and then economic profit positive in years three to five. So to the extent it meets the strategic filters and the financial filters, we would potentially move forward. But we do those things in tandem. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Michael J. Sison: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Hi. Good morning. Andreas Fibig : Good morning, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : I just wanted to talk about your trends to-date relative to what your guidance was three months ago. So, clearly you have exceeded your plan for the first quarter. So, maybe if you could just go through what were the specific areas, whether it's countries or categories where you exceeded your expectations for the first quarter. So what was surprising to you on the upside? Alison A. Cornell: So I think Fragrances clearly did well across all regions, all categories, all geographies. From a Flavors perspective, we had strength in Sweet, Savory, Dairy, but we had volume strength, volume leverage. Along with that from a bottom line perspective, we also had cost productivity initiatives that benefited us. We also had net price to input costs favorability. And so \u2013 but I think the main driver of our strength in the first quarter was clearly Fragrances. Faiza Alwy : What do you think... Alison A. Cornell: In consumer. Faiza Alwy : Okay. What do you think drove that strength? Do you think it was more -was there a recovery? Just the impact going from Q4 2015 to 1Q 2016 was just more than you had expected? Or was there something sort of underlying in the market that drove that upside? Alison A. Cornell: Yes. So I think it's a number of things, so one item being the shift between \u2013 of course, possibly timing between Q4 and Q1. Another is stronger commercial performance and so we had less erosion combined with stronger commercial new win performance that contributed to the overall strength in the quarter. Faiza Alwy : All right. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Hi. So you've been talking about how you report organic growth or currency-neutral growth differently from your peers, and I think this is what you are alluding to in Alison's last slide. If we were to adjust the 6% growth rate, in line with peers, do you know what that number might be? Alison A. Cornell: So, from an organic perspective, I mean, we don't have exact calculations, but I would double it. Heidi M. Vesterinen: So, 12%? Michael DeVeau : Organic. Alison A. Cornell: Organic. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Organic is double? Okay. So, 4%. Alison A. Cornell: Yes. Heidi M. Vesterinen: And then would you have the equivalent number for full-year 2015? Michael DeVeau : It's roughly 5%. This is Mike, Heidi. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. I apologize if this got asked earlier since I just jumped on the call late. But some of your major customers have been implementing zero-based budgeting. Do you need to go to something like that model as well? Alison A. Cornell: So, we as well are implementing a zero-based budgeting. We are in the early stages. We actually started \u2013 I would say we dipped our toe in the water last year as we did our 2016 budget, but are moving forward with that on a broader scale in 2016. Andreas Fibig : So basically for the budget, John, this is Andreas, for the budget 2017. John Roberts : And then could you remind us of the split in business between local/regional customers versus global customers in both the Flavors and Fragrance segments? And was the gap in performance between those kind of two categories several percentage points difference in growth or was it much smaller than that? Andreas Fibig : It is \u2013 actually the difference in growth, I start with the last one, is smaller because we have seen one or two of our big customers was really, really good and nice growth rates in the first quarter. The business is still split by 50 :50 roundabout for us between the two categories, local/regionals and global customers. And actually it's a split we really like, because as you well know, it's also the split in terms of emerging markets and mature market is 50 :50. Flavors, Fragrances, almost a 50 :50 relationship. That helps us in these volatile times actually to balance our business fairly well. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck : Good morning. Do you have a sense for what the size of your sweetener modulation business is by now? Is it like in the tens of millions or is it larger than that? Michael DeVeau : Silke, this is Mike. Let us come back to you on that. Traditionally, the way we have to go back on our systems to kind of proportionately allocate it to determine what the actual size is. We talked about our encapsulation size on our CAGNY Conference when we were in CAGNY this past February. But on the modulation, we have to dimensionalize in terms of size. Let us come back for that one. Andreas Fibig : Yeah. Silke Kueck : Okay. And secondly, I was wondering if you knew how much favorable price cost contribution was to your gross margin. Alison A. Cornell: So, from a net price input, it was very small. About 10 basis points. Michael DeVeau : Yeah. Silke Kueck : And my last question is, is the Lucas Meyer acquisition, does that contribute anything to EPS growth in the quarter? Or will it this year? Alison A. Cornell: Yes. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Michael DeVeau : It's accretive Alison A. Cornell: Yes. It's accretive. Silke Kueck : Yes. Okay. Thanks very much. Alison A. Cornell: Sure. Andreas Fibig : You're welcome. Operator : And your next question is a follow-up with Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Thanks. Glad I got back in. So I did have a quick question about vanillin. I know that the relationship with Evolva is changing. I believe they're kind of taking that back and the commercialization didn't really go maybe as well as planned. It'd be great if you could just articulate why. What are kind of the learnings from that experience, particularly as vanilla was cited as an area of potential cost inflation this year? That'd be just really interesting to learn about. Thanks. Andreas Fibig : So we're taking the vanillin from Evolva for our own internal consumption, so not so much to sell it externally. And you are right; the vanilla prices are pretty high. We will see how the price trend will go on over time, but I can't make projections right now. I think for the rest the year, we should be fine because we think we have everything in stock we need, we are covered. But for 2017, we will see how the price trend moves on, but it's hard to predict right now. Lauren Rae Lieberman : And was the expectation that this was going to be \u2013 I mean, what changed I guess in the expectation that this was going to be a product you could commercialize more broadly externally than is proving to be the case? Andreas Fibig : It depends actually, Lauren, on the price because whenever we do \u2013 in this industry, when you do something in the biotech space, you try to get, let's say, stable supply to a certain price. And if the raw material is not any longer \u2013 let's say you can't buy enough, then the biotech version kicks in or if the price really goes through the roof and you have a good manufacturing price in place. And that's what helps us to balance these kind of movements. So as soon as if the price would go up even further, then there might be an opportunity to commercialize that, but that's not the case at the moment. So for us, basically it's a supply backup solution. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay, all right. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : You're welcome. Operator : And your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Hi. So Symrise's CEO was talking on an interview recently that the M&A multiples are far too high and they're choosing to focus on CapEx. Are you still confident on your guidance of CapEx to sales falling through to 2020? I wondered if you don't find any accretive deals, is there scope to develop new technologies or even enter adjacencies organically or do you actually need to acquire to get into these new segments. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Yeah. Thank you, Heidi, for the question. I certainly can't comment on Heinz-J\u00fcrgen's comments here. But what is clear for us is that in the last couple of years we have invested a lot in CapEx. You know we have built new manufacturing plants in Indonesia, in Turkey, in China, and that helped us a lot. On our agenda, as you well know, we have still India and a second plant in China, but that's basically built into our plan for the coming years. So we believe we might spend between 4.5% and 5% for the next two years, maybe three years on CapEx and then CapEx will go down to more of the maintenance level of 3.5 percentage points. So nothing has changed on our side. In terms of the valuation of M&A targets, I agree they're usually high, but they were high last year as well and we are very happy with the two acquisitions we have done. So I think it always depends what kind of targets you find and for what kind of price you can close and what kind of strategy you apply then afterwards to make the business grow. So I would be more optimistic that you still can find good targets, and you know we are not doing anything outrageous here. We really want to make sure that we are financially very disciplined with what we acquire. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Thank you. Operator : And you have a question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan: Thanks for the follow-up, all. Two questions unrelated. One, could you talk about the price-cost relationship over the balance of the year in terms of what anticipated benefit you might get from pricing versus what potentially happens from an input cost standpoint? And then secondly on China, following up on the question, I guess the last question, CapEx-wise. So there's been a bunch of moving parts even since last June's Investor Day about goings on in China. How much is incremental in terms of what the CapEx spend is going to be for potentially one, two new facilities? What's your current capacity utilization in that market? And how do you think about it when the dust settles in terms of what the ultimate number of facilities will be relative to what your needs are and relative to your competitors from a positioning standpoint? Andreas Fibig : Maybe I'll start with a very macro picture on China. First of all, what you see in China is nothing very specific to IFF. You have seen it through basically all of our competitors and many of our customers and other companies. So it seems to be the way you have to operate in China. That's number one. Number two is that we have made a decision that whatever we do in China was exceptional of our Ingredients plant for Fragrances, everything is for the local demand. We are not going to export out of China. So we do basically our manufacturing in China. I think that's important to know as well. It's not a big, let's say, export hub for us. And now, Alison can talk about the financials. Alison A. Cornell: Okay. So you asked about incremental CapEx associated with China, at this point, it's $45 million that we've assumed. From a capacity utilization perspective, it's about 50%. But we're considering the second site as more of a contingency or backup site. So that's essentially how we're using it as needed. Your first question in terms of price-cost input, we expect it to be favorable for the remainder of the year. Mark S. Astrachan: Okay. Thanks, guys. Alison A. Cornell: Thanks. Operator : At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Yeah. Thank you very much for all of the questions. And in summary, I would say we are on track for the year and we are on track for Vision 2020. Thank you again and talk to you soon. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2016 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly (1:10) for the second half and full year 2016. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 1, 2016 and our press release that we filed yesterday, all of which are available on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and is also on our website. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Alison Cornell. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview as usual of our operational performance for the second quarter. Then I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, Alison will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then I will provide some concluding remarks and we will finish by taking any questions that you may have. I'm pleased to report that all our key financial metrics for quarter two came in as we anticipated with currency-neutral sales improving 4%, comprising 3% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately two percentage points related to the contribution of our acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our organic business grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis driven by new wins across both businesses. From a profitability perspective, we strategically reinvested in our business, while simultaneously delivering 7% currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth and a 70 basis points expansion and adjusted operating profit margin. This was driven primarily by volume growth, the benefits associated with our cost and productivity initiatives, and the contribution of acquisitions. Currency-neutral EPS improved 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Turning our attention now to Vision 2020, as we celebrate the first anniversary of its launch, this is a perfect time to review the progress we have made thus far. We are pleased with the performance we have made relative to our strategic priorities and remain focused on execution to drive long-term growth. Since inception, we have seen strong currency-neutral sales growth across all our key platforms, including modulation, encapsulation, delivery systems, and naturals; proof that we're executing our plan and delivering what we believe is industry-leading innovation to our customers. With that in mind, I'm happy to report that delivery systems across both Flavors and Fragrances continued to drive growth in the second quarter. In Flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit currency-neutral growth, led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales also continued its strong trend of growth, improving double digits in a currency-neutral base, led by Fabric Care and Personal Wash. In the second quarter, we also launched a new flavor modulator and a new natural flavor molecule to continue to give our flavors a superior pallet to work from to ensure we continue to build winning solutions for our customers. We also set a new benchmark for fragrance sustainability with the release of the first-ever Cradle to Cradle Certified fragrance, PuraVita, a fragrance which has noted (sic) [notes] of green apple, wood, apricot and vanilla, is a proof of concept for an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved when perfumers pair creativity with sustainable design principles. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, we are continuing to see accelerated growth. In North America, we saw 5% currency-neutral increase for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the contribution of our acquisitions. Within North America Fragrances, Consumer Fragrances improved high single digits, led by solid new win performance. Strong growth trends in the Middle East and Africa continued through second quarter, as currency-neutral sales improved mid-single digits with strong growth coming from Flavors. Another strategic area for us, Home Care, grew mid-single digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in North America and EAME. We continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go-to supplier. In the second quarter, we launched an enhanced sustainability strategy focused on leading positive transformational changes toward a regenerative, healthy and abundant world. As an enabler of IFF's Vision 2020 business strategy, creating a sustainable future is essential to IFF's long-term growth. As such, our new sustainability strategy's centered on three main aspects; Positive Principles, Regenerative Products and Sensational People. Through this strategy, IFF is committed to engage its people and partners to ask what if, and to tackle complex challenges by reimagining what is possible when sustainability, innovation and passion combine. We also achieved core list status with key customers in the second quarter. With this core list status, we are the one and only core supplier with 100% briefing access. This is a great accomplishment as it is a clear key competitive advantage, helping to drive future growth in the years to come. We're also happy to announce that we have partnered with Unilever to improve the lives of vetiver farming communities in Haiti. The partnership, Vetiver Together, aims to sustainably improve food security, increase yields, and diversify income, while working to support women's empowerment and our environmental conservation. Haiti produces some of the best vetiver in the world and many farmers rely on cultivating of the root for their entire source of income. But, due to the economic pressures, farmers often harvest the roots before they are fully mature, leading to low prices, poor oil yields, deforestation and soil erosion. The partnership will help farmers address these challenges as well as provide training to community members, including in crop and livestock production, soil conservation and nutrition to help improve social conditions and diversity of farm production and food security. Finally, in quarter two, we also deployed the industry-first onsite wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility. The turbine, which has an output of 2.4 MW, will produce the clean energy equivalent of what is needed to power 1900 households. It is estimated to provide up to 30% of the site's electricity needs and when combined with purchased green electricity, the facility will be powered by 100% renewable electricity. In line with our focus on strengthening and expanding our portfolio, I'm pleased to report that our two recent strategic acquisitions continue to perform well. IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics achieved double-digit growth on a standalone basis and IFF-Ottens Flavors continued its solid growth trend. We believe these results are good indications that we are putting our capital to work to drive accelerated performance both in terms of growth and return. Following the end of the second quarter, we also announced that IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra, a Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory, highly specialized in the development of active cosmetics and botanical extracts. This investment expands IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable sourced extracts from the Boreal Forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Alison. Alison A. Cornell: Thank you, Andreas. Our financial results for the second quarter remained solid and were consistent with our expectation. Currency-neutral sales improved 4%, including approximately two percentage points relating to the acquisition of IFF-Ottens flavors and IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both businesses. If we include foreign exchange-related pricing in our Q2 growth rate, our currency-neutral sales would have increased approximately 6% and on a two-year basis, would have increased 7%, which is ahead of our competitors. Adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis grew 7%, as we achieved gross margin expansion that when combined with volume growth benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions translates to a 50-basis point improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit margin. Currency-neutral adjusted EPS improved by 5% as lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our repurchase program were offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. As we are now at the midpoint of 2016, I thought it would be appropriate to highlight our first half results as well. Our currency-neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 5% with 4% growth in Flavors and 6% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong sales growth, benefits of our productivity program and contributions from acquisitions. The net result was positive as our currency-neutral adjusted EPS increased 8% in the first half of 2016. Turning to business unit performance for the second quarter, Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 3%, including approximately one percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF-Ottens Flavors. All categories experienced broad-based growth with the strongest growth in Savory and Dairy. From a region perspective, growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in North America, Europe, Africa and Middle East, and Greater Asia. North America increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis, inclusive of our acquisition of IFF-Ottens Flavors. Europe, Africa and the Middle East increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Dairy and Beverage. Africa and the Middle East continued to outgrow Western Europe, improving approximately 7% in the second quarter. Greater Asia posted 6% currency-neutral growth, led by strong growth in Indonesia, India, and ASEAN. On a category basis, we achieved double-digit growth in Sweet and mid-single-digit growth in Savory. Growth in Latin America in the second quarter was disappointing, decreasing 7% on a currency-neutral basis, based on a strong 14% currency-neutral prior year comparable growth rate. From a country perspective, Mexico grew strong double digits on a currency-neutral basis, however, was offset by challenges related to customers reducing their inventory positions due to the softening of import restrictions in Argentina. Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 9%, primarily resulting from volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives. Segment profit margin also expanded 120 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. Fragrances currency-neutral sales improved 5%, including approximately three percentage points associated with the acquisition of IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, led by a double-digit increase in Greater Asia, high single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances decreased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, as strong double-digit growth in Latin America was offset by softness in North America and Europe, Africa and the Middle East, where new wins did not compensate for erosion of existing business. The growth trend in Consumer Fragrances continued, improving 4% on a currency-neutral basis driven by broad-based growth across all subcategories, led by a double-digit increase in Personal Wash, strong contributions from technology-driven innovation in Fabric Care and mid-single-digit growth in Home Care. On a geographic basis, in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by double-digit increase in Greater Asia and high single-digit growth in North America, both on a currency-neutral basis. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 14% driven primarily by the acquisition of IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As expected, trends in our organic Fragrance Ingredients business remain challenged and should improve in the second half of the year. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency-neutral segment profit increased 7% year-over-year resulting from volume growth, benefits from cost and productivity initiatives and the benefits of the acquisition of IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. As a result, currency-neutral operating profit margin improved 40 basis points. From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow in the first half was $155 million, compared with $166 million in the prior year period. This change was driven by our core working capital levels being challenged, principally by the timing of payables within our year-over-year period. As communicated previously, we still expect this impact to normalize as we progress throughout 2016. From a capital deployment perspective, capital expenditures through the first half totaled $43 million or 2.7% of sales and we continue to believe we will spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase will principally be driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansion. Switching gears to cash return to shareholders. In the first half, we spent approximately $89 million on dividend payouts and $72 million on share repurchases. Last week, our board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.64 per share of the company's common stock, an increase of 15%, to bring our dividend yield to around 2%. This marks the sixth consecutive year that the board approved a double-digit increase in our dividend. This increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in IFF's long-term growth prospects and commitment to returning 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders. With the first half of 2016 now behind us, we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. We are reiterating our previously stated currency-neutral financial guidance for 2016 of 3.5% to 4.5% currency-neutral sales growth, including approximately a 1.5-percentage point contribution from the acquisition of IFF-Ottens Flavors and IFF-Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From an adjusted operating profit perspective, we expect to achieve 5% to 7% growth, inclusive of a 1.5-percentage point contribution from M&A. Currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5% to 8.5% supported by a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of our share repurchase program. In terms of modeling the second half, please note that our fourth quarter and 2016 growth rate is expected to be the strongest, given our more favorable comparable to prior year period. In addition, we also expect currency-neutral operating profit to grow less than sales rate, given the timing of some of our planned reinvestments. While our currency-neutral guidance has not changed, we have updated our EPS guidance to reflect the FX gain we benefited from in the second quarter. The net result is that the impact of currency on sales and profit remains the same, at two points and three points, respectively, and the impact on EPS is lower by approximately one percentage point. At this point in time, we are hedged approximately 80% on our euro profit exposure at $1.14 in 2016 and hedged at approximately 40% of our 2017 exposure at $1.13. As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we said we were reviewing our currency-neutral methodology to determine if either a more refined or simpler approach is warranted, in order to ensure that we provide investors increased insight into our underlying operating performance, greater alignment with how our business is run and information that is more usable for comparison purposes. While we are still reviewing our current methodology, any changes determined will not be implemented until the beginning of 2017 since our employees' in-year compensation is linked to our current methodology. With that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : In summary, I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half of 2016 from a financial and strategic standpoint. Despite the volatile global operating environment, we are on pace to achieve our previously stated currency-neutral guidance for 2016. Simultaneously, we continue to be focused on the execution of Vision 2020, which is geared towards accelerating our growth and increasing differentiation, which in turn should lead to sustainable, profitable growth. With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions. Operator : And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks and morning, everybody. Wanted to ask about sales growth. So you're still guiding to growth for 2016 below long-term targets, so want to understand how the business is performing relative to the going-in beginning of the year plan. And then more broadly, want to understand how we should think about returning to 4% to 6% long-term sales growth targets. Is that predicated on improving end demand, IFF specific share gains, acquisitions, et cetera? Andreas Fibig : Okay, Mark, thank you for the first question. Let me talk about 2016 first. And it's true that the performance first half of the year was a good \u2013 actually a very good growth rate and a great performance. But we have all witnessed that there's great macroeconomic and political volatility over the course of the year. And we will see it in some of our geographies which are important for us. We will have elections in the U.S. We have seen the Brexit. And we have seen other events like Turkey for example, where we have to be cautious. And that's the reason why we reiterate our guidance and we believe we are on track to make it. But the volatility is certainly unprecedented. Talking about 2017, I can't talk in detail about 2017. I believe that needs some more time because we have first of all to finish 2016. But we will return and we are optimistic to return to our long-term guidance because what we see is actually a couple of things. First of all, we have an unprecedented pipeline strengths in terms of new molecules for Fragrances, for example. We see great progress in some of our other R&D platforms like modulation and naturals. And that will help us to gain share going forward. And that's the reason which makes me cautiously optimistic for the years to come. Mark Astrachan : Great. And then just following up, another question, want to ask about M&A and sort of how the company is thinking about bolt-on versus larger scale deals. There's clearly a little bit more cash on the balance sheet than there has been in recent years. I don't know if that really means anything, but just sort of broadly you've done a couple of bolt-on deals. So is that still the path or do you think now learning's from that allow for larger scale? Andreas Fibig : Mark, as you know, many of these deals are, let's say, opportunistic at the very end because you never know whether you'll get the asset you want. But I can reassure you that our M&A pipeline so far is pretty well filled. We have made great progress in identifying the right targets. And it might be a mix going forward in terms of bolt-ons and more bigger acquisition and we certainly as you have alluded have the fire power to do these kind of deals. So we are on a path and the good thing is the year's not closed. Mark Astrachan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Thanks so much. Good morning. Andreas Fibig : Good morning. Lauren Rae Lieberman : I want to talk first about the North America Flavors. It looks like the organic was up a little bit and it seems like probably an acceleration coming next quarter. Can you just talk about what's sort of driving the improvement you're starting to see in North America Flavors? Andreas Fibig : I'll probably take it. Lauren, first of all, it's Andreas, great question. In North America, we have actually seen good movements in some of the smaller accounts we are having. That's the reason why our IFF-Ottens has actually very, very good performance here. But we see a recovering of some of our bigger accounts as well. We have a better win rate. And we are cautiously optimistic for North America. But we have to take into consideration that the North America market as a market is not a high growth market. So we always have to take this into perspective. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay. And then also on Asia, I was actually surprised to see Asia both Flavor and Consumer Fragrances being so strong, both because of the macro in the region and usually kind of looking at your trend as a little bit of a leading indicator of where your customers expect sales trends to go and also knowing some of the manufacturing challenges you were dealing within China. So if you could talk about I guess market growth and also some of the manufacturing things in China, that would be great. Alison A. Cornell: So, Lauren, it's Alison. So, first, while we had continued challenges in China, what we saw was growth in Indonesia, India, across Greater Asia. And that was a function of our technology, our delivery, so encapsulation, our delivery systems, very strong pipeline, strong win rate and so all those things are combining to deliver a strong performance despite our challenge in China. As we talked about China previously, we have taken corrective steps in China in terms of the odor-abatement issue as well as announcing our second factory in China. We've also modified our commercial strategy that we're targeting I'd say higher growing categories. As you know, in order to commercialize things in this space, it takes time. So, fortunately in the interim, we're experiencing strength in the other areas in \u2013 or the other geographic places across Greater Asia. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay. So, that's great. So, in China, this \u2013 sorry \u2013 excuse me, in Asia, the strength wasn't even yet showing that China's starting to come back for you other than any kind of recapture of some of the lost business? Alison A. Cornell: Exactly. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Okay. That's great. Thank you so much. Alison A. Cornell: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck from JPMorgan. Silke Kueck : Good morning. This is Silke Kueck for Jeff Zekauskas. How are you? Alison A. Cornell: Great. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : We're very well, Silke. Silke Kueck : I was wondering whether you can shed a little bit of light on the gross margin expansion in the quarter, like what was the benefit from favorable buys over costs, were there any hedging gains due to productivity improvements? Alison A. Cornell: Yes, so there were, I'll say, several benefits. So we had first, starting with volume, so that was about 120 basis points. So it's cost productivity initiatives, another 120 basis points, and that was offset by other items like unfavorable price to input costs, higher incentive compensation, higher RSA and then slightly negative mix, but the biggest drivers from the favorability, volume and cost. Silke Kueck : As you think about the back half of the year, do you think a 46% (29:00) gross margin is something that's sustainable? Alison A. Cornell: Yes. There or thereabouts. Silke Kueck : Okay. Alison A. Cornell: Yes, what you'll see, though, is it will be somewhat weaker in Q3 and that's relative to the timing of our cash flow hedge and then stronger in Q4. Silke Kueck : In terms of the SG&A line, so the SG&A grew 7.5% on sales that were up 3%. And can you discuss what was due to the strategic investments and how much was due to the acquisitions and maybe higher amortization expense? Alison A. Cornell: Sure. So let me start with amortization expenses. So amortization expense in the quarter was $3.3 million. From a strategic investment perspective, that was $4.5 million or call it, three percentage points of growth. That splits $700,000 in Fragrances, $600,000 in Flavors, and then we had $3.2 million that's associated with cost and productivity initiatives. All of those initiatives are in line with our Vision 2020 strategy. Silke Kueck : And what do you think the level of investment of strategic investments will be for the second half, like it sounds like that that level of spending is going up, if I understood it right? Alison A. Cornell: I would say it's consistent with the run rate, if not slightly higher. Again, what you'll see is in Q3 the timing of our \u2013 you'll see greater spending in Q3 associated with strategic initiatives and that's really just due to the timing of the projects versus Q4. So at a macro level, it's consistent with run rate but it does have a quarterly spread. Silke Kueck : And so when you look at your operating margin as a whole for the third quarter, do you think the margins would expand or would it be more flattish due to the timing of the investments? Alison A. Cornell: I would say they'd be flat in the third quarter and improved in the fourth quarter. Silke Kueck : And then my last question, I was wondering what your expectation is as for the new flavor modulator that you launched. If you look at it over like, I don't know, like a one-year period or a three-year period or a five-year period, like how big of a market is there for that product and what do you think \u2013 what revenues do you expect over time on it? Andreas Fibig : Silke, it's very early times for the new modulator, and we can't give you any specific guidance on that one. But we might come back when we see more, let's say, in-market sales here. Silke Kueck : Do you have a hope of what you may achieve? Andreas Fibig : We have always great hopes, but I can't give you anything in specific here. Silke Kueck : Okay. Andreas Fibig : I'm sorry. Silke Kueck : And thanks very much. I'll get back into the queue. Andreas Fibig : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. Heidi M. Vesterinen: Hi, I wanted to ask about LatAm. Was the weakness just in Argentina or are you seeing weakness in other countries as well because we're hearing from some customers that Brazil is getting quite bad and potentially worse in the second half. Perhaps you could talk us through trends that you're seeing in the key countries you're exposed to in LatAm, please. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Heidi, thank you for the question. It was basically Argentina for us which was really bad, and here I would say my interpretation is that there's a lot of changes in the policies as well in import and export and we will see how that straightens out over the course of the year. Actually on Brazil, in terms of the Fine Fragrances business, it was doing very, very well. So we can't see the weakness here. And we have another hope that we'll see Olympic Games probably using \u2013 people are using some more personal wash, but you never know. I'm sorry. Heidi M. Vesterinen: That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison: Hey, good morning and nice quarter there. Andreas, interesting, every time I see a commercial these days they talk about reformulating into naturals, both fast food and some of your consumer products companies. Can you sort of walk us through how this movement to more natural ingredients continues to impact your business, and do you think it potentially accelerates over the next couple of years? Andreas Fibig : Actually our planning or our belief is that we might see even more of an acceleration. We get already on the Flavors side more than 50% of all briefs (33:45) on naturals or organic. And so this is a clear trend, and I think it goes with the trend of health and wellness as well. So that this is basically the ask from the consumer. That's what we see in our consumer surveys as well. So that will be something which will stay strong over time. And here what we see, particularly also on the modulators, and you know we do on savory, on sweetness modulations, they're basically all-natural right now in what we are doing. That's another indicator that this trend is probably here to stay. Okay, Mike? Michael J. Sison: Okay. Great. And then in cosmetic actives, I think every quarter you report it's double digits. So, can you help us understand maybe what's driving that? Is there some end market drivers there? And is that something that can continue for quite some time? Andreas Fibig : So first of all, the business we have acquired here had already in the past a very solid track record. But what we see right now for us is that first of all the whole market has a higher growth rate than our core market, with probably 4.5%, which is basically double, almost double what we see in our core market. And then we see that we come up with good solutions which are really needed by the customers, plus we find new customers as well because \u2013 and that was the idea of the acquisition, that we can open some doors for the active cosmetic sales teams to make sure that we introduce them to some of our clients we have already for many, many years. So that's a classic top line synergy we are playing here. Michael J. Sison: Okay. And then last one, in terms of your outlook for the second half of the year, if conditions kind of stay where they are now, would you be similar to the first half? Meaning that you kept your guidance despite doing better in the first half, you would need sort of a deterioration in the environment from here to be at the lower end? Andreas Fibig : Look, Mike, we reiterate guidance here. That's where we stay, because you never know how things are playing out. Michael J. Sison: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning. I was just wondering, Andreas, if you could give us some more background on \u2013 you talked about the new core list that you have gotten on recently that you weren't on before. If you could maybe give us some more background around that, sort of what led to that? Was it your technology? Was it customer relationships? Sort of just a little bit more on that. Andreas Fibig : Faiza, first of all, good morning. Unfortunately, I can't give you any more details on the core list. But it's a significant customer for us which is, I think, that's important to know, has a good volume. And what helped us here is certainly technology. So the technology we are providing to this specific customer has helped to gain access. The second one is certainly our, let's say, focus on the customer and being a partner of choice, as well to working with them very, very closely together in many, many areas, and that has helped us to gain access here. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Great. And then I just want to push a little bit more on Latin America because it sounds like you do have difficult comps going into the third quarter also, and I know we talked about it a little bit with respect to Argentina. But is there anything else? Is that expected to continue into the back half? And are you expecting a recovery there in the back half or do you expect trends to be similar to where they were this quarter? Alison A. Cornell: So, I think overall, we're going to see a slight recovery in the Flavors space, but from a Fragrance perspective, I'd say we remain cautious for the second half. Faiza Alwy : Okay, okay. And then just one last one, Alison, you have that great chart as part of the Q4 presentation where we talked about the profitability improvement in 2016 and you highlighted Vision 2020 investments were going to reduce operating profit by 3.5% and then fund the journey was going to help by 5% to 6%. I know you talked about where we are in terms of the investments. Can you talk about some of the savings that we've seen so far? Have those come through, or are those expected in the back half? Alison A. Cornell: Yes, so I would say, Faiza, that we're tracking with our plan, both on the investment side as well as the fund the journey, productivity cost savings initiatives and so those are in line with our plan. Faiza Alwy : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask, I'm not sure I understood just to be clear on your answer to Lauren's question, Alison, what would \u2013 that mid-single-digit growth in North America Flavors, I think the Ottens business is fairly heavy in North America. Could you just give us a sense what that would have been without the acquisition? Alison A. Cornell: Sure. So organically in the second quarter we were flat in North America. Having said that, through the second half of the year, our organic business by itself, excluding Ottens Flavors, improve, and that was based on the pipeline, strong wins and so forth through the second half of the year. Jonathan Feeney : Great. Thanks. And forgive me if you'd mentioned this before, but would the margin profile of Ottens Flavors be likely similar to your overall margin profile? Alison A. Cornell: Yes. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Jonathan Feeney : Okay. Great. And then I guess just one bigger picture question. The capabilities you build through Meyer and Ottens, I mean how much of this is specific to a set of customers and how much of this is building competitive advantage relative to the other big three global players? Do you feel as if this is a race and all these companies are sort of building your capabilities and you're positioning IFF to be stronger, or is this sort of \u2013 are these sub-niches that you're trying to maybe stake out while the other three, big three sort of stake out other niches? Andreas Fibig : No, actually if you look at the two acquisitions, quite a different approach. On the active cosmetic ingredients, we were looking at an adjacent business to our Fragrance business and we entered into this business because we believe that we have great top line synergies here in terms of the customer coverage and we are playing in the premium segment of that market, which gives us an extra profitability and certainly a good growth as well. So that's important to understand. That was the reason why we ventured into that business. On the Flavors side, different approach because as we said and probably many of our competitors are telling you that as well is, that you see some of the smaller, mid-sized companies with higher growth rates and we needed kind of a differentiated service model for that part of the market as well. And that was the reason that we acquired Ottens, to use it as a platform in that segment because this way usually customers who were not reaching out as much as we would like to have it, and now we have the platform, we're filling the platform and we are pretty happy with it. Jonathan Feeney : Okay. Great. Thank you very much, Andreas and Alison. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up on M&A, I mean, Andreas, you've talked about like the pipeline and opportunities that are available, so I was just trying to figure out like what's preventing you from closing on some of those deals? Is it just that those assets are very pricey, and you have to make sure they make sense financially or is it just a matter of time? Just wanted to figure out like what the opportunities are? Andreas Fibig : So, Edlain, it's actually more a matter of time because you really have to work through the pipeline. You have to figure out what is the real value of these assets and do they make sense from a strategic point of view. So we are certainly not, let's say, under pressure here to do it. We're really taking our time to look at these assets and then make the call at the time as time is ready to do it. Edlain Rodriguez : That makes sense. And one last one, you've highlighted the markets where you're doing well and in some of the markets where you're seeing weakness, Latin America and some other products in other places, like do you believe it's temporary? And if it's not, like are there steps you can take to address that to make sure it doesn't have like a significant impact on results going forward? Andreas Fibig : I actually believe in particular in the emerging markets it's temporary, because in the mid-term and long-term you will see still, let's say, very significant population growth and people are trending towards middle class, lower middle class. And these are all potential customers for our products. If you look at the numbers, for example Africa, Middle East is an area which is expanding double-digit for us and you will see a doubling of the population in Africa until 2050. So it will happen. We always see these kind of spikes or lambadas (44:10) going forward. And I'm actually very optimistic in a long way and said these will stay good growth areas for us. And the good thing was in IFF is as you might know is that we have 50% of all our business in the emerging markets and 50% individual markets and so that will help us when we see these markets returning to good growth here. Whether we will see like to see in a China again double-digit growth over years, I doubt it. But even if you see let's say 6% or 7% growth I think it's still a pretty significant one. Edlain Rodriguez : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : You have a follow-up question with Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. Andreas Fibig : Heidi? Heidi M. Vesterinen: Sorry, sorry about that. Could you tell us what the organic growth rate might be if you included LatAm currency effects like your peers do, please? Thank you. Michael DeVeau : Yes, Heidi, we don't have the specificity at this point. This is Mike. I can follow up with you offline. It will be significantly higher, because that's probably where the most concentrated effort would have been in terms of the differential in reporting differences respect to pricing late FX. Heidi M. Vesterinen: All right. Thank you. Alison A. Cornell: Thanks. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to speakers. Andreas Fibig : Thank you very much for all your questions. And have a great day. Thank you. Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas Operator : Now, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2016 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at ir.IFF.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 1, 2016 and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. As usually, we would like to start with an executive overview of our third quarter and year-to-date performance. Then, I will provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, Rich will review our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. And I will provide some concluding remarks and we will be finished by taking any questions that you may have. In the third quarter, currency neutral sales grew 3%, lead by an improved performance in Flavors. Thus, approximately 1 percentage point related to the acquisition of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Our top line performance continued to be driven by new wins across both business units, along with increased volumes in Fragrance ingredients. From a currency neutral operating profit perspective, we expected quarter's three performance to be muted, given the timing of planned investments. Yet, results came in softer than expected. This is largely attributed to lower than expected gross margin performance. Rich will provide more details in a moment. As a result, currency neutral adjusted EPS in quarter three was challenged. Despite the benefits from lower year-over-year shares outstanding due to our share repurchase program and a more favorable effective tax rate. On year-to-date basis, currency neutral sales growth for the first nine months of 2016 improved 4%, with 4% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. Currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 3%, driven by sales growth, benefits of our productivity initiatives and the contribution from acquisitions. It should be noted that this is inclusive of approximately 3 percentage points of planned strategic investments, as well as litigation and compliance-related cost made over the course of 2016. A proportion of this investment is intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the future. This, combined with lower shares outstanding and a more favorable effective tax rate, had had a positive effect on our currency-natural adjusted EPS, which increased 5% in the first nine months of 2016. Reviewing our progress against our Vision 2020, we continue to achieve strong results in the key areas that we've identified as strategic priorities for us : encapsulation, modulation, North America, Africa and the Middle East, to name a few. From innovating first perspective in flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit growth, currency neutral growth across all categories. In Fragrances, encapsulation-related sales of Personal Wash & Home Care improved strong double digits in a currency neutral basis, demonstrating that our technology is starting to gain traction in areas outside of Fabric Care. In the third quarter, we also launched four new flavor molecules in the key tonalities of citrus, onion and garlic to help our flavors continue to build consumer preferred products that perform in the marketplace. In Fragrances, building on our legacy of pioneering first, one of our Vision 2020 goals is to launch more new captive molecules to give our perfumers a competitive edge when creating the next great fragrance. Tracking this initiative, we have recently commercialized a new captive fragrance ingredient called Saffiano (6:14) to further drive differentiation. This particular fragrance ingredient is a strong rich natural leather with powdery soft sweet quality, providing a unique modern twist and is very additive to many fragrance creations. It enhances strength and increases both facets and fragrance accords by providing a very clean natural effect. The combination of the two molecules we have released so far this year, plus the two we expect to commercialize in the fourth quarter, puts us on track to double our annual fragrance molecule output average from two per year to four per year. In addition to this expansion, we have also adjusted our commercial fragrance ingredient strategy to release these types of captive molecules to the external market sooner to accelerate value creation. In the areas where we are targeting a market leadership position, our growth has accelerated. Our strong growth momentum in the Middle East and Africa continued in the third quarter, as currency neutral sales improved strong double-digit, with both businesses achieving very strong growth. In North America Fragrance, we saw 6% increase for the third quarter, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in Fabric Care. This was led by our encapsulation platform as we continue to leverage this technology to gain market share. Another strategic area for us is Home Care, where lower single digits on a currency neutral base, led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia. We also continued to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and go to supplier. Our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality of product allowed us to continue to capture the growth of both local and faster-growing regional accounts, with regionals outpacing global accounts. This should strengthen as our acquisition of Ottens Flavors and, more recently, David Michael and Fragrance Resources, the one we announced our intention to purchase last week, are all very strong from their regional customer bases. We are also collaborating with Delos and Mayo Clinic to be a part of their Well Living Lab, which is a new research facility dedicated to understanding the interaction between health and well-being in indoor environments through human-centered research. This world-class Living Lab leverages and expands upon the principles of the WELL Building Standard, which focuses on seven concepts relevant to indoor health : air, water, nourishment, light, fitness, comfort and mind. We are excited about the opportunity to leverage our expertise in scent to help improve the lives of individuals. In the third quarter, we also became the first flavor and fragrance company to join the World Economic Forum. As pioneers of the senses for more than 127 years, we embrace this unique opportunity to exchange ideas with other leading organizations who are interested in making positive lasting changes in society. This collaboration with the Forum aligns with IFF Vision 2020 strategy, which underscores how we are as a company, and businesses in general can innovate in the area of artistry, science, technology and sustainability to produce positive results for both business and society. I'm also proud to be elected to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Executive Committee. The WBCSD is a CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies that galvanizes the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. I'm extremely excited to represent IFF and about our journey as an organization to help leave the world a better place for generations to come. We continued our trend of strengthening and expanding our portfolio by accelerating our efforts in M&A with the addition of approximately $160 million in expected annualized sales from the acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, both of which complement our strategic vision well. I will speak in more detail about each of these acquisitions in a moment. I'm happy to report that IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics continues to perform well, achieving double-digit growth on a standalone basis. We believe their performance is a good indication that we are putting our capital towards long-term value-creating opportunities. Turning to our more recent acquisition announcements, David Michael is a privately held flavors company headquartered in Philadelphia. The company is well known in the industry for its vanilla expertise, strength in Dairy and Beverage categories, and the relationships with dynamic faster-growing middle market customers. David Michael complements our Ottens Flavors acquisitions from last year by strengthening our ability to serve the faster-growing mid-market customers in North America and solidifies our strong number one position in Flavors North America, a strategic priority for us. The deal, which closed on October 7, is expected to add approximately $85 million of sales in 2017 and expected to be EPS accretive in year one and economic profit breakeven between years three and year five. This bolt-on acquisition is another important milestone in IFF's Vision 2020, helping us win where we compete in the world's largest flavor market as we look to further accelerate growth. Late last week, we also entered into an agreement to acquire Fragrance Resources, a privately held family owned fragrance company, who for nearly 30 years, has distinguished itself by exceptional creative talent and quality service to faster-growing regional customers. This highly complementary bolt-on acquisition further will increase our penetration in Specialty Fragrances, a faster growing sub-category within Fine Fragrances, and is expected to strengthen our market share position with the regional customer base within the key markets of North America and Germany. Fragrance Resources is expected to add about $75 million of sales in 2017, and is also be EPS accretive in year one, and economic profit breakeven between year three and year five. Right now, we expect an early 2017 close. And we look forward to welcoming Fragrance Resources to IFF. The combination of both acquisitions is expected to contribute approximately 4.5 percentage points to our currency neutral sales growth in 2017. This, plus expected cost synergy benefits, will lead to greater financial performance in the years to come. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone on the call. Building on Andreas' commentary, sales growth on a currency neutral basis for Q3 came in as expected, growing 3%, with 3% growth in Flavors and 2% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top-line growth benefited from approximately 1 percentage point related to the contribution of our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquisition. On an organic basis, we grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, driven by new wins across both businesses. I want to provide you with greater insight with respect to our performance, including foreign exchange-related pricing for Q3. As a reminder, our industry indexes the majority of its pricing in emerging markets to movements in foreign exchange rates. For example, in Brazil, while actual invoicing is done in Brazilian real, the invoice amount is indexed back to hard currencies such as the euro or the U.S. dollar. On a predetermined basis, prices are adjusted up or down to reflect the underlying movements of currency and the product profile. When reporting, we exclude the indexation effect on local currency invoicing from our currency neutral sales growth calculation. This is different from our competition. In Q3, adjusting our currency neutral sales growth calculation to a basis similar to how our competition reports, our currently neutral sale growth would have increased to approximately 3% organically and 4% inclusive of the acquisition of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. On a two-year basis, to factor in the year-ago performance, organic-currency neutral sales would have increased to an average of 4.5%, which is ahead of our largest competitor by approximately 150 basis points. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit was down 4% year-over-year, principally due to year-over-year decline in gross margin, and I'll walk you through that in greater detail in a moment. We benefited from the lower year-over-year shares outstanding and a more favorable tax rate that helped offset the impact of our operating performance on a currency adjusted EPS basis. Looking at our Q3 currency neutral operating profit results, I want to provide more clarity on our performance drivers year-over-year. In the second bar, you'll see the contribution of our cost and productivity initiatives. Due to likes of formula optimization, indirect procurement savings, and manufacturing efficiencies in both compounds businesses, we delivered approximately 6 percentage point benefit, year-over-year to overall profitability. In the third bar, you can see that growth added approximately 5% to profitability. From a headwind perspective, there are several items that I need to elaborate on. In the fourth bar, RSA expenses represented approximately a 5 percentage point drag on operating profit. It should be noted that this includes approximately 3 percentage points related to planned investments that we mentioned earlier in the year, and another 1 percentage point in compliance and litigation-related costs. The strategic investments, while they challenge profitability in the short-term, are expected to yield P&L leverage in the years to come. The greatest gap to our previous guidance came in the form of weaker sales mix. Beverages, our highest margin category in Flavors, had limited growth in the quarter. While Savory, a less profitable category, performed very well, growing high single digits. On the Fragrance side, we experienced a similar dynamic, with Fine Fragrances, a strong margin category, declining year-over-year, while we experienced growth for the first time in approximately two years in our Fragrance Ingredients business, which is a less profitable category. Net-net, this led to an unfavorable sales mix, which represented a 3% drag to operating profit. In addition, we were also pressured by year-over-year manufacturing performance, principally related to manufacturing yields in our Fragrance Ingredient manufacturing network. Rounding out our performance, price and input costs and other miscellaneous items, including the year-over change in incentive compensation, were the remaining headwinds. Turning to our business unit performance for the third quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 3%, driven by mid-single-digit growth in Savory, Dairy and Sweet. From a regional perspective, growth was led by high single-digit increases in Latin America and mid-single digit growth in Greater Asia and Europe, Africa and the Middle East. North American results were challenged, reflecting low single-digit growth in Savory and Sweet that was offset by softness in Beverage. Europe, Africa and Middle East increased 5% on a currency neutral basis, as growth was led by new win performance, particularly in Savory and Sweet. Africa and the Middle East continue this impressive growth trend, improving strong double digits in the current third quarter. Greater Asia posted 5% currency neutral growth, led by strong growth in India, Asia, Indonesia and China, which returned to growth after several quarters of decline, partly due to the manufacturing odor issues that we saw in early 2015. We're happy to see that the business is stabilizing and returning to growth as the odor issue is behind us. On a category basis, within Greater Asia, we achieved double-digit growth in both Beverage and Dairy. Growth in Latin America rebounded, improving 7% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in both Brazil and Mexico. Flavors currency neutral segment profit was challenged, as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by weaker mix, unstable price to input costs and increases in RSA. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 2%, including approximately 1 percentage point associated with the acquisition of IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Growth was led by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances was challenged; on a currency neutral basis, as strong double-digit growth in Greater Asia and low single-digit growth in North America was more than offset by softness in Latin America and Western Europe. It should be noted that we believe that a part of our softness in Finer Fragrances can be attributed to a large fine fragrance customer, who is going through a portfolio transition via a divestiture. Consumer Fragrances grew 1% on a currency neutral basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care and Personal Wash. On a geographic basis in Consumer Fragrances, growth was led by a high single-digit increase in Greater Asia, and mid-single-digit growth in North America. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 8% on a currency neutral basis, driven by low single-digit growth on an organic basis, and the contribution of sales related to IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral sales profit declined, as volume growth and the benefits of cost and productivity were offset by weaker mix, unfavorable price and input costs, manufacturing performances and increases in RSA. From a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow improved 12% versus the same period in 2015. Our operating cash flow was 14% of sales, up from 12.8% in the first nine months of 2015. This change was driven by our core working capital levels improving versus year ago period, principally driven by improvements in accounts receivable. In terms of capital deployment, capital expenditures through the first nine months totaled $70 million, and we're on track to spend approximately 5% of sales in 2016. As previously noted, this increase were be principally driven by capacity projects in Greater Asia and investments in technology expansions. Switching gears to cash returned to shareholders, during the first nine months of 2016, we spent approximately $134 million on dividends and $94 million in share repurchases. This puts us on target to deliver on our commitment to return 50% to 60% of adjusted net income to our shareholders. As we finish up 2016, we expect business trends to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter. We expect stronger currency neutral top line growth in Q4 versus Q3, driven by improvements in both Flavors and Fragrances and the benefits of our acquisitions of David Michael. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that David Michael will add about 200 basis points to currency neutral sales growth in Q4, while providing limited benefits on an operating profit basis, given the increase in purchase price accounting impacts. From a currency neutral operating profit basis, growth is expected to strengthen in the fourth quarter. And while we do expect pressure on gross margins to continue given the sales mix dynamics we've discussed earlier, we believe that improvement in volume trends and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives will drive operating profit growth year-over-year as we compare to our largest year-over-year quarterly reset in incentive comp during the fourth quarter last year. The combination of this currency neutral operating profit performance, plus lower shares outstanding and some benefits in our effective tax rate, is expected to lead growth in currency neutral EPS also. Upon entering 2016, we expected challenging conditions, given the high level of economic uncertainty and a more cautious volume outlook of consumer packaged goods companies. As evident in today's marketplace, this is indeed the case, as volume consumption remains challenged across many end market categories and economic volatility and visibility in key markets around the world remains challenging. We acknowledge that we are slightly lowering the previous guidance we provided earlier this year. Nevertheless, the viability of our business remains strong and we expect to deliver growth across all of our key financial metrics on a currency neutral basis. For the full-year, we see currency neutral sales improving 4% to 5% versus 2015, with broad-based contributions from organic and inorganic business. Currency neutral operating profit is expected to grow 3.5% to 4.5%, in large part due to the benefits of cost and productivity improvements, increased volumes and the benefits of acquisitions. It should be noted inclusive in our guidance is approximately 3 percentage points of litigation and compliance-related costs, as well as planned strategic investments made over the course of 2016. As I mentioned earlier, these investments are intended to help drive improved productivity and greater P&L leverage in the years to come. From a currency neutral adjusted EPS perspective, we expect a modestly lower effective tax rate and the continuation of a share repurchase program to lead to 5% to 6% improvement on an EPS basis. In terms of foreign exchange, we have tweaked the impact of currency on our guidance, as it is slightly more favorable. On a sales basis, we expect currency to impact results by approximately 1.5 percentage points. And for adjusted operating profit and EPS, we expect a 2 percentage point impact. With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. In summary, despite the challenging global operating environment, our year to-date results are solid, with 4% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. Progressing in quarter four, we expect business trends to improve sequentially versus quarter three, as all of our key financial metrics return to growth on a currency neutral basis. Longer-term, we continue to be focused on the execution of Vision 2020, which is geared towards accelerating our growth, increasing differentiation and driving cost efficiency, which, in turn, should lead to sustainable profitable growth. Our R&D pipeline is the strongest it has been. We are winning in key markets' categories that we have identified as strategic and we are executing our M&A agenda, all of which will lead to greater value creation for our shareholders. With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Morning, everybody. So, Rich, productivity outpaced reinvestment in the quarter I think a little bit more favorable, too, than expectations going in at the beginning of the year. So I guess I'm curious your thoughts from here about anticipated productivity initiatives and reinvestment. As I recall in June last year, you had talked about anticipation of reinvestment being net neutral versus productivity initiatives, and now it's obviously more favorable. So, I guess how should we think about that dynamic in the fourth quarter, but also into 2017 and beyond and sort of what level of productivity initiatives are now required to grow EBIT in line with those long-term targets? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Mark. More clearly, as I talked about last year in the current situation, productivity gains are clearly a key component of our financial algorithm. When we do better, we have more ability to reinvest. When we don't, we've got to adjust our spending and control our costs. The combination of volume growth and productivity gains are really what drive the foundation of our P&L leverage, and we've got to manage all three of those dynamics, volume growth, productivity and how much we reinvest and invest in the business. In the current environment, as you've seen, it's challenged. Growth is below our historical trends and below our long-term financial long-term guidance. And, as a result, we've had to adjust how we allocate those resources. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And just related to that last point, so and I'll preface it by saying macros have clearly become a bit worse probably than anticipated last June, but I am curious how you think about the company's ability to achieve the revised long-term targets that you set out for sales, EBITDA and EPS last June, given since then, I don't think the numbers have really hit those targets, certainly not on an average basis. So, are those metrics still reasonable or considering the market conditions, do they need to be reassessed, particularly sales growth, given its important to driving the other two? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Maybe, Mark, it's Andreas. I'll take it. We believe it's reasonable on a long term. I believe what's important for us always that we can't manage our business quarter-to-quarter because it's a long-term business here as well. And what we are doing actually to make sure that that we hit our long-term targets is, first of all, we believe that we are capable to produce solid top-line results, given our focus on innovation. Our pipeline, as I said, is actually very strong. It was never as strong as it is right now. Emerging markets, we had a dip in the last, let's say, 18 months. We believe that the emerging markets will eventually come back. Also, the currency situation here was challenging for us, and we're diversifying our portfolio as well. In terms of the mix, I believe we have to focus right now on the mix improvement, which we have done in the past. The fixed cost leverage will help as with the productivity initiatives. And here, I think what's important, and maybe Rich can talk about it, some initiatives are the initiatives we're doing always on manufacturing, but with ZBB, we have now, let's say, a new lever, which we are pulling, but, Rich, you might comment on that one. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Andreas. Yeah. I mean, for me, as Andreas mentioned earlier, we've got to look at both the short-term profitability, but also make sure we protect the long-term growth prospects and strategy of the business. And, look, clearly, we're under-delivering in 2016 versus our long-term targets. We're not going to be able to make that up overnight. And we're still in the early stages or still in the stages of planning for next year. But I think as Andreas talked about, focusing on innovation, those are things that drive expansion of our gross margins, as with the productivity gains. ZBB, that's part of the strategic investments we made during this year. We are starting to embed that in the organization and we'll start to get benefits. We've seen some of the benefits this year, but I think it will continue to ramp up next year into the future. And I think we've got to look at everything we do and look at our business model on a broad basis. How do we operate and how do we leverage our capabilities across the business. How do we continue to drive process efficiency, at a functional level. And all those things will enable us to manage our cost structure and provide the balance between profitability and our ability to reinvest and grow the business on a long-term basis. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And if I might add, one of our pillars in the strategy is actually our M&A ambition. And if we assume for a moment that we close on the Fragrance Resources, we have done actually four deals in the last 15 months, which will roughly add just right now without the growth in the future, $264 million in sales. And they're actually quality assets, which will help us in terms of mix and in terms of diversifying our customer base as well. So that's something, plus the synergies which might come out of these acquisitions, which will help us to achieve our goals. I think all of that taken together, we believe that we can make that. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Lauren. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Morning, Lauren. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great thanks. I want to focus first on the North America Flavors; that business came in a bit lighter than I had expected. And I remember there being some business that was expected to be commercialized in the second half, a big win. So just wondering if that happened, if there was another delay or what the situation is there? Thanks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I would say it's just a challenging environment in North America for us at the moment. No, I think that's what I would comment. And that makes it even more important for us that with the two acquisitions, David Michael and Ottens, that we bring it together as our platform for the mid-market, because that's where we see the growth. And that's our main objective right now to become the leader for the mid-market and the smaller customers. And I think when that's happening, you will see growth as well, because now with these two companies in our portfolio, we have enough critical mass to move a big market like North America for us. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, Lauren, from a category standpoint, I'd say Beverage was down. And on the other side, Savory and Sweet were up slightly, but not enough to offset the weakness that we saw in Beverage. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, also, it just looked like the comments in the release and in the earnings bridge on the difference between input costs and pricing, and then I think in the Q, you talked about a fairly benign input cost environment. So could you just help me understand, triangulate those two? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, sure. I mean, it's a combination of factors, Lauren. I think we saw price input pressures in both businesses. On the Flavor side, it's really driven by the price increases on naturals, and the inventory levels that we have, where we're experiencing the impacts of those very, very quickly. Vanilla is certainly one of the key aspects that we're seeing that pressure. As Andreas talked about, I mean, the acquisition of David Michael will help us on that aspect. On the Fragrance side, it's really a of couple things. One, from a pricing standpoint, it's been more about pricing pressure from a customer standpoint. And then, the second piece is really related to our Ingredients business, being aware we've wanted to address the declines in that business. And we've gone and looked at our go-to-market strategy. And we want to protect our market share more aggressively. And so we've had to adjust pricing accordingly. On the compound side, it's more about pricing pressure from the customers and what's necessary to defend the business that we have today. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, then look forward into next year, and that would suggest we're in a sort of more price-constrained marketplace than maybe we would have expected 6, 9, 12, 24 months ago. Is that reasonable? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, Lauren, I don't want to go into too much detail. I mean, we'll have more clarity in February, but I would say that what we're seeing today and what we expect today, that input costs will be up next year; not huge amounts, like we've seen in the past, but it's going to be up. And that's principally going to be driven by naturals in both businesses, as well as some of the downstream effects of oil-related derivatives as we've gone from $30, $40 a barrel up to $50 a barrel. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Okay. But at the same time, your ability to price to recover some of that is more constrained? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, certainly on the Fragrance side, yes. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, would the thought be to accelerate productivity to try to make up that gap, because it definitely sounds like the Fragrance business, where there's a little bit less ability to recover costs, and the naturals exposure? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, I think, as I mentioned earlier on Mark's question, we're going to have to look at productivity and what we can do from a productivity standpoint at the manufacturing level. We're going to have to look at what we can do to simplify and streamline the organization and the overhead levels. And we're going to look towards, as I mentioned earlier, benefits associated with embedding ZBB-type principles across the organization. And all three of those things are going to enable us to, as I said earlier, manage the dynamic between profitability growth, our expectations and our ability to invest in the business long term. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question come from Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys, and... Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Congrats on the new role there, Rich. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thanks. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So, when I take a look at the third quarter currency sales growth outlook relative to what you said in the second quarter, it's actually up. So it's a little bit better. And then you've talked about some of the headwinds you faced. And your currency neutral operating profit growth is lower than you said in the second quarter. How long do you think it will take to sort of flush through some of these issues? And I would imagine you think that the leverage on operating profit growth should be better than sales growth rate, right? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, as I said in my remarks earlier, for Q4, operating profit leverage, in Q4, will be better than top line. I think that that's despite the incentive comp reset that I mentioned earlier. I think short, medium term, we still expect to see pressures on sales mix. Fine Fragrances is still going to be pressured, and I think, you think about early next year, Q1 was the strongest quarter we had for Fine, and so, I think it's going to be very challenging as we start next year. So, as we look into next year, we're planning and we're acting on a conservative basis, and I don't think that we're sitting here saying that there is going to be a robust environment or robust recovery next year. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Right. Okay. And then, when I think about acquisitions, you mentioned you're going to add about $150 million in sales growth for next year, it's about 5%. Does that or should that lever to a similar amount of EPS growth next year? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's probably a bit early \u2013 that's Andreas taking it, because we will, let's say, integrate these companies fully next year. So, David Michael, we have closed the deal early October. So, we need some time to make sure that we integrate it well into our platform here. It's actually turning then organic in the fourth quarter next year. And the other deal with Fragrance Resources, we will hopefully close early 2017, so it will take some time, I expect let's say, to integrate it very well into our network as well. So, it will help us quite significantly on the top-line growth, as you just outlined, but Rich might comment on the cost side. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, Mike, from a profitability standpoint, EPS, I think as you saw in our commentary, we expect it to be EPS accretive, but it's not going to be anywhere near that impact from a profit standpoint, because we're going to have this step-up in basis. And so, as we saw with Lucas Meyer, as we saw with Ottens, particularly early on, it's not going to have much of an impact at all on operating profit, depending upon what comes out of the valuation work. On a cash basis, sort of an EBITDA basis, it certainly will be more positive. And then over time, as Andreas alluded to, as we're able to integrate the two acquisitions and drive the business rationale and the synergies, we'll be able to start to get more and more of an impact on an operating profit basis. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And as we always said that, we started last year was our first two acquisitions, we haven't done too many over the last 15 years, but now I think we're getting a little bit more skilled, also integrating these assets into our network and as fast as we can do it, as fast as we can produce results here. So, we are actually pretty well on track with that and I'm very satisfied with our focus we are making on the M&A front here, because that gives us another, let's say, critical mass we can basically play with. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Could you actually elaborate a little bit more on the Fragrance Ingredients strength? It was up double-digit in most areas. And a little bit more detail on the North American Beverage weakness, what's behind that? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I'll get started. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, you'll get started. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, John, first of all, good morning, it's Andreas. On the Fragrance Ingredients, it's quite a remarkable turnaround we are seeing here. And it's basically led to a couple of factors. Let's start with the not so exciting one, it's technically, because we are cycling through with one of our big customers we lost before, so the comparison is a bit better for us, but also the strategy is revamped now. And Nicolas and his team have done a great job to look into the business and to our customers, made a good, let's say, approach in terms of target the right customers and started also selling of our more captive molecules earlier, which is actually bringing us a greater value equation already upfront. We have waited probably too long in the past. And these two, let's say, two measure has really helped us to revamp the Ingredients business after two years of really not so good performance. We are pretty happy with what we're seeing here. Does that answer your question, John? John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. And then, North America Beverage? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: North American Beverage... Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think some of it is, as we talked about, alluded to earlier, I mean, I think the win performance in both businesses is pretty good, but particularly on the Flavors side, the lifecycle of those wins has been shorter than what we've seen in the past, so the erosion impact is principally what's driving down or pressuring the performance year-over-year. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, Rich, I think you said compliance and litigation costs reduced margins by 100 bps versus a year ago. Could you provide some additional details on that? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the drivers really are two things. One, you saw in the Q that we have a case going on and we're actively pursuing that and vigorously defending that, but that costs money. And as we prepare for trial, potential trial, early next year, we're getting prepared around. That's a piece of it. The bigger piece of that is really related to the REACH requirements in the fragrance business and it goes through a cycle where there is another \u2013 the next cycle is in 2018. And so we have to prepare for the registrations now, when we incur cost this year, we incur it again next year. And then the following year, potentially we get a little bit of money back from other companies that use our products. But it's really the registration and compliance costs associated with our materials that we operate within the European environment. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, I just wanted to again go back to North American Flavors. So, Ottens was in the base this quarter. Can you talk about how that business performs, because I think the worry is that it's run separately, but do you think you're experiencing any dis-synergies as Ottens becomes part of a larger company and some of your customers are more used to doing business with a company that's more agile and quick to deliver a solution? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We're actually not, because we keep that platform quite separate in terms of how they act. The only thing we are doing is that we are delivering our technologies to make sure that they can use these more high-tech solutions as well. So dis-synergies, we don't see actually. So now the next thing is actually to combine it with David Michael's because that's important. The good thing is that both companies are in Philadelphia, which makes it much easier than if they would have been in different cities. So no, we don't see dis-synergies and that would be my comment on that. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, Faiza, I think as I mentioned earlier, I think one market, I think, is pressured and certainly, certain key clients. The lifecycle on the wins was another factor. I think we expect to see improvement in a strong rebound in Q4. So, I think it's more short-term than we think anything long-term or structural. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, Rich, could you just expand on the manufacturing cost? I think you said that was on the Fragrance Ingredients business. Was there something specific that happened this quarter and it's not expected to continue next quarter or just a little more detail around that? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. No problem. I think it is primarily manufacturing yields in the Ingredients business that I alluded to earlier. Q3 last year was a very strong result, so I would say above average productivity. Our planning was to expect this to be more or less more in line with historical trends, so on average. And we came in below that in the quarter. So, the year-over-year impact is bigger than the absolute impact. I don't think it's structural. I think there is a lot going on in the Fragrance and Ingredient business, in terms of the runs and the product mix, which we're working through and working to optimize, but I don't think it's a long-term challenge. I think it's certainly the big impact was a function of year-over-year performance going two different directions. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, it's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, Jeff \u2013 Silke, sorry. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Silke, good morning. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. What's the EBITDA that you expect from the acquisitions next year? So typically, EBITDA level is something like 50%. So, do you think the business can contribute, I don't know, $80 million EBITDA next year or it will be something lower than that? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, 50% \u2013 Silke, let's come back on that one offline. But, I mean, I think if you look at kind of the amortization levels that are in the Q, that we provide visibility in the Q and in the press release, I would expect similar levels. I mean, obviously, we have to go through the details. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Over the next several quarters, but that I think that overall profitability is the two businesses are pretty close to our existing businesses. And I think the existing amortization levels for Ottens and Lucas Meyer is a close enough proxy to use to try to estimate what the EBITDA levels are. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I apologize, I didn't mean to imply that EBITDA was up 50%. So EBITDA was somewhere like in the mid-20%s and so, I apologize. I miscalculated something, but do you think like a mid-20% EBITDA level is something that's reasonable? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Certainly, not short term, but long term, I think it should be. Again, it's our core business and there is no reason why it shouldn't be similar to what our existing business is. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It takes some time, okay. In terms of the strategic investments you are making, do you expect to make similar investments in 2017 and is there any quantifiable benefit that you can sort of like indicate? Like is this something where you see a benefit over like a two-year period or a three-year period, like what do you get from it? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So I talked about the REACH expenses, which is more on the compliance end. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: From a strategic investment standpoint, some of that work was related to embedding in the ZBB principles. And, as I mentioned earlier, we'll expect to begin to get those benefits next year. And I would expect those things to continue to build over the medium and long term. I'm not ready to say today exactly what those are, but we're going to get benefits related to that. Another key part of the strategic investments is more the overall profitability of the business and leverage not only at the operating profit line but at the EPS line. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And is there like a level of investment you expect for the next year, that's quantifiable? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think that, year-over-year, the level of investment will likely go down a little bit next year versus this year. It's part of the dynamic that I mentioned earlier of managing strategic investments versus growth versus reinvestment in the business. And we've got to work with the entire management team in working that balance. And so part of that will be moving those three levers, but I do expect some of those costs to come down year-over-year. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, my last question is in terms of your business in Europe, is the business, in general terms, is it the same, is it slowing, is it growing? Do you have any views on whether you're affect by the exit of the UK? What are business conditions like in Europe? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I probably can take it. I would say, first of all, it depends on the category or on the business. We see still growth in Flavors, but in all parts of the region, there's Europe, Africa, Middle East, and that's one thing. We suddenly see stronger growth in Africa, Middle East here than we see in Western Europe. So, it's not great growth trends we are seeing. In general, also on our Fragrance business, it's slower than what we see in other regions of the world. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Certainly for Fine. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Certainly for Fine Fragrance. So, I think it's a tough environment for us. The Brexit, I would say, there's no impact for us right now, despite the currency impact. We are all having it at the moment. And it all depends how finally the deal is negotiated with the UK and the rest of Europe. But right now, I think it's a pretty limited impact we are seeing. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And then, I think the other thing on consumer is, we mentioned early about one of our large customers, and so, I think that's in the short and medium term, that's something that we have to work through. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Is that something that you will anniversary at a point in time because the divestiture happened a while ago? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I'm not sure I... Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I'm not sure I... Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm assuming that you're referring to like the fragrance divestiture by one of your larger customers to Coty or I'm imagining that's what it is, but that happened like some time ago. And so I was wondering whether you sort of like anniversary like the headwind from that? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: My comment around the large customer was more on a consumer side. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the consumer side. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, I think, Fine, we talked about the issues with the customer, but I think we are seeing buying pressure and erosion in one of our big consumer Fragrance customers that we have to work through. And that's not going to be lapped yet. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : How many more quarters are there to go? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's a least a couple more quarters. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So it's just begun then, okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much for the detail, appreciate it. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay, Silke. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the gross margin piece of this, especially the two-year progression. Am I right, Rich, that Fine Fragrance is a significantly higher gross margin than the rest of the business? Is there any way you could kind of quantify for us on a basis-point basis, just give us an indication like how much of the two-year slowdown here, which has been, on a two-year basis, pretty dramatic from the second quarter to the third quarter. Was that Fine Fragrance shortfall and just you're making a lot of money before and maybe how much is other things like currency or the contribution from Lucas Meyer and Ottens? Thanks very much. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure, no problem. I think, as I said earlier, I mean, Fine is our most profitable category on the fragrance side. Beverage is the most profitable category on the flavor side. And both of those were pressured in Q3. I'm not going to provide details in terms of how much that is, but they're well above average. So the mix impact is a significant pressure, and you saw in the quarter what kind of impact that can have. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : And how about \u2013 maybe this is a simple question, but how does currency impact you at the gross margin line over the past couple of years, does it hurt you at all? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we try to strip that out and so but it's a complex supply chain in term of where it can go. We start at the ingredients plants and go through our ingredient plant network and then through compounds plant, so there is a time lag impact. There is a multiple currency impact. We do our best to try to isolate that and pull that out of the individual drivers. So, what you see in terms of, as we talk about volume, price mix is our best estimates on ex-currency. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : I understand. Thank you very much. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. No problem. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Good morning, gentlemen. When you look at raw material costs, some of your competitors have started building strategic inventories. You seem to follow a different strategy and your net working capital and cash flow was strong, but you took a hit on the P&L. How should we think about the way you handle raw material cost inflation and what raw material impact also do you see going into year end and 2017, please? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think, Gunther, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect to see modest input cost pressures next year. There, we do have strategic stocks similar to our competitors. The exact strategy may not be the same. And so it's hard for me to comment versus what we're doing versus they're doing. As I had mentioned earlier in my comments, one of the key things that we're seeing pressure on the flavor side is on vanilla. David Michael has a tremendous amount of experience in that area. And we're already looking to leverage that to help us in that market going forward. So we do work with our procurement teams in terms of looking out 6 to 12 months on a rolling basis and make decisions around strategic stocks. Some of it can be driven by the mix of the business now. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: What other than vanilla are strategic stocks for you? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We got vanilla. Most of it's the naturals side of it, natural citrus, some of those things. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Patchouli. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Patchouli, all key things that we have strategic stocks in. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP Paribas Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas : Hi. Just on the input cost question again, I wondered if your ability to recover input cost pressures to pricing differs by customer type or product area. I wondered, for example, is there a difference between globals and smaller customers? Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Go ahead. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. You go. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I think, Heidi, clearly, our objective and our strategy has always been to cover our costs. It has an impact. It can have an impact on our margins, because as we recover it, by sort of the pure math of that, it can have a dilutive effect on our margins. The market is tough right now, that I mentioned earlier, with certain categories of customers, but our objective is always to cover the costs. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you very much for everybody participating. Thank you for the vivid Q&A, and we see each other, or talk to each other, for the next call. Thank you. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you for joining today's IFF. You may now disconnect.",

Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed our press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our full year 2017. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 1, 2016 and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the full year. Then, I want to provide an update on the progress we are making in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including a comprehensive review of our fourth quarter, cash flow statement and cash return to shareholders. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2017 and finish by taking any questions that you may have. Starting with a financial review of our consolidated results for the full year 2016, I am pleased to report that consolidated currency-neutral sales grew 5%. Both business units successfully delivered growth, with 6% in Flavors and 4% in Fragrances. Overall, top line growth was supported by our organic business, which grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis, as we continue to benefit from strong new win performance. In addition, Ottens Flavors, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics and David Michael contributed 2 percentage points of growth. For the full year 2016, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis increased 4%, led by volume growth, productivity initiatives, and the contribution of acquisitions. This improvement in currency-neutral adjusted operating profit when combined with a more favorable effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding led to a 6% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS in 2016. On a full year basis, we continue to make strategic progress. Starting with our Innovating Firsts pillar, in 2016, we commercialized four highly-anticipated captive fragrance ingredient molecules, which was 2 times our historic leverage. All four molecules had unique and distinctive characteristics to give our perfumers a competitive edge and creating the next great fragrance for our customers. The strong growth trend for encapsulation-related sales continued in 2016 led by Fabric Care. For the full year 2016, Fabric Care was our highest growing category in Fragrance, led by a strong double-digit growth in North America and Greater Asia. We also set a new benchmark for fragrance sustainability with the release of our first-ever Cradle to Cradle Certified Fragrance : PuraVita. The fragrance is an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation that aligns well with our circular economy strategy. PuraVita is a model for what can be achieved from perfumers pair creativity with sustainable design principle. From a Flavors perspective, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continue to produce strong results, as well improving strong double-digit in 2016. Growth was broad-based, led by Savory, Beverage and Sweet, an example that we are providing our customers with innovative solution that win in the marketplace with the consumers. In 2016, we also launched and commercialized four new flavor modulators to further strengthen our capabilities and give our flavors a greater palate to work with. I also would like to recognize that IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics won two silver innovation awards in 2016. They've won a silver innovation award at the in-cosmetics Conference held in Paris for Miniporyl and a silver innovation award for Defenscalp at in-cosmetics Asia. Both are fantastic achievements and we look forward showcasting at our dinner next week at the CAGNY Conference. We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership position. While leveraging our longstanding presence and in-depth consumer knowledge, the Middle East and Africa continue to be a growth driver for us, as the currency-neutral sales improved strong double-digits in 2016. Strong growth was achieved across both Flavors and Fragrances. In North America Consumer Fragrance, we saw an 8% increase in 2016, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in both Fabric and Home Care, a direct correlation to our industry-leading technologies. Home Care also improved mid single-digits globally, led by robust growth in North America which I just mentioned moments ago. In 2016, in North America, we further strengthened our number two market share position in Flavors with the acquisition of David Michael, which I will touch on shortly. In addition to the strides we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner of choice and to-go supplier. Throughout 2016, we expanded our business access through gaining core list status with two multinational customers. This is a significant achievement as it will ultimately lead to more growth longer term. I'm also very proud of the recognition we received from our customers in 2016. Over the course of the year, we won several awards across both businesses, showcasting our collaborative work and inspirational session with our customers. As a committed global citizen, we became the first flavor and fragrance company to join the World Economic Forum in 2016 to partner with other leading organizations dedicated to creating positive, lasting changes in society. In addition, to leveraging new relationships, our collaboration with the Forum allows us the opportunity to engage with many of our large customers in new non-traditional ways. Our business strategy is built on the enabler of creating a sustainable future. This directive led us to launch an enhanced sustainability strategy in Vision 2016 that focuses on positive transformational changes toward our regenerative, healthy and abundant world. Under this umbrella, we opened an on-site wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility that is unique to the flavors and fragrance industry. We're rated gold and top suppliers by EcoVadis and identified as a global leader for our action and strategies regarding climate change. For the second consecutive year, we're also honored by being awarded a leadership position on the CDP Climate A List for advances in carbon management and disclosure. As part of our efforts to further fortify the cross-sections between sustainability and business, I was elected to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development Executive Committee in 2016. This CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies works to accelerate the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment, qualities that are parallel on our own commitment to eco-effectiveness. In 2016, we also partnered with Unilever for Vetiver Together, a program designed to enhance the lives of smallholder vetiver farmers in Haiti by sustainable improving food security, increasing yields and diversifying income while working to support women's empowerment and environmental conservation. In line with our ambition to accelerate growth and increase shareholder value, we are proud of the progress we have made in terms of acquisitions. During 2016, we added approximately $160 million of future annual revenue with the acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, the latter of which closed in January of 2017. David Michael is well-known for its vanilla expertise, strength in the Dairy and Beverage categories, and relationships with dynamic, faster-growing middle market customers. Whereas Fragrance Resources, which increases our participation in specialty fragrances, is a faster growing subcategory with Fine Fragrances and strengthening our market share position with a regional customer base. These two acquisitions as well as the 2015 acquisition of Ottens Flavors and Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, are expected to add approximately $265 million in annual revenue, putting us on track to achieve our $500 million to $1 billion goal by the end of 2020. We also announced that IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics made a strategic investment in Bio ForeXtra in Quebec City, Canada-based R&D laboratory, highly specialized in the development of active cosmetic and botanical extracts. This investment expands IFF-LMC's access to raw materials for the cosmetic active business. We believe the access we will gain to sustainable sourced extracts from Boreal Forest of Canada will provide us with a competitive edge. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made in 2016. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Andreas. The fourth quarter came in consistent with our expectation as all of our key financial metrics accelerated sequentially versus the third quarter. Currency-neutral sales growth of 7% was driven by new wins across both businesses, with improved volume trends on our historical business and the benefits associated with our recent acquisition. Our acquisition of David Michael contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to the fourth quarter results. From a profit perspective, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis increased 6%, as volume growth, the benefits of productivity, and the contribution of M&A drove results. Bottom line, currency-neutral adjusted EPS increased 6%, as we had lower shares outstanding versus the prior-year period, driven by a share repurchase program, offset by higher tax rate. Turning to business performance for the fourth quarter, Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 14%, driven by broad-based growth across all categories as well as the contribution of sales from David Michael. From a regional perspective, I'm pleased to say that each region delivered double-digit growth. North America grew 22%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of David Michael as well as strong double-digit growth in Dairy. EAME increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was led by new win performance with strong double-digit growth in both Beverage and Sweet. Africa and Middle East continued its impressive growth trend, improving strong double-digits in the fourth quarter. Greater Asia posted 10% currency-neutral growth, led by strong double-digit growth in India, ASEAN and Indonesia, plus low single-digit growth in China. On a category basis within Greater Asia, we achieved broad-based growth amongst all our categories, led by strong double-digit increases in Savory and Beverage. Growth in Latin America continued, improving 13% on a currency-neutral basis, led by strong double-digit increases in both Mexico and Brazil. Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 27%, led by volume growth, the benefits from productivity, and to a lesser extent the contribution of David Michael. From a Fragrance perspective, fourth quarter currency-neutral sales grew 1%, driven by growth in Fabric Care, Home Care and Fragrance Ingredients. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances declined, driven by abnormally high volume erosions, weak economic conditions in Latin America, and the portfolio transition of two large customers. Consumer Fragrances grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home Care and high single-digit growth in Fabric Care, partially offset by Personal Wash. On a geographic basis, we achieved double-digit growth in North America and high single-digit increases in EAME. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 2% on a currency-neutral basis, as strong growth in EAME was offset by softness in North America and Latin America. From a profit perspective, Fragrance's currency-neutral segment profit was flat year-over-year, as volume growth and benefits from productivity were offset by mix and unfavorable price and input costs. Before moving on to cash flow, I'd like to take a minute to provide you greater insight with respect to our full year 2016 organic top line performance, including foreign exchange-related pricing to provide a better comparison with our peers. As a reminder, when reporting, we exclude the indexation effect on local currency invoicing from our currency-neutral sales growth calculations. This is different from our competition and can impact performance comparisons. For 2016, adjusting our currency-neutral sales growth calculation to a basis similar to our competition reports, our consolidated organic currency-neutral sales would have increased by 1 percentage point to approximately 4%, Flavors would have increased to 5% versus 3%, and Fragrance would have been up 3% versus 2%. From a cash flow perspective, our core working capital levels to continue to show improvement year-over-year as a percentage of sales, as our five-quarter rolling average figure through the end of Q4 was down about 50 basis points to approximately 28.4% of our annual 2016 sales. This change was driven by core working capital level improving versus the year-ago period, principally driven by improvements in accounts receivables and inventories. Operating cash flow for the full year was $535 million. This increase was principally due to lower core working capital requirements, higher depreciation and amortization, and lower pension contributions. Operating cash flow increased 23% to $535 million or 17.2% of sales, an improvement of 280 basis points versus the full year 2015. Capital expenditures for the year finished at $126 million or approximately 4% of sales, as we continue to make investments to support new technologies and infrastructure. We delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders in 2016. Dividend payments were $185 million, reflecting a 15% increase in August as we look to provide a more competitive yield while simultaneously balancing our growth objectives. Supplementing our dividend, we spent $127 million in share buybacks. Over the course of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares and lowered our diluted shares outstanding by approximately 900,000 to 79.9 million shares. When combining both dividend and share repurchases, we achieved a 71% total payout ratio of adjusted net income, exceeding our target range of 50% to 60%. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. In large part to our industry-leading innovation and the ability to provide our customers with superior product, IFF has a history of strong sales growth, proven profitability, and industry-leading returns. Over the past two years, however, we have seen the global operating environment become more volatile as the global consumer staples volumes are soft, currencies are fluctuating, and raw material costs are on the rise. To put this in perspective, we have seen top global consumer product companies volumes decelerate from an average of 2.5% in 2013 to an expected average of 0% in 2016. We have seen emerging market GDP growth slow significantly from 7.5% in 2010 to 5% in 2013 and to approximately 4% in 2016. Key markets such as Brazil and China have been under pressure. The U.S. dollar has although continued to strengthen versus many global currencies. As the U.S. dollar strengthens, many global customers increased pricing in the emerging markets, which has an adverse effect on end market volumes. In addition, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has an adverse impact on multinational organizations domiciled in the U.S. Raw materials have also exhibited inflationary pressures. On the natural side, the demand for all natural products has driven the cost of natural ingredients higher over the past few years. This can be best seen in the vanilla and citrus markets where increases have been two- or three-fold. More recently, we have seen synthetic raw materials rise off their lows. With that as a backdrop and fully recognizing the changing landscape, we are taking action to continue to deliver winning solution to our customers while achieving sustainable profit growth. The start was the launch of multi-year productivity program to allow us the flexibility to invest in the business to drive greater competitive advantage and deliver the target financial results we set out to achieve. Over the course of the next few years, we expect to unlock savings through the application of enterprise-wide zero-based budgeting, elimination of open position, streamlining of our organizational structures, and the optimization of our global network. Once fully implemented, we expect savings from this productivity program to reach an annual run rate between $40 million and $45 million by the end of 2019. We believe that by taking these steps, we should be a stronger, more successful company for our customers, employees, and shareholders. To provide additional insight into our expected profitability goal for 2017, we want to highlight the main drivers of change. In the table, we anchored on full year 2016 adjusted operating profit and build out a reconciliation to bridge to 2017 operating profit. Starting with the second bar, you will note that we expect approximately 3.5-percentage-point headwind related to the reset of our incentive compensation costs. In the third bar, we have included the projected growth of our organic business, including our standard cost on productivity initiatives. This takes into account the external factors that I mentioned moments ago. To ensure we continue to deliver an improved profit performance in 2017, I want to focus on the fourth bar where we have highlighted the potential benefit related to our multi-year productivity program. As you can see, the contribution from this program expects to yield 4 percentage points to 4.5 percentage points of growth in 2017. To round this out, we also expect 1 percentage point contribution from our recent acquisition of David Michael and Fragrance Resources. Looking at 2017 holistically, we're optimistic that all of our financial growth rates should accelerate versus our 2016 performance. From a top line perspective, we expect 7.5% to 8.5% currency-neutral sales growth, inclusive of approximately 4.5 percentage points related to David Michael and Fragrance Resources acquisitions. From an organic perspective, growth is expected to accelerate, largely driven by improving trends in Flavors North America, as volume erosion improves, and a return to growth in China Flavors following the order issue we faced. In addition, we expect Fragrance Ingredients to continue to improve, a direct result of our revised strategy and Fine Fragrances to return to modest growth, driven by strong new wins. As I already shared, operating profit is expected to improve 5.5% to 6.5% on a currency-neutral basis. It should be noted that we expect raw material prices to increase low single-digits in 2017, with vanilla continuing to rise to very high levels. We are in pricing discussions with our customers and are confident we can recover these increases. Currency-neutral EPS growth is expected to improve by 6.5 percentage points to 7.5 percentage points, led by a modestly lower effective tax rate and a continuation of our share repurchase program. In terms of foreign exchange, for 2017, we expect currency translation to impact sales by approximately 2.5 percentage points. For adjusted operating profit, we expect to benefit from our euro hedging program, which we are approximately 70% hedge at $1.12 for 2017. In terms of the impact on operating profits and EPS, we expect currency-reduced results by approximately 2 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively. So, in summary, we are pleased that we have achieved currency-neutral growth across all metrics in 2016 while also executing against our Vision 2020 strategy. As we look ahead to 2017, recognizing the reality of today's market environment, we're optimistic that our financial growth rate should accelerate versus 2016 performance. We are also taking proactive measures to allow us the flexibility to invest in the business, to drive greater competitive advantage and deliver the targeted financial results we set out to achieve \u2013 in particular, achieving our long-term financial targets in 2018. By leveraging our strengths, innovation, consumer insight, talent and diversification, we will continue to strive for improved growth and increase in profitability to deliver our long-term sustainable value. With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : And your first question comes from Mark Astrachan. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wanted to ask what is implied in your organic sales guidance range of 3% to 4% for 2017. In other words, what has to happen to achieve the high end and the low end of the range? For example, is there any improvement embedded in emerging markets, which I think you'd mentioned last quarter? And then, if you could also give the composition of sales from volume and pricing, especially given your commentary on input costs, that would be helpful? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay, Mark, absolutely. So, as you well know, we have faced a couple of challenges over 18 to 24 months largely in North America Flavors where we believe that we're over the volume erosion and we normalized to historical levels and we are stronger than we ever were in North America, which is important. We anticipate a return to growth in China Flavors where we had the issue with our manufacturing facility and we believe as well that the Fine Fragrances will return to modest growth, driven by strong new wins. So, all in all, I believe these factors are \u2013 if they turn out as we have them right now in the plan and we're optimistic they will, we will deliver on the growth rates. But probably Rich can talk a bit more about the composition of the sales. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah sure. And, Mark, I think when you look at the improvement and where we were in 2016 versus 2017, primarily \u2013 the primary growth and improvements of the, let's call it, the midpoint of that range is going to be volume. Pricing, there's a couple of different aspects going on there. We've still got some of the carryover impacts from the 2016, particularly on the Fragrance Ingredients side that's going to have a drag on it. On the other side, we're going to clearly have to have pricing, particularly in the Flavors business with what's going on with the input costs there. So, it's going to be substantially all that of the growth that we're projecting for 2017 is volume-driven. It's both wins and more stable \u2013 I'll call it more stable volume erosion with a slight impact on pricing. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Just to clarify then. So, is there any incremental impact in our expectation from pricing in 2017? And then just a separate follow-up. I wanted to ask about, given the new productivity initiative, what your thoughts are on long-term gross and operating margin? Expansion, is \u2013 let's call it, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion is still reasonable? And then what's embedded for reinvestment in 2017 since I don't think I explicitly saw that in the chart? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: All right. So, again , from a pricing standpoint, it's not a significant amount. So, it's not significant on either direction. I think from a long-term profitability standpoint, I think you heard in Andreas' comments, 2017 puts us on the right trajectory, and I think we are confident on our long \u2013 as we exit 2017 and we deliver upon the results for 2017, we're going to be in a good position to deliver on our long-term profitability targets. And that's really how we're looking at the business. From there on, on a long-term basis, as the volatility stabilizes, we'll be in a better position to make choices on how much and where the investment opportunities are and how much falls to the bottom line and how much gets reinvested in the business. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. First, I just want to follow up again on the productivity program. So, one would be, Rich, in that bridge, the amount that you're showing, is that the benefit of the small program announced in last year's fourth quarter and then some portion of what you've announced today? But just in my mind, it seems like a bigger benefit from productivity than I would expect, given this announcement. So, maybe it's something you were already working on. So, first I just wanted to ask about that. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, the first column of productivities, which is I think is the third column, is our normal ongoing productivity activities where we work through \u2013 it's our organic business. Most of that is productivity. When you take into account volume growth, net of input cost and pricing net of our ongoing cost increases for merit, carryover head count that's slightly favorable, the vast majority of that third column is our ongoing productivity initiative. The fourth column is really what we've talked about today in terms of long-term \u2013 the productivity improvement from the program from today. And that includes both the organic piece of that or the existing piece plus the value creation coming from the acquisitions. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Great. And then I wanted to also talk a bit about the fourth quarter performance in Flavors overall. So, really broad-based improvement, I know the kind of two-year comparison is in line with where the trend has been. But if I recall, in the beginning of the year, you guys had talked about the potential, some significant new wins that could fall in the back half of the year and I think it was reformulation activity maybe around naturals or health and wellness-type stuff. So if you could just talk about whether or not any of that was in this quarter's numbers or if that's still something to look forward to in next year? Thanks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, what we have seen, Lauren, this is Andreas. We have seen an improved commercial performance, which resulted into new wins as well. So, that's actually on a very, very high level right now on the Flavors side. So, that has helped us as well. Another factor, which is partially organic from this year onwards, partially not organic, is the companies we acquired like Ottens Flavors and David Michael, they have a bit of a higher organic growth rate than our core business. And with all the, let's say, improvements we are taking, the profitability will be good as well. So, these are, let's say, two extra engines for our Flavors business here as well, which will yield us some results. And now, the acquisitions are becoming a bit more of a bigger piece of our whole business that will help us going forward. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Lauren, let me just add one thing. From a profitability standpoint, I think the other thing is a favorable mix. We started the year in the Flavors business with a weaker sales mix. We ended the year with a stronger sales mix. So, that's another factor that contributed to the fourth quarter performance. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's great. Okay. And then, just on Fragrances side of the business. So, can you talk a little bit about any kind of incremental investment that you have planned? I mean, obviously the Flavors, like you just described, the Flavors' momentum is great. But as you've been talking about in your 2020 Vision, your 2020 Plan, is there also some incremental investment built into the 2017 plan? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, first of all, let's start with the fundamentals, which is always, let's say, research and development and new molecules. We are on an all-time high in terms of coming out with new patent-protected molecules, which is actually a great progress. It's actually double the rate we had before. So, I think that's important. The encapsulation is helping us as well. That's the reason why Fabric is growing so well. And then, in our Fragrance business now, we have Lucas Meyer for the whole skin care and active cosmetics, which has per se a higher growth rate as well. So, that's helping us actually pretty much. So, we did an investment on a newer extension of our Singapore plant for encapsulation. So, that was something for business, which will come over the couple of the next years. So, all in all, there's optimism as well. And if you look at the whole business, the Consumer Fragrance still grow very strong business; Ingredients, and you know we talked about this for many, many quarters, is finally back and it's turning positive. The problem for us, let's face it, was Fine Fragrances, and that we have to fix, but there is nothing, let's say, structural, I would say, it's blocking and tackling to get this back on track. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hi. Good morning. So, I just had a couple questions. First of all on the productivity program and just the margin bridge in general. So, you've talked about accelerating value realization of recent acquisitions. So, are those fixed synergies? I know, you talked about like David Michael and Ottens sort of both being in Philadelphia and sort of consolidating those operations. Is that part of the productivity program? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, out of the overall productivity program that we've announced, it combines both factors, right. It's looking at our existing structure, streamlining our organization, doing things more efficiently, standardizing it. And the other part is accelerating the benefits coming from the recent acquisitions. I'm not going to get in \u2013 we still have a lot of work to be done in terms of where the specifics come from, but there's a lot of logical opportunities that when you look across the footprint that we will take advantage of where it makes sense to do that. Both of the businesses provide tremendous opportunity, particularly in the local and regional customers, and we want to be able to continue to maximize that. But there's opportunities in some of the procurement and some other activities which we are able to leverage in while continuing to grow the business. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then \u2013 so your largest competitor, Givaudan, had talked about increasing high \u2013 investments and growth this year in particular and they talked about specifics sort of R&D labs and things like that. Do you feel like from a global point of view, you're well-placed or do you think you need to make more investments? And maybe as you answer that, if you could also just talk about like your cash flow guidance and what you expect for CapEx this year? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, Faiza, I would say we are very well-placed in terms of innovation and because we put basically money behind the programs where we really think we can make a difference, as for example, modulation, encapsulation, even the active cosmetics because with some small acquisitions like Bio ForeXtra, we are really building a competitive advantage. And actually we have done quite a bit on CapEx investments in our facilities, not just in buildings, but in robotics for example, which help us actually to increase the output from our R&D labs quite significantly. So, if you're asking me whether we are well-positioned, I believe we are actually very well-positioned and we feel strong about the future. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Faiza, I mean, from my perspective, I think two comments. One, I'd say, again, the intent of this program is to ensure that we're competitive and we drive improved results after a challenging 2016. I think as the benefits associated with these programs take hold in both 2017 and 2018, it gives us the flexibility to then selectively go back and reinvest and increase our investments in the highest opportunity and highest probability activities, and we'll look at that during the course of 2017 and 2018. And, as I said earlier, we'll manage that dynamic between bottom line and growth opportunities on a case by case basis. In regards to cash flows, CapEx, as I said, 2016 was about 4%. I see 2017, 2018 being the peaks of probably 5% of sales for those two years as we get to the last legs of some these investments, particularly in Greater Asia and then trending down towards, I will call it, a 3.5% level, which I considered a long-term level that's sufficient to support the business, but we'll start trending down off of that number. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi, Silke. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Doing good. Hi, Silke. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'll start with your restructuring first, if that's okay. Of the $30 million to $35 million in cash costs, how much of that will you accrue in 2017 and how much will you actually pay out in 2017? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's about \u2013 I think it's about two-thirds of that is people-related costs. The other third of it is facility-related and integration-related activities and support activities. I think the bulk of those amounts will be paid out in 2017. There may be a small amount of carryover into 2018 more on the facility side, but I think the bulk of that will be paid out this year. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And in terms of run rate savings of $40 million to $45 million, where do you think you're going to get to in 2017? What's your target for 2018? If you \u2013 like it seems if you'd plan to pay most of the cash cost out in 2017, like I'm expecting it seems like that a lot will get done in year one and so can you get to like a run rate of, I don't know, $30 million in year one and ramp up pretty quickly? What are your internal targets? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean, if you take the $40 million to $45 million, it's about 7%, right? So, we've said it's about 4 percentage points to 4.5 percentage points. The bulk of the remaining amount will come in 2018. There may be a small amount, again, mostly facility-related or footprint-related is the way I would call it. That's the better way to think about it. That may spill over into 2018. But the bulk of it \u2013 the vast majority of the remaining savings, we should see in 2018. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Then I have a question about your cost of goods sold. Like what percentage of your domestic raw materials do you actually have to import? Is it like 10%, 15%? Is it like 20%? Is that sort of like the ballpark order? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Off the top of my head, I'm going to have to get back to you. If you're trying to get to a question around the... Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Border tax. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: ...the border tax. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Right. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You see. We're reading your mind. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We've taken a look at it. And based on, I'm going to call it, the Congressional plan, and I would say that \u2013 when you look at both materials and services, it's basically a negligible event for IFF just based on our current estimates. Again, a lot depends upon where the legislation comes out. But if you look at the overall portfolio, it would be basically breakeven to slightly positive. I mean, slightly positive. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That as well. Yeah. So, let's see when finally there's like some wording around how this will all work out. But you think in terms of the amount of materials that you have to import in the U.S., it's a negligible amount? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, I'm not saying that. Because, I mean, there's... Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, what's that percentage? Because nobody knows how the regulations will work. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I don't want to give you a percentage because I got to look back over the specifics to North America. I looked at the values of what we sell out \u2013 what we export. I looked at the values of what we import. And again, when you add all that up, plus our service fees around the world, it's a net to slightly favorable. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Then my last question that I have, maybe it's more like a comment, but that's really also a question. So, what are the \u2013 it's like the business model for IFF for many years has worked in a really nice way where if you had mid single-digit sales growth, you would have double-digit earnings growth. So, just like before any benefits from share repurchase and which was just like a testament, like nice high incremental margins. And so in 2016, total sales grew 3% and, I guess, your net income before share purchase grew 3%. And next year, you think your sales are going to grow all-in 5% to 6% and your earnings are growing 4% to 5% with share repurchase. So, are we going to go \u2013 is like the business model impaired in some way or do you think we're going to get back to a period where \u2013 when your sales grow 5%, your earnings grow double-digits? Or what needs to happen for things to get better? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: For me, Silke, the fundamentals of the business are still quite strong and we believe strongly in the fundamentals of the business. There's no doubt that 2016 was a challenging year. As you said, the fundamentals when we're growing mid single-digits between 4% and 6%, particularly when you go up on [higher-end range], the leverage in the business is tremendous. But when we're growing 2.5% \u2013 between 2% and 3% on an organic basis, the opposite happens. And so, I think when I look at 2016 and we have an incentive comp reset that we've highlighted. If you take that out and you say all else is equal, then there's pretty good \u2013 I consider very good profit growth, if we have a stable environment going forward. So, I think I feel confident that, as we said in the call earlier, both myself and Andreas, we feel confident that we can \u2013 our long-range targets are still achievable, particularly as we get traction and fully realize the benefits associated with the programs that we've discussed today. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I would say as one final remark, Silke, is the business model is still intact. The only thing what has changed is the volatility in the environment. And with the action we are taking, we are taking care of the volatility because we are creating flexibility for ourselves to deal with that in a best possible way. So, that's how I would describe it. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for your comments. I'll get back to the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much. Couple of questions, small picture and big picture. Small picture, on the Flavors side, how much of this pickup is related to either cross-selling new Ottens or David Michael capabilities or new customers associated with them cross- selling in that direction? And the big picture is, somebody already asked about border tax, what about the regulatory environment globally? I mean, that seems like such a no-brainer of a positive backdrop over the past five years and now with regulation seemingly in the crosshairs for food, the household products, everything, does that slow down what had been a key driver of your business? And have you had any communication with your customers about regulatory mandated reformulations and that sort of thing? Any sense on that? Thanks very much. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Well, Jonathan, I'm taking the broader, bigger question first. Indeed, we have seen a tightening of the regulatory environment across the globe. And I can tell you, the regulatory costs for the industry went up. I see it even in our own cost center here as well because we want to be best in class in regulatory because we believe it basically creates a competitive advantage. Let me explain. What we see in our industry is that some of the smaller companies have a hard time to catch up with the regulation and to invest as much as we do, which creates actually opportunities for us in the business and in the M&A space as well. So, I don't expect that the regulatory pressure will go down, probably not even in the U.S. despite the new President. We are actually prepared for a tough regulatory environment, and we believe it could create a competitive advantage for us as a company. So, that's number one. Number two, on the Flavors side, we have not seen too much cross-selling opportunities right now. It's too early. But this is exactly what we want. I'd give you just one idea here. We had just two weeks ago, the first sales meeting for the combined entity for the middle market, which is ex-David Michael's, ex-Ottens, the sales force, and they have their territories in place and they are now rolling. And now, we have basically a force for the big customers and a force for the smaller and mid-sized customers and I think you will see a lot of that because we can deliver now to the smaller customers, not just the service but we can deliver innovation as well and I believe that will create a great advantage for us. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : And your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I think we know many of the raw materials that are up : vanilla, citrus, acetone. Are there any raw materials that are down significantly? It's such a diverse set of raw materials that you bought is usually something going down when something is going up. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You would think. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: One would hope. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, right. Rich, you take it. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. John, I mean, I think you've highlighted where the pressures are in citrus, in vanilla and some of the naturals. I think when I look at 2016 as an example, input costs were basically up slightly but very negligibly. So, it's more around what's going around those specific buckets that's what's driving the upward pressure. But there's nothing significant that's going the other way. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And when the petrochemical raw materials, in particular, rise, usually we see the customers start to reformulate because their bulk ingredients like surfactants go up even more, and then you get to reprice on the reformulation. So, are we seeing any product reformulation acceleration and activity because of the rise in raws? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I don't know if I would characterize an acceleration. I mean, to me, it's a constant part of our business that it helps us manage our relationship with each of the customers where we help them and they help us deal with these pressures on both sides. And probably the one exception is vanilla where it's gone so much in such a relatively short period of time that those are where a lot of the customers are looking for other alternatives. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions from my side, please. First on Flavors and the strong performance there. You mentioned it was very broad-based the growth rates there. I suppose that's a comment on the regional split. Can you just give us an idea what the split on the customer base, especially the MNCs versus the regionals were? And also you just noted that the Flavors division's performance was on improved commercial performance and new wins. Is that something you see continue in 2017, please? And the second question I've got is on the raw materials. Has the split between synthetic and natural raw materials changed in any way over the last few years and if you run rate the acquisitions that you've made recently as well? Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, we're just getting ready for all the questions, Gunther, but let me get started. First of all, on the customer base, what we are seeing still kind of a 50 :50 between globals and local and smaller customers. But it's a good question because with our exposure now in U.S., which is a big market or region to some of the smaller mid-sized customers that that might change over time because we see good growth rates here. On the commercial wins, we have seen a good and great performance, and we started well here as well. So, we see a continuation of what we have seen last quarter. I think that's really, really good as well. Raw materials, Rich, you take it. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, one additional comment on the Flavors growth, I mean, that as you said, wins are solid where we want them to be. Volume erosion, as I alluded to in my comments, was better than what it had been, and so it was stronger than the long-term average. So, volume erosion was better in Q4. That's obviously and clearly one of the most volatile components of our business. And so, that's one of the factors to keep in mind for Q4. In terms of raw materials, I think it's more on the \u2013 as we've talked about, it's more on the natural side, particularly on the Flavors business where we see more of the focus and more of the demand on that is on the Flavors side. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: What you well know, Gunther, is that we are putting a particular emphasis on modulation. And what is really working very well at the moment is the sweetness modulation. Certainly, it's a sweet spot literally because many of our customers try to reduce sugar, and we have seen actually an unprecedented flow of wins coming in for that technology. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: That's really helpful. Thanks. Maybe I can sneak one more in. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, would you be able to give a growth rate for that business? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. 10% for the full year. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Curt Siegmeyer from KeyBanc Capital. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Curt. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Curt. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just a clarification on the productivity program. So, it seems your guidance implies, let's call it, roughly $25 million to $28 million in savings in 2017. How should we think about that by quarter? And then how much of that is head count reductions in 2017 versus some of the other things, streamlining and integration savings? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I think it will accelerate as we go through the year. I think the bulk of the benefits associated with the position-related asset savings and people-related costs are going to be Q2, Q3. There'll be a piece that \u2013 but I think the bulk of that will probably in those two periods. I think the footprint type of benefits are really going to take longer. That involves us figuring out where the right locations are and how do we best optimize the footprint. So that's the part that more drags into and has a bigger component that's going into 2018 versus 2017. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then could you guys maybe give a little more color on your expectations for Fine Fragrances? As we move further into 2017 here, do you expect North America and Latin America sort of the headwinds that you're seeing there to improve, get worse, sort of remain stable at kind of low levels? And then any other color on EMEA as well? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Sure. I mean, I think several comments to that question. One, I think we're still, as I mentioned on the third quarter call, I mean, the pressures that we're seeing that are related to Brazil, Latin America as well as the customers working out their portfolio, we still expect that to continue in the near term. Also, keep in mind that Q1 was a very strong quarter last year. So, from a comparable standpoint, it's going to be our most challenging quarter. I think for the full year, we expect, as Andreas commented earlier \u2013 I think for the full year, we expect it to be \u2013 I'm not going to call it a strong growth engine, but it's going to be positive as opposed to a significant tailwind in the past. So, I think it will improve \u2013 not tailwind, headwind. The improvement will come later in the year. Q1 will be challenging. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We have good visibility in terms of the new wins, but you never know how the new wins play out in the marketplace. So, that's how we'll describe it. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, the pipeline and wins are \u2013 we feel very good about the pipeline and wins. It's the timing of when those things actually get launched by our customers that we still have to work through. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Just wanted to stay with Fine Fragrances real quick. Certainly, given some recent commentary from some larger customers, it does sound like some existing challenges maybe remain in place, especially for the early parts of 2017. You just talked about visibility of new wins. But I'm also curious about any visibility related to existing business picking up potentially as we move into the back half of 2017 and into 2018. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Again, I think what I can tell you is, from my perspective, we have to wait a bit \u2013 I mean, the customers \u2013 the two big customers have to work out the inventories and make those decisions, so we're on hold. We know that they've been bringing down inventories and that's been a significant drag in terms of volume erosion. I think we feel Latin America is getting a bit better, but I'm not going to consider it a huge opportunity. So, I think we're expecting improvement, as you said, as we get to the latter part of this year. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. And then just one other for me, if I may. You guys have started to pick up M&A in recent years. You've been able to do so. Is there anything on the horizon as we've moved into 2017 here that makes it any harder for you to add to your portfolio the M&A? Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. Actually, as you well know, the cost of M&A went up over the last couple of years, and it's getting a little harder to find good assets. What I have to say is the assets we have added in the last two years, we are very, very pleased with what we found in terms of the quality of the assets and what they do for us after we have integrated. So that's good. So that makes me optimistic actually looking forward that we may find some other assets here to add as well. We are constantly looking, but I can't be more specific on that one. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : That is the last question. We will now turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Very good. And thank you very much for participation and the good questions. I would like to remind you that we have next week the CAGNY Conference on Thursday, it's a big IFF day, and you should not miss it. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Brett Hundley - Vertical Group Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances' First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Vice President, Global Corporate Communications & Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2017 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed our press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please take a note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for our second quarter and full-year 2017. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2017 and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce, Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. I would like to start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the first quarter. Then I want to provide an update on the progress we made in terms of our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I would ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit, as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. Then, I will provide some concluding remarks and we will finish by taking any questions that you may have. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter sales growth was strong and in line with our expectations. Currency-neutral sales increased 7%, which was comprised of 10% growth in Flavors and 3% growth in Fragrances. Sales performance was predominantly driven by the contribution of our recent acquisitions of David Michael and Fragrance Resources and a strong performance in our Organic Flavors business, while we achieved growth across all categories and regions. In Fragrances, we were successful in offsetting challenging macroeconomic conditions in Latin America, primarily Brazil, driven by Fragrance Ingredients and Fine Fragrance, in particular in the EAME region. In terms of currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, the contribution from our recent acquisitions was strong and support our overall profitability as we are ahead of our acquisition plans. Organically, our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit came in consistent to the prior year as volume growth and productivity initiatives were offset by unfavorable price to input cost, as well as several unplanned expenses that Rich will go through in more detail later in the presentation. We also benefited from a lower effective tax rate and reduced shares outstanding in the quarter, which supported a 9% improvement in currency-neutral adjusted EPS. We continue to make progress each quarter with respect to our Vision 2020 strategy. I'm happy to report that the two of our key R&D-focused areas continue to be growth drivers in the first quarter. In Fragrances, our encapsulation technology continues to expand beyond the traditional Fabric Care category with strong growth in Personal Wash. In Flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continue to post strong growth and proving strong double-digits on a currency-neutral basis, led by savory, dairy and beverage. This is further proof that our innovative solutions are allowing us to meet our customers' demand by healthier and better-for-you products. Looking towards the future, we also commercialized two new flavor molecules to enhance our Flavors palette for (5:04) in order to continue to build winning solutions for our customers. We continue to see accelerated growth in the areas where we are targeting market leadership position, benefiting from our recent strategic acquisitions, as well as from solid growth in our Organic Flavors business, we saw a 14% increase in North America in the first quarter 2017. Our ongoing commitment to provide our customers with in-depth local consumer understanding, superior innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality products allowed us to continue to capture the growth of both global and faster growing regional accounts with regionals outpacing global accounts. This continues to strengthen as our recent acquisitions of David Michael and Fragrance Resources are all well strong from a regional customer base. I'm also happy to report that IFF | Lucas Meyer Cosmetics continued its strength in the cosmetic active ingredient segment as it won several beauty industry awards on CosmeticsDesign, including Best Skin Care Active Ingredient for Americas with Miniporyl, Best Hair Care Ingredient for Americas with Defenscalp, and Best Skin Care Active Ingredients Global with Miniporyl. All of which are showcased at CAGNY earlier this year. In addition to the slides, we have made from a market share and innovation perspective, we continue to position ourselves to be our customers' partner-of-choice and to-go supplier. In the first quarter of 2017, we expanded our business access by gaining core list status with a multinational Flavor customer to ensure we continue to increase our participation, ultimately leading to continuous growth. We also received an innovation award from a top Flavors customer, validating that our innovation, collaborative work and inspirational sessions are driving the success in achieving solutions that meet end consumer demands. During the first quarter, we launched our 2016 Sustainability Report entitled Circular by Design. It is an in-depth state testament to all we have accomplished over the past year and provides insight into our aspirations as we move forward with our journey to make IFF a deeply greener company. If you haven't already, I invite you to check out our report and companion video are found online at the iff.com/sustain. Beginning in 2014, IFF-LMR took a step forward and partnered with the Institute of Marketecology, a leading provider for international inspection and certification services for organic, ecological and social standards to certify that our strategic supply chains and operating platforms meet with the For Life criteria. During the first quarter, we were proud to announce that IFF-LMR achieved its 9th For Life Certification, this time for Burgundy Blackcurrant Bud. Our responsible sourcing platforms in naturals demonstrates our commitment to traceability and towards progressively more responsible ingredients. Certification For Life is a guarantee from IFF to our customers and their consumers. We are also targeting opportunities within our industry and near adjacencies to develop new technologies and to expand our geographic and business access. All of this must be done in a way that make strong strategic sense and leverages our expertise in science and technology. Over the past two years, we have successfully acquired five companies, three of which closed in the past seven months. Our acquisition of David Michael in October 2016 helped further reinforce our differentiated service model is the U.S. for Flavors middle-market customers, focused on innovation, agility and enhanced collaboration. In early 2017, we acquired Fragrance Resources, which is a key player in a fast-growing specialty Fine Fragrance category, also increasing our exposure to regional customer base. In the first quarter of 2017, these two acquisitions contributed approximately 5 percentage points of our sales growth and 3 percentage points of operating profit growth already, as we are tracking ahead of our acquisition case, driving sales growth and extracting synergies. Last month, we also announced the purchase of PowderPure to further expand our expertise and offerings for clean label solutions that satisfy consumer demands. Founded in the early 2000s and based in Oregon, PowderPure utilizes its patented Infidri drying technology to create all-natural food ingredients by eliminating water while leaving the taste, nutrition and color matrix intact. Using minimal processing, PowderPure currently focuses on all fruits and vegetable powders, juice powders, as well as other specialty products. PowderPure's technology has also been used to effectively repurpose valuable materials resulting from other food processing systems, turning them into useful and nutritious products and saving them from waste streams. The global trend in natural food formulations and the delivery of taste was options for the cleanest possible label. It's clear and we found the combination of powders, product quality, and the unique benefits of their technology very compelling. This platform further expands our access to fast-growing natural, clean label food ingredients and potentially creates opportunities in adjacent markets of nutraceuticals, specialty extracts, and coloring food stuffs. Overall, we are very excited about this addition to our organization and the future growth prospective it brings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Andreas. Our first quarter results in sales growth was strong and in line with our expectations. Currency-neutral sales grew 7%, including approximately 5 percentage points related to the contribution of David Michael and Fragrance Resources, and 2 percentage points from our Organic business. Currency-neutral adjusted operating profit grew 3% as the benefit of acquisitions, volume growth, and cost savings initiatives more than offset unfavorable price to input costs, as well as unplanned expenses, including unfavorable manufacturing variances, bad debt, a product recall, and litigation loss. I'll go through these in more specifics on my next slide. Below the line, we had strong leverage as we benefited from a more favorable effective tax rate, which we expect to normalize over the next three quarters to approximately 22.5% on a full-year basis, and a reduction in shares outstanding related to our share repurchase program. These two factors led to a robust currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth in the quarter of 9%. Looking at our Q1 currency-neutral operating profit growth, I want to provide some more clarity on our performance drivers year-over-year. In the second bar, you can see that volume growth added 6 percentage points to profitability. In the third bar, we have highlighted the benefits of our cost and productivity initiatives. Due to the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings, and restructuring program savings, we delivered approximately 4 percentage points of benefit year-over-year. As Andreas stated earlier, the contribution of David Michael and Fragrance Resources added 3 percentage points to operating profit growth, as shown in the fourth bar, as we are growing and realizing synergies. From a headwind's perspective, as seen in the next bar, price to input costs were unfavorable by about 4 percentage points, driven by a reduction in pricing within Fragrance Ingredients, as well as volume-related rebates in core listing agreements in Fragrance compounds. The area where I'd like to elaborate more on is in the next box, which is related to unplanned expenses that negatively impacted our operating performance in the quarter by approximately 4%. About half of that amount relates to manufacturing variances in Fragrance Ingredients. We have a reactor temporarily suspended for approximately two to three weeks in one of our plants, and manufacturing yield variances due to the implementation of new manufacturing processes at another Fragrance Ingredient plant. The other half of the variance is \u2013 the headwinds, was driven by bad debt for a single customer based in Latin America, a litigation loss, and lastly, a charge of $1.8 million related to the write-off associated with the product recall. The remaining items, grouped together in other, primarily relates to deferred compensation expense, where we make mark-to-market adjustments based on the performance of the equity market. Net-net, had we not had these unplanned items, currency-neutral adjusting operating profit would've been more in line with our expectations. Looking at the business unit performance for the first quarter, Fragrance currency-neutral sales improved 3%, driven by growth in Fine Fragrances, Fabric Care, and Fragrance Ingredients. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance improved 10% on a currency-neutral basis, inclusive of additional sales related to the acquisition of Fragrance Resources. Three of the four regions, led by EAME, achieved strong growth, with the exception of Latin America, which continues to experience abnormally high volume erosion due to weak economic conditions. Consumer Fragrances grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis, principally driven by the additional sales related to the acquisition of Fragrance Resources and improvements in Fabric Care. In the first quarter, Fabric Care grew low single-digits on a currency-neutral basis, with three of the four geographies posting strong growth, led by double-digit increase in North America and high single-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 2% on a currency-neutral basis, as double-digit growth in EAME and LatAm were offset by softness in North America and Greater Asia. From a profit perspective, Fragrance's currency-neutral segment profit decreased 6%, as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to input costs, as well as several of the unplanned expenses that I mentioned earlier. In terms of currency-neutral segment profit margin, our profile remained strong, yet was under pressure year-over-year, driven by the above items I mentioned. Plus the Fragrance Resource acquisition, inclusive of a step-up in purchase price accounting and before realizing all the synergies. Flavors' currency-neutral sales increased 10%, driven by broad-based organic growth across all categories, as well as the contribution of sales related to David Michael. From a regional perspective, each region delivered growth led by strong double-digit performance in North America, which improved 27%, reflecting additional sales related to the acquisition of David Michael, as well as strong double-digit growth in dairy and savory in the Organic business. EAME increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis, led by high single-digits in Western Europe, Central, and Southeastern Europe. This performance was primarily driven by strong new wins. Greater Asia posted 3% currency-neutral growth, led by strong double-digit growth in India, Thailand and the Philippines. On a category basis within Greater Asia, performance was led by double-digit growth in beverages. Growth in Latin America continue, improving 7% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Mexico and the Andean Pact, as well as mid-single-digit growth in the Southern Cone. Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 12%, led by volume growth, the benefits from productivity initiatives, and the contribution of David Michael's acquisition. In terms of currency-neutral segment profit margin, we delivered year-over-year improvements, principally driven by our savings related to the productivity initiatives as well as volume growth. Turning to our cash flow, our core working capital levels continued to show improvement, principally driven by the timing of payables. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $22 million compared to $40 million in the first quarter of last year. While we experienced lower outflows from working capital, we were negatively impacted by the timing of higher pension payments, which will normalize throughout the year, as well as higher incentive compensation payments. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $27 million in CapEx and we continue to believe we expend approximately 5% sales in 2017. Regarding cash return to shareholders in Q1, we spent approximately $51 million on dividend payouts and $38 million on share repurchases. For the full-year, we expect to meet or exceed our total payout objective of 50% to 60% of adjusted net income. As we look to the balance of the year, we are optimistic that we can achieve our previously stated total financial guidance on a currency-neutral basis. Please note that this is absent of any additional costs and/or recovery related to the product recall, as it's not estimable at this time. We do not believe that the ultimate settlement of the claim will have a material impact on our financial condition; however, it may have an impact on any one quarter. We are reiterating our previously stated currency-neutral sales growth projection of 7.5% to 8.5%, including approximately 4.5 percentage points' contribution from the acquisitions of David Michael's and Fragrance Resources. Embedded in the acquisition impact is the sales benefit related to recent acquisition of PowderPure, which is expected to have a negligible impact on a full-year basis. From adjusted operating profit and EPS perspective excluding the impact of currency, we expect to achieve 5.5% to 6.5% and 6.5% to 7.5% respectively, inclusive of a 2.5 percentage point contribution from M&A for each. Given our performance in the first quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year, we raised the contribution from acquisitions which provided an offset to the unplanned expenses in our Organic business in the first quarter. For modeling purposes, please note that we expect the momentum in terms of currency-neutral adjusted operating profit to accelerate in the second half of the year as we fully realize the benefits of our previously announced productivity improvement initiatives. While our currency-neutral guidance has not changed, the effects of currency movements on our results have. From a top line perspective, the impact of currency improved by approximately 1 point to 1.5 percentage point headwind, primarily driven by an improvement in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate. On a profit and EPS basis, movements in several currencies such as the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Indonesia rupiah and Mexican peso versus the dollar has had an adverse effect on our guidance as well as transaction rate differences on the timing of inventories. We are hedged approximately 75% on euro profit exposure at $1.12 for 2017. As a result, on a full-year basis, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on adjusted operating profit to be approximately 2.5 percentage points and approximately 3 percentage points on adjusted EPS. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. In summary, we are pleased that we achieved currency-neutral growth across all metrics in the first quarter of 2017. Sales growth was strong and overall currency-neutral adjusted operating profit was supported by a successful integration of recent acquisitions, evidence that we are allocating capital to the highest return initiatives. Simultaneously, we continue to refocus on the execution of Vision 2020 as we believe our emphasis on building great differentiation and delivering profitable growth that will create incremental shareholder value long-term. For the full-year, we are optimistic that our financial growth rates should accelerate as our 2016 performance as we have confirmed our currency-neutral financial guidance. With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hey. Morning, everybody. So, wanted to ask, if I heard correctly, the organic sales growth expectation is unchanged while EBIT and EPS are a little bit lower. So, I guess, on the top line, confidence in achieving accelerating organic sales growth through the year, including now off of a lower 1Q base. And I guess maybe putting it differently, too, what would have to happen for you to hit the low and the high end of that 3% to 4% range? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Look, I think from a top-line standpoint, the first quarter was challenging. I think when we look at our full-year expectations, it's based on our current views in terms of confirmed new wins. We do expect that volume erosion and the effects of destocking, expect to have less of a drag as we proceed through the balance of the year. We are expecting to see improved performance particularly in the second half of the year related to Lucas Meyer's. And we'll continue to see greater contribution from the faster growing acquisitions and their impact associated with local and regional customers. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: If I might add, and if you look at the acquisitions, you have certainly an impact from David Michael, which was done in the fourth quarter, but it's not the total quarter, so we have technically more sales than Fragrance Resource, which was closed basically mid of January, so that has an effect here as well. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Maybe just following on that. You sort of look at the business performance relative to peers. Clearly, IFF has been underperforming, depending on which you want to -you benchmark against at least of the other big public four companies. So, I guess, I'm curious what your thoughts are that has contributed to that. And then, sort of related to it from a geographic standpoint, why do you think developed markets contribute more than developing markets, in terms of the expected growth? And what are you specifically seeing that would be the underlying behind that? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Mark, I'll take it. First of all, we don't see an underperformance compared to competitors on a FX-neutral basis, that's number one. Last year, the first quarter is the first quarter, and I think we should look at the year. Looking at the developing markets, we see actually right now a pretty good performance for certainly North America, in many regards, organically, but also through the acquisitions. Europe is actually amazingly strong for us, which is a good one. Coming to the emerging markets, here, we see a lot of headwinds in terms of currency. I think all the currencies with exception of the euro, Rich just mentioned are all in the emerging markets, which are creating a lot of headwind for us. We see a lot of economic turmoil and volatility in Latin America, which is obviously an important customer not just for the Fragrance business \u2013 or region for the Fragrance business, in particular, Brazil is really not easy to manage right now. We see certainly more turmoil in the Middle East as well, and China is volatile. So, you see that the emerging markets or the contribution of the emerging market was not as good or as, let's say, important as it was many years or the years before. We believe that we still \u2013 as our exposure to the emerging market that many of these markets will come back over time and will create again a growth engine for us looking forward during the, let's say, strategic planning horizon. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. So, looking at the outlook for the balance of the year, and Andreas, you just mentioned \u2013 sorry, I think it was Rich \u2013 about volume erosion and destocking being less pressure as we go through the year. Just when we look at the results of some of your customers, largely in the U.S. more so for the food companies, but also the HPC (28:35) players, the first quarter was a shocking turn to the negative, and they all seemed very surprised. So, I'm curious with degree to which you've seen that, sort of inventory adjustments for customers make its way to impact your business yet, or is that something we should still be anticipating in the second quarter? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi, Lauren. It's Rich. I think couple of things from me. One, I would say that, again, while I expect and we expect to see less of an impact, it's not like it's based on a significant turnaround. We still expect to see pressure, and it's less about having less of a headwind, but it's still going to be headwind. Our expectations are not based on having a significant turnaround, for example, in Latin America for Fragrances. Latin America for Flavors is quite strong and our full-year outlook for Flavors in Latin America is pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. I think when we look at our relationship to our customers, I think as there is a downward correction, we are more lagging. And I think when conditions are improving, we're probably an earlier indicator. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And I might add on \u2013 if you look at the market and you have seen this between the big companies and the small or mid-market companies, it's really bifurcation of the market. And now for us, in particular in North America, increasing our share in the smaller customers is really beneficial for us, and it will help us with our growth rates as well going forward. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But, Andreas, were those \u2013 and I understand that and I know that's been a big piece of the strategy and the acquisitions, it all makes a ton of sense. I just wonder if those businesses are yet large enough to offset some of the pressure that may be ahead, even if it's a short-term, again, as Rich said, kind of lagging the correction that your larger customers in North America have seen in the last three months? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Actually, we see it now through, because it is now five acquisitions if we include PowderPure, and we are building critical mass. And what we see here is new wins as well going forward. And actually, all of these acquisitions \u2013 okay, I can't talk for PowderPure, it's probably between you. But all of the four acquisitions have at least double to triple the growth rate of regional business, and they are becoming an engine of growth for us. And I think it's helping. I agree with you. At the beginning, when we had our first acquisition, it was very small. It was not moving the needle, but now accumulating more of these growth engines that's really, really helpful for us, and that's actually moving it forward. Particularly in North America, we see it actually big times, big times. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Lauren, I would... Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I would also say \u2013 sorry, Lauren. I would also say that \u2013 to what Andreas was talking about is, when you look at our win rates this year compared to our win rates last year, we feel good about where we are in both businesses. Volume erosion in the Q1 was above average, and as I said, I think we still expect to see pressure in the first half of this year. As that works out, we've got \u2013 certainly the situation in Latin America is challenging. We've got key customers there. Two of the key local and regional customers are clearly going through destocking. And again, as I said, we're not expecting that to turn around significantly, but we expect the impact to lessen as we progress through the year. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, on the Ingredients business, so you mentioned that the spread between pricing and input costs, reading the Q, it just doesn't sound like the input cost basket is all that much worse, so it feels like maybe more pricing concessions or raw pressure in the business. So, can you just talk a little bit about that, and sort of plans to combat that dynamic? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. When you look overall, the net of pricing, the input costs is \u2013 as a percent of sales, the net impact in the quarter is little less than a point. Of that, about a third of that is price, so that's principally related to the Ingredients business. Two-thirds of that \u2013 the other part of that is really, as we talked about in the commentary, it's related to the Fragrance compound business, both the effects of core list agreements and getting on to new agreements, as well as the volume-related rebates. So, it's principally \u2013 those are the two factors in that split. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And is that core list, kind of fee and rebates, is that something that's always been a feature of the business, or has things gotten more competitive, that that's kind of a new dynamic to get access? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I think that's always been there for \u2013 as we get access to more business, I mean, there's a bigger impact to that. But the effect of the global and the large customers using \u2013 requiring that, it's been around for years. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. I'll pass it on; I'll come back if there's time. Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thanks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thanks, Lauren. Operator : Your next question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good. How are you doing? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thanks, Silke. I'm okay. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good. If you look at your 2% organic growth in the quarter, was it 3% volume, negative 1% price? Was it 4% volume, negative 2% price? Like, how does one think about it? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: As I mentioned earlier, I would say that the new win commercial performance was strong. It's in line with our long-term averages. Pricing was slightly unfavorable, and I talked about that \u2013 just my previous comments with Lauren. And as I also said, volume erosion was a little worse than the long-term averages. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So you \u2013 okay. So, that's a volume erosion, but organic growth, and you think your price were down slightly, so that's down like 0.5%. Is that what slightly is? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, if you \u2013 I mean, overall.... Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, how do you measure negative price versus the rebate? Because it seems to me, you seem to capture rebates... Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: That's in price. That's embedded in the price number that I gave you. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. In terms of the Fragrance Resources acquisition, I think there was like no benefit from the sales considered added this quarter. Is that just a one-time event, having to do with like the inventory write-ups and then you expect the business to contribute for the rest of the year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Are you talking about in the 10-Q, Silke? Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, just when I look at the Fragrance results and I look at the acquisition impact, like it looked like there was a sales impact that was positive, but no profit effect. So I was wondering, was that sort of like a one-time issue because you just bought it, you had to write-up inventories and you expect it to contribute to profits? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. There's two factors. One is, we have to write-up the inventory to basically selling price. So, the initial \u2013 as the initial sales of the inventory, we basically get no margin on it, or very little margin on it. I think that will continue probably for at least another quarter. On top of that, we have, obviously, we have the step up in intangibles which will continue, and we'll have that for multiple years and it really drives the impact, the synergies. Ultimately, as we ramp up the synergies, that's how we get back to cost of capital returns. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I want to touch one more (36:38) like Latin America, because it seems that some of headwinds in Latin America has been \u2013 like when I look back, I think some of these we've seen now for like three quarters or four quarters and so. Like it does seem that by the time we get to the second quarter, your Latin America business should begin to get better. Well, like it seems you had these headwinds for that time, it's like four quarters whereas headwinds of the consumer side than on Ingredient side \u2013 I'm sorry, on the Fine Fragrance side than on the Ingredient side? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I mean, again, from a business standpoint, Latin America again I think Flavors is performing well. From our Fragrance standpoint, we've got a couple of factors. Again, the macroeconomic factors are certainly impacting the overall region. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a couple of key customers that their business is under pressure. And on top of that, we know that they're going through destocking. And that's \u2013 until they get to that process, it's going to continue to impact us. I think the other factor is when you look at our Fabric business, which is our biggest business in consumer. We are a little bit \u2013 we are more indexed to the value-added segment, particularly related to our encapsulation around, say, something like fabric conditioner in a market like Latin America, we see consumers trading down and are not purchasing fabric conditioners as much as they are doing basic detergents. So, that's part of what's dragging the Consumer Fragrance business down and providing the big headwinds that we've seen for multiple quarters. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. The last question I have is, can you just explain \u2013 maybe I missed it \u2013 what the product recall relates to like and like in which region it affected? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. It's North America. There was a contamination issue that we traced back to one of our suppliers. Our own quality control and testing procedures identified the (38:49) contained the salmonella. We notified the customer and the FDA, and they've mandated a product recall. We don't believe it's reached the consumer, and there has been no reported illnesses. As a result of that, we wrote off our sales related to the inventory, and we wrote off our remaining inventory, and that was the total charge of about $1.8 million in the quarter. We do believe it's probable that we're going to have additional losses and costs, but we can't estimate it at this point in time. But we don't believe it's going to have a material impact on our financial condition, but it could have an impact on any particular quarter. And we'll also continue to pursue reimbursement. But again, it's very early in the process. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for the explanation. I'll get back into queue. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.: Hi. Sorry if I missed this earlier. Could you update us on input costs, please? What was the impact in Q1? What do you expect for the full-year? And could you also update us on what you're seeing in vanilla in Madagascar? Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Just a couple of things there, Heidi. Impact in the first quarter was slightly unfavorable. We've got and that's higher input costs for the Flavors business, particularly driven by the naturals and the vanilla that we talked about previously. Favorable on the Fragrance side of the business, but slightly unfavorable in total. For the full-year, I would say that we're looking probably at this point in the range of 3%. It could continue to go higher, depending upon what's going on with particularly vanilla. Vanilla continues to increase in the market. There's been supply constraints. There's a lot of pressure from a demand standpoint, and we continue to see vanilla prices going up. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.: And I guess you have a bit of stop, so you're incubated from these market crisis for a couple of quarters. Would that be the right way to think about it? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I would say we're more incubated on the David Michael side. And on the rest of our business, particularly in North America and Europe, we're working with our customers on pricing. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I just wanted to \u2013 morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the pricing. So, we're talking about that our price is going up 3%. Have you \u2013 I know you said you're in the process of having conversations with your customers. Have you sort of gotten any pushback on taking pricing? Has the environment changed at all from previous years? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, again I think it's primarily in \u2013 the pricing is primarily in the natural side of the business and more on the Flavors side, as I mentioned earlier. Overall, that's reflected in roughly 3% guidance that I just mentioned earlier, and we are working with our customers on that to recover those costs. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. So, no change. And then just if you could talk a little bit about Ottens? And then I guess more broadly, if you could talk about what the organic growth of the business would've been assuming all of these acquisitions were in the base period? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, let me talk about the two acquisitions we did in North America and the Flavors side, Ottens and David Michael. This is all a lot of exposure towards the small and mid-size customers. We see here a good development. We see great new wins going forward, and we see that the performance is certainly outperforming the market. If we look at our market data right now, we should be the market leader for this segment of the market which was the intent of these two acquisitions to make sure that we increase our exposure towards these faster-growing customers. In terms of the sequencing, we acquired David Michael in October. So, I would say end of this October, it turns into organic. And Ottens is already organic. So, it's not accounted any longer as an M&A. Let's say, growth number is already an organic number and it's helping us with our organic growth acceleration anyway. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But if you assume that Fragrance Resources and David Michael were in the base, what would your pro forma organic growth would have been? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I mean, as we indicated, when you look at the first quarter, it was about 5 percentage points, worth of growth. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'll follow-up offline. I mean, the 5 percentage includes the incremental benefit of like the entire sales, right? So, I just want to know sort of on an organic basis how those businesses are doing. But I'll follow-up. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. We can follow-up on it. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Curt Siegmeyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Curt. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just a follow-up on unplanned expenses. I know you clarified on the product recall cost uncertainty related to that, but would you expect any costs related to the manufacturing or the bad debt litigation to carry into 2Q or beyond? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Bad debt, no. I think, we might have a little bit of carryover into Q2 on the manufacturing side. The reactor is back up and running, so that's not going to be an issue for Q2. But the other issue where we've ramped-up the new manufacturing process, there will be a little bit of carryover into Q2. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then just on Fine Fragrances in Latin America, the volume erosion that you experienced there. I know that's been an issue for several quarters in a row. But I'm just wondering, when you compare that to the Flavors side that showed really solid volume growth, is there a vast difference in the geographic exposure and that being part of the reason as the economic conditions that impacted Fine Fragrances not \u2013 is impactful on the Flavors side or maybe just some more color around that? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I would say, Curt, that certainly the Fine Fragrances is in a, let's say, in a weak economic environment, more discretionary item and people save on it. But on the food side, probably not so much. And with all products, in particular, in Latin America, we are let's say exposed to let's say better cost solutions like with the powder drinks, for example. So, that we basically hitting actually an area which has good growth rates. Unfortunately, that's not the case with the Fine Fragrances and here we have to say as well as particularly two of our local customers where we are very strong, we have very high win rates, still they are suffering volume losses here. So, that's what it is. That actually is the difference between the Flavors and the Fragrance business as well. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And the destocking that I mentioned earlier. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And the destocking. Yeah. Curt A. Siegmeyer - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Morning. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Maybe a question on customer activity and I know you talked about some, obviously the sales pressures that your customers are facing have been significant especially in Latin America. And you've talked about new business wins start to layer into the portfolio later this year. Can you talk about the activity level in terms of new briefs and if your larger MNC customers in particular have maybe shifted a little bit out of (47:30) kind of cost containment and are actually trying to accelerate that new product cycle to reinvigorate growth and how that provides visibility to get later into this year or into 2018? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's a very, very good question. We see it actually stable for the big ones compared with last year. But we are seeing increasing activity from the smaller customers and particularly on the Flavors side. And that's encouraging taking our strategy into account, while we are increasing our exposure here. But in the big ones, we haven't seen an increased level so far. It's just pretty stable compared to what it was last year. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then on the Fine Fragrance side, in your customers' distribution, it's disrupting, to say the least, with the department stores, especially in North America. Are you starting to see that flow back into your business in terms of the customer , as new distribution channels become much more important to that business? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Absolutely. And you hit the nail here. It is, in particular, North America, where the distribution model that's changing, and particularly on the more Mass (48:43) Fragrance, Fine Fragrance part. And here, it's actually of the essence to make sure that we as well, and our customers, let's say, find the right mix of the products between the prestige, the premium, and the mass and masstige (49:00) market. I think that's really, really important. Interesting enough, it looks \u2013 at the moment, it's very much a North America issue. Europe looks still different. And if you look at our growth rates, you can reconcile that. But that's certainly a topic for our customers, and ultimately a topic for us as well. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And can you talk about the margin implications of that? Do you see that presenting risks, as some of those Fine Fragrance can be particularly rich in terms of the margins? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. At least not on our end so far. No, we don't see any risks. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. Andreas, I want to talk about, could you give us a rough sense, your split of business between \u2013 across the company \u2013 between the large global companies and smaller regional companies? I know you talked, gave us a little detail about the trends there, but what is that \u2013 how big have smaller regional companies, however you want to customers define that, become within your mix? It is \u2013 I mean, I know the trends are better, is the cost-to-serve those customers, because of increased complexity, a little bit higher than your larger customers, at least on a marginal basis? And is that maybe part of what we saw this quarter, or is there anything to that? I'd just like to understand it. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Well, it's a good point. So, for us, our exposure, big two, the smaller one is roundabout 50/50. What we see is, or what you have to do if you serve the smaller customers is that you need a differentiated service model, which creates, let's say, actually a better approach for these customers which is more agile, faster, more nimble, and has certainly, also on our side, probably lesser exposure to cost, because the good thing is, many of these customers are making faster decisions, and you basically get the business earlier and faster than with the bigger ones. And usually, you don't have a core list exposure where you have to say, bigger rebates to get on this list, for example. And that's the reason why, on the Flavors side here, in the U.S., we are having kind of a standalone facility now serving these customers. And that's basically everything, the whole operation between Ottens and David Michael, with some of our smaller business together to make sure that we take into consideration a really differentiated service model here. That's the only way that you can become successful in this market segment. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sorry. Go ahead. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Yeah. I was just going to say, would you say the \u2013 is there a structural cost to service you here at the margin that it just gets harder \u2013 I mean, a lot \u2013 it seems to me like a lot of your growth in margin over the past five years has been making everything more efficient, focusing on more \u2013 larger briefs for huge customers, and this is a lot of what you've done. And now like a little bit more complexity maybe erodes that at the margin, but maybe brings some other things. So I just like to understand how that margin works structurally? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, let me just put some \u2013 a little bit in context. When you look at the year-over-year margin profile for the business, if you take the currency impact out, which is probably 80 basis points, if you take out the effect of the unplanned expenses that I mentioned earlier, which is probably 70 basis points at the margin level, so if you \u2013 absent those two factors, our margin year-over-year will be slightly positive. So, your cost-to-serve element, there's different components. Andreas talked about the Flavors side of it. If I look at the compound side for Fragrances, the smaller customers, we have less from a cost-to-serve standpoint, because more of that business is going to come off of our \u2013 out of our bank, and we have less of a creative demand related to the local and regional customers. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Brett Hundley - Vertical Group : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, guys. First, just a quick one. I'm sorry if I missed this, but what is M&A now expected to contribute to currency-neutral sales and EPS growth? Before, it was expected to contribute 4.5% to sales and 1.5% to EPS growth. And I think you guys said that that stepped up a little bit. Did you give those revised figures? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We didn't. I mean, it's about 1.5% at top line and 2.5% at the operating profit line. So it shifted a little bit, given the strong performance in the Q1 from the M&A business and the unplanned expenses on our Organic business in Q1. Brett Hundley - Vertical Group : I'm sorry, you said 1.5% top line, incremental 1.5%? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: The M&A impact, about 1.5% top line and 2.5% operating profit. Brett Hundley - Vertical Group : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, just for you and/or Andreas, even with these regionals, these smaller customers increasing as a percentage of your mix, as you well know, M&A is an increasingly greater proportion of your sales growth today versus previous quarters or previous years, however you want to look at it. And when we talk to other ingredient companies in the industry, other adjacent companies, they are increasingly talking about blends \u2013 ingredient blends as getting more and more in focus from a customer standpoint, being in greater demand relative to just single Flavor and Fragrance compound. And I know some of these guys are obviously talking their book, because that's what they produce. So, maybe I'll give you guys a chance to talk your book and discuss if you are seeing that as well and maybe how you guys are set up to handle any related shift? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, I would not say that you see a trend in that, but we see certainly that this is an opportunity. And if you look at on the Flavor side at our PowderPure acquisition, then this is certainly going into an adjacent part of the business, which could certainly add to that quite significantly. On the Fragrance side, I'm actually not so sure. I would say on the Fine Fragrance, you deliver the whole package anyway despite the packaging material. But we haven't seen anything else on the Consumer Fragrance side. There's probably more trend we see towards the Flavors and Ingredients business. And then here, we are taking account of it, but we have to make sure as well as that you keep your margin profile because some of these, let's say, complete solutions are not the most profitable ones, but we have to make sure that we manage that in a very careful way here. Brett Hundley - Vertical Group : That makes sense. Thank you so much. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You're welcome. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Brett, let me make one correction to what I just said. At the top line, it's about 4.5%. I transposed currency versus M&A. Brett Hundley - Vertical Group : Okay. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, it's about 4.5% top line. Brett Hundley - Vertical Group : Got you. So, no change to the top line impact and instead of 1.5% health now on the bottom line, it's 2.5% health? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Correct. Brett Hundley - Vertical Group : All right. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. I was actually going to clarify that so that's helpful. And then the other thing was on reinvestment spending. Another unexpected expenses in the quarter, but I just want to check in where in that bridge which we could find kind of any reinvestment considering there was this quarter? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's basically going to get netted in the cost and productivity, but again it's been limited, given the environment. I mean, I think the big part of the reinvestment is going to come as we talked about later this year and into 2018 as we get the full benefits associated with the productivity program. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then also on the bridge, the six-point contribution from volume. Is that inclusive of \u2013 that's including volume from acquisitions I would think, because I thought it sounded like total company volume wouldn't have that much positive leverage to it? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, the M&A's impact, all the M&A's in the... Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: ...is in the M&A line. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It is totally separate. So, is this level of volume growth which was \u2013 I would have thought was slightly down total volume. I was just surprised that there was this, again, positive leverage? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I will go back and check it, but... Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: ...that's apples-to-apples. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you very much for your questions and have a good day. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. Analysts: Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances' Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2017 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed our press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2017. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2017 and our press release that we filed yesterday, all of which are available on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce, Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Mike and good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everybody. I would like to start as usually with an executive overview of our operational performance for the second quarter. Then I want to provide an update on our Vision 2020 progress. Once finished, I will ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit, as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. I will finish by providing some closing remarks and then take any questions that you may have. Our second quarter results finished in line with our expectations. The improved trends across several of our key financial metrics, currency neutral sales grew 8%, including 11% growth in Flavors and 5% growth in Fragrances. On a consolidated basis, our top line growth benefited by approximately 6 percentage points related to the contribution of our recent acquisitions of David Michael and Fragrance Resources and to a less degree PowderPure. Organically, Flavors currency neutral sales improved 3% as all regions except Greater Asia posted solid results. Fragrances sales were flat as Fine Fragrances and Fragrance Ingredients including cosmetic actives was offset by challenging results in Consumer Fragrances. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 6% in the second quarter principally driven by the contributions from acquisitions, volume growth and cost savings initiatives. Currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 8%, driven primarily by operating profit growth, as well as year-over-year reduction in shares outstanding related to our share repurchase program. From a strategic perspective, we continue to make strong progress against the areas we have identified as strategic imperatives. In terms of innovating first in Flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit currency neutral growth across all categories led by beverage and savory. In Flavors Latin America, our proprietary delivery system continues to perform well contributing to strong double-digit growth in the second quarter. We also successfully rolled out a new flavor modulator for our Flavors to use in formulation development. This technology can enhance mouthwatering perception in snacks and baked goods, and can also enhance the perception of freshness and mouth feel in citrus flavored beverages. In Fragrances, we launched a new fragrance ingredient called Veraspice. This ingredient is a warm spicy note bringing together the opulence of natural white flower with a smooth tobacco leaf undertone. The smart combination between salty and tarragon classes contribute to the creative differentiation. I am also happy to report that our IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics team won the bronze award at In-cosmetics Global 2017 Innovation Zone Awards with Siligel. Siligel is a natural gelling agent, providing improved skin feel and provides high resistance to electrolytes. Benefiting from recent strategic acquisitions of David Michael, Fragrance Resources & PowderPure, as well as from strong growth in our organic Flavors business, we saw a robust 90% increase in North America in the second quarter of 2017. We also saw robust growth trends in the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter as currency neutral sales improved strong double-digits with the contribution from both Flavors and Fragrances. We continue to position ourselves to be our customer's partner of choice and go-to supplier. In the second quarter of 2017, we launched Tastepoint by IFF designed to service a dynamic middle market customer in North America. I will speak more about this exciting launch in a moment. I'm also proud to acknowledge that we are the first and only Flavor and Fragrance house to sign the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's new publication, The CEO Guide to the Circular Economy. The purpose of the guide is to help companies embrace the Circular Economy mindset. We believe that the Circular Economy is one of the biggest opportunities to transform production and consumptions throughout the value chain. By sharing this information, we can be a vital link to unleash innovation needed to create positive transformational change in the world. I'm pleased to report that our three recent strategic acquisitions are key drivers of our financial performance. The combination of David Michael, Fragrance Resources and PowderPure contributed approximately 6 percentage points of sales growth and 4 percentage points of operating profit growth in the second quarter. In addition, Lucas Meyer Cosmetics acquired two years ago, continued to be a growth driver as Cosmetic Active Ingredients grew strong double-digits in the second quarter. More forward-looking, in the second quarter we also announced that we have joined the MIT Media Lab to Accelerate Sensorial Open Innovation. Our membership in the MIT Media Lab Alliance, is our strategy, which underscores how we are committed to innovation as an accelerator of business growth. Since 1985, the MIT Media Lab has combined a vision of digital future with a new style of creative invention. With was more than 30 years of innovation and 150 spin-off companies, The Media Lab currently supports 27 research groups and over 450 projects focused on designing the future. We are proud to join this innovation lab and collaborate with the next generation of research break-throughs. I would now like to take a moment to expand on our exciting launch of Tastepoint by IFF. Born out of the combination of David Michael and Ottens Flavors, the new brand was first revealed at the IFT 2017 conference in Las Vegas. Tastepoint is designed to serve as a dynamic and fast growing middle market customers in North America, which we believe will help us to drive growth going forward. By combining the long established and well regarded relationships of Ottens Flavors and David Michael with the R&D, technology and consumer inside of IFF, Tastepoint offers a new and innovative go-to-market approach that targets the unique needs and expectations of this subset of customers. As a fully dedicated organization within IFF, we believe we are well established and have a competitive advantage to meet the expectations of our middle market customers. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Andreas. To reiterate what Andreas mentioned earlier, our financial results for the second quarter were good, consistent with our expectations. Currency neutral sales improved 8%, including approximately 6 percentage points related to our recent acquisitions of David Michael's, Fragrance Resources, and to a lesser extent PowderPure. Our top-line performance both organically and inorganically continues to be driven primarily by new wins across both businesses. Our adjusted operating profit on a currency neutral basis grew 6% and currency neutral adjusted EPS improved 8%. Also want to take a moment to highlight our first half results. Our currency neutral sales growth in the first half was strong at 7%, with 11% growth in Flavors and 4% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 5% on a currency neutral basis driven by contributions from acquisitions, volume growth and the benefits associated with our productivity programs. Our currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 9% in the first half, further benefiting from a lower tax rate and a reduced number of shares outstanding. Looking at our business unit performance for the second quarter, Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 5% driven by broad-based category growth and the acquisition of Fragrance Resources. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 11% on a currency neutral basis, including Fragrance Resources. Organically, performance was driven by double-digit growth in Greater Asia, EAME and North America, more than offsetting softness in Latin America, where we continued to experience abnormally high volume erosion due to weak economic conditions. Consumer Fragrances grew 1% on a currency neutral basis, including additional sales related to the acquisition of Fragrance Resources, as well as low single-digit improvements in Fabric Care and Home Care. On an organic basis, currency neutral sales declined as several of our largest household and personal care customers are continuing to experience volume weakness in various end markets plus continued weakness in Latin America and China. This ultimately impacted our volume on existing business and more than offset contributions from new wins. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 9% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. IFF Lucas Meyer's also continued to perform nicely as we grew double-digits in the second quarter. From a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit decreased 3% on a currency neutral basis, as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price and input costs, as well as a weaker sales mix. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, our profit margin remains strong, yet was under pressure year-over-year, driven by the items mentioned above plus the Fragrance Resources acquisition, which is inclusive of step-up and purchase price accounting before we fully realized synergies. Flavors currency neutral sales increased 11%, driven by strong contribution of sales related to David Michael and to a lesser extent PowderPure. On an organic basis, we achieved broad based organic growth across all categories driven by new wins. From a regional perspective, three of the four regions delivered growth led by strong double-digit performance in North America, which improved 30% reflecting additional sales related to the acquisitions of David Michael and PowderPure, as well as strong double-digit growth in Dairy and high-single-digit growth in Savory. EAME increased 9% on a currency neutral basis led by mid single-digit increases in Central, and Southeastern Europe and low single-digit increases in Western Europe, as well as additional sales related to the acquisition of David Michael. Greater Asia was soft in the second quarter, decreasing 2% on a currency neutral basis as double-digit growth in Thailand and India, plus low single-digit growth in China was more than offset by challenging conditions in Indonesia. Within that market, we're seeing a change in purchase behaviors as consumers limit spending, as cost of living has increased recently due to lower subsidies and higher taxes. Growth in Latin America continued, improving 11% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Argentina and Colombia. Flavors currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 14%, led by volume growth, the benefit of acquisitions and our productivity initiatives. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, we experienced margin expansion year-over-year of approximately 70 basis points to 24.2%. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow was $58 million in Q2 on a year-to-date basis, compared to $172 million in the comparable 2016 period. Performance was adversely impacted by the previously announced ZoomEssence litigation settlement, which is about $56 million. And despite having core working capital level slightly improved due to accounts payable, we were challenged by lower net income, higher incentive compensation payments compared to the prior year period. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $46 million in capital expenditures, or about 3% of sales. And we believe, we'll spend approximately 4.5% of sales in 2017. Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in the first half we spent approximately $101 million on dividend payouts and $53 million on share repurchases. Last week, our board of directors authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share. The increased dividend is well aligned with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, returning 50% to 60% of adjusted net income as we strategically invest to drive long-term sustainable growth, while returning value to our shareholders. We believe this increase underscores our confidence in our continued financial strength and the long-term outlook of our business. Turning to our outlook, for the full year we remain optimistic that we can achieve our previously stated currency neutral financial guidance recognizing that end-market volume growth remains soft, particularly with our global and multinational customers. We are reiterating our currency neutral sales growth projection of 7.5% to 8.5%, which will be primarily driven by the contribution of acquisitions in David Michael's and Fragrance Resources, as well as modest organic growth primarily in Flavors. From adjusted operating profit and EPS perspective, excluding the impact of currency, we expect to achieve 5.5% to 6.5% and 6.5% to 7.5% growth respectively. For modeling purposes, please note that in Q3, we expect to have higher interest expense related to the dual carrying costs of our recent $500 million bond issuance, as well as existing private placements that are maturing in late September. Please take note of this when you think about EPS in the third quarter. We will also see favorable reduction in interest expense in Q4. While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, the effect of currency movements on our results have moved. From a top-line perspective, the impact of currency improved by approximately 50 basis points, to a 1% headwind, primarily driven by an improvement in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate. On a profit basis, we anticipate a 100 basis point improvement versus the last quarter guidance and on EPS a 50 basis point improvement. As a result on a full year basis, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on adjusted operating profit to be approximately 1.5 percentage points and approximately 2.5 percentage points on adjusted EPS. For your reference, please note that we remain hedged at approximately 75% on our net euro profit exposure, at approximately $1.12 and our forecast is based on current rates for second half of this year. With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. In summary, we are pleased that we have achieved currency neutral growth across all metrics in the second quarter of 2017. Simultaneously, we continue to be focused on the execution of our Vision 2020, as we believe our emphasis on building great differentiation, which in turn should lead to sustainable profitable growth. We are on track to deliver our previously stated 2017 financial goals. With that, I would like to open up the call to your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Mark. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess, first question is on the sales guidance for the year, and specifically, for the back half of the year. So, what gives confidence that you're going to be able to achieve the anticipated acceleration that's implied by the numbers? It would seem like you'd have to get to at least close to 4% in the back half of the year on an organic basis? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Mark, thank you for the question. First of all, we see in terms of our win performance going forward is one argument. The second thing is that we had at least on the fragrance side actually a pretty good and favorable comparison for the third quarter. And we had with all the uncertainties around the third quarter, but we had a pretty good start into the third quarter already. Rich, do you want to add? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. I think a couple extra comments, Mark, from my side. I think, we do expect on the fragrance compound side to benefit from a couple things : one, some new product launches and wins that are expected to hit in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in Latin America. And we do expect to see some reduced headwinds in Greater Asia. And as Andreas talked about, I think we are starting to see signs of stabilization of the inventory levels at our customer standpoint. So we're expecting to see less headwinds from a destocking standpoint in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the productivity acceleration in the second quarter, how sustainable is that? And what should we take from the increase in R&D spend? Is there thoughts on increasing that more longer term given just weakness at your customers from a volume perspective? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Mark, let me take the first half and then Andreas will talk to the R&D investments. When we look at our productivity objectives for this year, I'd say we are on target through the first six months. The impact is probably on the range of 3.5 percentage point of improvement in the first half of the year, so somewhere $10 million, $12 million roughly. And I think that positions us well to deliver on the full-year outlook, particularly as we start to get benefits later in the year related to Fragrance Resources, although the bulk of those synergy benefits are going to come next year. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: On the R&D front, we certainly invest wherever we think we get a good return, and we have certainly a pretty robust program in place with really very differentiating projects here. And we are now in basically, in the Phase 2 to look what could be the budget for next year, but it's not decided that we will significantly ramp up the R&D, but we'll certainly put the R&D dollars behind the projects where we think we can really create differentiation. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So just to be clear then, Rich, on your first part. So the selling and administrative piece, is that a reasonable level to use over balance of the year? Or with overall expectations trending to longer-term targets, is there more of an increase in accrued compensation expense in the back half of the year? I mean, just sort of puts and takes would be helpful there. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think there's a couple of different dynamics going on there, Mark. I would say from an SG&A standpoint, there are some of the projects that I've talked about earlier around the corporate projects particularly on the finance area that we will have some increased spending in the second half of the year. On the other side, remember that on a year-over-year basis, last year incentive comp came down as results weakened, and so we will see increased incentive comp expense this year versus last year in the second half. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Gunther. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Just on raw materials, can you confirm the 3% cost inflation for this year that you highlighted with Q1? And add onto that, given the currency moves we've seen recently, is this guidance is in dollar or in euro terms? Thanks, guys. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. So for the first one, I think we still see input cost in the 3% range for the full year. There will obviously be some timing impacts related to that when it flows through from a P&L standpoint. The increase is, again, primarily driven by naturals on both business units, whether it's vanilla or citrus, those are impacting both business units. From a currency standpoint, it's based on our current \u2013 our guidance that I gave you is based on existing exchange rate, the latest exchange rate. So call it roughly a $1.18 euro-dollar exchange rate, as that flows through, that's embedded in the guidance. And that's on a \u2013 the dollar basis will be, what I talked about, net of currency, that will be on a reported dollar basis. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: That's, great. Thanks. Have a nice day. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. How are you? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Silke. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I was trying to like puzzle out your results in the Flavor division excluding the acquisitions. So David Michael, this is like $85 million in annual sales and PowderPure like $15 million and $20 million. So if you distribute it through the second quarter, did your North American business grow or didn't it grow because it looks like it's all acquisition growth. It looks like the underlying growth was negative? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, I mean North America, remember PowderPure, we only had it for a portion of the quarter. It had, on a total company basis a negligible impact in terms of sales growth in the quarter, I would say less than probably 30 basis points at a total company basis. When you look at North America for flavors, I mean the organic business grew mid-single digits and the balance of that relates to the contribution of David Michael's. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Mid-single digits, okay. Where did the growth in flavors come from on the mid-single digit range? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think it's growth across all the categories. Particularly I would say we had double-digit growth in snacks and dairy and mid-single digit growth in sweet. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And it's all driven \u2013 it's primarily driven by new wins. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And we are actually pretty proud because you know just a year and half backwards, you saw that we had not so good of an organic performance in Flavors North America, and team has turned this around quite significantly. And that has led to the mid-single digit growth in North America and on top of it we have the great performance of Tastepoint as well, and that makes it actually a very good and sustainable business for us. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. And I wanted to ask one question on your cash flows if I may. And I was wondering if you had sort of like an operating cash flow targets for the year. So, in the quarter like I understand even if we strip out the litigation settlement, like your operating cash flows were like $114 million versus $173 million last year. So if you leave all the items in like what is your operating cash flow target for the year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Look the specific target I'll have to get back to you. I don't think we have that said or communicated that. I would tell you that the decrease year-over-year was roughly on a year-to-date basis $115 million. So $56 million of that is the settlement on ZoomEssence. We've got lower income, including the non-cash gain on the derivative or liquidation of the subsidiary. So that was two combined about $20 million, $10 million in incentive comps year-over-year and there's another $10 million roughly associated with deferred taxes and indirect taxes. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for the clarification. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. So I was wondering, Rich Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, Faiza, good morning. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Rich, if you could try and quantify for us the impact this quarter from the destocking and how that offset the new win performance that would be really helpful. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: The specifics are \u2013 it's hard to specifically identify the impact. I will tell you that we saw a pretty sizable increase in back-outs in the last week, the week and half of the quarter. I will say that on top of that we have seen \u2013 we're encouraged by the start to the third quarter. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then could you just remind us \u2013 you're spending a lot in CapEx. I think you said 4.5% of sales. Could you just remind us sort of where you're building new facilities or sort of where that is going? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's principally around the facilities in Greater Asia and the deployment of technologies around delivery systems and some of the capacity. But we've got a big piece in China. We've got two new facilities that are going on there. We're going to have to continue. And as you know, we've talked that we're going to have some peaks in next year, this year, next year, and 2019 around 5% because not only do we have China, but we've got Indonesia and India that we have to deal with. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And in particular, India is important to us because it's a high growth market for us, and we really have to make sure that we have state-of-the art facilities in India, and we will invest in two more manufacturing plants in India and we are well underway to do that. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, Andreas, if you could just expand a little bit more on Tastepoint. Sort of just practically what's the difference in terms of how you're approaching your high growth, medium-sized customers versus what it was maybe before Tastepoint? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. So I would say that our exposure, and particular in the U.S., towards this middle market was not so good before we acquired actually Ottens two years ago. And we saw it with all the changing trends and the struggle of many of the bigger multinational global companies that we have to change our exposure towards the more dynamic markets. And with the entrance of Ottens, we saw that that's a very, very good hub for us. And we have combined this now with David Michael, made it Tastepoint, and that's creating actually our outlet in terms of customer segmentation towards exactly that dynamic middle market. They have the flexibility of a small company, but they can use the great technology we can give them from IFF, and that makes them uniquely positioned for that marketplace. And what we see so far is, first of all, the launch at IFT in Vegas went very well. The people are very motivated and our customers are very excited about this opportunity to work with us. What we see so far is probably two times to three times of growth we have in our organic business. So I think it's really important. And I would say, as we always say, it's small enough, but still big enough to help with technology. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first on the gross margin side. I'm wondering if you can give a little more color on maybe the price/cost headwinds specifically that you absorbed in the quarter, or if the gross margin decline will be on a percent basis is attributable to acquisitions and confident that can actually flip positive later this year as you get right side up on price/costs. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Let me try to answer that in the following manner. I'll talk to the overall return on sales profile for the two businesses. Flavors improved by roughly 90 basis points year-over-year. It's principally driven by productivity, cost, and volume. And price to input cost net were slightly favorable. And those were offset by unfavorable mix. And to a certain extent and slightly by FX. When you look at the Fragrance return on sales profile, it went down about 140 basis points. Price to input cost and M&A, which is principally related to Fragrance Resources, those were each about 1 point of headwind year-over-year and mix was probably another I'm going to call it 20 basis points. So those three items more than offset the benefits associated with volume and productivity gains. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And as you think about those pieces moving forward. I mean, Fragrance Resources that impact was fully layered in for the balance of the year. But I presume if there is an expectation of a reacceleration in organic in the back half that you should start to get then some tailwinds on the gross margin line as well. Is that fair? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. I think as we look at the second half of the year, I would expect to see improvements in Fragrances, again, as we have better leverage from a volume standpoint. There is still some volatility associated with sales mix. And then I think the biggest part of the benefit associated with Fragrance Resources, as I said earlier, will come next year, as we fully realize \u2013 we get the bulk of the synergies next year. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up actually on Tastepoint. I'm wondering if this is a model that you see as replicable in the current organization in other regions or do you think that has to be done via M&A? And specifically on Tastepoint in the U.S.? Do you have any growth targets or ambitions for that business that you could share? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. Actually that's a pretty good point because we see that this works very well in the U.S. market, and the challenge for our Flavors team or Taste team is basically to look, what can we do in the other geographies as well. But a prerequisite for that is a pretty big market because if you just take for example, Europe, you have a very fragmented markets for the different countries, and if you have an asset, let's say, in Spain, you probably can't serve a small customer in Germany. And so the challenge for us is right now to pick the right markets, let's say, a market like Brazil or let's say a market like China which has enough critical mass to cater for this kind of principle or this kind of model, but we're doing it because we really want to export it because what we have seen so far is really excitement on the customers' side and the results are pretty good as well. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Katie Grafstein with Barclays. Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. So, first I was just wondering, what drove the strong performance in Ingredients this quarter, especially in Latin America and Europe? And then I was just wondering if you could also talk a little bit about the unfavorable price to input cost dynamic in Fragrances. I know it's been going on for some time, but just curious if the level of rebates have changed or if that dynamic has improved at all since last quarter? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Let me take the first part and Rich takes the second part. So, the Ingredients business we have done probably a year ago quite some changes, how we approach our customers. We have also changed a bit our portfolio where we're working with it, we have changed our sales team, we have increased the sales productivity here as well and that has led already to a quite significant turnaround of our Fragrance and Ingredients business, and then we report the active cosmetics in that as well, which has yielded a double-digit growth for last quarter as well. So, all-in-all, actually it's an amazing turnaround story from lackluster performance for couple of years to a good growth engine for now and for going forward as well. Rich? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. So, Katie, let me go back to the pricing input. I'd say overall for the company was basically flat, favorable by about 1 point in Flavors and unfavorable by about 1 point in Fragrances. Your point about has the dynamic changed from last quarter, I would tell you that the pricing impact of Q2 for Fragrances compared to Q1 has improved by about 70%. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, Brett. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : My question was centered on Fragrance in Asia, and specifically Fine Fragrance in Asia accelerating during the quarter. And certainly, when you do the math, there's a portion of that that comes from Fragrance Resources in China, but the math also suggests that your legacy business is supplying nice gains in the region as well. And I think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks, so I just wanted to delve further into that and understand your organic performance in the region, and maybe even China specifically, and talking about whether or not that's coming from new wins, improved growth at existing accounts, any color you can give us there might be helpful. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, probably, let's start with a general comment is, if you look at Asia and the Fine Fragrance business, it's still a very, very small business. And the part of Fragrance Resources, we have bought into that was even smaller and it was actually a split between consumer and fine here as well. So, we see some movements in Asia, even in terms of Fine Fragrances, which is good for us to see because in the past, it was never a market which was very exposed to that category. We will see how it's going forward, particularly also in geographies like Japan, but certainly also China. So, still a small business, a very small piece of it is also Fragrance Resources and, yeah, we will see how we are going forward. In general, maybe backing off the just Fine Fragrance part going to the Consumer Fragrance, it's a tough environment we see in Asia and also in China, because we see that particularly for some of our bigger customers are that the market is changing and they have to adapt and we have to adapt as well, and here probably also compared with the question we had before on smaller customers, that plays a role as well that you have a good standing with some of the smaller or mid-sized customers in these markets as well. I don't know, Rich, whether you want to add? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, as Andreas was talking, I'll talk total Fragrance compounds for Greater Asia, I think keep in mind there was a strong double-digit comp in the prior year. So, if I look at it on an organic basis, it's down mid single-digits in the region, primarily driven by China, which is also down mid single-digits. And then, some of the same pressures we saw and mentioned regarding Indonesia impact, and Flavors also impacted Fragrances. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. And Rich, just quickly, do you have any update on some of the Fragrance Ingredient plant discussions and actions that you are taking in China this year. I think we're around the timing where you are in discussions with the government on a facility and maybe you've been taking some actions to move around some production there as well, do you guys have any update there? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I will say, Brett, that we're still in the discussions, it hasn't been formalized yet. I think it keeps \u2013 to be honest, it's kind of kicked out a couple of months effectively. So, we expect it to be in a position to talk about it now, it's going to have to be fourth quarter now. Brett Hundley - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I assume there's not a Tastepoint equivalent on the Fragrance side. I mean, there are obviously some small dynamic customers there, but there's not really any Ottens or David Michaels to acquire to serve that market I would assume? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: John, actually it's an interesting question because if you look at our Fragrance Resources acquisition, that's actually why we did it for actually two markets. One is in the U.S. because they have some of the smaller customers and we are capitalizing on it. And believe it or not in my home country in Germany, they are serving a lot of smaller customers out of the Hamburg facility as well, and that's very welcome because we were not very strong in Germany despite a good engagement with Henkel. And so, you see Fragrance Resources is a bit an entry into these smaller customer base like Tastepoint. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And then, Rich, if you look at your full year currency guidance and compare it to the first half realized currency, at the EPS level, it looks like in the second half it's roughly neutral year-over-year in currency, and is there a significant difference between the third and fourth quarter? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: As I said, when I look at the second half, keep in mind we had a favorable \u2013 in relation to our guidance for the full year for tax rate, call it, 22.5%, we were favorable in the first half of the year, that obviously then turns around in the second half of the year. As I also mentioned that I would see more pressure on EPS growth year-over-year in Q3, particularly related to the interest expense dynamic that I mentioned earlier. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : I was asking about currency that's there. The currency year-over-year in the first half was significantly higher than full year currency effect? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So currency, in general, will be favorable in the second half of the year, more of that coming in Q3 than Q4. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sorry. Operator : Your next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Yeah. I have a spectacular question, actually you just touched on it a little bit. What's your guidance on tax rate? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: That's the reason for the second question, okay. Sorry. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Just a short one I promise. It's been quite volatile, what's your guidance on tax rate for the last two quarters of the year, please? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So again, I think my guidance for tax rate hasn't changed since the beginning of the year it's about 22.5%. The calendarization of that of quarter-by-quarter, there is volatility in that depending upon specific items that occur in the mechanics in terms of how we have to report some of the items relative to the pre-tax in the quarter. So in general, the second half will be higher than the first half, but I'm still comfortable with the guidance of full year at 22.5%. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys, again thanks for the second question. I guess just broadly Andreas, what are your thoughts on industry consolidation given slowing customer volumes and maybe more specifically, how do you think about bolt-on versus larger scale M&A sort of given where we are and you've done a bunch of smaller deals and yeah, a broader context there would be helpful. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Mark, if you look at our M&A strategy, you know that we were not very active for many, many years. We've done now in the last two years round about five acquisitions and they have different, let's say, strategic reasons for it. Three of these acquisitions are basically to look whether we can broaden our exposure to small and midsize customers to grow on that front. Another one is basically going into an adjacent area like active cosmetic ingredients and PowderPure is a pure technology play because it gives us access to a technology which we had not before, which can help us to grow in certain segments of the business. So all of these things we have experienced. We are very happy with all of the five acquisitions and we're very happy that they are actually performing at or above the business case we have given, which is actually pretty, pretty good, if you look at five of these acquisitions. So, we certainly, certainly will go ahead with the bolt-on strategy because it just has paid off and we will make sure that that we continue that path. I certainly can't tell you how many and how big these are because it's a bit opportunistic as well. But that's certainly in the cards and we have to be disciplined here as well how much money we put at work. And for the transformational one, as usually I have to say, it depends on the opportunity and if the opportunity arises, we look at it and then we make a call and a decision. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And on the bolt-on piece, just out of curiosity, so you've done deals as you mentioned for customers and servicing middle market consumers in some ways, Lucas Meyer was an adjacent category, so as you think about it going forward, if you had a choice, is it that you want more the former or the latter? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: For me the most important question, and here I'm getting Rich already nervous. For me the most important thing is to create value. So, either one we take as long as we see an opportunity for us to create value in the long term, and that's probably the answer. But I have to say, I hope that we will do some more of this technology plays going forward because now we're geared towards this as well, because what we see was PowderPure was a patented drawing technology, which is a very great opportunity with less processed ingredients to go into a market segment, which is very natural and very, very organic, and even prevent food waste streams. That's something which is exciting as well and gives us exposure even some markets where we were not before like, for example, some of the natural color markets, because you know the technology leaves the color metrics intact in the ingredient, which is fantastic and our Flavors team is now looking at different directions and we'll build out of it. And we'll have unfortunately some CapEx, but it's not too big. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So Mark, let me wrap-up from my perspective. I think, both the technology side and the bolt-ons are attractive to us. I think we've demonstrated the ability to create value. And I think what's most important is that we continue to exhibit the financial discipline that we have around the targeting and the selection process. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much for all the insightful question. I guess, we will talk to, to many of you during our one-on-one calls, as well. Have a good day. Thank you, bye-bye. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances' Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2017 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.IFF.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2017, and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. As usually, I would like to start with an executive overview of our financial performance for the third quarter. Then, I want to provide some key highlights of our strategic progression. Once finished, I will ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit, as well as our cash flow statement and outlook for the remainder of the year. We are pleased with our third quarter results, as we achieved growth across all categories and regions. Currency neutral sales grew 12% on a consolidated basis, with an equal contribution from Flavors and Fragrances. Both business units delivered marked improvements versus the first half, moving from a low single-digit organic performance to mid-single-digit organic growth in quarter three, led by strong new win performance as well as improved volume trends on existing business. Our top line also continues to benefit from our recent acquisitions, contributing approximately 6 percentage points of growth in the quarter. At the same time, our focus on driving greater efficiencies throughout our business, via costs and productivity initiatives, continue to support overall profitability, as currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 7% this quarter. Rich will take you through the drivers of year-over-year profit performance. Currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 5%, driven primarily by operating profit growth, a lower effective tax rate and a year-over-year reduction in shares outstanding, which more than offset high interest expense related to dual carrying cost on our recent $500 million bond as well as existing private placements which matured in September. Fully recognizing that we have and continue to operate in a challenging global environment, we are pleased with our financial performance through September 2017. Our team continues to deliver winning innovative solutions to our customers, while achieving sustained profitable growth for shareholders. On a year-to-year basis, currency neutral sales growth for the first nine months was strong at 9%, with 11% percent growth in Flavors and 7% growth in Fragrances. Adjusted operating profit grew 5% and adjusted EPS increased 8%, both on currency neutral basis. I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight a few of our strategic accomplishments in the third quarter. In terms of innovating, first, in Flavors, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued its trend of strong double-digit currency neutral growth across all categories, led by Savory (sic) [Sweet] (5:00) and Dairy. In the Fragrance side, encapsulation-related sales grew high single digits, led primarily by Fabric Care and Personal Wash. Tastepoint, our new brand within IFF, designed to service the dynamic and faster growing middle market customers in North America, improved strong double digits in the third quarter. This early success shows that our efforts have been very well received by our middle market customers and that combining the long-established and well-regarded relationships of Ottens Flavors and David Michael is the right approach to serve these critically important growth accounts. Lucas Meyer Cosmetics, acquired now two years ago, remains a primary growth driver as Cosmetic Active Ingredients continues its strong growth, improving double digits in the third quarter. We also opened a fully-renovated and expanded facility in Cairo, Egypt. This investment supports both our regional focus on growth in the Middle East and Africa, as well as our focus on key categories, providing enhanced services to customers and strengthening our presence in the key market. The expanded labs will allow us to better serve our Egyptian customers and strengthen our market presence in Africa and the Middle East, as it remains a critical component of our long-term strategy. I should note that in the third quarter, our Middle East, Africa region improved high single digits. I'm also happy to announce that we recently launched our Re-Imagine programs in flavors to accelerate innovation and increase agility to capture unmet opportunities in the changing food and beverage market. Based on a combination of future trends analysis, consumer insight and a modernized cross-category development process, the programs guide our research and development efforts to ensure an innovation pipeline that addresses the evolving consumer needs and desires. It is another way in which we show how we are dedicated to being our customers' partner of choice as we progress our business strategy, imbue sustainable thinking throughout the creation process, and continue to strengthen our industry-leading innovation platforms. The programs focus on six key areas, including culinary, citrus, delivery systems, naturals, modulation and protein, and were selected based on market potential, customer input, expert industry collaboration and versatility across end-use categories. They consider a rapidly changing world from the expectation of sophisticated consumers too busy to cook for themselves, to the realities of a warming climate and its impact on key crops and ingredients, to an increased awareness of our role in the health of the planet. This extensive innovation platform requires an innovative approach to taste creation. To address this, our bespoke IFF Taste Design is a combination of artisanal, handcrafted techniques and proprietary technologies that drive consumer preference and market differentiation. We believe that both our Re-Imagine programs and our IFF Taste Design approach will provide our customers with winning tastes and further establish us as their essential partner. In terms of sustainability, I'm pleased to announce that we have joined FReSH, a project of the World Business Council on (sic) [for] (8:39) Sustainable Development designed to improve the health of people and the planet while recalibrating the global system of consumption, transportation, production, and agriculture, thus achieving the initiatives goal to make responsibly-produced healthy, enjoyable diets available for all. As a standing member of the WBCSD, IFF will join forces with the EAT Foundation and 25 leading businesses and science companies to accelerate transformational change in global food systems. We are passionate about doing the right thing and happy to have the opportunity to contribute in areas where we can make a positive difference in the world. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. [07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]: Thank you, Andreas. Before reviewing our results by business unit, I'd like to start by walking you through the drivers of currency neutral adjusted operating profit growth. On this slide, we show you the year-over-year impact in terms of contribution of growth, expressed as a percentage of our restated third quarter 2016 adjusted operating profit. Starting with the second bar, you can see that volume represented 15 percentage points of operating profit growth. In the third bar, the net contribution of acquisitions added 5 percentage points of operating profit growth, but please note that this also includes both operating performance and synergies. We also continued to benefit from our cost and productivity initiatives. Through the likes of formula optimization, procurement savings plus the restructuring program savings, we've delivered approximately 4 percentage points of benefit year-over-year. If we combine all cost and productivity programs into one bucket, including both organic and inorganic components, it would represent approximately 7 percentage points expressed as a percentage of operating profit. From a headwind perspective, as seen in the next bar, sales mix had a negative impact as we experienced stronger share of sales growth in Savory, specifically snacks; Fabric Care; and Fragrance Ingredients, which have lower than average margin profiles. In the sixth bar, price to input costs was unfavorable by about 4 percentage points, as favorability in Flavors was offset by Fragrance. This reflects targeted adjustments with select customers as well as strategic price reductions within Fragrance Ingredients. In the next bar, we have highlighted RSA expenses, which represented a 9 percentage point headwind. Please note that included in the bar is incentive compensation, where we have a large year-over-year variance, and represents approximately two-thirds of the change. Regarding incentive compensation, we are highly incentivized to deliver on our financial commitments. There are variations in incentive compensation, as it is based on our performance relative to our annual plan. If we achieve our financial targets, we receive 100% of our designated payout. Should we over or under-perform versus plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower. In terms of the year-over-year comparison in the third quarter, we have large delta as we are comparing to a lower base period due to under-performance (12:14) in the prior year quarter versus strong results in the current year quarter. For simplicity purposes, we grouped several miscellaneous items into Other, as they're negligible. Turning to the business unit reviews for the third quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 12%, with a strong contribution related to the acquisition of David Michael and, to a much lesser extent, PowderPure, as well as mid-single-digit organic growth where all categories, led by Savory, improved year-over-year, driven by new wins. From a regional perspective, all four regions delivered growth, led by strong double-digit performance in North America, which improved 28%, reflecting additional sales related to acquisitions, principally David Michael, as well as high single-digit growth on an organic basis, driven by new win performance in Savory and Beverage. EAME increased 12% on a currency neutral basis, inclusive of the additional sales related to the acquisition of David Michael, with the strongest growth in Beverage, (sic) [Savory] (13:28) and Dairy. On a geographic basis, Western, Central and Southeast Europe, as well as Africa and Middle East all reported strong growth. Greater Asia grew 2% on a currency neutral basis in the third quarter, driven principally by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in Thailand. Latin America increased 1% on a currency neutral basis, as growth in Colombia and Argentina more than offset softness in Brazil. In the third quarter, we experienced isolated pressure with a limited number of customers who are experienced challenges on a volume metric basis. On a currency neutral segment profit basis, Flavors grew approximately 19%, led by volume growth, the contribution of acquisitions and the benefit from productivity initiatives. Overall price versus input cost was slightly favorable in the quarter. The situation regarding raw materials, such as vanilla and citrus, remains fluid and volatile. And we continue to pursue price increases where appropriate. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, we achieved margin expansion year-over-year of approximately 130 basis points to 22.3%. Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 12%, as overall growth was broad-based, with a balanced contribution between organic and acquired businesses. Regionally, growth was strongest in EAME and Latin America, increasing double digits, followed by mid-single-digit growth in Greater Asia. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrance improved 18% on a currency neutral basis, including Fragrance Resources. Organically, performance was driven by strong new wins in EAME, Greater Asia and North America, as well as improved volume trends in Latin America. Some of those new launches included YSL Y, Armani Because It's You by L'Oreal, At The Beach by Limited Brands, and Pure XS by Pooch (15:37-15:47). Consumer Fragrances grew 11% on a currency neutral basis, with a balanced contribution from organic business and additional sales related to the acquisition of Fragrance Resources. Organically, nearly all categories achieved growth, led by strong double-digit growth in Home Care and high single-digit growth in Fabric Care, driven primarily by wins. I'd like to note that Consumer Fragrances showed a marked improvement relative to second quarter of 2017, growing 6% year-over-year, as volume on existing business was positive in Q3. Fragrance Ingredient sales were up 8% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Latin America. IFF Lucas Meyer Cosmetics also continued to perform well, as it grew double-digits in the third quarter. From a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profit increased 6% on a currency neutral basis, as volume growth, the contribution of acquisitions and the benefits from productivity initiatives more than offset unfavorable price to input cost, weaker sales mix and higher incentive compensation expense. We do expect to see input costs rising as we exit 2017 and, as such, have already initiated discussions with our customers regarding the need for price recovery in 2018. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, our profile remains strong at 20.2%. Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow was $199 million year-to-date which compares to $342 million in the first nine months of 2016. Performance was adversely impacted primarily by the previously-announced ZoomEssence litigation settlement, which was about $56 million, and higher working capital requirements, in particular, accounts receivable. It should be noted that we expect accounts receivable to improve going forward, partly due to timing, regarding stronger sales in Q3 with collections in Q4, and as well as traction on our improvement program. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $77 million on capital expenditures or about 3% of sales, and we believe we will spend approximately 4% to 4.5% of sales in 2017. Regarding cash return to shareholders, through the first nine months, we've spent approximately $152 million on dividends and $53 million on share repurchases. Last week, our Board of Directors approved an extension of our existing share repurchase authorization through 2022 with a total value of $300 million, including approximately $50 million remaining on our prior authorization. This share repurchase authorization is consistent with our established return of capital strategy and reinforces our belief that IFF is well-positioned for the future. Our strong financial position and cash generation enables us to return cash to our shareholders, as we continue to strategically invest both organically and through acquisitions to create long-term value for our shareholders. Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we remain optimistic that we can achieve our previously-stated currency neutral guidance for the full year 2017. We are reiterating our currency neutral sales growth projection of 7.5% to 8.5%, with the expectation that we could be at the higher end of that range. We expect high single-digit growth across both business units, with broad-based contributions from acquisitions and organic performance. From an adjusted operating profit and EPS perspective, excluding the impact of currency, we expect to achieve 5.5% to 6.5% and 6.5% to 7.5%, respectively. While our currency neutral guidance has not changed, the effect of currency movements on our results has moved. From a top-line perspective, the impact of currency improved approximately 100 basis points, essentially having no impact for the full year, primarily driven by an improvement in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate. On a profit and an EPS basis, we anticipate a 50 basis point (20:51) improvement versus last quarter. And on a full-year basis, we expect that the impact of foreign exchange on adjusted operating profit to be approximately 1% and approximately 2 percentage points on adjusted EPS. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. In summary, we are very pleased with the strong financial performance we achieved in the third quarter. We continue to be focused on the execution of our long-term strategy, accelerating growth, increasing differentiation, and driving cost efficiencies to drive sustainable, profitable growth in the future and maximize value creation for our shareholders. And, as Rich just stated, we are on track to deliver our previously-stated 2017 financial goals on a currency neutral base. With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Morning, Mark. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: It's afternoon where I am, actually, but nonetheless, wanted to ask about the top-line expectations for the year. So that implies fourth quarter with pretty nice acceleration on the tough comparison. I guess, trying of figure out exactly how to think about what's improving in the business, what gives you visibility that you're going to be able to see that improvement, given those comparisons? Maybe you could talk a bit about category and what sort of has surprised you. Obviously, with a strong third quarter number as you head into year-end and I know (22:33) preliminarily, but how you think about that heading into the first half of next year as well, when you have more favorable comparisons? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay, Mark, let me take it. So if we look into the fourth quarter, we had a strong start into the fourth quarter up to the end of October. So that's a good thing. What we see is that our performance, and particular in Fragrance, is just pretty, pretty strong. And it's continuing and has a very, very good momentum. On 2018, I prefer not to comment right now. You know, we do this usually in February because, first of all, we have to close our fourth quarter, but the start was pretty good. Rich, any... Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. A couple of things from my perspective, Mark, I mean, I think we did expect to see improvements in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. I think we've got good strong win performance in both businesses, particularly Fine Fragrance. In that category, you heard in our commentary regarding the third quarter, there's a strong volume component in terms of on existing business. Some of that, we believe, is event-driven and potentially timing. So the impact between Q2, Q3, Q4 is still a little bit volatile, but I think we feel, again, as Andreas said, looking at the start to the quarter, we definitely feel like it's the trend. I don't think it's going to be at the same level as Q3, but certainly an improvement versus what we saw in the first half of the year. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And just on gross margin, wanted to try to understand the puts and takes there and specifically try to figure out the puts and takes between mix and price concessions or pricing that you're giving customers. And maybe can you help us sort of explain exactly what is going on there. And I guess just lastly, how do you think about that going forward? I mean, I guess just fourth quarter, if you don't want to talk about 2018, but what the puts and takes are would be helpful. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. I mean, I think from the first standpoint, I mean, let me take mix as a starting point. As I said in the comments, I think mix is driven by our customers. And what they order is what we're going to deliver. And I think we saw, as I said : really strong growth, strong double-digit growth in Savory, particularly snacks, in the Flavors business, that has below average margins from an overall standpoint; Fragrance Ingredients, similar story, good growth, high single digits, below average margins; and Fabric Care, good growth. So I think that's clearly the drivers of mix. I think that we're going to still see mix headwinds in Q4. The second component of that, price to input costs, really, I would say, two different dynamics going on there. On the flavor side, as I said in my commentary, overall price to input cost was flat to slightly favorable. And we've been able to recover and pass through the increases that we're seeing in the naturals, that we've talked about previously, like citrus and vanilla. On the Fragrance side, we've got Fragrance Ingredients. We've talked about the strategic pricing changes we made late last year to rebalance and drive growth in that business by making modest changes in there. The impact related to that has been fairly stable. Where we're seeing the greatest amount of pressure is on the compound side. We've got large customers that have significant improvement objectives of their own. We have to work with them and balance their short-term objectives, but do it in a way that provides us long-term growth opportunities. We're not going to jeopardize the entire business. On top of that, we're starting to see an acceleration of input costs in the second half of this year. Input costs were up slightly in Q2 year-over-year for the Fragrance business. That accelerated in Q3. And that's why we talked about the need to drive and realize price realization going forward for the Fragrance business. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Could you just quantify the impact in gross margin between mix and price concessions? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I would say mix on gross margin was probably 60 basis points, more or less, and about 80 basis points for price and input costs. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kate Grafstein with Barclays. Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. So I just wanted to ask a question on the emerging markets growth. The 7% growth is the highest level I think since 2015. Do you see this as a sustainable inflection point? And I guess how much of the acceleration is about true market growth and an improvement in consumer demand or optimism from customers ahead of real consumer acceleration? And then just if you could also discuss the improvement in the context of both local, regionals and multinationals, that would also be helpful. Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You can get started. (28:23) Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure, Katie. I mean, I think it's still quite volatile. I think that, as I talked about, I mean, I think that we've seen on the last call and then we talked about in today's call that I think we've seen improvements in Latin America on the Fragrance side, improvements in Brazil. One of our largest customers, a local regional customer, has had a strong turnaround in their business in Brazil and Latin America in the third quarter. We feel good about that. But I would not say that we're sort of out of the woods. We saw strength in, I think, Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, certainly for Flavors; continues to be a positive and a bright spot. I think that on the Fragrance side, Indonesia and India had strong growth in the quarter. There's still uncertainty and challenges in Indonesia and China for the Flavors business. So I would say it's better. I'm not sure I'm ready to say it's an inflection point, but, again, there's a big piece of what we saw in both businesses in Q3 versus Q2, in particular, was the volume component on existing business was much better in Q3 versus Q2. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. On the local and regional customers, that's certainly a source of growth for us and a growth engine within the company, not just in emerging markets, but in particular in North America in the Flavors division with the setup of Tastepoint we have installed. We believe that this business model truly can help us to grow the business substantially. And it's shown in the numbers so far. Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And then, I guess also just talking about the acceleration in the developed markets, it's interesting just as the customers are talking about slower market conditions. So was wondering if maybe you can talk about that disconnect. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Well, what we see is, in particular in Western Europe but also in North America, good performance on both sides of the business. It's certainly driven by good win performance, in particular with the bigger ones. But as I said and reflected, the customer mix plays a super important role here. And with our setup, in particular in North America, that positions us very well for good growth rates and further growth to come. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think the other thing for me as I mentioned a couple times is the volume component is definitely stronger this quarter than five-year long-term trends. So I think some of this may be event-driven, whether it's timing between Q2 into Q3 as our customers adjust their order patterns, as they look at what's going on in their market. So I think it's a combination of factors. I mean, we feel good about the win performance. The volume component is hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter. Katie Grafstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP Paribas. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas : Hi. I wanted to ask a bit more about the Re-Imagine initiative you talked about. Could you maybe help us understand, maybe with an example, what the initiative is? Is it kind of like an integrated solution? And is what you're proposing here \u2013 what is the margin profile here compared to the rest of the group, please? Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi. Let me try to answer that in a way. It's actually a creative process to build our solutions. And it tries actually to look what the customers and consumers really need from the consumer insight perspective, figure out what are the most important trends, and then come up with solutions which bring as many of our technologies together as we can to make sure that we are well-positioned vis-\u00e0-vis our competition certainly, but also to satisfy the customer needs and that we basically focus our investments in R&D and applied R&D on the right areas like, an example, like naturals protein delivery systems. Talking about the margins, usually the margin should be very good because we combine a lot of technologies together to come up with these solutions. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys, nice quarter. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi, Mike. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I think you noted Cosmetic Active's another really strong quarter. Can you maybe talk about the momentum there? And are there other potential acquisitions to continue to build on to this business? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Mike, let me take it. First of all, what we see is that this part of the market has a nice growth also compared to the core F&F markets. So that's number one. Number two, in the segment where we play with Lucas Meyer, we are in the upper premium segment, which is usually more dynamic than the other segments of the market. And now, it's going into the natural actives as well where we are in particular strong because, remember, with Lucas Meyer, we have access to SouthernCross Botanicals in Australia. We have access certainly to our own naturals palette and naturals ingredients here as well. So it's going actually very, very well and we had a good start into the fourth quarter as well. So we foresee good growth for this business going forward. And as you were asking, we always evaluate other opportunities, whether we can strengthen this business in an inorganic way as well. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then encapsulation is another one that has continued to post pretty good growth there. Is it still just in the laundry side that you're seeing the growth, or have you been able to move into other markets that maybe could continue to grow into next year? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Actually, the expansion goes in different directions. The first one is that we are evolving out our encapsulation technology, which is now more multi-cap systems which help us in the classic fabric care area. But we are moving technology into other categories like hair care, for example, as well, and that's ongoing and in full, full swing. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Good morning, gentlemen. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Morning. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: My question relates to the price and the raw material costs, just following up from that. What was the pricing effect on your top line in the quarter? And given the recent trends and increases we're seeing in petrochemical intermediates, do you feel an increased urge to push up prices, especially in the Fragrance division going into next year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: In pricing itself, if you segregate it from the input cost piece, it was slightly favorable. I mean, it's less than 1 percentage point. On a combined basis, as I said, I think we are seeing what we believe the start of input cost increases on the Fragrance side and we're going to definitely have to work with the customers and get price increases to compensate for the input cost trend going forward. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Which we have done actually very well this year on the Flavors side already. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: And if I can just follow up, and when are you going to lap the price rebates in the Fragrance Ingredients space? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: End of the year, we'll lap it in the fourth quarter. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Faiza. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So a couple questions, can you just talk about what you're seeing from your multinational customers? So it seems like local regional customers, the performance with those customers was better. But are you seeing any improvement from the multinational customers at all? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think that if you look at Q3 itself, I mean, the growth was pretty well balanced between local and regional and global customers. I think the drivers of that might be slightly different, as I talked about. I mean, I think the local (37:38) continue to execute well and gain share. On the global side, I think there is some element, again, of volume. The volume swings from quarter-to-quarter, so in recovery in volumes on base business. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, Rich, just drilling in on some of the comments you made around events-driven and sort of timing factors, is that something that you saw globally or was it more concentrated in a particular region or category? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Let's see. I mean, it was fairly broad-based. I think it was largest in North America for Fragrances, a little bit in Latin America and in Western Europe. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then, just broadly, are you seeing any appetite for innovation from your customers across the board or do you feel like many are so just focused on whether it's short-term seasonal trends or sort of a quick pick-up from a new flavor or are you seeing sort of any sustained drive for innovation from your customers? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I would say we do. And in particular, it was really cutting-edge innovation if you talk about delivery systems or some specifics. So, that's what we see and that's actually very good and we try to drive this trend as well with our customers. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, Andreas, is this like a change that you saw this quarter or is it something that you've been seeing all year? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Actually, already for quite some time. It's not specific to the quarter, I would say. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Okay. And then, just last question from me on, Rich, I know you don't want to talk about 2018 at this point, but any guidance on FX would be really helpful in terms of the top-line and the bottom-line impact that you anticipate. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Let me think about this. I mean, I... Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You should have a crystal ball on FX. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. If I was, I would be on a beach somewhere probably. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Assume current spot rates. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, look, I mean, again, if we stay at where we are today, we're going to have a favorable impact from a currency standpoint in the first half of next year and probably more I'd say flat, mute-ish in the second half of this year. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good, very good. (40:20) Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Silke. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : My first question is in the quarter, you had you know 6% organic local currency growth and I think the profit improvement on that (40:35) was 15%, as you show in your slides and the acquisitions contributed 6% to sales growth, but the profit contribution was 5% and maybe if you strip out the synergies, maybe it contributed 2%. So the question is why is that and what type of contribution do you expect for 2018 from the acquisitions as you try to pull out cost synergies and you integrate these businesses? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. So a couple of things. Let me start with the organic business on the volume impacts, so then you've got the mix impact going as an offset to that. You've got pricing input costs offsetting that. And then particularly the incentive comp reset are all offsets that ends up bringing that number down. On the M&A side, keep in mind that we have the amortization expense that we have to get through all of our synergy programs before we start getting the incremental leverage. The sales come right away, but we've got to work through our integration plans. We've got to work through the cost savings programs before we start to get acceleration from an operating profit standpoint. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So that means like next year, the cost amortization still that means that even the contribution may not be... (42:05) Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Once we start lapping the amortization and we continue the process next year on realizing the synergies and we get the growth, then we'll start to get acceleration from an M&A contribution standpoint. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : What's the incremental amortization on the acquisitions year-over-year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: $3.6 million. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. My second question is what is behind the accounts receivable issue, why the receivables so high? Is it a regional issue where these sales took place, or is it just that you had most of your sales at the very end of the third quarter? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I mean, it's a huge increase in sales. We go from 2% organic growth to 6% organic growth. I mean, the biggest piece of it is just purely the volume effect in the quarter compared to where we were. If you compare December last year to third quarter this year, we had an acceleration in our business. If you compare December 2015 to third quarter 2016, you had a deceleration of the business. So you have a different dynamic going on. I fully expect that we're going to recover that from a timing standpoint and then we'll collect those receivables in the fourth quarter. And then, fourth quarter is seasonally a slower quarter. So, we'll be able to recover a large portion of that outflow. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Rich is already collecting. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It is a focal point. Believe me, it's a focal point for us. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Right, but the reason why I ask this is you had like an improvement in sales year-over-year in the second quarter as well and the receivable increase wasn't quite as big, but it's true, there is a large sales increase. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, there is a big difference in the performance. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I have two more questions. One has to do with Fabric Care. Is the growth in Fabric Care, does that have to do with new product launches or is it the case that products that were previously launched are now reaching better penetration, you're selling more of it and maybe that it goes to the detrimental of like what you can charge on price because you said it's sort of like a lower margin contribution? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's a big volume component in this number for (44:39) existing business. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: The win rates, they're good, but there's not been any significant uptick. It's driven primarily by the volumes on existing business. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. I understand. And lastly, can you pull out the acquisition a bit more specifically? Can you discuss what organic sales was like for North American Flavor excluding David Michael and what it was for European Flavors excluding David Michael? And maybe can do the same thing for North American Fragrances and European Fragrances if you strip out the Fragrance Resources acquisition, if you have that data. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, North American Flavors on an organic basis was 7%. North America organic for total Fragrances was down 3%. What other area were you... Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And in Europe, I think there was an acquisition piece in European Flavors and also in European Fragrances. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. So... Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I was wondering what the organic piece was. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. No problem, no problem. Organic in Flavors was 10% and organic in Fragrances was 11%. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Those are big numbers. Okay. Thanks very much. I'll get back into queue. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Adam. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: A lot of ground's been covered, but maybe just a question on operating leverage in the quarter, because the volume growth, I mean, very healthy, sounded like a little bit above 5%. And I'm just trying to think about if we can sustain those kind of operating profit levels into 2018 and you don't have the comp issue for incentive compensation this year versus last, should the implied operating leverage that you did in the quarter ex the incentive comp, should we think about that being sustainable into the first half of next year, especially when your organic revenue comps are not particularly challenging? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I'll sort of skip over the comment about not particularly challenging. But, I mean, look, I mean, I think as we head into next year, certainly incentive comp will be a significant less headwind than what we experienced in 2017. I think that we're going to continue to drive the productivity agenda that we've laid out at the beginning of this year. We've got to continue to execute against that. We've got to continue to look at investing in driving innovation that's going to help from a sales mix standpoint and a product mix standpoint. And we'll continue to look at our cost base and say how can we drive leverage through the P&L. It's a tough environment. It's volatile. As I talked about earlier, we're expecting input costs to go up next year, so our ability to pass those increases on to our customers on the Fragrance side is going to be critical to our success in 2018. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just a question specifically on Fine Fragrances, which did seem to improve in the third quarter, I think you alluded to some new customer wins in the prepared remarks, but any comments there on the sustainability, what you're seeing at the department store level, if you're seeing better buying activity and better expectations for foot traffic and just thoughts there. It's an important business in the Fragrance division. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, Adam, what we see is actually on the Fine Fragrance side a tremendous development in Europe. It's going very well, in particular, for many of the other premium brands. So we see good demand and we certainly have a good win rate here as well. So for us, we see that this hopefully will be sustainable for the months to come. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then in the U.S., are you seeing better activity at the retail level or is it more Europe that's driving the strength? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. It's more Europe what's driving it at this spot. (49:12) Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Can you hear me? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes, very well. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, good morning, John. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. I think you said you had positive price raws in Flavors. I would assume it was negative in vanilla and negative in citrus. What would be the kind of offsetting categories where the overall would be positive? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Well, no. I mean, we were able to get price increases related to those materials and get out ahead of it. And the Flavors business has done a great job in doing that. So I mean, it was slightly positive but it's really our ability to push through and anticipate those impacts. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And then it's pretty hard to time acquisitions, but would you say you're ahead of plan or behind plan or on plan in terms of the number and size of acquisitions that you've done over the past year and a half, two years? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We're absolutely on plan and we are a little ahead of plan with the performance of our acquisitions compared to our business cases. So we're very happy with all the five acquisitions we have done in the last two and two and a half years. (50:28) We are pretty much on plan. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. A few questions, first on the M&A 2018 component of the growth, sorry for jumping to next year, but in our model, we have about 2% contribution for (51:01) M&A 2018, would like to get your views on that, if nothing else is being (51:06) acquired, of course. And also what's your view on operating income impact from M&A in 2018, again, looking at the synergies, looking at the integration was question number one. Maybe I'll let you answer that one first. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure, Patrick. I think from an M&A impact in 2018 on acquisitions, it's principally related to PowderPure. The Fragrance Resources was a couple weeks, so it's insignificant. So the 2% number that you're looking at seems way too high for me. So I think that impact, again, it's only going to be \u2013 PowderPure is really for half a year is the primary impact. Again from a profitability standpoint, all the other acquisitions go into organic and they'll be in our guidance for the full year from an organic standpoint. We'll embed our guidance for PowderPure in the full-year guidance also. But I think from a purely financial standpoint, it's what I said earlier, which is I would expect, once we lap the amortization impacts, that we'll continue to drive expansion through the synergies, growth of the business, and drive in improvements in the product mix of those businesses. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Great. Second question, CapEx, are you still targeting 4% to 5% for this year and next year, and any plans (52:48) we need to consider for next year in terms of increasing capacity? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. For this year, I expect us to be somewhere between 4% and 4.5%. We do expect that CapEx next year will be closer to plus or minus 5% because we've still got some of the big projects in Asia that we've got to execute against. We've got China. We've got India and some of those projects. So, 2018 and 2019 are going to be the elevated years. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Okay. And last question, I guess, would be (53:28) China in particular. Could you comment a bit more on details of what you're seeing in China, in particular, in both Flavors and Fragrances? Still weak organic developments there, so if you can comment on that. Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's still challenged. I mean, I think on the Flavors side, I know I mentioned in my comments that volume was down. We're going through and still working our way back up from some of the issues we've had. On the Fragrances side, we're seeing customers again trade down and not buying some of the categories where we're stronger at. We have a larger exposure to some of the globals in China also, and they're struggling in the marketplace on their volume basis compared to some of the local and regionals. So, it's still a challenge for both business units. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Good morning. This is Brandon Groeger on for Brett Hundley. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Good morning. Perhaps you could give us some more detail on the new Chinese fragrance plant Does that plant replace any existing production or is it additive? And when do you expect that to come online? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, it will come online probably end of next year, and it will be in addition to the existing Flavors plant we are having there because for two years, in 2015, (55:03) we had an issue with our Flavors plant, and it is probably prudent to have a second opportunity here for us on the Flavors side as well. So it will be an additional plant for... Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. There's actually two plants that we're dealing with. One was a smaller ingredient plant that we're finishing now. And it'll start up in the fourth quarter. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Which is on the Fragrance side. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Which is on the Fragrance Ingredients side. And then, as you've seen in the footnotes to the 10-Q, we're in negotiations with the government regarding their request for us to relocate our other larger ingredient plant in China and that I would expect to happen over the next two years. (56:01) Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC : So relocating that other plant is in addition to this plant as well? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: In both cases, they've asked us to leave existing sites and go to a new site, and we're going to put both of the plants in a single site over the next two years. Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, shifting to the balance sheet, it looks like it's in a good place. You're less than 2 times net levered. You recently announced the share repurchase. Ingredient valuations have been rebounding in recent months. I was thinking about your grid that dictates the repurchase of the shares. Do you intend to update that at all? And then, outside of that share repurchase activity, how are you thinking about putting the balance sheet to work? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Let me take the share repurchase first. Yeah. As I noted, we did get an updated authorization from the board. The matrix is stock price-driven, but I would say that there is a component of the new authorization that provides for a minimum amount of share repurchases that's targeted to offset dilution. And then on top of that, will depend upon where we are versus the share price grid. From a utilization of the rest of the capacity in the balance sheet, I think, as Andreas talked about, we continue to look and pursue our M&A agenda, but it all depends upon what's available. And we want to make sure we are targeting the right deals and have the proper return profiles. Brandon Groeger - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much, guys. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Morning. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good quarter. I wanted to talk about active cosmetics. I'm trying to look at a couple of regions where you saw some real big lift in Fragrance Ingredients. Is active cosmetics growing in every region, and that's just two places where there's not offsets, if you could kind of comment on that and maybe dimensionalize how big that business could be going forward? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Jon, the big drivers in terms of where ingredients are growing significant, which is the EAME and Latin America, is on our Fragrance Ingredients side. The growth on the cosmetic active side has been pretty consistent. It's in the double-digit range, so that's not driving the changes. What you're seeing is on our Ingredients business. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. And it's pretty well-distributed across on the active cosmetic side. Region-wise, we are certainly stronger in Europe and North America, in terms of the size of the business. We still have a ways to go in Asia and in Latin America. Well, that's good. That gives us growth opportunities going forward. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks. And just one follow-up, if I could. Rich, I went back and looked at 2006, 2007, like strong periods of Asia, basically global luxury fragrance development that would advantage a fine fragrance business like yours. Certainly, we're seeing that across some of your key end customers. What's different? You're seeing much better growth this time around than 2005, 2006, 2007, when you saw similar kinds of trends in beauty, particularly in Asia, but luxury globally. Could you comment on like why \u2013 how much of that \u2013 do you worry that some of that is economically cyclical and why the difference this time? What kind of capabilities do you have now, around Fine Fragrance particularly, that you maybe didn't have back then? Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Well, there's a lot there in your question. But, I mean, I think, that certainly we're seeing good growth in some of the emerging markets, Middle East, Africa in particular, within the EAME region. As we've been talking about for several quarters, we need to and we have adapted our strategy on Fine to focus on those categories in the channels that are most attractive. Certainly, that profile has changed over the last 12 to 18 months, where there's a lot less going through the department stores and the brick-and-mortar. And we're going to continue to target our resources towards those, the premium and the prestige components of the Fine business. Look, it's a reflection of the team we have around the world and their ability to leverage the consumer insights, understand what's going on in the market, understand our customers and designing fragrances that are attractive to the consumer. And that's ultimately what it comes down to is our ability to put the right fragrance in the right place at the right time. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, thank you very much for your participation and have a good day and/or a good night. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request that you limit one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2018. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28th, 2017 and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on our call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. As usual, I will start with an executive overview of our operational performance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Then I want to provide some key highlights of our strategic progression in regards to our long-term Vision 2020 strategy. Once finished, I will ask Rich to cover our financial results in greater detail, including specifics on each business unit as well as our cash flow dynamics. Then we will both provide commentary as it relates to our outlook for 2018 and finish by taking any questions that you may have. Starting with the financial review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report that we had strong operational performance resulting in consolidated currency-neutral sales growth of 10%, currency-neutral adjusted operating profit growth of 4%, and currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Rich will take you into greater detail on the fourth quarter later in the presentation. On a full year basis, 2017 was another notable year in regards to our financial performance. Consolidated currency-neutral sales growth grew 9% as both business units successfully delivered strong growth with 10% in Flavors and 9% in Fragrances. Overall topline growth was supported by our organic business, which grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis, in line with our long-term financial target, as we capitalized on strong new wins as well as improved volume trends on existing business. In addition, David Michael, Fragrance Resources, and PowderPure provided approximately five percentage points of additional growth. Led by volume growth, the benefits associated with growth of productivity initiatives and the contribution of acquisitions, consolidated adjusted operating profit on a currency-neutral basis increased 5% for the full year 2017. This improvement when combined with a more favorable year-over-year effective tax rate and a reduction in shares outstanding led to a 9% increase in our currency-neutral adjusted EPS. We also continued to advance our long-term strategy that will enable us to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. Some key highlights. Sales of our Sweetness and Savory modulation portfolio continued to grow strong double digits across all our categories, led by Savory, Dairy and Beverage. To ensure we maintain these robust growth dynamics, we successfully launched three new natural taste modulators. Encapsulation-related sales continued to grow, led primarily by Fabric Care and Personal Wash. In delivery systems, the encapsulation platform remains paramount to future growth, which is why we made strong advancements to extend this technology into even more categories. In the Middle East and Africa, we continued to grow our business up mid-single-digits, with growth coming in both Flavors and Fragrances. To ensure we continue to strive in this exciting and dynamic region, we opened a fully renovated and expanded facility in Cairo to better serve our regional customers and strengthening our market presence. In North America, we launched Tastepoint, a fully dedicated organization with -- in IFF designed to serve middle-market customers. This new and innovative go-to-market approach targets the unique needs and expectation of this target customer base, who call for speed, agility, and resourcefulness. And it is powered with technology that drives differentiation. Tastepoint performance in 2017 was very strong, improving double-digits. Cosmetic Active Ingredients also remained a growth driver in 2017, as Lucas Meyer's Cosmetics, acquired two years ago, continued to grow double-digits. In terms of sustainability, IFF continued its global sustainability leadership as we earned a Gold Status designed -- designation by EcoVadis and A-list acknowledgment by CDP for the third year in a row. We were also named to the Euronext Vigeo U.S. Top 50 Index and saw an improvement in our Dow Jones Sustainability Index score. More recently, we were named Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, an index launched in February 2018 as we joined the ranks of 99 other leading companies assessed by performance in key stakeholder categories. In terms of capital allocation, we spent approximately $129 million in capital expenditures or about 4% of sales. This was primarily driven by our previously announced strategic investments in operations, including China and India, and creative and application centers globally. We also invested $205 million of capital for two strategic acquisitions. We fortified our Fragrance business with an acquisition of Fragrance Resources, increasing our participation in specialty fine fragrances and strengthening our market position with regional customers in North America and Germany. We also purchased PowderPure to further expand our expertise in Flavors by offering clean-label solution that do not compromise taste, nutrition, and color. The combination of these two acquisitions should add approximately $90 million of expected annual revenue. We returned approximately $264 million or 56% of our adjusted net income to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases, increasing our annual dividend 8% and announcing the extension of our existing share repurchase [technical difficulty] With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. Richard O'Leary: Thank you, Andreas. I'd like to now turn our attention to the business unit reviews for the fourth quarter. Flavors currency-neutral sales increased 5%, led by strong growth in Savory, Beverage and Sweet. It should be noted that on a two-year average basis, growth was strong at approximately 7%. From a regional perspective, all four regions delivered growth, led by 9% improvement in North America, primarily driven by strong double-digit growth in Savory. EAME increased 5% on a currency-neutral basis, with the strongest growth in Beverage. On a geographic basis, the Middle East; Africa; Central, Southern and Eastern Europe all reported strong growth. Greater Asia grew 2% on a currency-neutral basis, principally driven by robust growth in India and the Asean region. And in Latin America, sales growth was 6% on a currency-neutral basis, as growth was led by the Southern Cone region, specifically Argentina. In Q4, on a currency-neutral segment profit basis, Flavors grew approximately 10%, led by volume growth and the benefit from productivity initiatives. In terms of currency-neutral segment profit margins, we achieved year-over-year margin expansion of approximately 90 basis points to 21.3%. Fragrance currency-neutral sales improved 15% in Q4, as growth was broad-based and very strong with approximately 10 percentage points coming from our organic business and approximately 5% coming from acquisitions. Regionally, growth was broad-based as all regions increased double-digits. It should be noted that Brazil has stabilized as we saw a rebound in overall volume performance. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 27% on a currency-neutral basis, including Fragrance Resources. All regions achieved strong double-digit growth inclusive of acquisitions. Organically, sales on a currency-neutral basis grew double-digits, led by new win performance as well as improved volume on existing business. Consumer Fragrances grew 12% on currency-neutral basis, including Fragrance Resources. Organically, our performance was driven by double-digit growth in Personal Wash and Home Care as well as high single-digit performance in Toiletries. Please take note that Consumer Fragrances continued to perform well relative to the first half of 2017, as volume on existing business has remained positive in Q4. Fragrance ingredients sales were up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven primarily by double-digit growth in Latin America, North America, and Greater Asia. And as Andreas noted, Lucas Meyer's also continued to perform well in the quarter with double-digit growth. From a profit perspective in Q4, Fragrances segment profit remained constant on a currency-neutral basis. Volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were offset by unfavorable price to input costs and an increase in research, selling and administrative expenses, which includes higher incentive compensation expense, and an increase in amortization cost associated with the acquisition of Fragrance Resources. This had a corresponding impact on year-over-year currency-neutral segment profit margin, which finished at 16.6% in the fourth quarter. Turning to next slide. We show the year-over-year pact -- year-over-year impact in terms of contribution of Q4 operating profit growth on a consolidated basis, expressed as a percentage of our restated fourth quarter 2016 adjusted operating profit. Starting with the second bar, you can see that volume added approximately 13 percentage points to overall operating profit growth. In the third bar, you can see that we continued to benefit from our cost and productivity initiatives through the likes of procurement savings, our restructuring program savings. Overall, we delivered approximately six percentage points of benefit year-over-year. Moving on to the next bar, through disciplined cost management, including components of zero-based budgeting. RSA contributed two percentage points of benefit to the fourth quarter adjusted currency-neutral operating profit growth. Overall in the quarter, mix had a negligible impact. From an M&A perspective, M&A -- from a headwind perspective, M&A was a slightly drag of one percentage point. We also at various times went against this in the quarter, which represented about two percentage points of headwind. Net price to input costs was unfavorable by about three percentage points and was predominantly driven by higher raw material costs in Fragrances. Lastly, incentive compensation was unfavorable by approximately 10 percentage points year-over-year. In terms of year-over-year comparison, we had a large delta, as we compare to a lower-base period in the prior year due to underperformance versus a plan compared to strong performance in the current year quarter. As a quick reminder, we are highly incentivized to deliver our financial commitments. From time-to-time, there are variations in incentive comp as it is based on our performance relative to our plan. If we achieve our financial targets, we'll receive 100% of our designated payout. Should we over or under deliver versus the plan, our incentive compensation is adjusted higher or lower. In the case of 2017 -- 2017, incentive compensation expense was higher than 2016, as we exceeded our 2017 targets. Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $391 million for the year, which compares to $550 million last year. Our 2017 performance was adversely impacted primarily by the ZoomEssence litigation settlement, higher working capital requirements, acquisition-related activities, and restructuring charges. It should be noted that while working capital requirements year-over-year was unfavorable, it improved significantly in the fourth quarter from where it was at the end of the third quarter, mainly due to improved accounts payable. As Andreas mentioned, from a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $129 million in CapEx or about 4% of sales and believe that we will spend between 4% and 5% of sales in 2018. With the current expectation, it will be at the higher end of the range. Regarding cash returned to shareholders, in 2017, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, we delivered a total payout of 56% of adjusted net income, consistent with our 50% to 60% targeted range. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Over the last two years, we have seen the global operating environment become more volatile. Fortunately, several of the factors in which we highlighted in the past have started to see modest improvements. To put this in context, we have seen global consumer staple volumes starting to stabilize and show signs of improvement. While it's early in the year, expectation is that the consumer staples volume will improve in 2018, increasing approximately 2%. This compares well to what we, as an industry, have seen over the last three years and where the average was flattish to up slightly. From an economic perspective, GDP growth on a global basis is expected to improve modestly. A key driver for this improvement is expected to come from stronger GDP trends in the emerging markets. This should provide a relative improvement over the last few years in terms of our topline performance, as approximately 50% of our sales are through the emerging markets. U.S. dollar continues to fluctuate versus the world currencies. And as a global organization with nearly 30 currencies, there are many moving parts. Most relevant for IFF, the strengthening of the euro versus U.S. dollar is favorable as approximately 30% of our profits are euro denominated. However, please remember that the impact on profitability will be limited as we have a rolling hedging program and our hedge about 80% at $1.15 for 2018. This compares to an average euro to U.S. dollar rate at $1.12 for the full year 2017. While we are optimistic that the operating environment has improved modestly, the one area that remains headwind is raw material cost. On the natural size, the demand for all natural products continues to drive across all natural ingredients, as has done over the past few years. This can be best seen in vanilla and citrus markets, where prices remain at historically high levels, and turpentine and turpentine derivatives, particularly gum turpentine, costs have increased significantly. In addition, synthetics materials are directly and indirectly from oil are exhibiting inflationary pressures. For all of these instances, we have been continue to have active discussions with our customers to recover our cost exposure via pricing. With that as a backdrop, I would like to highlight several notable items that we expect to impact our financial results in 2018. One of our key suppliers, BASF, had a fire occurred at their manufacturing plant in Germany during quarter 4 2017. This impacted their production of citral, a very common ingredient used in many formulations in both Flavors and Fragrances. In addition, they declared Force Majeure, which impacts both supply and cost of the key import for the entire Flavor and Fragrance industry. Based on their public statements, the startup for that plant is not expected to occur until the end of March 2018. We anticipate that the supply chain will not fully normalize until the second half of 2018. With that, I would like to turn it back to Rich. Richard O'Leary: Thanks Andreas. Let me take the couple of more technical items. At the end of 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax reform. Key changes include, but are not limited to, Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax, executive compensation deduction limits, and the elimination of certain special deductions. For us, we accrued a provisional net charge of $139 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which primarily includes a transition tax on the company's historic unremitted foreign earnings and the reevaluation of the company's net deferred tax assets to reflect the new lower statutory tax rate. As we think about 2018, based on our current assessment and understanding of the Tax Act in our current global operating restructure, we believe that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be approximately 21%. Lastly, in March of 2017, the FASB issued an amendment to the compensation report -- retirements benefits guide and effective in 2018, interest costs, asset returns, and the amortization and gains and losses will now be recorded in other income and expense versus operating profit under the previous accounting rules. The impact was approximately $31 million in 2017 and $15 million in 2016. For modeling comparison purposes, our pro forma adjusted operating profit for 2017 will now be $616 million, and other income and expense will be $40 million, of which $31 million is for the pension change and $9 million is other regular income and expense items. Given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to highlight the drivers of currency-neutral adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS for greater transparency. Before doing so, I want to highlight the expectation for sales performance. We expect 3% to 5% currency-neutral sales growth as all categories are expected to contribute to growth. In terms of expected operating -- adjusted operating profit performance in 2018, please take note that our starting point following the pension accounting change is $616 million for 2017. In 2018, we expect the profitability of our core business to accelerate versus the growth we achieved in 2017 from approximately 5% to approximately 7% to 9%. We expect the performance to be driven by the combination of volume growth and the benefits of cost and productivity initiatives, which include our standard program plus advancements in zero-based budgetings and savings associated with the multiyear productivity program that we announced in the early 2017. Net price to raw material cost is expected to be neutral, as we're taking action to cover our cost exposure. In the fifth bar, we isolated the impact relative to the citral Force Majeure. While we are pleased to say that we can believe we can meet the demand of our customers, the challenge, however, is that the total financial impact in 2018 is quite large at approximately 7%. Fortunately, we have and continued to work with all of our possible mitigation options, and currently believe the impact should be limited to approximately two percentage points. Inclusive of the impact of the citral situation, we expect raw material costs will rise mid-single-digits in 2018. Please note that this is very fluid situation and is based on how we see things today. Our objective is to fully offset the BASF impact, as we're pursuing all options, both internally and externally. I'll review the impact of currency in more detail shortly. Moving on to EPS, as you see from the second bar and similar to our previous slide, our core business remained strong. We expect 6% to 8% growth in 2018 from our core business. As I discussed moments ago, the Force Majeure situation is expected to adversely impact results by approximately two percentage points. Looking at tax, based on our current assessment and understanding of the Tax Act and our current structure, we believe that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be 21%. And it's inclusive of the net -- the impact of the tax reform net of mitigation and planning opportunities that we've identified today. The ultimate impact of the tax impact may differ from this estimate due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by taxing authorities, as well as our operating and structural changes that we may take into result -- take into account as a result of the Act. We expect currency-neutral EPS to be between 4% and 6%. In terms of foreign exchange, for 2018, we expect currency translation to be a favorable impact on sales of approximately three percentage points. We expect currency to be favorable by approximately 1.5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, respectively. Net-net, our 2018 guidance all-in is 6% to 8% sales growth, 6.5% to 8% for operating profit, and 5.5% to 7.5% for EPS. With that, I'd like to pass it over to Andreas for some closing comments. Andreas Fibig : In summary, we're pleased with what we have achieved so far across all key financial metrics in 2017. As we enter 2018, recognizing that uncertainty remains in the operating environment, we are targeting growth across all of our key financial metrics. We're doing so by taking action to accelerate sales growth in advantage categories, deliver innovation that is truly differentiated, and generate higher returns via continued cost and productivity initiatives, and generate strong returns for our shareholders. And we have started the year 2018 well with growth across both business units. With that, I would now like to open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes, hey, good morning everybody. Andreas Fibig : Good morning Mark. Richard O'Leary: Good morning Mark. Mark Astrachan : Wanted to ask first about the sales growth outlook. So, if you keep the two-year constant, it would imply growth at least at the midpoint, maybe even a little bit stronger than that. So, I guess, I'm curious why are you including a wider range at least compared to last year? And what if they happen to come in at the low end and at the high end? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Look, Mark, first of all, we are certainly optimistic for 2018. But with all the volatility we have seen in the last, let's say, two years in the market, plus the citral situation we are having at hand right now, we said it's more prudent to go in with a wider range and then probably update over the course of the year. So, that's our view on it. Richard O'Leary: I think, the other thing for me, Mark, is as we talked about on the last call, I mean, we're still -- it's still unclear to what extent the improvement we've seen late in 2017 and how much of that is going to be volume impacts and inventory at our customer levels and restocking. So, I think that's why -- some of those factors are why we use a wider range this time. Mark Astrachan : Got it. And just to elaborate on that, and then I want to ask the second question. Six weeks into the first quarter at this point, so I guess, maybe color as it relates to your last bit of commentary would be helpful in terms of sort of how you're seeing things so far. And then just switching a bit to growth margin. So, your ability to take pricing given, obviously, higher input costs now, the BASF issues and the commentary from last call about slightly pushback from customers in terms of the ability to take pricing or at least their pushback on needing to hit their own internal earnings target. How do you think about the puts and takes that where we are? And how do you think about the longer term ability to grow growth margins relative to the level where you were at the end of 2017? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Okay, I'll take that. So, as we said, the start into the first quarter was a very, very good start, what we have seen so far. So, -- and we are closing in February next week, which is good, good data point. On the pricing, we are certainly in negotiation with our customers. We believe that we can recover our pricing. As you well know from the past, it will take some time to recover the pricing. You always had a -- have a time lag in it, whether it's based on inventory or the negotiation of the contract you have in place, but we are fairly optimistic that we get it done. But we have to recognize all. It's a very complex situation for us right now, because on one hand you have the raw material prices, on the other hand, you have the BASF situation, which are completely two different animals. And I think that, that's not easy to explain. But I hope when we are through the whole situation BASF situation, it's easier to show where we are. That's pricing. And growth margin, on the fourth quarter what you have seen probably a bit of a mix impact and the raw material, but we certainly want to make sure this year that we work on the mix to make sure that we are really very well in place and about the raw material and the pricing we talk. But I don't know, Rich, whether you want to add on this? Richard O'Leary: Yes, sure. I mean, I think it -- I mean, just to echo a couple of Andreas' comments. At the end, I think it was a -- it has been a good start to the first quarter from a margin perspective. We've had some -- in Q4, some productivity, some one-off items that we saw in the quarter. As I think about 2018 margin relative to 2017, as you said, Mark, we're going to have pricing increases to cover the normal input cost increases. On top of that, we've got BASF. So, that by definition is going to put pressure on margins for 2018. We've got some of the carryover pricing more in the first half, obviously, in the second half from our customers. So, that's going to put further pressure, I think, in the first half of 2018. And then, as you saw in the operating profit bridge, I mean, the two percentage point net impact that we currently believe is achievable in 2018 for BASF is going to have a direct impact on margin. So, when I look at in total, I'd say that our expectations for margins in 2018 are probably flat to maybe down slightly. Mark Astrachan : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kate Grafstein with Barclays. Katie Grafstein : Thanks. So, just looking back at your initial expected profit bridge for 2017 that you gave last February, I was wondering if you could talk about what performed better or worse than you initially expected? And did you achieve the four to four and a half points of benefit from productivity and cost savings? Richard O'Leary: Sure. Thanks Kate. No problem. There's a lot there, but let me try to stick with the highlights. I think top line growth was better than what we expected. So, overall growth in the business was better than what we expected. I think you've heard us talk throughout the year, M&A, particularly, the Flavors, Tastepoint business performed well and probably exceeded expectations. Price input cost was -- I would say is unfavorable. We've had the pricing pressure on, particularly in Fragrances that we've talked about since the middle of the year. So that was a negative. Mix, particularly, in the middle part of the year was a big drag that we talked about on the second and third quarter calls. From a productivity standpoint, I think we were slightly ahead of our goals for 2017 in terms of the profit improvement program. The components may have shifted a little bit, but we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be. Katie Grafstein : Thank you. And just one other thing on the strength of North America Fine Fragrances. Just wondering if it was due to any one customer, in particular? Or if -- and then, like, the split between existing business and new wins. Andreas Fibig : It was actually not one customer. So, it was more across the Board was broader, which is good. And the volumes went up as well, which was driving it. So, all-in-all, very, very positive, because it's not a one-off and it's just not one customer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Michael Sison : Hey guys. In terms of the BASF situation, does it affect Flavors more or Fragrances? And maybe can you talk about the core growth in each of those segments in 2018 based on your outlook? Richard O'Leary: Yes. And Mike, it's primarily Fragrances in terms of BASF. The principal impact on Flavors is on menthol. But the vast majority of the impact is on the Fragrance side, because it's used in so many different formulas. In terms of growth in the two business units in 2018, there is -- I think, it's pretty similar growth expectations for both businesses. Michael Sison : Okay. And for the citral situation, is it more your inability to get the raw material versus the higher prices? And are there other ways to may be source some of these materials? Richard O'Leary: No, I think, Mike, we're -- we actually feel very good. And I think you heard it in Andreas' comments that we're actually well-positioned and we feel good that we've been able to maintain continuity of supply to our customers. However, to do that, we're having to deal with increased input costs and the market pricing has driven dramatically in late -- beginning in October and November when the -- when BASF had first made the announcement. We've had to make choices internally and shift internal capacity. We're vertically integrated. So, part of the impact that we're seeing is we're having to give up external sales on Ingredients in order to give preference to our customers, though it's a variety of factors. Most of that is the input -- the actual cost of the input, cost and some incremental manufacturing expenses to get the product in the right place, some work in terms of Nicolas' team from a creation standpoint to be able to adapt with changes that the customers are asking us for. Michael Sison : Great. And then last one. Andreas, when you think about the trend to naturals. Can you maybe just give us an update on where we're at there? Are you start -- are you continuing to see a lot of momentum in new product development from customers? And what inning do you think we are in that trend longer term? Andreas Fibig : No, Mike, absolutely. The trend stays and it's gaining even momentum. We have it, as you well know, on the Flavors already, because 90% of our, let's say, briefs in North America in Flavors are basically for naturals. So, you see -- and that's why we're catering with our PowderPure acquisition as well. So, we are strengthening even our position here. But now we see it more and more on the Fragrance side as well, and not just on the pure fragrance, also on the active cosmetics. That's a natural element, plays much, much a bigger role. And I don't expect that this will go away. So, that's something -- a trend which is still pretty much intact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck : Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you? Andreas Fibig : Good, very well. Good morning Silke. Richard O'Leary: Good morning Silke. Silke Kueck : So, my first question is just a question of clarification. So, what you said is that there was $15 million pension-related benefit in 2016 that you now will capture in other income. And there was an even higher pension benefit of $30 million in your 2017 operating income, which will now become part of other income, so, effectively, your operating income in 2017. So, it's like, we're really at a slower rate, right? So, it's, like, went from $605 million to $616 million, is that correct? Richard O'Leary: Yes, I mean, it's part of our normal pension expenses and what we have to deal with as a company year in, year out. I mean, for a long time, the cost was going up every year, and we were having to absorb it, particularly, post-Lehman crisis when asset returns were hurt significantly. So, it's a function of the overall economics of the business that we've had to deal with over the last several years. Silke Kueck : Secondly, how do you think about incentive accruals in 2018? Will that be headwind, the benefit, do you have some thoughts about that? Richard O'Leary: I'd say, it's going to be -- it should be flat to slight benefit. Silke Kueck : And in terms of your tax rate, there's various change that's taking place. Will there be a change in your cash tax rate? Or can you tell us what your cash tax rate was in 2017 and what you expect it to be in 2018? As best as you can tell with the information that you have today. Richard O'Leary: What I can say is that I don't have my cash tax rate off the top of my head. I mean, obviously, if you think about the charge we recorded, it's a $139 million, about $100 million of that is the transitional tax, the remaining part of that is a reevaluation of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. That $100 million, the actual amount we're going to have to pay over the next eight years is going to be, probably call it, two-thirds of that number, because of credits we have available. So, from a cash standpoint, that's going to hurt us in 2018 versus 2017, because we're going to have to start to make that payment spread over the next eight years. So, I would expect our cash effective tax rate to be worse than it was in 2017. Silke Kueck : And I've got a final question on the Fragrance business. Like, the underlying -- like, even if I strip out the acquisition, it looks like Fragrance sales in North America were really exceptionally strong. So, I was wondering whether you can sort of, like, talk about the Fragrance business in North America. What it may -- what rate it grew at in the individual divisions, excluding the acquisition and what was behind that? Richard O'Leary: Yes. So, I mean, it's overall -- I mean, the effect of -- I mean, big part of that on the compound business in total would have been -- it's about half of the compounds, a little bit, call it one-third of the growth, it's about 10% growth, double-digit growth in compounds in total, and their balance is going to be Fragrance Resources. Fine Fragrance grew -- again, on an organic basis, grew high single-digits, Consumer Fragrance grew low double-digits. So it's pretty strong across the entire business in North America. Win rates were pretty consistent with what we've seen, but the big piece was volume recovery on existing business. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Silke Kueck : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, good morning. Andreas Fibig : Hey, good morning. Richard O'Leary: Good morning. Faiza Alwy : So, just one or two questions from me. First of all, can you talk a little bit more about the pricing pressure that you are seeing from your customers? Is this something new in terms of because the competitive environment changed. Because historically, the view was that Flavors and Fragrances are such a small percentage of products overall costs, that there isn't a lot of pushback from customers, but that's clearly changed over the last, I'd say, year or so. Can you just, Andreas, maybe give us a little bit more perspective on perhaps if the competitive environment is having an impact on that? Richard O'Leary: Sure, Faiza. I mean I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. I mean we've talked -- they are customers, particularly, our global customers. We've talked about this for the last several calls about having significant productivity improvement programs in their business. So, we're not immune to that. We talk about how we deal with that in terms of a combination of pricing, reformulation, substitution, tradeoffs. So, I mean, I think, the pricing pressure was more significant in the middle part of the year. If you look at pricing in Q4 for Fragrances, it was slightly positive. So, I think we talked about during the course of the year that we -- it was going to get better. I think, as I said, I expect to see some carryover impact in early 2018. But it's never easy. I'm never going to sit here and look at Nicolas or Matthias in the face and tell him it's easy to raise prices in their teams. It's a lot of work. It takes a lot of focus and discussion. We've got contracts we have to deal with in terms of when the windows open up, what the thresholds of the increase have to be. So, it takes, I think, over the time and we've shown that pretty consistently over the last 10 years that we can get there. Sometimes, it takes a little bit longer than we want to. Andreas Fibig : Yes. No, I'm fairly optimistic on this one as well. I think we know how to deal with it. We know how to operate in that environment. And this year, as we said before, it's a little bit more complex because we have to distinct between the raw material price increase and the BASF situation, which makes it not easy. But we're fairly optimistic that we can do it as we've done it before. Faiza Alwy : Okay, okay. And then, Andreas, can you talk a little bit more about your M&A outlook strategies? What are you focused -- most focused on in terms of targets for -- especially for 2018? And then just, Rich, the cash flow, as you mentioned, was pretty weak in 2017. Do you have any targets or goals that you're looking for in 2018? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : No, look, Faiza, as we have done it in the last three years, we have all our list we're working on. We are actually very happy that all the five acquisitions we have done in the last three years are actually performing all very well. And actually all above the business case, which is a very, very good thing. And there's nothing extraordinary what I can announce right now. But we are certainly, let's say, going forward with our strategy, which is described in our Vision 2020, where M&A is an active pillar of our strategy. We're certainly looking at a couple of exciting technology moves as well, but it's too early to talk about it. Richard O'Leary: From a cash flow standpoint, Faiza, I mean, clearly 2017 was not a good year. We're down about $160 million year-over-year in cash flow from operations. I mean some of the pieces you're already aware of and everyone is aware of; the litigation settlement, $56 million; working capital was about $45 million higher. It's an increase in terms of cash outflow. I mean we did improve as a percent of sales by about 20 basis points on our core working capital, but it was well below what our expectations were. On top of that, there's probably about a $25 million-or-so impact on our cash flows this year -- or last year, 2017, related to the productivity-improvement program, the acquisitions and the integration costs related to that. So, the balance of it, call it $30 million or so is really around indirect taxes, prepayments, some of the more normal day-to-day stuff. Expectations for next year, obviously, is going to be significantly improved. If you take out just the two -- I'll call them more one-offs, the litigation and the integration-type things and productivity program, that's $80 million in itself. And then we're going to have the increased profitability of the business, and we're certainly targeting improvements in working capital this year. I think, it's going to be -- working capital is probably going to be back-ended, because we're going to have to deal with inventories and pricing associated with citral in the first half of this year. And we'll get the pricing in the second half of the year, as I talked about earlier. So, I think, it's -- the improvement's going to be back-ended. I am happy to say that, if I look at the fourth quarter alone, cash flow in 2017 was only slightly below what we saw in 2016. So, it was a tough start to the year undoubtedly. First nine months of the year was where most of the gap in cash flow generation occurred. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. How much of the sales growth in Fragrance Ingredients was priced to pass through the higher raw materials? I think that segment is the most impacted and fasted impacted with raw materials. Andreas Fibig : It's true. John, that's Andreas. Good morning. It's true, but not yet. It's too early that the pricing will come down in the first half of the year. John Roberts : So, that was mostly volume then? Andreas Fibig : It was basically -- you might remember up to two years ago, we were not growing in Fragrance Ingredients and we had to turnaround the business and came up with a turnaround strategy. And now the team is basically executing on the turnaround strategy and has a lot of innovation in the pipeline as well, which means new molecules we can offer to our customers and that's yielding right now. So, there's basically no pricing up to now. John Roberts : Well. And then, Rich, given 80% of your sales are outside the U.S., I was surprised that you were able to lower tax rate as much as you did. Is there anything significant beyond just statutory U.S. rate decline? Richard O'Leary: John, there's -- there are so many moving pieces. I think, obviously, that's the biggest piece of it, because I mean we've got executive complements that are headwind we have to deal and manage through the Base Erosion Tax, the BEAT Tax. So, -- but if you the -- if you sort of boil it down on one thing, it's going to be the rate reduction. John Roberts : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Hey everyone. Can I just ask on multinationals versus regionals in your customer group? Is that still 50-50 or has that shifted because the number of the acquisitions that you've made are targeted towards those faster-growing local champions? So, could you give an update there? And then in the slide deck, you expect, on page 14, an acceleration of CPG companies from three-year average of 0.4% to 2% in 2018. What's that based on please? Richard O'Leary: Sure. Probably, I'll start with the last one. For the CPGs, it's basically street expectations, which we talked. So, Mike extracted that and we put it in. And on the customer side, we are around about still 50-50, but certainly would have better growth rate on the smaller customer. So, it probably will tilt a bit towards this over the next couple of months. Gunther Zechmann : Okay. And can I just check on the 2% of the CPG companies. I know it's early in the year, but is that something that acceleration that you're observing in your orders as well? Andreas Fibig : Yes, we do. Absolutely. And then we saw already with the volume, because the volume is helping in the fourth quarter. Richard O'Leary: Second half of the year. I mean-- Andreas Fibig : On second half of the year you can say, in particular. For Fragrance, it was actually a pretty strong turnaround. Gunther Zechmann : Very clear. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : I'm sorry, Q1, I forgot about this, but we see it in the first couple of weeks here in the new quarter as well. Gunther Zechmann : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fintan Ryan with Berenberg. Fintan Ryan : Good morning gentlemen. I just have a question in terms of some of your key geographies. Wondering could you give a bit more color on what you're seeing on the demand side in Brazil, Latin America and China within the Greater Asia region? They have been areas of relative softness over the recent quarters. And I guess, the outlook for 2018. Do you see the emerging markets acceleration driving the sales growth? Or do you expect growth to be sort of broadly split between developed and emerging markets? thank you. Andreas Fibig : Thank you for the question. I'll start with the last one first. We see actually a broad-based growth over all regions for 2018. In specific on Brazil or LatAm, we see -- or we have seen that it turn around Brazil for the Fragrance business actually in the second half, which is a good sign, because it's a very important market for Fragrance and it looks like it will stay like this for 2018 as well. On Asia, we see very, very strong growth in India, very double digit. And you might have seen that we have announced the building of two new factories, Fragrances and Flavors, actually the biggest one in that case in India. In China, it's still a little bit of a rough patch. You might remember two years ago, we had the incident in our Flavors factory. We are building a second backup plan, which will be inaugurated probably end of third quarter, fourth quarter this year, so that we are over this hump as well and can produce against good growth coming out of China. But again, the emerging markets are coming back, which is great, but what we have seen is actually very good growth out of the United States, as you have seen and also Western Europe. We shouldn't underestimate that and that's still a pretty significant piece of our business. So, all in all, a pretty broad-based approach. With a couple of pockets where we believe good growth comes on, like Brazil, for example, or India. Fintan Ryan : Okay. Thank you for the clarity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. good morning everyone. I was hoping to go back to the sales growth guidance and just to be clear. So, 3% to 5% currency-neutral growth, the company did 4% organic, a little bit -- couple of basis points above that in 2017, so middle of the range. You've talked about your customers expecting an acceleration in volume growth in 2018. You've talked about your orders being healthy at the start of the year. And there is an expectation that pricing will be accelerating as you move through the year to recover raw materials. So, I'm just trying to think about that organic sales growth guidance and why there wouldn't -- what's decelerating in the mix to get to the 3% to 5% range if you have those kind of pieces moving where they are actually right now? Richard O'Leary: Sure, it's Rich. Let me try to give -- I think, you heard our comments earlier around -- there's still a fair amount of uncertainty in the market. And so given that, we took a wider range. I mean, I think certainly as we look at the components, we probably have about a 1.5 of growth embedded in the guidance related to pricing. The remaining is the volume impact, but I certainly hope that we can be at the higher end of the range and beat that. I think as Andreas talked about earlier, we've had a good start to the first quarter, but six weeks don't make a year or seven weeks don't make a year. The situation -- the supply situation and the pricing impact and the impact that's going to have as we work that through in both businesses is probably the key drivers on why we've taken a relatively cautious approach in terms of our guidance for 2018. Andreas Fibig : But we certainly can give you more details as soon as we know when the BASF plant is up on stream online again. And then in our -- what is it, second quarter -- first quarter call, we can give you a good update where we see things panning out. But I would echo Rich's comments here. It's a lot of moving pieces right now and that's the reason why we said, let's be prudent here and then come up with that guidance. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just a quick clarification on the EPS guidance, the 4% to 6% currency-neutral against the 5% to 7% operating profit currency-neutral growth range. Tax rate's flat year-over-year. What below the line would be causing EPS to grow slower than operating profit? Richard O'Leary: Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean, I think there's a couple of things. I mean tax is slightly unfavorable, so that's going to be a piece of -- it's a little bit. In 2017, when there is elements of other income that we don't forecast or beat, sort of the miscellaneous items or one-off items really the only thing we embed into our guidance for the current year, i.e. is going to be the interest income component of it. The rest of it, miscellaneous sales and gains, we do not include in that guidance. And then the last piece, there is the -- given what's going on in terms of our pension plans, interest rates, the amortization schedules on the unrecognized gains and losses, the benefit in 2018 versus 2017 for the pension change is a slight headwind also. Interest expense, we're forecasting -- that's the other piece, we're forecasting to be higher in 2018 versus 2017. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley with The Vertical Group. Brett Hundley : Hey, thank you. Good morning guys. Andreas Fibig : Good morning Brett. Brett Hundley : I joined the call a little late, so I apologize if you guys already talked about this. But on the Fragrances business in Q4, that year-on-year margin declined. I think, it was roughly 200 basis points, if I'm not mistaken. Did -- can you or did you parse out the margin impacts by group, mix being one, price recovery of inputs being two, and then just three, higher core operating cost? Richard O'Leary: We don't -- when I'm breaking out the individual components, I would tell you sort of the big buckets. I mentioned in my comments, Andreas' comments, we talked about unfavorable -- higher input costs in Q4 for the Fragrance business. Pricing was up slightly, but not enough to offset the increased input cost. We've got the negative impact principally related to incentive comp reset and the performance of the business. And to a lesser extent some -- I'll call them, selected investments in RSA. Those are probably the three biggest drivers. Brett Hundley : Okay, that's helpful. Sorry if you had to repeat that. Richard O'Leary: No, it's okay. And the amortization -- sorry and the amortization cost is the other piece of it, which I didn't have to recall. Brett Hundley : Okay. Maybe hanging on to the raw material discussion. So, we understand that a fair amount of the drive higher in synthetic raws is related maybe to a stance by the Chinese government where it's becoming a little bit more focused on manufacturing in certain regions in country. And I'm just kind of curious what you are seeing from that region. I know you have a couple of plants there and you're working to make some consolidation efforts. If you are just seeing any disruption or if it's kind of just business as usual for you guys? Andreas Fibig : No, I would say, it's business as usual, in particular in the materials we are buying. So, there's nothing extraordinary. But-- Richard O'Leary: No, I mean, I would probably say, it's -- I'm not sure I would have called it business as usual, given the investments we've had to make over the last several years in moving plants to work as good partners with the government, both on the Flavor side and our Ingredients business. We talked about that on the -- in the third quarter call, our two Ingredients business. But I mean, we feel good about our ability to operate going forward. I think there's probably been some small intermittent issues where local players are going to have to may be dealing with the government coming down on them. But I wouldn't say there's anything significant from a supply chain issue that we are seeing. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Hey, guys, just a follow-up. Can I check on Dairy? And what happened there in Q4? It's still in the area you don't explicitly split out this contributing to growth. And I thought that's the one area where the vanilla pricing be passed or have passed on should contribute to organic growth. Richard O'Leary: I think part of it -- I think probably the biggest driver, Gunther, is the prior year comp being quite strong. Gunther Zechmann : Okay. So, the outlook for 2018 is unchanged? Richard O'Leary: Yes, it's positive. Yes. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Richard O'Leary: There's nothing fundamental in the business has changed. Gunther Zechmann : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you very much for your attention and the questions. And we certainly will follow-up by one-on-one calls. Thank you very much and have a good day. Richard O'Leary: Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to today's conference call and webcast to discuss the merger between International Flavors & Fragrances and Frutarom as well as IFF's First Quarter 2018 Earnings. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Michael Deveau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining our call to discuss the combination of IFF and Frutarom as well as IFF's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Results. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and the press release and slide presentation regarding today's news are available on the IR section of IFF and Frutarom's respective websites. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued today, and is on our website. I would like to remind everyone that these statements being made -- that all statements being made during the call that relate to future results and events, including the proposed merger, are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those discussed here. Please refer to the information on the disclaimer slides in the presentation as well as the additional information contained in the regulatory filings for both companies. Presenting on the call today will be IFF's Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; Frutarom President and CEO, Ori Yehudai; and IFF Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary.  With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. This is an exciting day for both IFF and Frutarom. I'm going to take you through why we are so excited about the news we have announced today, and then I will cover the transaction terms. Ori will take you through Frutarom's and its history at a high level for those that are not familiar. Finally, we will delve deeper into the compelling strategy and financial rationale for this transaction. Lastly, Rich will conclude with a brief discussion of our strong first quarter earnings. So let's get started.  We believe this combination will create a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition. This transaction is a win for both company's shareholders. Among the important benefits we expect to realize by combining with Frutarom, IFF will significantly increase its position in natural solutions. We will also strengthen our exposure to fast-growing small and mid-sized customer accounts, gain new opportunities in attractive and fast-growing adjacencies such as natural colors, enzymes, antioxidants and health ingredients, and enhance our global reach. We will also be able to realize the benefit of strong talent comprising extraordinary employees globally. Overall, we have a tremendous opportunity to accelerate our growth, realize significant synergies and deliver attractive shareholder value.  Moving on to the terms of this transaction on Slides 7 and 8. Frutarom's shareholders will receive total considerations of $106.25 per share in a cash and stock transaction. The transaction has an implied enterprise value of approximately $7.1 billion. And the consideration is a mix of 67% cash and 33% stock, which provides shareholders both immediate value and the ability to participate in the compelling upside of the combination. Notably, the transaction has a significant synergy potential. We expect to realize approximately $145 million of run rate cost synergies by the third full year.  The transaction is expected to be neutral to adjusted cash earnings per share in the first full year and double-digit accretive to adjusted cash earnings per share in the second full year. The combined company is also expected to generate strong free cash flow. As such, we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend consistent with prior guidance following the close of the transaction.  We will also suspend our share repurchase program to prioritize debt reduction. In terms of financing, we have a solid foundation with a cash consideration expected to be financed with the combination of cash on hand, new debt raised and new equity of approximately $2.2 billion. We have bridge financing in place and the transaction is not subject to a financing condition. We are pleased that Ori has agreed to join us as strategic adviser following the close of the transaction to ensure a smooth transition. We are expecting to close in the next 6 to 9 months, subject, of course, to the receipt of regulatory approvals, a Frutarom shareholder vote and other customary closing conditions. Affiliates of ICC Industries Incorporated, which owns 36% of Frutarom, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction.  Before I hand over the call to Ori to tell you a bit more about Frutarom, I want to thank him and his team for the extraordinary effort they have put forth on this transaction. Over the last several months, as we worked on the details of bringing our 2 companies together, I have had an opportunity to get to know him and his team a lot. Everything I have learned during the process has confirmed my tremendous respect for Frutarom and its team. And I have shared with Ori on many occasions, Frutarom's expertise, reputation and record of performance is impressive. We have long admired Frutarom, and I'm excited to be combining forces. Ori? Ori Yehudai : Thank you, Andreas, and it's a great pleasure for me to participate in this first call, while we are aiming to combine these excellent 2 companies, IFF and Frutarom. I admire IFF since I joined this industry more than 33 years ago, and I'm sure that we'll all, including with my excellent colleagues, will admire the combined company going forward in the right ways. In a way, if you allow me on a personal note, just shortly, I'm closing like 2 wheels or circles right now after these 33 years. I joined the company in '86 with sales at that time $3 million. We were able to grow fast, double our company every 4 years, build a global company with 70,000 products sold to 30,000 customers in more than 160 countries. This is a great power to -- that we will be able to use together in the cross-selling opportunity, while we combine the excellent product portfolio and technology of the 2 companies. Of course, great support from the high technology of IFF that, of course, we didn't have access to before.  So we truly build a global company, combining fast internal growth above markets, 70 acquisitions added into the Frutarom portfolio and business over the years that enabled us to jump from $3 million in revenue to $1.6 billion to date, and hopefully more. The second circle that I can see is value creation. Frutarom became a public company about 22 years ago. Market cap was $13 million, 1-3 million. We are closing this circle today, which is only the beginning of the circle for me with a market valuation of over $7 billion. So we were able to give some value creation to our shareholders with a great belief that I already -- always mention. We must find a way how we combine 1 plus 1 that equal 3 or 4, because I'm very weak in mathematics.  I believe, and I'm sure that the combination of the 2 companies will allow Frutarom together with IFF to grow faster. Frutarom itself as a stand-alone company, had targets that were upgraded about 6 months ago, following excellent acquisitions that we did to $2.25 billion with EBITDA margin in our core business of above 23% before 2020. The 23% EBITDA margin I'm sure will be achieved much before, and I think the combination with IFF will enhance both the internal growth and the profitability following the synergies that were mentioned by my friend, Andreas, before and maybe he will come back to that later.  I believe that part of Frutarom's success was to see market trends before many of our competitors, in many cases, before the food industry saw the competitors. We built the company over the last 10 years on taste, on health, on naturals, on where -- on the areas where billions of consumers want to see in their foods and that's enabled us to grow at a double rate than the markets we are operating in with over 75% of our products today being natural products, much more than all our competitors. Another differentiation of Frutarom, definitely with IFF and with other large companies, that now we combine together to create higher value will be with our specific approach towards customers. 70% of them smaller, mid-sized local companies, out of them 1/3 of the company is private label. Private label sector in today's world is growing faster than many of the multinational. IFF's strength with the multinational. So we have now 2 strong legs, 1 with the multinational and 1 with the smaller customers and the private label primarily.  In the geography side, I think, again, we are dealing with complementary combination of 2 companies that are strong in different areas. And again, this will allow us to grow faster than the way we were going each company by itself up till now. The full solution of product that Frutarom can contribute with the cross-selling are getting now a very nice booster with the IFF technology. And I'm very, very optimistic that using these synergies in the best way will allow us to grow faster than any other company in our area. In the last few years, Frutarom added some new technology into its portfolio through several acquisitions, natural color, natural antioxidant; infant nutrition, a fast-growing business that we acquired through a company called Enzymotec; natural cosmetics ingredient, and we have more acquisition to do in that area.  Starter culture, that's a very profitable growing business. I will not have the time to mention all of them. We'll have the time, me and Andreas, to talk to you and give -- maybe give you some training about the Frutarom products to those that are less familiar with the Frutarom portfolio and how the combination of the 2 companies create, I believe, the best company in the industry.  I take this opportunity to thank Dr. John Farber, our Chairman, for his vision, support and trust and to thank our excellent employees that brought us to where we are now. On a personal note, I really feel lucky to be part of such an incredible group. And I'm excited and thankful for Andreas to invite me to be part of that. Thank you. Andreas, and the floor is yours, my boss. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Ori. Let's go a bit deeper on the compelling strategy and financial rationale. As you can see on the Slide 11, this transaction solidifies IFF as a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition. We are uniting 2 industry-leading, innovative companies with complementary customers and capabilities and a talented and committed workforce. Ori and the entire Frutarom team have done an incredible job innovating and building their natural platform. As a result, we will also become a global leader in this important arena and will be well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers and consumers.  We will offer our customers a stronger more differentiated portfolio of integrated solutions and capabilities. This will allow us to expand into attractive and fast-growing areas, such as enzymes, antioxidants, health ingredients and natural colors. Our customers will have access to a comprehensive portfolio with more value-added and integrated solutions. With Frutarom, we will significantly increase our exposure to fast-growing small- and mid-sized customers, which dovetails perfectly with our new Tastepoint platform. Slides 12 to 14 outline what the combined company will look like at a very high level. We will be positioned as the leader in natural capabilities, which will extend across our entire platform. Our customers will have access to comprehensive and differentiated integrated solutions with increased focus on naturals and health and wellness. This is consistent with the consumer trends we are all seeing. As an example, through their ALDI partnership Frutarom has developed food supplements, but also cosmetic solutions that can be additive to our active ingredients platform. For flavor, paprika combines the benefit of natural flavor and clean label color. In addition, rosemary extracts are powerful antioxidants offering health benefits to food and beverage solutions.  On Slide 13, you can see that the combined company is expected to have approximately $5.3 billion of revenues in 2018, making it one of the largest players in the industry.  Turning to Slide 14. Once the transaction is closed -- closes, we will have a more diversified and more favorable revenue mix. This shift also supports a more favorable growth profile. We will have new exposure to attractive adjacencies, such as enzymes, antioxidants, health ingredients and natural colors allowing us to expand beyond flavors. Importantly, the adjacencies Frutarom brings establishes competitive positions for the combined company in high value-added categories with increasing expected market growth rates.  Additionally, as outlined on Slide 15, by combining our R&D with the capabilities of Frutarom, we will be able to offer a full suite of value-enhancing integrated solutions to customers of all size. For example, we are excited about the potential to combine our technical expertise in savory modulation and delivery system with Frutarom's Savory Solutions to strengthen our product offering to our savory customers. On Beverages, combining our flavor and sweetness modulation expertise with Frutarom's citrus capabilities, natural antioxidants and natural colors, to build visually appealing, wholesome and nutritious beverage solutions. As a result, we will have products that are second to none.  As you can see on Slide 16, it is not just the market growth rate that makes us excited. The combination also increases IFF's access to faster-growing small- and mid-sized customers. This is a key demographic subset within the fast-growing markets just discussed that includes local and regional customers. We will also gain a presence with fast-growing private label customers.  Slide 17 provides more details on the significant synergies we expect to achieve from this transaction. We anticipate $145 million of run rate cost synergies by the third full year after closing with approximately 25% achieved in year 1. We expect the cost synergies to come from procurement, footprint optimization and streamlining overhead expenses. We have done our homework here and spent a lot of time looking at the business. We are confident that these are very -- these goals are very achievable. Cross-selling opportunities and integrated solutions are expected to provide revenue synergies, providing additional value to the shareholders over time.  As we have already discussed, we expect the transaction to drive strong earnings and cash flow accretion for the combined company. We anticipate double-digit cash EPS accretion in the second full year. Following the completion of the transaction, IFF is also expected to benefit from enhanced top line growth rates and a strong EBITDA margin. When you take all of this together, we expect tremendous value-creation opportunities. Importantly, we are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, and we'll prioritize deleveraging through our anticipated strong cash flow generation.  Wrapping up. Slide 19 underscores how this combination with Frutarom fits with our stated strategy and our refreshed Vision 2020 plan. Our Vision 2020 strategy focuses on building differentiation, accelerating profitable growth and increasing shareholder value. We look to win where we compete and strengthen our position through developing pioneering firsts. Our goal is to become our customers' partner of choice, and we will continue to look for ways to strengthen and expand our portfolio to fit into areas of expertise beyond the walls of IFF. This combination with Frutarom allows us to achieve all of these things.  With that, I turn the call over to Rich O'Leary to discuss our first quarter results before we open the call up for questions. Richard O'Leary: Thanks, Andreas. I'd like to now turn your attention to a review of our first quarter 2018 results. We have a few slides here to review. I'm pleased to report that we started off the year very well with robust growth across all of our key financial metrics.  Our first quarter sales growth was strong as currency-neutral sales increased 7%, which was comprised of 8% growth in Fragrances and 6% growth in Flavors. Top line trends remain strong in both businesses with new wins, volume and pricing all contributing to growth. In Fragrances, we delivered broad-based growth from all categories and regions. And in Flavors, we achieved growth in all categories and nearly all regions.  In terms of currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, our focus on driving greater efficiency throughout our business by our cost and productivity initiatives continue to support overall profitability. When combining this with our strong top line performance, we had strong leverage in the P&L as operating profit and EPS both grew 12% on an adjusted currency-neutral basis.  Turning to Slides 22 and 23. Flavors' currency-neutral sales increased 6% with growth coming from all categories led by strong improvements in Savory and Dairy. It should be noted, on a 2-year average basis, growth continues to be strong at approximately 8%.  From a regional perspective, 3 of the 4 regions delivered growth led by double-digit increases in both EAME and North America. EAME increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in Africa and the Middle East as well as mid-single digit growth in Europe. Growth was achieved across all categories, led by strong performance in Dairy, Beverage and Savory. North America increased 10%, driven by strong new wins in Beverage and Dairy as well as double-digit growth in Tastepoint.  While the impact of the acquisition was not material on our overall results, PowderPure added a couple of percentage points to growth in North -- in Greater Asia, 2% growth on a currency-neutral basis as double-digit growth in India and China was muted by softness in Indonesia and the Asean region. And Latin America decreased 2% as mid-single-digit growth in the Southern Cone was more than offset by softness in Mexico and Colombia, which had strong year ago comparison. In terms of profitability, Flavors' currency-neutral segment profit grew approximately 15% led by volume growth, the benefit from productivity and favorable sales mix. Currency-neutral segment profit margin achieved year-over-year margin expansion of approximately 190 basis points to 24.8%. Fragrances currency-neutral sales grew 8% in Q1, as growth was broad-based with contributions coming from all categories. Regionally, growth was led by double-digit increases in 3 of our 4 regions. From a category perspective, Fine Fragrances improved 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was led by strong double-digit growth in Latin America and North America. In these markets, performance was driven by new wins as well as increases in volume. Consumer Fragrances grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was achieved in all categories led by high single-digit performance in Home Care, Toiletries and Hair Care as well as mid-single digit performance in Fabric Care. The contribution of growth continues to be led by new wins, with modest improvement in volumes.  Fragrance ingredients sales were up 18% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in nearly all regions led by double-digit growth in Latin America, North America and Greater Asia. Cosmetics active ingredients also continue to perform well as it grew strong double digits in the first quarter. Fragrances segment profit in Q1 grew approximately 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven primarily by volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives. Currency-neutral segment profit margin increased 60 basis points year-over-year, finishing at 19.4% in the quarter.  As you see on the next slide, we are off to a strong start to the year and that gives us added confidence in achieving our financial objectives for 2018. And while it's still early in the year, we will -- we believe we'll be closer to the upper end of our previously communicated sales and operating profit guidance range. Those ranges are 3% to 5% currency-neutral sales growth, 5% to 7% currency-neutral adjusted operating profit and 4% to 6% currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth. In terms of foreign exchange, while there continues to be fluctuations, we expect currency-neutral translation to be favorable impact on sales of approximately 3 percentage points and add approximately 1.5 percentage points to adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, respectively.  With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich. Let's summarize. We are very pleased with our strong start to 2018. Sales growth was robust with growth across both business units, that when coupled with cost and productivity initiatives, translated into stronger currency-neutral adjusted operating profit and EPS growth. We are more confident in our outlook for year, as we expect to be towards the upper end of our previously communicated guidance range.  On this strong foundation, today's transaction comes from a position of strength. As we discussed, together with Frutarom, we anticipate delivering accelerated growth and offer our customers a stronger, more differentiated portfolio of integrated solutions, allowing us to expand beyond our core taste and scent businesses into nutrition. We will drive differentiation via R&D, balance our customer base by emphasizing fast-growing small and mid-sized customers and maximize our portfolio by expanding into fast-growing and diverse adjacencies. Our partnership will result in value creation for our shareholders and even more opportunities for the talented employees of both companies. We could not be more excited about what the future holds for both of us.  Operator, let's open for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I guess, just thoughts broadly, so the deal gets you bigger in Flavors, how do you think about the sustainability of Flavors' growth to remain ahead of Fragrances longer term? I guess, it has in recent years, so you're obviously expecting it to continue, but I guess I'd love to hear how you think about that. And then sort of related to it, thoughts on the strategic rationale for buying a business that had some overlap of competing within your core business, Flavors and Fragrances, I get they're not completely a competitor, with some smaller customer exposure. But how do you think about going into more traditional F&F versus going into an adjacent category at scale as Enzymotec, something like that? So I guess, thoughts on just overall growth rates would be helpful. Andreas Fibig : Okay. Yes, absolutely, Mark. So first of all, we would like to see that it's just an overlap on the classic and traditional flavors, but what we see is here a whole range of exciting adjacencies. And you well know, with our Vision 2020, we have started to expand beyond Flavors already and beyond Fragrances actually with the acquisition, for example, of LMC, where we went into active cosmetic ingredients. By the way, we will strengthen with the Frutarom acquisition the active cosmetics business as well, because we have parts of it in it. And if you look at all the different markets, and actually we have one of the slides showing it very well, the adjacencies. The market growth of these adjacencies is a bit higher than in our traditional F&F. And we have some of these areas which was really good profitability as well, so we are basically building beyond the traditional Flavor business. That's the reason why we like to talk in the future about taste and nutrition as the 2 elements or segments where we are in. We actually believe that the deal with Frutarom is very complementary, actually in many regards; in terms of the portfolio and the technologies; in terms of the geographic exposure, because we are filling in some gaps we are having, for example, in Eastern Europe, where Frutarom is just very, very, very strong. So that's helping us a lot. So for me, it's a very natural prolongation of our Vision 2020 strategy and fits exactly into that. That's the reason why Ori and myself saw this combination as something which is just unbeatable, because it fits so well together. So we're a bit stronger on the taste and nutrition side, but we believe that's really good. Rich, do you want to step in? Richard O'Leary: Yes, I mean, Andreas, and Mark, I mean, for me I think it is very -- it's a great opportunity. It shifts the overall mix when you think about it. It's going to be favorable in terms of accelerating growth for the combined companies. From a business standpoint, the overall -- we know the overall markets on the Flavors side are higher than on the Fragrances side, but both businesses remain very attractive and very profitable. It helps from a category standpoint that Andreas talked about, that we're getting access to and a foundation to build upon some of the faster-growing adjacencies that we've targeted and saw real opportunities for our Vision 2020. And then the access to the faster-growing local and regional customers, all those things are going to be positive for the overall growth profile of the company. Andreas Fibig : And the good thing on the customer side there is, the overlap is not that big. So it actually helps us for the cross-selling quite tremendously, because we can sell our technology to Frutarom customers and vice versa. So we believe that we'll create a lot of value going forward just cross-selling. Mark Astrachan : Great. And just following up on the last point. So how confident are you in retaining the customers? I guess, if you can give more of a specific percentage of customer overlap, that would be helpful. And just sort of another broader question related to customers. So your gross margins were a bit better in the quarter than I think most would have expected, certainly us. Have -- has the push back on the pricing which you talked about last fall subsided? And in doing a deal like this, do you think that helps get more scale? And just how do you think about the puts and takes in dealing with your customers on a go-forward basis? Obviously, you're offering them more solutions, but they're all still under pressure on their -- in their earnings algorithm. Andreas Fibig : So if you look at the customer base, Frutarom is covering around about 30,000 customers, we cover around about 3,000 customers. So there is actually, as I said, not a lot of overlap. We believe that the danger that we are losing important customers is very, very little. We don't think that will happen. The good thing as well on the Frutarom side is because they are standing on so many legs with so many different customers, there is not this big customer, if we lose it, it will put the deal into jeopardy. I think it's actually a very good risk mitigation for all of us that they have such a wide customer base. And we will now go really into the targeting, how we do the cross-selling in the best possible way. On the pricing? Richard O'Leary: It -- I mean, I think, my first comment I would say, when you look at the categories, I mean, there's not -- they are -- in a lot of ways, Frutarom, their business, where there is overlap from a customer standpoint, so a lot of that's coming in categories that we don't have today. So again, I feel like the risk of overlap is quite low, from a pricing standpoint, but not -- I mean, it's a market environment and we have to manage through that the way we do day in, day out every day, okay? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : First thing I wanted to ask about was just integration. So my understanding is Frutarom has been very, very active on the M&A front. And so as you're thinking about synergies and integration, I wanted to know, one; how much of the $145 million is sort of inclusive of integration plans that Frutarom was already in the middle of pursuing? And then secondly, if some of those plans kind of get reworked, because now integration may be meaning something different as you're integrating some of those deals into a bigger sort of infrastructure, vis-\u00e0-vis IFF. And just kind of visibility on timing of those pieces. Andreas Fibig : So Lauren, thank you for the question. And indeed, the integration is of utmost importance. First of all, we have started already with Ori and the Frutarom team to identifying what are the areas and that's how we came up with the $145 million. And we are actually very confident that we can achieve that. And we looked during the DD, from our point of -- our vantage point on the integration, and we believe that we have already a good idea and a good plan in place. We will bring up an integration office, which is manned with people from both companies with one of our high-ranking IFF executives to lead this team for the next 1.5 or 2 years to really make it a priority for us. Actually we have even set up a board integration committee, which is led by -- as a Chairman, by Marcello Bottoli to make sure that we have the right focus on it. So I believe we are very well prepared. And then we should not underestimate that what Frutarom has done in the last couple of years is a lot of work on integration already. So we are counting here on a very experienced team, which can support us to bring this all on board. Richard O'Leary: Yes, I think from my standpoint, Lauren, I mean, we really did start with a clean sheet of paper and said, okay, let's look at the 2 organizations. Where are these opportunities? Whether it's from a technology standpoint, whether it's from a sourcing standpoint, manufacturing footprint, the overhead expenses, and I think we know we feel very good about and confident about our ability to deliver on that and leverage -- as Andreas said, leverage the talent and the expertise on both sides of the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Michael Sison : In terms of the accretion potential in year 2, can you maybe talk through what type of growth you expect Frutarom to generate in that year? How much of the synergy would come in year 1 or in year 2? And then maybe frame up the -- I guess, your long-term growth, if you grow EPS organically, add double digits or 10% or something, that would be kind of a strong double-digit mid- to high-teens EPS growth in year 2, is that the way to kind of think about it? Richard O'Leary: Mike, there's a lot there. I'm not sure I can write that fast. Look, I think from a synergy standpoint, the cost side as we talked about in our previous materials, we think about 25% of the synergies will come in year 1. There will be probably between 70%, 75% in year 2. And then fully in year 3. Year 2 -- year 1, we believe we're basically going to be neutral from a cash EPS standpoint and as we said earlier, double-digit increase and double-digit improvement in cash basis in year 2. From a top line standpoint, there is -- again, this is an attractive business. Frutarom has had a consistent growth trajectory on an organic basis for the last 3 years, growing faster than we have been growing. On top of that there is benefits associated with their M&A program, which has been a crucial part of their business strategy. So I think on an absolute basis, combining organic growth and some of the carryover impacts of their M&A program will have higher growth in year 1, and then the normal growth at the higher end of the range going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : So I have 2 questions. One is just, can you talk about how much overlap there is in North America specifically? Because I know that's where you've made an effort to target some of the smaller and medium-sized customers? And to the extent there is, sort of how do you plan to run the business together in North America, and then just globally post deal closure? And then my second question is just on, it seems like Frutarom's gross margins and EBITDA margins are a bit lower than yours. Do you see that as an opportunity or do you think that's a function of the categories that they are in versus that you're in? Andreas Fibig : Faiza, thank you for the question. I'll take the first part and then Rich, the second one. So actually North America -- the overlap is very, very, very small how we see it. But it will fit actually very, very well into our business, in particular with the Tastepoint we have set up here. So we will make now this part of the business super, super strong, and it will help us in our home market actually a great deal. Rich? Richard O'Leary: Yes. From my standpoint, looking at the margins, I mean, first of all, Frutarom's had a tremendous impressive record of growing the business while expanding margins. It's a very strong business, and we're extremely pleased to have that opportunity to combine the 2 companies. I think some of the opportunities and the differences reflected in the margin is reflected in the synergy opportunities that we already discussed earlier. And other piece of it can be mix related also. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I guess, my first question would be just around kind of what pro forma growth margins, capital intensity of the business. And as you think about what the pro forma organic revenue growth would look like for the combined business. I mean, acquisitions post close, I'd imagine would become less kind of eminent strategic priority. And then on the capital intensity portion, what the working capital -- do you see any opportunities in working capital post the deal? I think the cost synergies, which is the cost number and there wasn't any identified cash synergies. And then 1 quick follow-up on the quarter, you exceeded kind of your range on growth on all metrics, but the guidance range was left unchanged. Could you talk about drivers of implied deceleration over the balance of the year? Richard O'Leary: Okay. So I mean, from a growth perspective I'll give you some comments on the last one now, and directionally we're not going to get into specifics. From a margin potential, I mean, when you look at the 2 businesses, add on the synergies, we feel like we're going to be well positioned to be competitive at the high end of the market in terms of overall EBITDA margins. From a capital intensity standpoint, I think there's opportunities as we combine both organizations to drive improvements on an overall basis in terms of our working capital performance. It's going to help drive the cash flow over the next 5 years to help drive the deleveraging. That's important for our overall strategy. From a CapEx standpoint, I think as we look at the overall position, over time it will come down. Again, we have to work through, some of the integration work will require some one-off CapEx. And then -- so there'll be some -- included in our estimates of the cash flow models over the next couple of years, is some CapEx necessary to drive the synergies from a manufacturing standpoint. But overall, this is a very strong business. Both businesses are extremely profitable. Strong cash generation and that's going to get us where we need to be to grow the business and also deleverage on an accelerated basis. From a earnings standpoint in our guidance, there is an implied difference between first half or Q1 sort of first -- strong start in Q1. As we talked about on the last call; number 1, the second half comps in the last year becomes much, much stronger compared to the first half last year. We feel confident about our ability to get to the higher end of the range from growth, from a sales and operating profit standpoint. As I've talked about on the prior call, there is still a lot movement in the industry in terms of demand, inventory impacts, and so I think we're being appropriately cautious at this point in terms of our guidance for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley of Vertical Group. Brett Hundley : I just had 2. The first one is a simple one. I was just curious if Frut will continue its M&A strategy during the next few months? I know their pipeline is very full, so I just wanted a comment on that. And then secondly, Andreas, in our opinion, Frut grows the way that it does, because of its, what I'll call a satellite approach and heavy levels of decentralization, so their culture seems very different than yours. And honestly, when we speak to other companies in the industry, many times they say that they don't even know when they're going up against Frutarom in a bid or something like that just because of all their disparate acquisitions over time. So it does seem like you really have your work cut out for you in realizing your synergy target, which is a pretty high target to begin with. Do you feel like you're being aggressive with the time line of synergy realization? And can you just delve back into the confidence that you have in realizing that target and the work that you've done? Because again, I think some of us are just thinking, while Frut has all these different businesses then IFF may potentially have some real work ahead of it? Richard O'Leary: So let me start with your easy one. From an M&A standpoint, I mean, as I made in the comment earlier, I mean, the M&A part has been an important part of the growth strategy and the vision for Frutarom. It's a key core competency of the Frutarom organization. We want to continue to leverage that and help drive the growth as combined companies. We're confident given the strong cash flow of both businesses and the industry as a whole that we can continue to execute on the M&A platform, while aggressively deleveraging the company. Andreas Fibig : On the second question, we believe that both companies have an entrepreneurial culture and that is a pretty good alignment. So we don't believe that we have an aggressive time line on the cost synergy realization. So we feel real good about this. And if you think, what we have started now, let's say, a year, 2 years ago with our Tastepoint experiment in the U.S., it basically shows how you can deal with these smaller companies. Remember, we brought David Michael and Ottens and we have combined them into the Tastepoint as an outreach or platform for the more regional, smaller and mid -- or mid-sized customers. I believe that we have already some expertise. And that we also know when you build this platform, for example, how do you basically separate the traditional IFF business with the big customers, but still make sure that companies like Tastepoint and now in the future, the Frutarom subsidiaries will get access to IFF technology. And that's the part of cross-selling which will create a lot of value going forward. And I believe that's a tremendous opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. John Roberts : Could you comment on margins on the 25% of sales that aren't Flavors? I assume trading is below average, and natural colors, enzymes and antioxidants are above average? Richard O'Leary: Yes, that -- I think that's the right way to think about it. I mean, the trading business is very much almost like a distribution type, so the margins are low, but it's a key value-add service that the Frutarom business provides to its customers. John Roberts : And then, how do you plan on reporting the non-Flavors part of Frutarom? I think sometimes the way companies report kind of tells us a little about how they'll manage the businesses well. Will you roll it into Flavors like you do with Lucas Meyer in Fragrances? Or will you put it over with the Fragrance Ingredients or how do you plan to handle that? Andreas Fibig : Yes, what we will do over the next couple of months until the closing is that, we will come up with the right structure for the business going forward, which is -- positions us to capture the value as best as we can. And then we will basically decide on the reporting structure here as well. And you are right, John, there are a couple of ways to go and now we have much more businesses, we have to look how we do it in the best possible way to make sure also that we support the cross-selling. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Feeney of Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Andreas, we've talked for a while about -- so one of the first questions I ever came up with, I know it was a good one, was why mergers between the largest flavor and fragrances houses in the world don't really make sense. And I was referring to Givaudan, Symrise and Firmenich, there is discrete capabilities, there is overlapping customers. So what -- are there aspects of this transaction that suffer from that? Like do you -- are there major overlaps where you have -- you commented on the existing customer base, is there something special about Frutarom and IFF's capabilities that make that a lot less of a problem? And -- or if you wouldn't mind, if I could ask you, what makes IF -- certainly a great company, lot of growth for all the reasons you outlined and incredibly are going to -- would accelerate any flavor house's growth. Why IFF as a partner, owner, colleagues going forward? Andreas Fibig : So let me start with it and then hand it over to Ori. So for us, the great thing about this and why we believe it's the best fit you can find in the industry is that we don't have these major overlaps, either in the customer base, which basically broadens the customer base of the new company and also makes us much, much stronger on the naturals, which is a very great strategic fit for us. So Ori, why IFF? Ori Yehudai : Many reasons. First is the one is the guy that talked before me, Andreas, that I think in a way just in love with him and decided to go with him even though we had other bidders and other interested parties that were less attractive to Frutarom. But on a more, I would say, serious note, even though the previous one was the truth, I mean, look, there are not -- there aren't too many flavor or specialty farm ingredients that are relevant in this space. Financial investor is not interested -- interesting for Frutarom, because it's not money that we are looking for. I strongly believe, and Andreas correctly said, that here we're really talking about the combination of 2 companies that are operating in different fields in 80% of the cases. If you're talking about Savory Solutions for the processed meat, processed fish, ready meals, Frutarom built over the last 12 years a leadership position in that area and that's not the strength of IFF. So here, this will be completely complementary to IFF, but we will use the excellent capabilities of IFF in flavor creation of specialty savory ingredients. When you go to natural products, again, Frutarom built over the last 10 years an exciting product portfolio, i.e., natural color, natural antioxidants, natural cosmetics ingredients that, of course, will go together with IFF and give them a very nice boost with high-end technology of products coming from ALDI or coming from extracts and other applications. The difference in customer portfolio, 75% of Frutarom customers mid to -- local midsized with a special emphasis on the private label, I believe that was not the focus of IFF, correctly so as a large company. And I'm sure that between Andreas and me and the management, we will know how to -- not to lose customers and really use both expertise to create the 1 plus 1 equal 4. So it's the combination of the differentiation in customers, differentiation in product. And then talk about geography. Frutarom is very strong in some geographies where I believe IFF historically were not very strong. I will give examples. Central and East Europe, very strong growth for Frutarom, but not where IFF invested before. Frutarom is very, very weak in Asia, IFF is strong in Asia and now we have both Frutarom portfolio and IFF portfolio to go to the same customers. Frutarom acquired Enzymotec with the infant nutrition business, that's not a business that IFF has, but IFF has many large customers that are using, or might use, this type of technology, so we are going to a new area of basic nutrition ingredients that enhance our position. Frutarom acquired a company called Taura with unique amazing technology to dry fruits within less than 1 minute in an authentic way, no flavor, no sugar added. This is extremely interesting for many customers. For example, in the United States, nutritional bars, many other areas, the large customers that are IFF customers, not necessarily Frutarom customers. So the entrance into these customers will be much higher. I can continue talking about it for another year, but really this is about creating value and growth. And I strongly believe that this is what we are going to achieve together. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann of Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Look, you've spoken a lot about the synergy potential and the margins. Can I just ask at all the returns from the Frutarom acquisition for IFF? You've got this target to and your cost of capital within 3- to 5-year time horizon. I think all, except one acquisition were within that time frame. Where does Frutarom in your projections stands on return on invested capital basis? That's the first one. And the second one, on sales synergies, you've got $145 million in cost synergies by the third full year of acquiring Frutarom. You've spoken a lot of the sales synergies, but can you put some numbers on that? That would be very helpful. Richard O'Leary: Okay. Let me start with the first one from a return standpoint. Yes, this -- given the size and the transformative nature of this deal, I think we're looking at 2 different ways. One, on a cash basis, again focusing on how strong a business both companies are, we're probably going to -- we're going to -- we project that we're going to get the cost of capital returns between year 5 and year 6 on a cash basis. On a GAAP basis, probably another year later, 1 additional year, so we still feel very good about the return profiles of combining the 2 companies and certainly the long-term value creation that combining the 2 companies provide. From a synergy standpoint, again, we're focused on the cost synergies. We do believe that there's substantial opportunity out there from a cross selling standpoint, but don't -- we're not going to comment specifically on what that value is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fintan Ryan of Berenberg. Andreas Fibig : Next question, operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lambert of Raymond James. Patrick Lambert : Two questions for me. I think a bit financial related to the transaction. The cost of integration of the businesses, you haven't mentioned it. And questions around the IT systems, any -- anything that you think is going to be a bit challenging in terms of integrating Frutarom to IFF? Linked to that also, again for, I guess, Richard, which is the tax impact. What can you actually deduct, I know it could be a good driver for value if you can deduct a lot of the intangibles there. And finally, I think you answered the overlap of clients, but a very quick one on Q1 results in terms of the 8% Fragrance growth, in particular. How much was pricing versus volume overall for IFF and in Fragrance in particular? And are you a bit more in -- could you a bit more precise your view on the citral disruption and impact in Q2, Q3 and the remainder of the year? Have you got a bit more details on that, a bit more granularity on it? Andreas Fibig : Maybe I'll take the last question first. So on Q1, as you were saying very strong growth on the Fragrance side, there was not much pricing built in this -- in the first quarter. So it's volume, which is great. On the citral situation, you probably see that the BSF is coming back to manufacturing, so we are basically for the second and third quarter on our plan. And we are actually in a very good position to deliver what our customers' need. And we're optimistically going forward. So that's where we are. And we are in a very good position. Now I hand over to Rich on the financials. Richard O'Leary: Okay. Thanks, Andreas. Yes, just one quick comment, I mean, on the Fragrance growth, it was predominantly volume and commercial performance, new wins, but there was pricing in there, so it was helpful. In terms of citral, I do think it's going to be heavily in the impact. As Andreas said, we're on target with our previous estimates. We still believe that's appropriate. I think, we'll see the biggest impact in Q2 and Q3, again, depending on what happens from their side. From a cost standpoint, the cost to execute and achieve the synergies, it's roughly 1.3x, it's in the ballpark. It's a combination of cost. As I mentioned earlier, there is some capital in there that we believe is going to be necessary to be spent in order to achieve the synergies. From a financing standpoint, it's still pretty early in the process. I think there are opportunities and we'll structure the deal at -- within the company in order to optimize that from a standpoint, look at where the business operates, where the cash flows are generated. So we still have some opportunities there to work through, but I think we're confident in our ability to help -- to have that drive, the delta to see returns that I talked about earlier, in year 2 on a cash basis.  No, I mean -- it's part of what I just said we still have to go through the details and work with the Frutarom team in terms of how to optimize and structure that so it allows us to generate -- get the cash from where it's generated to where we need to do to pay down the debt, and that -- work with the specifics of the tax implications associated with that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fintan Ryan of Berenberg. Fintan Ryan : I think most of my questions have been answered, but I would just like to get a sense that within the synergy plans or the integration going forward, do you plan on any asset disposals, particularly around some of the trading and marketing operations within Frutarom? And/or within the duration as well, I know Frutarom has acquired majority stakes in a number of entities. Is there any sort of change in control at provision in those deals so that you need to buy out some of the minorities as well taking on just the bulk of Frutarom equity? Andreas Fibig : No, actually, we are not planning to dispose any of the businesses, at least not big parts. And we go forward with the businesses where Frutarom has entered into agreements and has majority parts of the business. So I think that will be business as usually for Frutarom and for us going forward as well. Richard O'Leary: Yes. I think, as I mentioned earlier, the trading business is a value-added service that Frutarom management team believes its central in terms of their relationship with the customers. Again, we'll look at potential asset sales, as we work through the integration process, but it's too early to say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Rafaisz of UBS. Patrick Rafaisz : From a technical point of view, on the contracts you have, is there a break fee in case the transaction doesn't happen? And can you elaborate a bit on what happens to -- or with the other interested party that was mentioned to be involved? Why was that an inferior solution? And lastly, you talked a lot about the complementarity of the business and very little overlaps. And so does that mean that you do not foresee any antitrust-related issues in any of the key markets in this transaction? Andreas Fibig : So let me start with the last piece. We certainly have to work with the regulatory authorities on the antitrust, but in our initial assessment, we believe it will be positive and benign, so we don't expect any extra hurdles here. And then, I hand over to... Richard O'Leary: Yes, from a -- there is included in the sales purchase agreement a break-up fee. It's standard and it's consistent with industry standards. Andreas Fibig : And on the other interested party, I think Ori gave the reason why he believes that IFF is the best partner in the industry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sipke Moes of Kempen Capital Management. Sipke Moes : I have one question. I heard somebody referring to that he was not that good at mathematics, but I'm now beginning to do doubt myself. I'm also wondering if you could give a pro forma leverage for the deal because I saw somewhere $3.7 billion, but I'm not exactly sure how you arrived at that specific number. Andreas Fibig : Thank you for the question. Rich? Richard O'Leary: Yes, it's $3.7 billion on a simple basis in terms of just looking at net debt over the EBITDA on a run-rate basis. And then, we expect, as I said, to get -- delever quickly over the next 18 to 24 months and probably get down to less than 2.5x over that period. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now return the call to Andreas for any additional or closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Well, it's an exciting day for Frutarom and for IFF. We're making really good progress, and I would like to thank all of you as well for participating in the call. I think it worked out very well and the 2 of us believe it's a real strong combination, and it's more than 1 plus 1 is 3 or 4. I think going forward, it will be a great future for both companies. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

Please refer to the information on the disclaimer slide as well as the additional information contained in the regulatory filings of both companies. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. On the call today, our plan is to review our financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2018. Provide an update on our financial expectations for the full year, excluding the impact of Frutarom and give insights into the strong progress we have made relative to the Frutarom transaction. Then, we will be happy to take any questions that you may have as usual. Starting with a recap of our first half 2018 performance, growth was strong across all of our key financial metrics and in line with the objectives we set out for ourselves earlier this year. Currency neutral sales increased 6% in the first half, with both business units growing 6%, respectively. New win performance, volume growth on existing business and price increases to offset rising material cost all contributed to consolidated growth. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 5% as volume improvements and our focus to drive greater efficiencies throughout our business via costs and productivity initiatives continue to support overall profitability. Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved 10%, driven by improvements in adjusted operating profit, as well as a more favorable effective tax rate. I'm very pleased to also report that we are making strong progress against our four refreshed strategic priorities. Solidifying our position to drive differentiation, sales of our sweetness and savory modulation portfolio continued to grow strong double digits across all categories led by savory and dairy. PowderPure, our platform for clean label solutions, grew an impressive triple digits as we continue to scale this unique and differentiated technology. Performance with local and regional customers also remained strong, growing double that of our global customers. And it's a trend that we see across both business units. In Flavors specifically, our mid-sized go-to-market platform Tastepoint continues to deliver strong results, improving strong double digits in the first half of 2018. In terms of maximizing our portfolio, driving growth in our most margin accretive categories, cosmetic active ingredients continued its robust growth trend by improving very strong double digits. And hair care, home care, and toiletries improved high single digits. In Flavors, growth was strong in dairy and beverage, improving double digits and high single digits respectively. We also remain diligent in our focus to drive greater efficiencies in our business, allowing us to reallocate resources to efforts that drive the greatest returns. This yielded strong results in the first half 2018 as our cost of productivity initiatives, including zero-based budgeting, added approximately 5 percentage points of growth to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and EPS growth. All in all, we believe all parties are well-positioned in our strategy to drive long-term value for shareholders. Our pending transaction with Frutarom, which I will touch on in more detail shortly, will support and accelerate efforts across all of these pillars. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. [07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]: Thanks, Andreas. And moving on to our Q2 performance, currency neutral sales in the second quarter grew 5%. Growth was broad based as all regions and categories across both Flavors and Fragrances posted solid results. From a profitability standpoint, currency neutral adjusted operating profit declined 2% in the second quarter, as top line growth and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by the impact of higher raw material costs, including the previously announced BASF citral supply issue. Pricing was up about 1.5 percentage points in the quarter on a consolidated basis. However, as expected, it did not offset raw material pressure in our Fragrance business unit. As we move through the back half of the year, we expect the price to raw material cost dynamic to improve as pricing takes hold in Fragrances. We are pleased that despite these challenges, we were able to achieve 8% currency neutral adjusted EPS growth as we benefited from a more favorable year-over-year effective tax rate and higher other income. Looking at our business unit performance for the second quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 6% with growth coming in all categories and all regions. It should be noted that on a two-year average basis, growth was very strong at approximately 9%. North American Flavors improved 9% in the second quarter led by high-single digit growth at Tastepoint and strong new wins in beverage, dairy, and sweet. EAME increased 5% on a currency neutral basis led by strong double-digit growth in Africa and the Middle East, as well as mid-single-digit growth in Europe. Greater Asia grew 2% in the second quarter on a currency neutral basis. A strong double-digit growth in China and India was largely offset by softness in Indonesia and Thailand. Latin America increased 8% on a currency neutral basis led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Mexico. Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 6% led primarily by volume growth and the benefits from our ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, we achieved margin expansion year-over-year of approximately 10 basis points to 24.3%. Fragrance currency neutral sales improved 5% driven by broad-based region and category growth. From a category perspective, consumer fragrances grew 5% on a currency neutral basis. As growth was achieved in all categories led by double-digit growth in hair care, as well as mid-single digit increases in toiletries, home care, and fabric care. Fine fragrances improved 1% on a currency neutral basis against the very strong 11% comparison in the prior year period. Growth was led by double-digit increase in Latin America and low single-digit growth in North America. It should be noted that EAME and Greater Asia were soft. However, it was due to a strong year-over-year comparison of 19% and 25%, respectively. Fragrance ingredient sales were up 10% on a currency neutral basis with growth in three of our four regions, driven by improvements in volume and higher pricing related to raw material costs. From a profit perspective, Fragrance currency neutral segment profits decreased 9% on a currency neutral basis, as volume growth and cost and productivity benefits were more than offset by higher price to input costs, including the BASF citral issue. As I mentioned, as we move through the back half of the year, we expect the price to raw material cost dynamic to improve as pricing takes effect. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, our profit profile remains solid yet was under pressure year-over-year. Before I move on, I want to provide some more commentary on the raw material environment. Coming into the year, we expected mid-single digit raw material inflation in 2018, inclusive of the impact of the citral situation, with that heavier based in the Fragrance business unit. Since that time, cost inflation has picked up following a series of disruptions in the supply chain. There have been fires at several ingredient suppliers, increased environmental actions on suppliers in China, and to a lesser extent, rising oil prices. Based on what we're seeing today, we expect incremental inflationary pressure as we exit 2018 and head into 2019. It remains imperative that we achieve incremental price increases or identify other actions in unison with our customers to ensure we cover our raw material cost exposure over time. Operating cash flow was $55 million compared to $58 million for the first half of the year. Performance was primarily impacted by a product recall payment as we previously disclosed, as well as costs associated with the bridge loan commitment fees, the combination of which was approximately $40 million. In addition, there was an increased level of working capital. Working capital was primarily impacted by higher inventory due to rising raw material cost, increased volume associated with the pre-building of inventory related to citral issue, and higher than anticipated sales volumes. Over the course of the year, we expect all the elements of working capital to improve. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $67 million in capital expenditures or about 3.6% of sales. And we continue to believe we'll spend approximately 4% to 5% of sales in 2018 on CapEx. Regarding cash return to shareholders, in the first half, we spent approximately $109 million on dividend payouts and $15 million on share repurchases. As part of the Frutarom combination, we have paused our share repurchase program as we prepare for the financing of the transaction and prioritize debt repayments going forward. Also, last week, our board of directors authorized a 6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.73 per share on the company's common stock. The increased dividend reflects the board's confidence in the cash generation potential and financial strength of the company. We will maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we continue to accelerate growth through organic investments and strategic acquisitions, while returning significant capital to shareholders. As we look towards the balance of the year, I want to provide some commentary on our financial expectations excluding the Frutarom transaction. All of our currency neutral metrics have not changed. Based on our strong year-to-date performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we are reconfirming our previously stated full year currency neutral guidance. As world currencies versus the dollar continue to fluctuate, we do expect to see an impact in terms of our top line. Based on current rates, we believe that we will have a 2 percentage point benefit on consolidated sales growth versus 3% previously indicated. While many currencies have an impact, the largest is the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate. On an adjusted profit and adjusted EPS basis, we anticipate the benefit of FX to be the same as previously communicated, due primarily to our 12 to 18 month rolling hedging program and movements of various other currencies. For your reference, please note that we remain hedged at approximately 80% on the euro, profit exposure at $1.15 for 2018 and are approximately hedged at 35% at $1.23 for 2019. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas, who would walk you through an update on Frutarom transaction. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. First, I would like to reiterate that we continue to be very excited about the combination and it will create a global leader in natural taste, scent and nutrition with an expected 2018 pro forma sales of $5.3 billion and it is a win for both companies' shareholders. Together, IFF and Frutarom will have a broader customer base, more diversified product offerings and an increased market penetration. We will instantly become a leader in natural solutions. We will also strengthen our exposure to fast-growing small and mid-sized customer accounts, gain new opportunities in attractive and fast-growing adjacencies and enhance our global reach. We also anticipate cost synergies through raw material harmonization, footprint optimization and streamlining overhead expenses. Additional cross-selling opportunities and integrated solutions are expected to provide revenue synergies to our shareholders over time. Both organizations have a strong talent base, comprising thousands of extraordinary employees globally. And through our integration planning work, we continue to be confident in the opportunities that lie ahead and the ability of the combination to accelerate profitable growth, enhance free cash flow, and generate greater returns for our IFF shareholders. Since the announcement of the deal on May 7, we really have made strong advancements towards the deal close, and I would like to give you an update on a few. On Monday, Frutarom received shareholder approval for the transaction. Of the votes cast at the special general meeting, about 95% were in favor of the proposed merger, representing approximately 75% of all outstanding shares. We are pleased that Frutarom shareholders have approved the combination with IFF, marking another milestone in our path to unlock the value creation potential of the combined company. We continue to have comprehensive pre-close meetings and discussions on talent, R&D, adjacencies, and business and functional integration to ensure that when this transaction closes, we are ready to execute and drive profitable growth by capitalizing on the best of both organizations. We also want to take a moment to reiterate our intention to remain listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange upon completion of the transaction. Given the progress to-date, we now expect to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, earlier than our previously communicated timeline of six to nine months from May 7 announcement. This timing continues to be driven primarily by the completion of the remaining anti-trust reviews. To ensure the most successful integration, we have structured our approach in a very disciplined manner with strong and dedicated teams, foundational in our approach of four guiding principles. The first includes the establishment of a cross-functional team across both organizations directly involving about 75 people committed 30% to 100% of their time to the integration depending on the nature of their role. To complement and support this team, we have engaged external advisors such as leading consulting from across a variety of specialties. Our second core principle is to protect the core business and deliver the plan. As both organizations are entering the transaction as a position of strength, it's very important that we do not lose focus and continue to deliver strong financial performance. At the same time, the integration team is responsible for realizing our targeted cost synergies and capture cross-selling opportunities. Leading the integration for us is Francisco Fortanet and Amos Anatot for Frutarom. Francisco is the EVP of Operations for IFF and has extensive experience leading manufacturing procurement plus strong cross-functional leadership, robust commercial support and expertise bringing innovation to market. Amos is the EVP of Global Supply Chain and Operation for Frutarom and has a robust knowledge of the day-to-day operations at Frutarom and is actively involved in all business aspects. Together, both are excited and very engaged to ensure the successful completion and integration of our two great companies. Aligned with our second core principle to protect growth trajectory of both businesses, we are structuring our Day 1 Model to ensure that once the transaction closes, Frutarom will remain as a standalone unit for now and will maintain their current to go market strategy given they are a very customer-centric organization, it is critical that we limit the changes on the front end of the business. We want to ensure that there are zero disruption to customers and they continue to provide their products as effectively and efficiently as they have done in the past. To drive cost synergy realization, which I will cover in more details in a moment, we plan to leverage IFFs global expertise and shared service model. As time progresses, we will slowly centralize various group functions to further unlock value. Simultaneously, we intend to drive cross-selling to sharing our vast technologies and categories expertise across the organization. While going through the integration process, there will be areas where we selectively lift and shift as appropriate based on the long-term strategy of the business. One example is the cosmetic active ingredients where we are moving Frutarom's business into our LMC infrastructure. As we outlined on May 7, we plan to unlock significant cost synergies related to the Frutarom acquisitions. I'd now like to give you a bit more clarity on where the $145 million cost synergies target will come from and the estimated timing of this. We expect approximately 40% of the cost synergies targeted to come from procurement, as we accelerate the rationalization and harmonization of raw materials across both organizations. Activities include make versus buy, vendor consolidation, centralization of spend which will all contribute to the savings. Approximately 30% will come from operations, as we optimize the global footprint. Given the large infrastructure of both organizations, approximately 110 sites on a combined basis, there are a lot of potential options to optimize our combined footprint. Out of the anticipated $145 million of our run rate cost synergies, we estimate approximately 20% to 30% to come from streamlining of overhead expenses. It should be noted that less than 10% will come from business development as we are taking steps to ensure the preservation of the customer service levels at both companies. In terms of timing, we anticipate $145 million of run rate cost synergies for the third full year after closing with approximately 25% achieved in 2019, 17% in 2020, and the remainder in 2021. In addition to the cost synergies, and that's where I'm most excited about, we believe there's a strong potential to drive accelerated growth by capitalizing on revenue synergies. Stepping back not only does this combination create a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition, the combined organization will have the broadest customer base and strongest product offering and deepest markets penetration in our industry. With respect to customers, we at IFF are extremely well-positioned with global multinationals. Out of our approximately 3,000 customers, 50% of our sales are global customers where we are participant on nearly all global correlates. The balance, our sales, our local and regional customers, strategic focus for us where we are utilizing mid-tier customer go-to-market model like Tastepoint. Frutarom, on the other hand, has approximately 30,000 customers of which 70% are small, mid-sized, and private label accounts. By putting us together, we will have a very strong distribution network ranging from the largest global customers to start-ups and private label accounts. In terms of product, we pride ourselves in our ability to bring differentiating and unique innovation to the market. With approximately 8% of our sales spend in R&D, we have developed industry-leading technologies across various areas, including modulation, delivery, natural cosmetics and so on. And our pipeline right now is as well-filled as it was never in the history of IFF. Frutarom has a leading natural portfolio. 75% of their consolidated sales, as well as access to adjacent technologies, such as natural savory solutions, natural colors, natural food protection and health ingredients. The combination will create a comprehensive portfolio, with a potential for integrated solutions to offer our customers one of the strongest portfolios in the industry. Together, both organizations will further penetrate key markets around the world. IFF has a leading market share in Greater Asia and Latin America, as well as strong positions in North America and Western Europe. Frutarom is a great complement, as they have very strong exposure to key emerging markets and a complementary position in developed markets. While we haven't quantified the contribution of revenue synergies yet, we look forward to driving incremental growth by capitalizing on these uniquely beneficial positions. I would like to provide an update on the antitrust approval process. We are currently on-track, as all applications have been submitted to the eight countries that we needed to file. In June, we have already received approval in the U.S. and have recently received approval in Israel. The rest, we are waiting feedback and under normal circumstances, expect to conclude the process in the fourth quarter. Rich, can you please take us through deal financing consideration. [07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]: Thank you, Andreas. Given our progress to-date and as we prepare for financing the transaction, we want to briefly give an update on the sources and uses of funds. From a source of funds perspective, we're providing approximately $2 billion of new equity to Frutarom shareholders at closing of the deal. We'll then be issuing about $2.2 billion of new equity issuance to the market. Of the $2.2 billion, approximately 67% is expected to become an equity and approximately 33% tangible equity units. From a debt standpoint, we'll be taking on approximately $3.1 billion of new debt financing. Within this debt financing, we'll be using a combination of 10 and 30-year U.S. dollar bonds, as well as Euro public bonds with maturities. The remainder will be cash on hand from the balance sheet. In terms of uses of funds, we'll be delivering approximately $2 billion of equity and $4.3 billion of cash to Frutarom shareholders. Then we will be retiring approximately $900 million of debt on both sides, on both the IFF side as well as Frutarom. All of this was done while maintaining our focus by keeping an investment grade rating. Back to you Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. Let's summarize. We're very pleased with our performance of the first half of 2018. Sales growth was robust at 6% with growth across both business units. We also have achieved strong improvement in currency neutral adjusted operating profit and currency neutral adjusted EPS. Based on our year-to-date performance our current outlook for the second half of the year, we have reconfirmed our previously stated full year currency neutral guidance. On this strong foundation, we are pleased to have made great advancements towards the Frutarom deal close, faster than our original expectations. We are very excited that together, the combination of IFF and Frutarom will have a broader customer base, more diversified product offerings, and an increased market penetration. It will create a global leader in natural taste, scent, and nutrition with a very attractive financial profile in terms of growth, profit, and cash flow which is expected to unlock significant value for our shareholders. With that, we would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Mark. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi, Mark. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey. So, wanted to ask first just on a logistic standpoint. So sales growth expectations for the back half of the year, so there's a pretty large implied range from guidance. There's obviously a much tougher comparison. So I guess any sort of broader strokes you can give on how to think about that including how much pricing should we expect given the commentary about incremental input cost pressures and the underlying volumes as well as new wins? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure, Mark. I think couple things from me as I think about it. We've been talking since the end of last year certainly in the first two quarters that a big component of the higher growth in the first half of this year was the volume on existing business, so \u2013 and we've expressed and I certainly have expressed an expectation that that will soften. I think overall on a two-year basis, the numbers are fairly consistent first half, second half. But I do think the mix is going to change where I think our win performance is pretty consistent. There are good rates. Our commercial performance are good. But I think in the second half of the year, we're expecting a decrease in the impact associated with volume and existing business, and an increase in the pricing impact. As I said in the second quarter, we're about 1.5 points of pricing impact in Q2 and I'd expect that to be higher than that in the second half of this year. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, I guess kind of putting that together then it sounds like you're expecting basically the two year to weaken somewhat, but maybe not as much as, I guess, I would have thought given incremental pricing, is that fair? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes, very fair. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just switching more to a strategic question, Andreas, I guess I want to understand a bit more what gives you conviction in commentary you had before about sustainability of Frutarom is about 6%, core sales growth in the context of what seems like some increasing competition within the natural space from competitors, not just Givaudan Naturex, but just sort of broader strokes as customers out there move towards cleaner labels and more healthful products? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think that's a very fair question and an important question for us, as well as, we are redoing now our strategy. Let me answer it in a way that, first of all, we have now probably the broadest customer base in the industry. So, a lot of business is done with the mid-sized and smaller customers, where we expect to have higher growth rates going forward than our core business. Secondly, if you look at the categories, we have now a portfolio as a combined company \u2013 or we will have, after closing \u2013 which gives us the ability to move categories which have good and high growth rates like natural colors, for example, and we mentioned then, natural color that's still a trend which where we have, let's say, the exchange from synthetic to natural colors in the U.S. just in front of us, where we will see high growth rates going forward. So, the customer base and the categories give us good confidence that the growth rate will be really, really good, despite the competition in some of these areas, but the market is so big that we believe that will not hamper our ability to have a fast growing business in front of us. And if you're combining both, I believe it \u2013 we can see a good uptick in the growth rate here. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Lauren. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First thing I would ask about was just the commentary on the incremental inflation. So, it sounded like both there's incremental inflation versus the outlook six months ago for the second half of the year and also very much heading into 2019. And so, I just wanted to be clear on expectations for the back half, is there incremental pricing going in? Do you have visibility? I mean it sounds that way from \u2013 you've said you're reiterating \u2013 but how you're going to be covering that incremental inflation that's kind of close in. And then also as you're looking into 2019, just to maybe try to help us square the kind of rate of inflation we're talking about, because if you're discussing needing to work with customers on solutions outside of pricing it suggests that it's a pretty severe rate. Thanks. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, Lauren. It's Rich. Yeah. I think \u2013 look, as I indicated in my comments, I think, we started the year, we ended last year, started this year, we expected inclusive of citral and the BASF issue to be mid-single digits. It's now above that given the other dynamics. I think what we feel good about is that the vast majority of our discussions and pricing negotiations with our customers have been completed. And so, it's a matter of phasing those in; we've talked about that in the past. These things don't happen overnight, but we're confident in our ability to recover those increases over time. As I think about next year, I \u2013 what our current view of what we're seeing today, I mean obviously we expect this \u2013 the BASF situation to normalize in the second half of this year, so that will relieve some of the pressure. I think that as we see it today, input costs next year are probably going to be in the low to mid-single-digit level. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then I'm not sure if you'll be able to comment on this yet, but the Frutarom outlook, I think sort of implies that they are baking in some incremental M&A before year-end. I mean, to what degree do you have visibility on that because that's one piece that's where the forward look that's left me a little bit less comfortable, assuming M&A for something that's about to be bought, sort of a \u2013 a bit of a funny dynamic \u2013 so, anything you can offer there would be great. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, in general, what we said when we announced the deal is that we certainly want to go ahead with a model of good acquisitions on this business and particularly on the adjacent businesses. Probably not at the same rate as Frutarom is doing it because some of them were just geographic expansions where we probably don't need it because we are, as a combined company, are very well covering the globe. We know and we have visibility of their pipeline in terms of deals. I can't give you any details, but there's certainly a good pipeline, and there are deals to be happen over time. And that's what I can say for now. Yeah, and we are planning our business model for money to be spent on M&A on this side as well. So, that's what I probably can announce today. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP Paribas. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas : Hi. Good morning. So a question on the pro forma business as well. I think in the past year, you had talked about increasing profitability through the combination. As you know, there's a debate on the market about how high margins can go. Some people are saying there's a cap. So, where \u2013 do you still see significant margin potential for yourself and more broadly in the industry, please? Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes, Heidi. And in particular, when you look at the change in product portfolio and customer portfolio going forward, what we certainly see is that in some of the adjacent businesses, you have good margins and probably better margins than in the core F&F business. And now, it's up for us actually to manage our portfolio in a way that we see a margin increase over time for the total corporation. I'd give you just one example. You might remember when we moved three years ago into the active cosmetics, that's a very high margin business, at least the piece or part where we are playing in. And we see now some of these businesses coming to us as well with Frutarom. And now, we are right now in the middle of the discussion in terms of strategy, what are the product categories we really want to push to move ahead on that time. Certainly, it's true on the core F&F business. It's not easy to push the margin up and up, but we'll see, let's say, the acceleration of the different portfolios, I think. And then don't forget that we have the cost synergies for us as well, and they will help us on the margin side, and particularly when you look at procurement and at the manufacturing footprint, because that's another driver for us for margin. So, it was probably a little bit of a long-winded answer, but I wanted to give you some details, but the answer is, yes, we can move it up. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas : Thanks. And if I could squeeze in a very quick short one. On the citral issue, is there any scope to get compensated after this disruption perhaps from the supplier? Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, Heidi, we're looking at every possibility there in terms of obviously working with our customers. Our priority, number one priority, has been to maintain surety of supply with our customers and figure out the best way to work with them. From there, we'll look at any other option out there. Heidi Vesterinen - Exane BNP Paribas : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Mike. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: When you think about the slide 20 and 21, appreciate the update on integration approach and such. And so I understand you're keeping Frutarom separate, makes a lot of sense. Can you give us a little bit of color how you plan to change the culture within Frutarom? A lot of different businesses that have been bought over the years, what's sort of the plan inside that box to integrate that and make that more efficient? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Mike, that's certainly something where we're looking to it right now to look what really makes sense to change or what makes sense to keep. We have to say that there's certainly some elements like the nimbleness and the customer focus we like a lot. We certainly will not change that. So, there are a couple of elements actually within the culture where we have to take to consideration whether we make them even bigger within the combined company. But we are in the middle of the assessment to do it. We will also, in day one, integrate some business already as I've said we lift and shift. But it has to make sense and we can't jeopardize the top line growth, because that's so important for both businesses. That's the reason, why we have also kept our business people really focused on our core business and doing the integration basically in the back office work. Okay. And we can give you certainly more details over the next couple of months, when we are coming closer to closing and after closing certainly as well. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Sure. And then in terms of revenues synergies, you have three buckets that you talked about. Is there any particular \u2013 is it going to be quicker to see the synergies in either of the three buckets, all three buckets that just sort of, want to see also where and how soon some of these little areas can come in? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, it's actually an easy answer, but maybe not always as easy done. It's basically \u2013 we give them access to our technology and what we have seen so far when we disclose some of the technology to them there's a lot of excitement around that. What they can do with it with their own customer base. Usually, they have small and mid-sized customers. So, I expect actually a pretty quick uptake of this kind of business or top line synergy on this side. On the other hand, they have all the adjacent businesses which we can sell into our bigger customers as well. And there's actually a lot of excitement on our bigger customers side as well, what they can do there. For example, an interesting company, it's called Taura. They have a technology, which is very complementary to our PowderPure technology, which goes into natural solutions. And we are right now talking how we can bring this together and make sure that this gives a great offering to our customers. So, there are a lot of discussions, but it means basically our technology into their customer base and it means their adjacency into our customer base. And that's what we are working on it. And we haven't put too much of these revenue synergies already into our plan, because we said we want to be really diligent to go over it and then make really good plans. How to do it in the best way and when we have our, let's say, first, let's say, investor conference after the closure, we certainly will disclose some of it. Okay? Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. When you calculate currency neutral operating profit growth, is the base what you actually reported last year or is it a different base that's currency neutral that's not immediately visible? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, Mike, what we do is \u2013 no, Jeff. Sorry. Sorry. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It's all right. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You see Rich still has a little bit of the summer cold, which I \u2013 but he will give the answer. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Perfect \u2013 perfect timing for this. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. We take the prior year and then we're adjusting prior year results to current year exchange rates. Keep in mind, though, keep in mind that when you're looking at last year's reported numbers, the pension accounting change which may \u2013 which is a pretty significant number where the pension income is no longer reflected in operating profits now and other income and expense. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I just say that since your analysis of your own results rely so much on currency neutral values, you might simply supply those values so that your financial statements are somewhat more transparent. And since it's simply a translation or currency neutral, I don't think it would give away anything competitive. And just secondly, can you describe what the tangible common equity units are in a little bit more detail and what's the timing of your equity financing? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. In terms of the \u2013 in terms of the financing, we expect to go \u2013 to do the debt and equity raise \u2013 equity first, debt second in the middle of September. The exact dates, we're still working through that. In terms of the tangible equity units, they're issued at a premium and they have both a debt \u2013 they both have a \u2013 they convert from a tangible equity unit into common shares. At the future, they have an interest component to that. And the premium allows the company to benefit up to a cap on growth in our share price over the three-year period that gets the upside in terms of as our \u2013 as we deliver upon the plan, the shares reflects that we'll have a lower dilution effect. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Good. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. From what you said about pricing versus raw material costs, I found that very interesting. Do you expect higher gross margins in the second half this year compared to last? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Compared to last year? Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Second half last year. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. No. I mean, I think what we expect to see is that if you look at the pressure \u2013 year-over-year pressure that we saw in the second quarter, I would expect the second half of the year be better than that or less year-over-year pressure. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Pressure from raw materials, but also \u2013 less pressure, but also better pricing from what you said, so higher... Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. So... Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: ...gross margins in the second half 2018 versus 2017? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean, if you look at the second quarter numbers, we were down about 200 basis points year-over-year in Q2. As we get the pricing in the second half of this year, I would expect that decline to decrease in the second half of the year. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Okay. That's very clear. Thanks. And then just on the second quarter itself, on the gross margin. Can you help me split out what \u2013 how big the effects were between the ongoing raw material cost inflation and the citral impacts? And I think, you already mentioned the 1.5% price in Q2, if I have that right? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes, so pricing was about 1.5%. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Because you don't provide that bridge anymore that you used to. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. So, let me give you the background. So, yeah, as I said, 1.5% of price increases. When you \u2013 as I just mentioned, we were down about 200 basis points year-over-year on gross margins. All of that can be attributed actually slightly more than that. But all of that can be attributed to net price to input cost, the dynamic. And as best as I can \u2013 we can estimate it, it's split roughly 50/50 between the citral issue and the other price increases. And as I said, it's a timing issue that we expected to normalize over the balance of the year and into early next year. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: That's great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Your mysterious largest shareholder, Winder, increased their position in your stock again recently. That surprised me a little bit given they'll be able to buy all they want on the secondary offering in a month or so. Have you talked to them about participating in the secondary? Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey, John. It's Mike. From a largest shareholder perspective, look, we've had pretty lengthy conversation with them with respect to every ongoing institutional investor we have. They remain passive evident with their filing of their 13-G, so there's no change there. With respect to secondary offering, unfortunately, we don't disclose the process. But what I can say is that there's technical rules that they have to abide by given their size. So, it's ongoing conversations as we move forward, more to come. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, secondly, are you concerned at all about the persistent low growth in the Greater Asian flavors business? You had an easy comp this quarter as against minus 2% a year ago, and you haven't had a comp above 2% in over a year. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, actually not because we are happy that finally we were turning or we are turning around the situation in China. We have good growth in China in the Flavors business. What is in, let's say, an issue for us was Indonesia because we have a big business in Indonesia and the market is pretty soft that what's taking the growth rate down. But eventually that will come back. The rest of the Asian business is performing very well, and as I said, in particular, John, China, we are happy to be back. Interesting enough, as you might recall, the whole thing goes back to our factory issue we had in 2015. So, it took us longer to recover. We have now a second manufacturing plant actually in place and we will open it in the fourth quarter of this year. So, we have a backup plan and we believe that China will be for us a good growth country going forward. And now even, we see the consolidation of Frutarom even better because we will get some of their volume basically into our factories as well. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a clarification on the guidance, a lot of ground covered today. There is a pretty sharp deceleration implied in second half currency neutral sales growth and understanding the comps get considerably tougher, especially in Fragrance, but you've got better pricing expected to flow through. Is it such that you think volumes are actually down year-on-year in the back half either company-wide or at least in the Fragrance? And if so, is it just \u2013 is it just comp or is there anything on win rates or customer order patterns that would make you think that? I just want to make sure I understand some of the moving pieces in there. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. Again, I think as I said, as I mentioned earlier, overall, when we look at on a two-year basis, it's \u2013 there's not any significant change. What I do believe \u2013 what we do see happening is that the first half of this year, lower comps but a big bigger chunk of the improvement was volume on existing business. The growth \u2013 the volume on existing business were above, let's call it, five-year norms. Our win rates and impact of new wins was consistent with the five long-term trends. So, we were not seeing anything slowing or increasing there. And so, we expect to see a slowdown in the volume on existing business that'll be offset by pricing. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just below the line, tax rate has come in, I think, below kind of the expectations at the beginning of the year. Is there an expectation that you see a notable pickup in tax in the back half or what's the full-year expected rate? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, for the first half of the year, we're \u2013 between 2018 and 2019, I would expect we're going to end the year between 19% and 20%. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then there's no \u2013 the financing for Frutarom is not embedded in the EPS outlook for the year, is that correct? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, no. Everything related to that is excluded at this point. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Fintan Ryan with Berenberg. Fintan Ryan - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions from me, please. Firstly, in terms of the integration with the Frutarom deal on the Frutarom side, given that we are a few months further down the line, have you thought about or have you seen any impact so far in terms of some Frutarom employee turnover? And would you be confident that most of the core management team there will remain with IFF and help that integration process post-acquisition, particularly given that I felt that the Frutarom shareholders rejected the bonus, the $20 million bonus proposed for the CEO of Frutarom. How does IFF intend to keep him compensated or interested in the business? And then in terms of the regulatory approvals, would you anticipate any issues in terms of some of the larger markets where Frutarom operates like Russia and Europe and the European Union? Is there a potential for any divestments that you can see at this stage or do you think it's just merely marketing exercise to get the regulatory approvals? Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Well, thank you, Fintan. Let me start with the last one first. On the regulatory side, we don't see any issues and we don't expect to have to divest any business before we get the regulatory approval which is positive. And that made us actually believe that the fourth quarter is good for closing, which is ahead of the initial timeline we have given to ourselves. We are very happy about that. On the talent side for the integration, we haven't seen any significant departures, and we believe that many of the senior leaders will have a good position within IFF and will stay. And we are very happy with many of the talented people who will join the new IFF in the new makeup of the company and help us driving growth. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: From my standpoint, Fin, I mean, I think, we're also \u2013 obviously, we have a completely separate work stream around talent management and the people. As Andreas' previous comments in his prepared remarks, very strong talent base. Part of that work stream is identifying who those key people are and reaching out to them and having discussions before closing in terms of what the vision is for the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Faiza. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. I just wanted to go back first to pricing in the quarter. If you could just update us on \u2013 or give us more color around where the pricing is coming from? Like is it more \u2013 my sense is that it's coming maybe more from the smaller customers \u2013 and then you expect in the back half to get more pricing from your more global customers? And then maybe if you could disaggregate sort of how much of it is coming from Fragrances versus Flavors? And within Fragrances, how much is Fragrance Ingredients versus the other components? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure, Faiza. I mean, in general, I would say that the pricing is skewed towards Fragrances versus Flavors. And then within that, it's a balance between Compounds and the Ingredients business was, you know, we've talked in the past, Fragrance Ingredients business generally works off a six-month contract. So, they generally \u2013 the impact is seen sooner on the Ingredients side. On the Fragrance Compounds side, the timing is often driven by one, the process to identify where and when the choices are made about the adjustments. And in some cases, can be driven by the indices or the contract on when the windows open up. The details on global versus local and regional, it's hard to say. So, I think it's more around those three businesses. More Fragrances than Flavors and more of what we see today is on Ingredients versus Compounds. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And then, unless I missed it, I don't think you reiterated your previous outlook around double-digit EPS cash accretion in year two post the deal. So, I was just wondering if that still stands, and if it does, maybe you could walk through some of the components of that? We understand the synergy phasing, but maybe if you could just update us on what type of underlying growth you're expecting? And maybe if you've baked in anything for incremental acquisitions there? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Mike, I'm sorry, I can't control this. So it still stands. Let's put that clear, and Rich can explain. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we haven't \u2013 we reiterated the guidance today around our core business. We were not talking about the Frutarom deal that we will cover, as Mike said earlier and Andreas talked about, we'll cover that after the deal closes. But, overall, the big part of the year-over-year on a cash basis accretion is driven by the synergies. When we go from 25% to 70%, the cash flow generation of the business is quite significant. We expected to pay down the debt quite significantly, very quickly. So we get both the operating profit gain as well as the interest expense reductions that are driving it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking a few questions. A brief one, just going back on citral, I mean, every company has a different timing of impact apparently. And do you think that actually for you guys, the bulk of the impact \u2013 I think it was last year about $45 million for the year \u2013 total without any mitigation. Is it more in Q2 versus the rest of the year or there's still more to come just for citral impact? That's question number one. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. I think for that first part, I mean as we talked about on the last call, I mean, the impact was small in Q1. As I talked about at the time, most of the higher costs were sitting in inventory. So I think when you think about the overall impact, Q2, Q3 are the pressure points. And then on the input cost side, we expect the purchasing cost to come down as the citral line stabilizes. And then on the other side, we start to fully recover the \u2013 we get the pricing takes hold and that will further mitigate the impacts. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: And you still believe you can \u2013 out of the 7%, recover about 5% of impact \u2013 the percentage points of your bridge? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. We still believe that currently the impact in the year this year will be about a 2% headwind, so somewhere between $10 million and $15 million on operating profit. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to \u2013 when you think about your sales forecast, maybe this is a question more for Rich or maybe Andreas. Do you have implicit in that an assumption about acceleration or deceleration in your end customer markets? How much visibility do you have into that? And finally, could you characterize the growth in your portfolio, in your customers right now between small or local \u2013 either small, local, or both kinds of customers versus global customers? And I asked because it seems like, persistently your growth rate is so much better than if I put together just a \u2013 sloppily put an index together of what appear to be all your major CPG customers, you've been growing a lot faster for a long time on an organic basis. So, just trying to get my hands around that and how you think about that as your forecast? Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure, Jon. So, first of all, what we see certainly is that the smaller and mid-sized customers are providing us with better growth than the big ones. And now, with some of the moves we have done in our own core business like Tastepoint, for example, we are covering better these smaller and mid-sized customers which give us some good growth here. So, that's good. And actually, this is one of the reasons for the Frutarom deal because it will give us even more exposure towards these customers. And we feel very excited about this. In general, if you look at the volume trends, they are pretty robust, I would say also with our end customers since, I would say, probably third quarter last year, and we see still pretty robust volume trends. We saw it in our first quarter, for example, where we were circling through our inventory much faster than we saw and particularly on the Fragrance side. We don't see a deceleration of these trends, but you never know. So, that's certainly for something we have to see, and we are in constant dialogue with our customers all the time to figure out where they stand and how much growth they see going forward. But so far, the volume trend is intact for our customers which is actually good news for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hundley with Vertical Group. Brett Hundley - The Vertical Trading Group LLC : Hey. Thanks for fitting me in, guys. I just have one question. I'm trying to think more about your \u2013 the ability of your Fragrance segment margins to rebound in 2019. And, Rich, I thought you had an interesting comment on pricing when you talked about raw material inflation continuing into fiscal 2019. And, I don't know, I'm just reading your comment as a very public and signaling and talking about how it's imperative that you get pricing through or look at other actions. If I'm not reading too much into that comment, as you guys have pricing discussions, ongoing pricing discussions with customers, do you feel like you're getting to any type of price ceiling on the synthetic side or do you feel like you're running into any challenges on taking pricing higher? And maybe related to that, if it's not pricing, do you guys believe that you can deliver another round of cost savings following what you've done over 2017 and 2018. Are you feeling better about maybe walking your synergy number from Frutarom higher or maybe walking it faster? Can you just talk about the other ways, that if you don't go out and get pricing that you might be able to offset further oncoming inflation? Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Thanks. Look, I'm never going to sit here in my role and tell you that getting the price increase is easy. It's not. It's a long process. I think we have better tools available to us today to help our teams have fact-based conversations with our customers at a very detailed level that we hadn't had six or seven years ago. And that's imperative to our ability to get those price increases. Would I like them to come sooner? Absolutely, but we have to manage our business and these are long-term relationships with our customers and we have to work together and some cases we can come quicker, in other cases we have to make a choice and work with them around formula optimization or opening up the formulas and reformulating. Sometimes we have to look at options around phasing in the price increases. But I think both businesses have shown the ability to recover the price increases. Again, sometimes the timing it was probably not what Andreas and I would like. But I think we're able to do that. Now, from a margin standpoint, obviously it's dilutive. Because what we don't do is try to mark up the cost increases. So, I think those will continue, we'll continue to work that next year. I think what's important to me, I think, when I look at the trajectory on the input cost increases, again, we're not sitting here saying, we're expecting it to be double-digit increases across 80% of the portfolio, which is what we faced back in 2010, 2011 and 2012 and that took us two or three years to recover that. So, I think we will continue to do that. In terms of your question around cost savings and what we do as a business, I mean, that's part of what we're constantly doing, is managing productivity programs. I mean, the productivity programs that Francisco has led over the last 11 years that I've been with the company, have been dramatic in terms of what they've delivered to the bottom line and help give us flexibility. I'm not going to sit here and tell you we have the same ability to achieve those that we've had in the last 10 years, over the next 10 years because we've done all the easy stuff. But it's a constant part of our agenda. And then obviously \u2013 we will, obviously, look to accelerate the synergies and turn over every possible stone to have as much flexibility in our operating model. And I think we will then look at how much do we reinvest in the business. That becomes, to me, the variable of terms of, okay, if we're ahead of schedule, we can potentially reinvest quicker. If we're behind, we'll be more restrictive in terms of where we make incremental investments. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Actually, on the cost side and particularly on manufacturing, as Rich said, the easy stuff is done. But now in front of these, before the industrial revolution, we see much more of a drive into artificial intelligence and robotics, which will help us actually significantly to decrease some of the costs we were having in that area. And that's actually very, very helpful. So our profitability and potential savings agenda is still on for the core business, and then on top of it, certainly the savings we get to the Frutarom deal. Well, that's where we are and we feel actually very, very good about it. Operator : And we have reached the allotted time for Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for all the great questions. It was a good session. I hope you got the answers you needed. And as usually, we follow-up with one-on-one calls for more detailed information. Thank you very much guys. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd. Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances third quarter 2018 earnings conference all. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2018 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 27, 2018 and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release and is on our website. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We will start with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. On the call today, we will review our financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months for 2018, give a quick update on Frutarom since the transaction has closed, and provide an update to all financial expectations for the full year, inclusive of Frutarom. Then we will be happy to take any questions that you may have. Starting with a recap of our first nine months performance, growth was strong across our key financial metrics. Currency neutral sales increase 6% year-to-date, with Flavors growing 6% and Fragrances growing 5%. New win performance and price increases to mitigate rising material cost, both contributed to consolidated growth. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit grew 4%, supported by volume leverage and our focus to drive greater efficiency throughout our business via cost and productivity initiatives. Currency neutral adjusted EPS improved 11%, driven by adjusted operating profit growth as well as a more favorable effective tax rate. Our strategic priorities continue to drive overall performance over the first nine months of 2018. Sales of our Re-Imagine Modulation portfolio grew strong double-digit and PowderPure grew an impressive triple-digits, both indicative of our position as a leader in innovation. Performance with local and regional customers remained strong, growing double that of our global customers, which on a consolidated basis is about 50% of our customer base. In Flavor specifically, our mid-size go-to-market platform, Tastepoint, continued to deliver strong results, improving strong double-digits in the first nine months of 2018. In terms of maximizing our portfolio towards our most margin accretive categories, cosmetic active ingredients continued its robust growth trend by improving double-digits. Also on the Fragrance side, hair care grew double-digits and home care and toiletries improved high-single digits. In Flavors, growth was strong in dairy and beverage, improving double-digits and high-single digits respectively. We also continue to focus on driving greater efficiencies throughout our business via cost and productivity initiatives, which allows us to reallocate resources to efforts that drive the greatest returns and maintain strong profitability. This yielded strong results in the first nine months of 2018. And so our cost and productivity initiatives, including zero-based budgeting added approximately 5 percentage points of gross to currency neutral adjusted operating profit and EPS growth. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with how well our refreshed priorities are performing and believe better positions us to drive long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich. [07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]: Thanks, Andreas, and good morning, good afternoon, good evening to everyone. Moving on to our Q3 performance, currency neutral sales in the second quarter grew 4%. Growth was led by new wins and price increases to mitigate the impact of raw material cost inflation. From a profitability perspective, currency neutral adjusted operating profit increased 3% in the third quarter, as top line growth and the benefits associated with cost and productivity initiatives was offset by unfavorable price to input costs, inclusive of the BASF citral issue and weaker sales mix. Pricing was up more than 2 percentage points in the quarter on a consolidated basis. Despite the sequential acceleration in the third quarter, as expected, it did not offset raw material pressure, as we continue to see a timing lag in the Fragrance business unit. Currency neutral adjusted EPS increased 12%, as a more favorable year-over-year effective tax rate offset higher shares outstanding and interest expense associated with the equity and debt raise during the quarter. It should be noted that excluding the items that impact comparability, the adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 14% compared to 22.7% in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decrease was largely due to a more favorable mix of earnings, lower cost of repatriation, and the re-measurement of loss provisions, partially offset by adjustments to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the impact of current year transaction costs, including certain non-taxable gains on foreign currency in the prior year. Looking at the business unit performance for the third quarter, Flavors currency neutral sales increased 7% even against a strong year-ago comparison of 12%, with growth coming in all categories and all regions. On a two-year average basis, growth remained very strong at approximately 9.5%. North American Flavors improved 10% in the third quarter, led by double-digit growth at Tastepoint and strong performances in dairy and sweet. EAME increased 6% on a currency neutral basis, led by high-single digit growth in Europe as well as Africa and Middle East. Greater Asia grew 4% in the third quarter on a currency neutral basis, as it was led by double-digit growth in India and low-single digit increases in Indonesia, China, and ASEAN. Latin America increased 12% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina as well as mid-single digit growth in Mexico. Flavors currency neutral segment profit grew approximately 7%, led primarily by volume growth and the benefits from ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margin, our profile remains strong at 22.1%. Fragrances currency neutral sales improved 2% on a strong year-ago double-digit comparison, with growth in nearly all regions. From a category perspective, Consumer Fragrances grew 2% on a currency neutral basis, as performance was driven by continued growth in hair, home, and fabric care. Fine Fragrances declined 2% on a currency neutral basis, against a very strong 18% comparison from the prior year. From a regional perspective, Greater Asia increased strong double-digits and EAME increased low-single digits. Fragrance Ingredients sales were up 5% on a currency neutral basis, led by strong double-digit growth in the cosmetic active ingredients business. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth in Fragrance Ingredients. As we continue to successfully execute our refresh strategy and we achieve strong realization of price increases. From a profit perspective, Fragrances currency neutral segment profit decreased 5% on a currency neutral basis, as the benefits from productivity initiatives and cost management were more than offset by an unfavorable price to input costs, including the previously announced citral issue. In terms of currency neutral segment profit margins, our margins remains solid, yet were under pressure year-over-year. Before moving on, I'd like to provide some more commentary on the raw material environment, like I did in Q2. As you remember, coming into the year we expected mid-single-digit raw material inflation in 2018, inclusive of the impact of the citral situation, heavier in the business units versus Flavors. Since that time, cost inflation has picked up following a series of disruptions in the supply chain. Additional market disruptions continue to impact the Fragrance business unit, driven both by environmental considerations and new non-flavor and fragrance market demands for core raw materials. Unfortunately, we see further input cost and pressures in 2019, particularly in Fragrances. Our strategic priority is to protect our customers' business. However, this comes at a significant incremental cost and will require additional price increases as we move into 2019 to ensure we cover our raw material cost exposure. Operating cash flow was $202 million in first nine months of 2018 compared to $199 million in the prior-year period. This was primarily driven by litigation in the prior-year period. Core working capital was impacted by higher inventory to ensure continuity of supply during unprecedented supply chain challenges as well as higher raw material prices. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $102 million in capital expenditures, or about 3.7% of sales, driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia. Some of these investments include a Flavors manufacturing facility in the Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone, which opened on October 9, and a Natural Products Research lab located in the Nanjing Life Science Park, which opened on October 15. The Flavors plant is our second in China and is designed to supplement our existing flavors and manufacturing operations in Guangzhou. The Natural lab is our first outside of the U.S. China is a critical component of our long-term strategy. The opening of these new sites will support our efforts to be a partner of choice and to grow in this exciting region. We continue to believe that we will spend approximately 4% to 5% of sales for the full year 2018 on CapEx. Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the first nine months, we spent approximately $163 million on dividends and $15 million on share repurchases. As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom combination, we paused our share repurchase program, as we will prioritize debt repayment going forward. We will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we accelerate growth through organic investments and strategic acquisitions while returning significant capital to shareholders. Before turning it back to Andreas, I'd like to provide some commentary on Frutarom's estimated results for Q3 2018. Please note that this information is for informational purposes only, and they reflect Frutarom's results when it was under the previous ownership and prior to the completion of the acquisition on October 4. For the third quarter, net sales are expected to be between $360 million and $365 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 21%. Performance from a top line perspective is expected to be up low single digits versus prior year, driven by the contribution of acquisitions and offset by foreign exchange headwinds. It should be noted that sales growth, while up year over year, was negatively impacted by customer order patterns, specifically in more commodity-oriented businesses such as trade and marketing and Frutarom's citrus processing business, which were both down double digits. Excluding these businesses, growth would have increased mid-single digits on a reported basis, and high single digits if we excluded foreign exchange impacts. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin continued to be solid, improving approximately 40 basis points year over year, led by gross margin improvements as well as expense control. On a year-to-date basis, sales are expected to be approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of about 15%. In terms of profitability, we expected adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 21.5%, which is a strong year-over-year improvement of approximately 175 basis points. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. I would like now to give you a quick update on our Frutarom combination. I'm very happy to say that on October 4, we completed the combination with Frutarom. This is ahead of our original expectations of six to nine months from May 7 announcement. The coming together of IFF and Frutarom is a momentous achievement, and we're excited to be moving forward as one company while pursuing new opportunities that benefit all our stakeholders around the globe. I applaud the integration teams around the world that over the past several months have been working to ensure that we capture the best of both companies and create a seamless and efficient transition to achieve both our operational and financial targets for this combination. Together, we create a global leader in natural taste, scent, and nutrition. IFF has now a stronger product offering, broader access in attractive adjacencies, and stronger exposure to fast-growing customers. We expect to generate cost synergies of $145 million through raw material harmonization, footprint optimization, and streamlining overhead expenses by the third full year after the completion of the merger. Additionally, cross-selling opportunities and integrated solutions are expected to provide revenue synergies to our shareholders progressively over time. Through this combination, we are confident in the opportunities that lie ahead and the ability of the combination to accelerate financial performance and targeting sales growth an average of 5% to 7% and 10%-plus adjusted EPS growth, excluding total company amortization between 2019 and 2021, all on a currency neutral and pro forma basis. Let's take a look how the new IFF is positioned now that the transaction has been completed. As you can see from the slide, we instantly have the number two global market position in the industry, with approximately 33,000 customers globally, selling about 150,000 unique product solutions annually. Our organization is fueled by 13,000 hardworking employees in more than 110 manufacturing sites and approximately 100 R&D centers and labs around the world. This historic combination sets us up to service our customers like we never have done before, being able to offer them a stronger product offering to help them create differentiation in the marketplace. With the addition of Frutarom's offerings, we instantly become a leader and natural capabilities extending across our entire platform. Our combination creates a highly diversified portfolio, with exposure to fast-growing categories and customers. Being that our product offering is now extending beyond our traditional industry, we have renamed our business segments from Flavors and Fragrances to Taste and Scent respectively. To ensure we deliver a seamless experience to our newest customers, we intend to preserve Frutarom's best-in-class customer-facing capabilities, which will enable us to maintain the strong relationships Frutarom has built, while capturing this significant cross-selling opportunities we will have as a combined company. As a result, our intention is to report Frutarom as a standalone business unit. Based on projected pro forma 2018 sales, we expect Scent to be approximately 35%, Taste to be about 33% and Frutarom about 32% of our entire business. And now, looking at our Executive Leadership team, Matthias Haeni and Nicolas Mirzayantz will continue to lead our Taste and Scent division respectively. Leading the Frutarom division, I'm pleased to welcome Amos Anatot, who spent eight years at Frutarom in leadership positions, with his most recent role as Executive Vice President of Global Supply Chain and Operations. He has a great perspective of the taste, savory solutions, flavors and fragrance ingredients, Taura and trade & marketing businesses and that's been actively involved in integration as a leader from Frutarom. Within Frutarom, I would like also to welcome Yoni Glickman, who will run Natural Product Solutions, which includes health, colors and food protection. He most recently held the position of present Natural Solutions at Frutarom, where he led the company's natural food colors, antioxidants, cosmetics and health ingredients business. This leadership structure is in place since the 4th of October to run these businesses in a manner that leverage our strengths and supports our customers. Aligned with this approach, we are already capitalizing on a few quick wins. For example, leveraging our Tastepoint go-to-market strategy for small- and mid-size customers in North America, we are integrating Frutarom's North America taste business into our own. As a reminder, Tastepoint is designed to serve the dynamic and faster-growing middle-market customers in North America, a key driver of growth. By combining the Frutarom North America taste business with R&D, technology and consumer insight of IFF, we are strengthening the innovative go-to-market approach that targets unique needs and expectations of this subset of customers. As you have seen since inception, Tastepoint has been a success, evident by our strong growth with small- and mid-sized customers in North America. This transition should be seamless, as the go-to-market model used by Frutarom's North America flavors business is perfectly in line with what we have at Tastepoint. Another example is in cosmetic actives. While we are shifting Frutarom's cosmetic active ingredients business into our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics business. Established in 1995, Israeli Biotechnology Research or IBR researches, develops, manufactures, and markets innovative and proprietary natural active ingredients for the cosmetics and dietary supplement industries, mainly for cellular and skin anti-aging, skin protection from UV rays and air pollution, skin whitening, and pigmentation prevention. By combining these two businesses, we have strengthened our cosmetic active ingredients portfolio sold to some of the world's leading cosmetic companies. We believe this will support continued growth in this highly profitable category. And all of these measures we have started already since the closing of the deal, which is ahead of time. With that, I would like to ask Rich to provide some perspective for the full-year 2018 financials. [07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]: Thank you, Andreas. Before providing full-year expectations, I wanted to clarify a few go-forward model assumptions. First, following the successful debt raise, our total debt outstanding is approximately $4.4 billion. The annual interest expense associated with this debt is expected to be between $150 million and $155 million per year. Currently, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 19%, more or less the average of the two standalone companies. For purposes of calculating adjusted diluted EPS on a go-forward basis, we estimate that there will be approximately 113 million diluted shares outstanding, including 6.3 million shares related to the tangible equity units. Annually amortization is expected to be approximately $220 million and subject to change based on the finalization of the purchase price accounting. In terms of our go-forward reporting, please note that we have modified the way we will disclose adjusted EPS. Previously, adjusted EPS was reported EPS excluding items that affect comparability. In addition to these exclusions, going forward, we will also exclude full amortization for the total company. We believe that this metric provides useful period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operational performance and cash generation capacity. Looking at the full year 2018, inclusive of Frutarom's fourth quarter estimated results, we are targeting year-over-year advancement in both top- and bottom-line results. We expect our sales to be between $3.95 billion and $4.05 billion for the full year, with similar contributions to Q3 in our legacy IFF business as well as sequential improvements in Frutarom sales performance versus the growth they achieved in Q3. We also expect our adjusted EPS to be between $6.25 and $6.45 excluding one-time items that may affect comparability and total company amortization for the full year. For reference purposes, we expect 2018 amortization for the full year to be approximately $83 million, made up of $37 million of legacy IFF amortization, $9 million from legacy Frutarom amortization, and an estimated $37 million from the purchase price accounting related to the (00:25:02) transaction. With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas for his final remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. In summary, we are pleased with a strong financial performance in the third quarter, as we achieved growth in all of our key financial metrics. Our strong performance in the first nine-months was driven by our refreshed priorities, as we continue to focus on the execution of our long-term strategy, accelerating growth, increasing differentiation and driving cost efficiencies to drive sustainable, profitable growth in the future and maximize value creation for our shareholders. As we look towards the remainder of the year, inclusive of Frutarom results for the fourth quarter, we expect strong advancements in top- and bottom-line results as noted by Rich. Looking forward, comes a bittersweet realization that the third quarter 2018 was our final as legacy IFF. We are now embarking on the next major chapter of IFF history. We believe that our combination with Frutarom, the largest transaction of its kind in our industry, is fundamentally going to expand our customer and employee base and product offerings. We will have greater exposure to fast-growing customers, broader access to attractive adjacencies and a very differentiated portfolio, with an increased focus on naturals and health and wellness, as well as more comprehensive solutions. We believe this will translate into accelerated financial performance as a combined company, with robust top- and bottom-line growth, leading to strong returns for our shareholders. With that, we would now like to open up the call to questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning, everybody. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Mark. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi, Mark. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I have heard worse by the way on the last news if that's what you're talking about. So, on the business, though it's helpful commentary on Frutarom for 3Q, I guess, related to that, so what gives you confidence that it can improve in 4Q? And if I'm doing the math correctly, why give such a large implied range of sales for the business? And kind of related to that, if I remember also from Frutarom's results earlier this year, there was some volatility in their trade and marketing business in those results. So thoughts on maybe how that business fits with the new company going forward? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Let me start the first part of the question, and then I hand it over to Rich. So, first of all, we had a solid start and an acceleration in growth with the Frutarom business for the fourth quarter, so that's a good part. And we are actually ahead of the integration. What is the big benefit for us is that we have closed the deal earlier than we sought. The teams were well-prepared. The leadership structure is in place. And most of the insecurity is gone, which we usually have when you embark in such kind of a deal. And that, let's say, fills the optimism for the fourth quarter and the year going forward. So good start, as I said, financially. Secondly, we have the organization in place to perform and we see that people are very motivated, leadership structure is there. They're going after it. We are talking already about cross-selling opportunities, which I always said is probably mid- and long-term, the biggest value creation opportunity we have here. We have the first small signs of cross-selling successes, which is fantastic, and that, I would say, fuels the optimism of the organization that the fourth quarter will go in the right direction. But in terms of the guidance... Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, Mark, in terms of the guidance range, I wouldn't read too much into that. It's probably the simplest answer is I didn't want to have to go out to three digits in terms of the range, and so we picked basically a $50 million range around that. There's nothing more than that. As Andreas had said, I think that the first \u2013 the fourth quarter, the start to the first quarter is in line with what we expected. We've seen the improvement in Frutarom's performance into the start to Q4. I mean, I think we do believe that a big piece of the Q3 performance was driven by specific incident-related items, whether it's the trade and marketing or whether it's customer order patterns in a couple of businesses. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on the trade and marketing, any thoughts on how that fits with the business going forward? And on the implied EBITDA, from a run rate standpoint, first half of the year I think was maybe a little bit stronger than kind of 21-ish. Is there anything within those numbers that perhaps makes them less sustainable going forward or were there \u2013 how much was contribution from acquisitions, for example, and is 21% kind of a good run rate to use going forward? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. I'll take the first part. For the trade and marketing, it's probably too early to tell, and it's part of a service we are providing with this business unit to some of our customers. It's certainly not a focus area where we want to invest, but we will evaluate it what we want to do with the business. But so far, it looks like a smart solution to have it in place, but not put too many resources behind it. Rich? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Mark, from an EBITDA margin standpoint, I think it's \u2013 within the Flavors business, probably there's some mix impact, probably there is a little bit of mix impact within Natural Product Solutions. I think there are a couple of projects in terms of productivity things that are about three or six months behind schedule, that were already underway within the Frutarom business. So that's probably a little bit of what we're seeing in the second half. So I think overall, we don't see that there's any fundamental changes. Obviously, with the strong growth rates we saw particularly in Q1, the leverage component is much more advantageous in the first half than what we've seen in the third quarter. Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. Thanks, guys. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. My first question was just around the go-to-market approach that you talked about in terms of leaving Frutarom to report independently. That was definitely different from what I had anticipated or expected to be the case. So I guess first, could you talk about, one, will you be giving us pro forma historicals that could just help us in terms of forecasting? And the second thing is, it was just interesting to me that it looks like in terms of you're going to be rolling in the Frutarom North America flavors business into Tastepoint straight away. Is the approach going to be that piece by piece, Frutarom will be integrated into Taste and Scent? And this is just to create almost a bridge platform to go slowly, such that the Frutarom piece of this is independently reported will just be going down over time? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Rich, you get started. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: In terms of pro forma information, Lauren, we will on the year-end call, once all the numbers have been finalized, we'll provide a full-blown full-year pro forma for both the combined companies, so that represents the reference point going forward to the three-year guidance that we've talked about earlier. So we will provide that on the next call. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And on the organizational setup, let's talk about the Natural Product Solutions, which is probably the most, let's say, adjacent businesses we have here at hand. That certainly is important to leave this as it is for now to make sure that we really capitalize on the growth opportunities because many of these businesses have higher growth in our core business and good profitability as well. So that's number one. Number two, on the Frutarom business unit, we said we won't organize it like that to make sure that we don't lose speed and we don't lose our customer focus to these high-growth smaller and mid-sized customers. And over time, we will decide what part of the organization we are moving to the Taste solution on our side. And it's right that the North America Taste business from Frutarom is mainly with smaller and mid-sized customers, so that creates for us a great opportunity to bring it together with our Tastepoint platform because it basically has the same business mechanics. And we believe that we can grow it significantly over the next couple of years when we house it in that area because, as I said, the mechanics are the same. And because we have already an approved model how to be successful in the North American market, we said this is probably the best thing we can do. And we are very happy that with the early close, the integration is already underway, which is way ahead of the time we sought, because we \u2013 actually I was thinking that we might close at the end of the year, and then you have Christmas and it takes a while. Now we are already in full swing integrating this business. Okay? Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. And then my second question was just around the pricing and raw material environment commentary that Rich offered. So just where do you stand in terms of your sense of the incremental pricing you're going to want to be taking? Where do you stand in terms of those customer conversations? Do you have visibility for how that starts to flow through, or should we be thinking about it more as it will be gradual throughout 2019, so that you'll probably still see some gross margin pressure as you play catch-up throughout the year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Lauren, a couple things. I think there is \u2013 unfortunately there's always a time lag as we go through this process. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think we've talked about that in the past about certain contracts and arrangements have windows for that. But we are already having conversations, the businesses certainly are starting to have the conversations around what is going to be necessary. We're going to expect to see \u2013 on an overall basis, I would expect to see mid-single-digit increases next year, again, skewed heavily towards the Fragrance business, given the continued supply chain interruptions that we're dealing with there. The teams are already having those conversations with and teeing those things up with the customers, but I would expect to see some continued pressure during the course, but I also fully expect to see progress quarter by quarter going forward also. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, that's great. Thank you so much. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi, good morning. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Faiza. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So two questions for me too. One is just to follow up on the raw material and pricing commentary. Could you give us more color in terms of where you're seeing the most raw material inflation? I know you said Fragrances. But just more specifically, is it the naturals? Is that synthetics, petrochemicals? Where are you seeing more of that? And then do you think that you're going to be able to recover the entire raw material inflation, because it looks like you talked about two points of pricing this quarter, but you said that you still haven't offset the entire inflation. So do you anticipate being able to offset that as you go through 2019? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, Faiza, remember, a portion of that is related to the BASF, so that's something that still is being worked through. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the effects of the citral stuff. Some of it doesn't show up in pricing because we'll go through and work with customers on reformulations to adapt the cost base, so not everything is going to show up exactly. But I do expect over time that we will be able to recover this. We've got to protect our customers' business, but we also have to protect our bottom line. It's not easy. I'm never going to say it's easy. So I do expect, as I said to Lauren's question, I do expect us to see further pressure and continued focus on price realization in 2019. In terms of where is it coming from, it's very much in the core feedstock type of ingredients for the Fragrance business. Again, in my comments, I mentioned that we've had supply chain interruptions. We started the year and we were at mid-single digits including citral. We've had issues in suppliers in India. We've had fires in India. We've had shutdowns in China on some of the core ingredient suppliers \u2013 chemical ingredient suppliers. More recently, more environmental-related supply chain restrictions, and we're also starting to see situations where demand is coming from non-F&F markets for the same raw materials, which is creating a supply and demand pressure point, and we don't expect new capacity come on in the short term. So I think we're going to have to deal with it. Our customers understand what's driving it. We spend a lot of time walking them through the details, and then working with them in terms of how do we mitigate the impacts on both sides. So, it's going to continue. Unfortunately, we're in a period where it seems every six months something else is popping up and we're having to deal with it with our customers. We're probably going to have the third round of conversation with customers in a very short period around price increases that are necessary for us to protect our bottom line in the long run. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my second question is around Frutarom again. I guess, I'm still not convinced that this is \u2013 like, I guess, I'm looking for more comfort from you in terms of how much of the Frutarom sales issue this quarter were timing related? And perhaps if you could update us on what your outlook is for like the Frutarom sales and EBITDA for fiscal 2018? So how much of a snapback are you expecting in the fourth quarter? So, were the timing issues more just the first half was better or are they going to come back in the fourth quarter? And then related to that, now that you've owned the business for maybe a month, are there any surprises outside of the revenue shortfall in the third quarter? What are some of the key \u2013 biggest integration risks that you see around Frutarom? Just more color around that would be really helpful. Thanks. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure, Faiza. Obviously, it's hard to pinpoint it exactly. What I can tell you is we've been able to, as I said in my comments, so if we look at some specific issues, the colors business has a pricing issue related to changes in the underlying raw materials. But that's had a big impact in that business. I talked about the timing of orders and order patterns, both in the citrus business as well as part of the savory business. So I think that's part of the reason why we believe it's a unique circumstance. Undoubtedly, there is \u2013 one of the biggest challenges any company that's going through this type of combination has to deal with is distraction. We always do our best to try to keep everybody focused on both sides, but I can't \u2013 it's hard for me to sit there and say specifically how much of what we saw in Q3 is that. But I can tell you, again, if you take out these three or four specific items that we know what was driving it, we were more in line with the long-term expectations of that business of mid-single digit growth on a currency neutral basis. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And then, as Andreas and I talked about in terms of the outlook and where we expect to see Q4, we are seeing and we do expect to see growth in Q4, probably not all the way back to where we would think it long-term, but certainly a marked improvement from what we saw in Q3. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And that's actually very comforting, and particularly in the start into the quarter, which is really, really good. And again, I believe this early closing of the deal gives us a great opportunity to be ahead of schedule with our integration, because we just can \u2013 we have named our leaders already, the organization is in place and we can drive the performance. So, that's good. What have we learned during the months we owned the business? Actually nothing which is a super big surprise to us. Maybe the only thing and that's more positive is when I listened to the teams which are working together on the cross-selling opportunity, and I said it in the last couple of months, but it solidified my view that the opportunity we can cross-sell their products and vice versa into different customer bases with the technology is probably a bigger opportunity than we had sought at the beginning, and that really can drive value over time. And it will take some time, but the first signs are actually very, let's say, very encouraging. We had the first win actually on a West Coast customer where we helped the Frutarom team with our vanilla technology and vanilla formulation and that has led to a $3 million order, which they probably would never had received if we would not have helped out here, just to give one example. It's small, but it started earlier than I sought it. So that's how I would describe it. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. How are you? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Very well. Thank you, Silke. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So there were a couple of acquisitions pending under Frutarom. And so I was wondering whether you can quantify what the \u2013 that maybe in like dollar terms, like, what the acquisitions of Frutarom added to Frutarom sales in the third quarter. What you expect for the fourth quarter and what you expect to \u2013 they may add in 2019? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, Silke, I think given that those \u2013 that the third quarter results are their numbers and we don't \u2013 I'm not comfortable disclosing that. I think in terms of M&A for \u2013 I mean we just continue to work together as you've heard Andreas and I talk about that we keep continue to work together on the pipeline. We've now reprioritized the comp \u2013 the two team's standalone pipelines into to a refined list based on our priorities and our needs going forward. We look to continue to execute against that pipeline. But I'm not \u2013 I really don't feel comfortable given the standalone nature of their results in Q3 coming in on the individual components of it? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: What you have seen so... Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, but... Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sorry. If I could add on this, Silke, what we have seen is that there were no acquisitions made this year during the process of the, let's say, the deal, let's say, the pre-deal months. But we have \u2013 as Rich said, actually we have a good pipeline of very value and technology-added opportunities. And I would not wonder if we could hopefully close two of these deals until the end of the year. They are smaller ones, but they would fit exactly into our wheelhouse. So, you see we're at a bit of a pause during that period. But now we are basically taking the combined pipeline with the new priorities and then going after it. And I think it will be a big success going forward. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I was just, like, interested in knowing what sort of, like, the acquisitions added that were already announced, not even like the things that may have happened between when the transaction was announced and at closing, just sort of like what was announced prior to acquiring Frutarom, of things that may have closed? I was just wondering what those acquisition benefits were for the quarter and what they may add for next year? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, again, they're going to disclose their results in the next two or three weeks. And then, we'll be in a better position to answer any questions at that point in time. I don't feel comfortable covering it right now. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. In terms of the DNA, and I apologize because I'm not as familiar with Frutarom as I could be. I thought that for the past two quarters that the D&A at Frutarom was something that was close to, like, $17 million a quarter, and what you said is you thought maybe it's something like $9 million a quarter? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Because we're just doing the amortization, not the D&A. So it's just adding back amortization. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, so amortization is $9 million of that, okay? That's helpful. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: That's correct. Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then D is like another $8 million, okay. The last thing is more of a comment rather than a question, but I thought rather than having an aggressive accounting treatment on earnings, maybe it's helpful to just provide the EBITDA aspect of it because I get a separate EPS estimate rather than including all amortization, which just seems like an aggressive treatment. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I would disagree that it's an aggressive treatment. It's looking at the underlying profitability. But then, again, bridging \u2013 it's a simple way to bridge it back to cash flow generation. We've seen this done on several of the acquisitions of similar sizes. So I don't consider it aggressive. I'm trying to keep it, \u2013 the number of metrics that we have to communicate and monitor going forward to keep it simple. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hi, John. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: John. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: John? John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Can you hear me? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah, now we can. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. We can now. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. On slide 18, are we going to get operating earnings for four segments or three segments? Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Only three. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Three. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: You're going to have Scent, Taste and then Frutarom. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And then in terms of sales granularity reporting going forward, will we get the same granularity on Fragrances that we currently get, the regional plus Fine and Ingredients? And will we get any additional granularity on sales underneath the various Frutarom and Taste segments? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, John, we're going through that right now. But I would tell you that where I expect this to end up is we're going to report it the way we manage the business. So, on the Taste side of the business, we'll report along the regions, that's the way that business is run. On the Scent side, we'll report around the categories. And on the Frutarom side, I think we're getting around the regional numbers. Directionally, that's where we're headed. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe just, I want to make sure on the guidance, that you can just clarify, the underlying IFF business, as we think about the fourth quarter and/or where the previous constant currency or currency neutral sales growth was, has that expectation changed in anyway? I know there was an embedded deceleration in growth in the prior guidance based on the tougher comps and you slowed a little bit this quarter. But I just wanted make sure I am understanding kind of what the assumption is on both the top line and then constant currency operating profit for the legacy business for 4Q? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, no, nothing significant in terms of change, in terms of the legacy business, both in terms of top line and overall profitability. We're on target. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as we think about 2019, on the Frutarom side, again, going back to some of the questions on the decel implied in 3Q, I mean it's a pretty \u2013 the constant currency growth looks like they were up in the high-single digits, kind of the 8%, 9% range in the first half of the year. And I don't know \u2013 we don't know exactly where it was for 3Q, but it looks to be kind of flat to up slightly organically. I mean, the confidence of that is this is really just a timing of order patterns and are not something kind of more serious that would it impact the revenue growth into the next year, just some additional thoughts there? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No, actually not. Because the good thing is that fruit, the fruit business has a very wide and broad customer base, and it will be very unlikely that all of these customers also for the different categories decide all of a sudden not to buy. I think that gives us a great comfort that we will reaccelerate in terms of the growth. And we are in the middle of the budget process right now, and I hope in the next two or three weeks we will see how the numbers come out. But no big surprises here on this side, I would say it's actually what Rich alluded to, a couple of timing topics and on color, certainly the pricing topic. And then it were the weeks and the two months before we were doing the closing, and that certainly impacted the business as well. As we see, we are coming back right now and that's comforting for us. So that's how I would describe it. And I think it's important to see, because the portfolio has such a wide range of different portfolio topics, plus the broad customer base, that gives us actually good protection against downside movements in the mid and the long term. And that's the reason why we are reasonably optimistic here for the future. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Adam, just a quick follow-up on my side. Again, I don't see anything in the discussions with the team around the third quarter or any expectations that would change our long-term expectations for the business. I think you're right. As we look into 2019, certainly the first half and the first quarter in particular are going to have tougher comps, stronger growth in the first half than what we expect to see in the second half in 2018. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Gunther. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning, Gunther. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Hey. Just a clarification on the amortization, the $220 million that you mentioned, just to make sure this includes also the non-Frutarom part of amortization that you're now including there. Thinking of David Michael, I think it was $7 million or so, and Fragrance Resources a few, so you're taking all of them together. And also on the amortization schedule, is there anything you can share at this point or when would you be able to give the phasing and the details around how to model that over the coming years? That's the first one. And the second one on free cash, more a longer-term question, you've been run-rating with the IFF legacy business for a number of years now very consistently around the 12% free cash flow to sales level per year. I appreciate that you have cash outflows as you integrate the business. But as a run rate, is there any reason to believe why the cash profile should be different from that? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Let me start with the first question, Gunther. In terms of the $220 million, it's really roughly $36 million for the historical Frutarom, $37 million roughly for legacy IFF amortization, and then the incremental \u2013 the difference to that to $220 million, which is call it $147 million, is our current estimates of what the step up is going to be. I don't think Bob has finished the calcs yet, so it's going to take us a while. I would certainly expect that to be the basis for 2019, but we'll have more clarity, I'd say midpoint of 2019 at the earliest, but we'll update everybody if anything changes materially. In terms of free cash flow generation, given the incremental step up, I would expect that ratio to go up. As we begin to see improvements on the IFF side in terms of working capital, we get through some of the inventory pressures that I've talked about earlier, both from a price and a supply chain issue, I think we will be able to drive further improvements from a working capital standpoint on legacy IFF businesses, and I think we see a significant opportunity, particularly on the payables side for the Frutarom business. So I think there's upside to the historical numbers that you were talking about. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Absolutely. And then if you go mid and longer term, also the CapEx will be ramped down, because we have on legacy IFF businesses, as you might know, still to finish our plant in India and in China and two big creative centers here in the U.S. And when we have done that, then the structure is actually in place. We need some CapEx investment on the legacy fruit business to absorb some of all our capacity here as well. But this is all done in the next two years, then CapEx will go down significantly. We had actually a CapEx discussion last Friday, and that will generate more free cash flow going forward as well. So that's how we see it, and it looks like it will go in the right direction. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: And that's all on the organic side. How do you think about providing capital to the Frutarom business to pursue acquisitions, and also what about the IFF legacy business looking for acquisitions longer term? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: It's in the business plan. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: I think as I said earlier, we don't look at it anymore as Frutarom's historical M&A and our historical legacy M&A. It's now one combined pipeline that's based on this strategy and the prioritized segments that we see going forward for the combined businesses. We're not done with all that work yet, but there are things that are in the pipeline that we are confident with, and we continue to work to pursue those. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Andreas's comment about CapEx, on a combined basis, I do see that coming down to probably somewhere between 3% and 3.5% on a combined basis after we get through 2019 and 2020 with all the integration work. Gunther Zechmann - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.: Yeah. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So we have built into our cash flow projections, we have built into our leverage ratios incremental M&A over the next three years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning, thanks very much, a few quick ones. First, can you characterize the margin differential between Fine Fragrance and Fragrance ingredients? Is one materially higher than the other, and any comment about that? Second, what can you \u2013 there was just a lot of great discussion about CapEx relative to depreciation. Can you give us a full-year run rate depreciation number, and then roughly what a full-year CapEx number looks like pro forma right now, depreciation versus CapEx for 2018 for the combined businesses on a full-year basis? And third and finally, how did you get a $9.8 million settlement from a supplier related to a prior recall? I haven't quite seen that before. Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Let me start with the Fine Fragrance versus Fragrance ingredients, and I'm going to put \u2013 I'm going to take the cosmetic actives out of that comparison. I think on a gross margin basis, there's a significant difference. On a return on sales basis, it's much closer to \u2013 they're much closer to each other, given the relative overheads of those two businesses. So they're both attractive on an accretive basis, but gross margin wise, if you think about mix, Fine Fragrance is significantly higher than the Fragrance Ingredients business. CapEx as a percent of sales, I have to come back to you on that one. I think for \u2013 let me come back to you on that one. I don't want to guess and do my math in my head over the call. In terms of the insurance recovery, again, this is related to the product recall issue we settled with our customer last year. We wrote the check in early part of 2018. And then, we've gone back to the vendor's insurance company and worked on getting reimbursement from them, because they had their own product liability insurance and that's where the money came from. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Got you, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Good morning. Thanks for taking a few questions, very simple. Could you quantify a bit the parts of Frutarom that are getting into Taste and Scent? I think IBR is pretty small, but I don't know to model the flavors North America. If you could help us in that? And the second is regarding again the modeling of integration, in particular, the cost that you will incur in restructuring. I think you commented on the overall amount, but if you're a bit more clear on when the timing of the spending in Q4 and I guess 2019? Thank you. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Patrick, could you just repeat the second part of that question, because I'm not sure I got it? Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Yeah. I was \u2013 can you hear me? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead, sorry. Patrick Lambert - Raymond James Financial International Ltd.: Yeah. Just I guess like everybody were trying to fully integrate now Frutarom in our model. And I was trying to forecast the integration costs that you've mentioned at the time of the acquisition. And if you had a bit more precise picture on the timing of the spending already in Q4 and 2019? Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. No problem. So on the internal transfers of IBR and the North American flavors, it's really, it's small. So it's insignificant, again. So, it's not a big number. It's not going to impact the regional numbers much at all. In terms of the integration costs spend, I think it's what Andreas said earlier, I think the bulk of that, the CapEx as well as I would expect that the bulk of those things to be both in 2019 and 2020... Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Richard A. O\u2019Leary - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: ...with a slight lag, I would say in terms of the severance costs by a quarter or two. But I think the bulk of it's going to be in 2019 and 2020. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : And I would now like to turn the call back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you very much for all these great questions. We'll follow up in the one-on-one calls as usually and have a great day, and it's Election Day. [07BDC1-E Rich O'Leary]: Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we distributed press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the first quarter and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 27, 2018, and in our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. For the purpose of this presentation, please note that we've calculated combined numbers by combining our results with the results of Frutarom prior to the acquisition on October 4, 2018, and adjusting for divestitures of Frutarom businesses since October 4, 2018. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I'd now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. On the call today, I will give an executive overview of our operational performance for 2018. Once finished, I will ask Rich to give a more in-depth financial review of the business before leading into our integration priorities for 2019 on the Frutarom acquisition. We will then provide an update on our financial expectation for 2019, and then as usual, take any questions that you may have. I'm very pleased to say that 2018 proved to be a historic year in the long and successful history of IFF. As we recently celebrated our 130th year birthday, we delivered on all of our key financial metrics and completed the acquisition of Frutarom, the largest deal in our industry to date, all while successfully navigating a challenging and dynamic market environment. We achieved strong advancements in both top and bottom line results in 2018 that were in line with our guidance range that we set forth. Highlights include our record-setting sales of approximately $4 billion, which was a 17% increase over last year. This performance was driven by mid-single-digit growth in both taste and scent as well as additional sales related to Frutarom. We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $6.28 as adjusted operating profit growth and a lower year-over-year effective tax rate more than offset higher interest expense and shares outstanding, both related to the Frutarom acquisition. Throughout 2018, we had many strategic accomplishments that drove significant value creation. To highlight just a few. With the acquisition of Frutarom, we established ourselves as a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition. This combination helps us create a truly differentiated portfolio with an increased focus on naturals and health and wellness. It also provides us opportunities to expand into attractive and faster-growing categories and broadens our complementary and growing customer base. We believe this plus strong sales and cost synergies will translate into accelerated financial performance as a combined company. Beyond the transaction, we continued to strengthen our innovation platforms by successfully commercializing three new natural taste modulators, two new fragrance molecules, 41 new natural fragrance ingredients and fragrance body care capsules as critical to driving future growth. Through the execution of our Vision 2020 strategy, we were truly the partner of choice as we expanded our core list access with key global scent customers. This expanded access will help fortify our market-leading position and offer significant future growth opportunities as we now can compete on incremental business opportunities. We also leveraged our exposure to faster-growing small and mid-sized customers to drive results as Tastepoint in North America taste continued its strong performance by growing double digits. Productivity continues to be paramount to our way forward as cost and productivity initiatives once again contributed approximately 5 percentage points of adjusted currency neutral, adjusted operating profit and currency neutral adjusted EPS growth in 2018. And in terms of sustainability, IFF continued its global sustainability leadership as we exceeded already 3 out of 4 of our 2020 eco-efficiency targets. We also established our 2025 goals, which focuses on emission reductions, geo waste to landfill and water stewardship. I'm pleased that we continue to be acknowledged externally for our sustainability efforts. In 2018, we were named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, an honor we received again in 2019; and we were named to the Euronext Vigeo World 120 Index, both recognizing companies for exceptional environmental, social and governance performance. More recently, in January 2019, we were once again included on CDP's A list for climate change, our fourth consecutive year. And we received an A for water security for the first time, naming IFF as a global leader in our environmental responsibility. We also made tremendous progress as it relates to our integration of Frutarom. First and foremost, we instilled an integration management office to provide visibility for all critical initiations and enhanced decision making. This key group of individuals, the best of IFF and Frutarom, have been instrumental in developing go-forward plans and supporting the day-to-day execution. We also refined and confirmed our plan to achieve approximately $145 million of cost synergies by 2021. Synergies are expected to come from procurement, footprint optimization and streamlining of overhead expenses. In addition, we identified initial cross-selling opportunities to drive incremental growth going forward. These opportunities are expected to provide revenue synergies, which we believe will further value create to the shareholders over time. As we mentioned last quarter, we've already capitalized on a few quick wins. We integrated Frutarom's North America taste business in our North America business, and we'll leverage our Tastepoint go-to-market strategy for small and mid-sized customers. At the same time, we combined Frutarom's cosmetic active ingredients business called IBR into our Lucas Meyer's cosmetic business. Concurrently, we moved all savory solution capabilities and innovation under a single leader to form Frutarom Global Savory Solutions group. This will enable the group to work together in a unified direction. From a global footprint standpoint, we've already begun to execute the optimization of our manufacturing sites in order to realize significant cost synergies. This plan has already led to closings in the U.K. as we consolidated our site in Manningtree. While this is a first step in the process and we have much more work to be done, we are moving forward as planned. Lastly, we're finalizing plans for our next stage of taste integration like we did in North America combining like taste businesses together to build a strong platform, more to be shared in due course. I would like now to turn it over to Rich. Richard O'Leary: Thank you, Andreas. I'd like to now give you a more in-depth review of taste and nutrition. Turning to the Taste business. In the fourth quarter 2018, currency neutral sales grew 5% with 3 of the 4 regions expanding year-over-year. This performance was led by mid-single-digit growth in North America and Greater Asia. All categories contributed to growth led by dairy and beverage. Segment profit was challenged due to higher RSA expenses and several other ongoing costs, which I don't expect to be continuing in a more of a one-off nature in the quarter. For the full year 2018, currency neutral sales increased 5%, driven by growth in all regions and across all categories. Improvements were led by high single-digit growth in North America with strong double-digit growth in Tastepoint; mid-single-digit growth in EAME, led by double-digit growth in Africa and the Middle East; and in Latin America led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina. Taste currency neutral segment profit on a full year basis grew approximately 6%, led by volume growth and the benefits from our ongoing cost and productivity initiatives. In terms of segment profit margin, we continue to see margin expansion improving 60 basis points to an industry-leading 22.7%. In the scent business, fourth quarter 2018 currency neutral sales grew 3%. Performance was driven by mid-single-digit improvements in Fragrance Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrances. Fine Fragrances were down slightly year-over-year, reflecting strong double-digit growth in the year-ago comparison. For the year 2018, currency neutral sales grew 4% with the strongest improvement coming in Fragrance Ingredients, which grew high single digits. This was led by price increases and strong double-digit growth in cosmetic active ingredients. Consumer Fragrances grew mid-single digits, including price as performance was driven by double-digit growth in Hair Care and mid-single-digit growth in Fabric Care, Home Care and Toiletries, all led by innovation platforms. Scent currency neutral segment profit decreased approximately 2% as the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to input costs, reflecting unprecedented raw material inflation, including the previously announced citral supply issue as well as highest manufacturing -- higher manufacturing costs due to these supply chain challenges. It should be noted that over the course of 2018, due to external events, we continued to be impacted by incremental pressures in raw material costs. Our pricing, as expected, accelerated throughout the year and was near 2%, 3% in the fourth quarter. However, it was not enough to cover the cost increases. As always, we'll continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate the cost increases. In terms of segment profit margin, year-over-year performance was pressured. However, our profit margins remained strong at 17.5%. Turning to Frutarom. In the fourth quarter, sales totaled approximately $360 million. Please note, and as a reminder, we closed the acquisition on October 4 and the financial results for Frutarom reflect the closing date, and as such, does not include a full quarter's activity. We're pleased to report that Frutarom returned to growth in the fourth quarter as like-for-like sales increased 3%, driven by strong improvements in natural product solutions and F&F ingredients. The core business, which excludes trade and marketing, grew 4% versus the prior year on a like-for-like basis. In terms of segment profit, the Frutarom division delivered $27 million and $66 million, excluding amortization. The margin profile for Frutarom in the fourth quarter was strong at 18.5%, excluding the amortization. This was a strong improvement when you compare it to what they reported in Q4 2017 as a stand-alone company. In terms of cash flow, operating cash flow increased $46 million or 12% to $437 million compared to $391 million in 2017. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased earnings, depreciation and amortization and lower pension contributions offset by increased inventories. Core working capital was impacted by higher inventory to ensure business continuity during the supply chain challenges as well as higher material -- higher raw material prices. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $170 million in capital expenditures or about 4.3% of sales, driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia. As we discussed in the past, some of these investments include a flavors manufacturing facility in the Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone, which opened on October 9, 2018; and a Natural Products Research lab located in the Nanjing Life Science Park, which opened on October 15, 2018. The flavors plant is our second in China and is designed to supplement our existing flavors and manufacturing operations in Guangzhou. The Naturals Lab is our first outside of the U.S. China is a critical and component part -- component of our long-term research strategy. The opening of these new facilities will support our efforts to be a partner of choice and grow in this exciting region. Regarding cash returned to shareholders, we paid approximately $230 million or about 50% of adjusted net income in dividend payouts and $15 million on share repurchases. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich. I wanted to spend a few moments to highlight our integration priorities moving forward as we end the year 1 of this 3-year journey. As we spoke about earlier, integrating IBR into LMC is imperative to strengthen the product offering and drive accelerated growth and cosmetic active ingredients. As a reminder, cosmetic active ingredients is a very high-growth and high-profitable sector that we have prioritized moving forward. We want to ensure seamless combination of the Global Savory Solutions group to address customer needs by leveraging the technologies and expertise in our various categories. By establishing a globally coordinated team, we will support strong local presence with global expertise as we offer a full range meat ingredient provider; novel flavors; functionality and technical expertise in texture, color, oxidation, plant protein and aromas to our entire customer base. We will continue to consolidate the Frutarom taste business under the IFF taste leader as we move to capitalize on efficiencies and drive accelerated growth. The plan is to leverage our strong blueprint of our Tastepoint North America go-to-market approach to strengthen our exposure with small and mid-tier customers in every market around the world. In terms of synergies, which I will touch more in a moment, we plan to capitalize on significant make versus buy initiatives across our spend to drive strong year one cost synergies, and we will continue to execute our global site rationalization for improved efficiency. Lastly, we will broaden our cross-selling activities and begin the execution on opportunities. A cross-functional global team has been established and is working diligently to generate incremental opportunities to capture a greater value. As I have said previously, I continue to believe this will provide the largest value-creation opportunity in the medium to long term. Slide 16 provides an overview on the anticipated cost synergies in year one of our three year integration plan. Our integration program is well underway, developing and refining the work plans to unlock these value-creation opportunities. As you can see, we anticipate approximately $30 million to $35 million of expected savings in year one. The $30 million to $35 million will come from accelerating the rationalization and harmonization of our procurement spend. We will leverage higher spend on overlapping direct raw materials and rationalize. We will also leverage production capabilities where we are currently buying materials or intermediates at a higher price. We will also continue to rationalize the global footprint to optimize our global sites. Note that over time the contribution of our manufacturing rationalize will increase as it takes time to work with site closures. Lastly, we will be streamlining overhead expenses by reducing nonstrategic costs and eliminating redundant expenses. This will ensure that we create an organization that focuses and directs spend to the most value-enhancing opportunities. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rich, who'll give us an outlook for 2019. Richard O'Leary: Thanks, Andreas. Over the last few years, we've seen a -- the global operating environment to continue to be volatile. There are several things that have direct implications on our industry and business in 2019 that I'd like to highlight. A clear headwind within our industry is the continued rise of raw material costs. In 2019, we expect mid-single-digit inflation on our legacy IFF business as synthetic materials continue to rise, driven by several supply chain disruptions that we've faced over the last 12 to 15 months. These market disruptions continue to disproportionately impact the scent business and is more -- as it is more broadly exposed to these raw materials. It should be noted that when you combine 2018 and 2019, raw material cost inflation in the scent division is near 20%. Our strategic priority is to protect our customers business, which we were successful in doing in 2018. However, this comes at an incremental cost. This will require us to continue to work with our customers, taking additional price increases as we move through 2019 to ensure that we ultimately recover these cost increases over time. It should be noted that natural ingredients costs like vanilla and citrus markets remained elevated near historical levels. We expect to see a more muted cost increases for taste in 2019. From an economic perspective, GDP growth on a global basis remains positive; however, many estimates were recently revised downward. There continues to be geopolitical tension and uncertainties around the world with examples like trade wars and Brexit. All in all, we are optimistic about our top line, but recognize that there is risk given the constantly changing operating environment. The U.S. dollar continues to fluctuate versus the world currency. As we are in generally a strong $environment year-over-year, the euro to $exchange rate is the most relevant to IFF. So you'll see the euro to $exchange rate stabilizing. It is positive. From a profitability perspective, the euro represents approximately 30% of our profits, including the addition of Frutarom. Our rolling hedging program helps limit any volatility as we're currently hedged approximately 45% at an average rate of $1.21. Lastly, we've seen improved global consumer staples volumes in 2018, which we expect to continue in 2019. At the same time, local and regional customers continue to grow rapidly, a great opportunity as this is more prevalent to our business when incorporating 30,000 small and mid-sized customers that we acquired from Frutarom. Before reviewing full year expectations for 2019, I want to highlight a few go-forward modeling assumptions. First of all, we will be referencing a combined 2018 result as if all aspects of the Frutarom transaction were retroactive to the start of 2018. First, in 2019, we expect a modest benefit from M&A, and yes, an additional week of sales or 53rd week. Currency is expected to be a headwind in 2019. We expect a headwind of approximately 3 percentage points on a combined sales growth and approximately 2 percentage points on adjusted EPS, ex amortization. We expect approximately $30 million to $35 million in cost synergies in 2019 coming from procurement, operations and overhead expenses as Andreas explained. Following successful debt raised for the Frutarom acquisition, our debt outstanding is about $4.4 billion. And combined interest expense associated with this debt is approximately $150 million. Currently, we're assuming an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% for 2019, but the dynamics around this remain fluid. For the purposes of calculating adjusted diluted EPS on a going forward basis, we estimate that there will be approximately 113 million shares outstanding, including 6.3 million shares related to the tangible equity units. Annual amortization of intangible assets is expected to be about $190 million to $195 million, down from our previous estimate. Given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers between combined 2018 and 2019 sales. In terms of sales growth, we're targeting to achieve $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion in sales during 2019, representing a combined growth of 5% to 7%. In the chart, as you can see from second bar, approximately nine months of Frutarom adds $1.1 billion to our combined 2018 sales. In the third bar, we've estimated approximately $45 million of divestitures related to noncore Frutarom businesses in Central Europe and the U.S. that takes us to a combined full year 2018 sales of $5.1 billion. In the fifth bar, we estimate approximately $150 million of headwinds due to currency, resulting in currency neutral combined sales number of $4.95 billion. If you then use our expected 2019 growth of 5% to 7%, you'll get our guidance of $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion in sales during 2019. We expect broad-based growth across all of our segments with pricing driving scent and volumes the key component of taste and food performance. Moving on to a reconciliation of our 2019 adjusted EPS. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.90 to $5.10 and adjusted EPS ex amortization of $6.30 to $6.50. On the left side of the slide, you can see what we -- you can see that we expect 10% to 15% of growth in 2019 for adjusted EPS to get us to our range of $4.90 to $5.10. For adjusted EPS ex amortization, I'll walk you through the key drivers. Starting with the second bar in that section, $2.06 will be added to our full year 2018 number, representing the first nine months of Frutarom. On the next bar, you can see that the full effect of the $4.4 billion debt issuance has a negative $0.55 impact. When you add that together with the share count dilution from the equity issuance going forward from approximately 80 million shares before issuance to approximately 113 million shares outstanding, it has approximately $1.71 share dilution impact on full year combined results. Combining that with approximately $0.13 related to other impacts, including tax rate, Frutarom minority interest and lower other income and expense in 2019, it gets you to $5.95 for the combined 2018 year. We expect approximately $0.12 related to currency in 2019 to bridge you to a currency neutral combined adjusted EPS of $5.83. When you apply the 2019 expected growth rates of 8% to 11%, our guidance for 2019 comes out to be $6 -- $6.30 to $6.50. While we expect to see solid top line growth across the entire business, scent profitability is being adversely impacted by the additional raw material cost inflation where pricing actions take time to achieve the -- to achieve given the nature of our business. As we move beyond 2019, we would expect to see the results to accelerate as raw materials tend to begin to -- trends begin to normalize and we generate the majority of our integrations related in 2020. Debt payment -- debt repayment continues to be a critical focus of ours. We're committed to reaching a 3x leverage ratio by 2020, down from our current 3.6x. Our intent is to retain an investment-grade rating and our management team's incentives are now aligned with the repayment debt metrics. With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich. That was a lot of very complicated slides, but I hope it helps. As we look to the future, we're reconfirming our long-term targets. We expect to deliver between 5% to 7% currency neutral combined sales growth CAGR between 2019 and 2021. We also expect to deliver 10%-plus adjusted EPS ex amortization combined growth for the same period. So 2019 is the first very important step in the journey and the foundation to achieve our long-term targets. In summary, we're pleased with our financial performance for 2018 as we delivered on all of our key metrics. We made strong advancement in both top and bottom line results as we recorded record-setting sales and adjusted EPS ex amortization. We also build an organization for accelerate -- accelerated profitable growth combining two strong organizations to create a truly global leader in taste, scent and nutrition. As we look forward, full year 2019, we expect sales to be between $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion, adjusted EPS to be between $4.90 and $5.10 and adjusted EPS ex amortization in between $6.30 and $6.50 as Rich said. The coming together of IFF and Frutarom was a momentous achievement in 2018, and we're excited to be moving forward as one company and pursuing new opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders around the world. And with that, I would now like to open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about Frutarom. So sales growth improved sequentially, but was still below longer-term expectations. I guess, given tough comparisons in the business prior to the deal, I assume it doesn't meaningfully accelerate until 2Q. So maybe just verify if that's kind of what you believe? And then what gives confidence that 6% remains achievable, the only thing that you've seen so far that would increase confidence in that? And I guess, sort of related to that, any idea what shipments looked like in that business relative to demand in quarters prior to the deal close, meaning, like, could they have overshipped demand? Andreas Fibig : Okay, Mark, so first of all, good morning. Let me answer the question. First of all, from the technical point of view, we certainly have much easier comparables in the second half of the year. So that's something which makes us very optimistic. We're also happy that after a softer third quarter last year, the fourth quarter was turning around. People are again focusing on the business after we have done the close on the 4th of October. We have started the integration very, very well, and as we said before, we were happy that we could close the deal a couple of weeks ahead of our original timing and that pays off because everything is going according to plan. So people can go back and focus on the customers. I believe that's super important. Leadership is clear, and we really can make sure that we see the customers and sell. What makes me optimistic is that first of all, we're in some of the faster-growing segments, which is super helpful, and particularly, in the adjacency -- adjacent business. We're with some of the faster-growing customers as well, and particularly, in Europe and in the U.S. And we haven't even tapped into the cross-selling opportunity, but we see already that our teams are generating really good ideas and having implemented a couple of pilots and that makes us pretty optimistic on the Frutarom piece. So all in all, a very, very positive picture from our point of view. Richard O'Leary: Yes. I think, Mark, from a -- as you said, I think Q1 will be the most challenging from a comp standpoint, a little bit better in Q2, obviously Q3. And the second half, as Andreas talked about, will be -- will see the fastest acceleration. I think the other thing to me was, clearly, North America was one of the challenged markets. I think we've done -- we've put the leadership in place now. There was a vacancy prior to the closing. And I think now we're getting much and much more alignment and integration between Frutarom's taste business in North America and our Tastepoint business. So that I think that will enable us to accelerate growth. I think we've already seen very, very quickly some real opportunities in terms of where we combine our two capabilities to drive growth on projects that the two companies individually weren't able to tackle. Mark Astrachan : Got it. Okay. So just to be clear, then 6% remains the target? And then I just want to switch to a separate question on free cash flow, Rich. It's diverged from an income in recent years. Does this normalize in your view in 2019? I think you'd mentioned given inventories being inflated given the supply chain challenges. So does the inventory piece specifically improve? And are there any other anticipated items that will impact cash generation in '19 as far as you can tell? Richard O'Leary: Yes, I think, to your first comment, our expectations in terms of the 6% is certainly our -- still our expectations for the Frutarom business going forward. In terms of cash flow, yes, I think that in the last two years, if I look at cash flow from operations compared to adjusted net income, it was in the 80% to 90% range. '19 was -- or '18 was clearly challenged by the inventories, which were up $130-something million. In '19, I would expect the inventory number to stabilize. I don't think it's going to get better yet. We're going to be challenged with the mid-single-digit cost increases that I alluded to on our legacy business. But I think that's where we see going forward, stabilization in '19 and then improvements beginning in '20 going forward. Overall, I would expect that cash from working capital impacts in 2019 to actually be favorable versus a big outflow in 2018. And overall, I would say, when you take that into consideration plus the increased D&A, I would expect our conversion of cash from operations versus adjusted net income to be above 100%. So much better than what we have been for the last two years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : To talk about the Flavors business, I think the organic growth of 2% in the quarter was a bit disappointing relative to what it had done in the rest of 2018. So just as you talked about your expectation for the Frutarom business, I'd love to hear how you're thinking about your base business? So Flavors and Fragrances, it seems like you're embedding a bit of an acceleration in 2019. So if you could just break those two components out, that would be helpful? Richard O'Leary: Yes, Faiza, it's Rich. I mean, I think that clearly, there's been -- Q4 was a disappointment, but I think you also got to keep in mind the prior year comparables and a very strong Q3. I think that in -- with 2020 hindsight, it looks like a portion of the strong growth that we saw in Q3 is some element of inventory because we see -- we saw a positive impact from volume erosion, which was actually favorable in Q3 in the taste business and it turned unfavorable in Q4. So I think there's clearly an element associated with inventory adjustments and movements on the part of our customers. On a two year basis, growth for Flavors is probably around 4%, and on a full year basis, growth rates were -- on a two year basis are probably in the 5% range. So I think, partly, the fundamentals of our taste business haven't changed, our expectations haven't changed. We are clearly seeing, particularly in the fourth quarter, some volume erosion and lower volumes on -- with global customers, the large CPGs. It's hard to say right now whether that's again a continuation in the inventory correction. But I think, overall, our expectations are -- going forward have not changed significantly. I think it's still going to be a challenging year, but the potential of the business hasn't changed. Andreas Fibig : And on the Fragrance side, we can say we're winning good businesses. We had for the Fine Fragrance business, a very tough comparison for the first quarter. But looking forward, and particularly, if we look at the win rates we have in-house already, we're very optimistic on the Fine Fragrance business. I think for the Fragrance and scent business, it's not too much about the, let's say, the growth rate in terms of sales and the win rate, I think we're doing extremely well here. It's more about managing the raw material crisis, making sure that we can realize our price. And what makes us super optimistic on it is that we have won three more global core list. We never had -- we didn't have before, and that gives us just a more expanded reach of our business opportunities. Whether we can big times already capitalize in '19, I'm not sure because it takes a little bit of time, but on the midterm, I'm very optimistic on this one because these were significant wins the team brought in end of last year. Faiza Alwy : Okay. So Andreas, you mentioned the -- managing the pricing amid this raw material inflation. Like what is sort of -- what is embedded in your outlook for '19 for pricing? And how much of that pricing have you already taken? And how much do you have to go back to the -- to your global customers and try to get that pricing? Richard O'Leary: I mean, Faiza, that process is already underway. I think, when you look at the guidance and our expectations for 2019, it's about 1.5% of pricing and all in the scent business. And that process is already underway. I think it's as -- that's the same thing -- it's like rewind button. It's a tough discussion, but Nicholas' team has done -- they understand the importance, our customers understand that we work through the normal mechanisms of price and other activities to do that. I think we did an excellent job in 2018. And our price realization was in line with our expectations. What was the surprise was the cost impact as we progressed through the year continued to increase and accelerate. So I'm confident in the medium- and long-term that we're going to recover the price increases, but '19 is going to be another challenging year. Andreas Fibig : Yes. And actually, if you compare ourselves to one of our bigger competitors, then you see that the erosion of the EBITDA margin was actually less. So that basically it is a testament for me that the teams are doing a good job here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kate Grafstein from Barclays. Katie Grafstein : If we could talk a little bit about gross margins for 2019, if you could walk through some of the moving pieces? And how should we think about incremental pricing needing to cover inflation in Fragrances? And can we assume gross margins could actually be up as that pricing comes through in the back half of the year? Richard O'Leary: I mean, actually, no, I think, as I said, we've got about 1.5% built in to the targets for our objectives for 2019 in terms of pricing. Again, all of that -- substantially all of that in the scent business. I think that on the taste side, it's more flat from a pricing standpoint. From a margin standpoint, it's going to be dilutive because we're going to have the sales and we're recovering -- we're looking to cover the cost increases and we're playing catch-up again versus what we -- the way we exited 2018, and then on top of that, we've got additional increases expected in 2019. So there's going to be a time lag as it has been. And in time, there is a level of this magnitude of 20% over a two year basis. From an overall margin standpoint, I think the other thing to keep in mind is the mix impact between the three businesses. And so you've got Frutarom that's going to represent about 1/3 -- about 30% of the overall total from a sales standpoint. Their margins or our gross margins when you look at how we report are from the U.S. standpoint -- U.S. GAAP standpoint. They're in the high 30s, about call it 38%, in that range, in that high 30s. So that has a dilutive impact. So our margin year-to-year is going to be -- it's going to be diluted and not going to go up in 2019. I think will help -- some of the synergies will help, but that synergy is going to get split between overhead expenses as well as cost of goods sold. I think we'll get some, but it's not going to be a significant step up from '19 to '18 or '18 to '19. Andreas Fibig : You will see it probably in 2020 because then the synergies on the manufacturing side start kicking in and taking into -- let's say, taking the assumption, which I think is fair that the raw material inflation hopefully will stop this year, then you -- we will see a significant improvement in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Michael Sison : In terms of Frutarom, could you walk us through what the expectations should be for sales in '19, I guess, from the $1.1 billion that you noted in the presentation? And then, I guess, when you report operating income for '19, what should that look like, you'll be reporting it with amortization, right? Andreas Fibig : Correct. Richard O'Leary: Yes. So if you take the $1.1 billion we've got -- we've adjusted for the -- you basically take out about, as I said, about $45 million of business. That -- we -- the biggest piece of that we sold in the fourth quarter. There is a small piece that will be discontinued. We expect it to be discontinued in early 2019. So then the base is net of those two elements. And then, from there, I would say the 6% that we've talked about is our expectation for 2019. From a profitability standpoint, the amortization will be included in the division results as it is for all three divisions. We do that to maintain. That's how we measure the business performance. It's how we look at it from an incentive comp standpoint. And it's how we keep things tied back to our economic profit principles. And that's why we look at it both -- at a division level on a segment profit basis, including amortization, and on a corporate level, we've added the element of ex amortization from an overall cash flow standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann from Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Mike and Andreas, two questions. Just, can you talk a bit about the sales leverages that we're expecting for the Frutarom business? I think I remember you saying 50 bps per annum. When do you see that really kick in? And also, if you can discuss what the incremental margins are that you expect from that? That's the first one. The second one is pretty quick I have. In the 5% to 7% sales growth guidance for 2019 that you put, is it fair to assume that, that's organic sales growth or is it just local currency with some bolt-ons as well? Andreas Fibig : Maybe you take the last one, and I think I'll take the other one. Richard O'Leary: Yes. Do you want me to go first? Okay. So out of the -- in the 5% to 7%, there is, as I said, about 1.5% related to price. There is about some -- a little bit between 50 basis points and 100 basis points or call it a middle 75 of impact related to the 53rd week and a small amount of M&A and the balance is organic volume. Andreas Fibig : Yes. And on the cross-selling, we will be -- first of all, we will be more, let's say, concrete on it when we do our Investor Day in the mid of the year. But what we see and the teams are working on it that we have the first, let's say, pilots running. We had the first couple of wins, small ones, but we see that they are really good and significant sizable opportunities. So I believe, it will actually start probably at the end of the year, and then going into 2020 that we see an impact on the cross-selling, which is really, really good. And we will make sure on the margin side to answer that question that we go into this more higher-margin business that we'll certainly put our resources behind the areas and categories while we can earn better margin than we have, and we'll probably let some of the lower-margin business go. So that's as an answer, and by the way, on the growth rate, as Rich said in one of his bridges, we have lost a couple of sales as well because we have sold or we are selling some of the smaller business from Frutarom just as an FYI. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. John Roberts : In the Frutarom shareholder filings, they had a 2018 projected revenue number of $1.75 billion. And so, on Slide 20, if I take your $1.1 billion and add your fourth quarter of $360 million, coming up about $300 million short today, finished the year like the -- was the fourth quarter $300 million below what they were thinking earlier in the year? That seems like way too bigger gap, like the math is wrong here somehow? Michael DeVeau : Yes, John, its Mike. Just remember, from a Frutarom guidance standpoint pre the acquisition, that was a 2020 guidance, right. So that $300 million was a number they had that was going to go out in another couple of years. Richard O'Leary: But look, clearly, John, I mean, third quarter built in -- at that point, in the numbers. They were not expecting to have a negative growth in Q3, and they were not expecting -- I don't think those numbers were based on having 3%, 4% growth in Q4. So the second half of the year was clearly weaker than what that was projected. There is a currency element between that and what we built into our assumptions for 2019. And clearly, there is -- I think there was M&A that they had expected to occur during 2018 that has not occurred. So I think it's a combination of all of that that much but it's not $300 million in the fourth quarter that was causing the difference. Andreas Fibig : No. No. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from Citi. Daniel Jester : Just on the cost synergies side, now that you have the asset for a couple of months, can you talk about your confidence level in getting that $145 million target? And if we do see a slowdown from a macro perspective, is there anything you can do to accelerate those cost savings? Andreas Fibig : Yes, let me take it. First of all, our confidence level on the synergies is very, very high because we see it already on the run rates we have for some of these elements like procurement and even the footprint rationalization. I'm saying run rate because of P&L impact. We had to go circa to inventory in 2019 to make it happen, but confidence levels is very, very, very high. If the economy is going down or is not growing as fast as we saw it in 2019, we have other levels -- levers to play here as well to make sure that we reach our numbers, but I'll give it to you Rich. Richard O'Leary: I think what built into the guidance that we have for 2019 is investments that we've -- we want to make to drive future growth. I mean, Nicolas -- Andreas talked about Nicolas' business and the new core list that we've gained access to. In order to realize that potential, we've got to invest in resources, whether it's commercial people, boots on the ground, C&A resources, consumer insights and research, that's embedded in that -- in our guidance for 2019. It's probably 300 to 400 basis points of investment. If the year unfolds differently, we can certainly slow that down and make choices as we've done over the last 2 to 3 years as -- particularly in '16 and '17, we slowed back investment and we cut it back to try to mitigate the impacts of weaker top line. That will always be part of our management process and then trade-offs that we have to evaluate. Part of that 300 to 400 that I talked about is really playing catch-up, and while we -- as we progress through 2019, that's the first thing we'll do is say, are we on track from an external in looking viewpoint and what do we do as a result of that? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Just a couple of questions on Frutarom. In your descriptions of the taste and scent business, you talk about local currency growth or currency neutral growth, but in the Frutarom business, you talk about 3% growth on a like-for-like basis. Can you remind me what like-for-like means? And how that factors in acquisitions or currencies or whether it does or it doesn't? And then secondly, Frutarom's sales were much higher in the first and second quarter, they were $385 million and $401 million. Why were the sales for Frutarom so much higher in the first and second quarters than they were in the third and the fourth? Andreas Fibig : You do the first one. Richard O'Leary: Yes, let me take -- I'll take the first one, Jeff. You're right, it's a different methodology. I mean, they've always used like-for-like. And we'll evaluate as we go forward if there is a way to combine the two methodologies. Like-for-like represents that if -- what they do is they then back in and say if there is an acquisition that was done in the middle of any year, they take the prior year growth and put it back, prior year sales and compare prior year sales for the acquisition to current year sales for the acquisition. So again, it's almost -- it's measuring on a pro forma basis as if the acquisition -- any current year acquisition was affected as of the first of the prior year. So they're looking at the organic growth of that business plus the organic growth of the existing businesses. So it's a slightly different methodology. It's almost like same-store sales. It is a bit different than what we're doing. But it was the most practical way for the time being for us to look at it on a combined basis. Andreas Fibig : Okay. And I think that's important that we have to, let's say, bring it all at the same level that we can compare apples-to-apples. Let me take the second piece of your question, Jeff, is on Frutarom first half to second half. Certainly, seasonality plays a role. Second, we had an unfavorable currency situation at the second half of the year as well because it's a lot of euro denomination in their sales. For the consolidation to our numbers, the three days we're missing because we closed on October 4. And then what we should not underestimate, particularly in the third quarter, that there was certainly a distraction of the organization to get the closing of the deal done. We are happy that we closed actually ahead of time, as we said, but that was certainly a couple of weeks or months even of the organization where they were more focused getting the closing done than selling to those customers. And then we're very happy and actually are optimistic because it turned around already in the fourth quarter and that's a very good sign. So that's the explanation for the sales first compared to second half of 2018. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Just a quick one. Andreas, you're on the board, and I know, Rich, you were there, I think, you were controller for a lot of the cultural changes under Doug and Kevin that took place, I think, just focusing on more profitable briefs, like that's sort of business process stuff. Could you compare the culture at Frutarom and the integration challenges or integration opportunities you see just as far as the cultural organizing from most profitable, least profitable and basically risk adjusting, all of that, to what you went through back then? And if there is that kind of opportunity, how that plays into your synergy plan? Andreas Fibig : I would say, Jon, a very interesting and good question because here are certainly opportunities for us to look at the profitability of the different businesses. And we're doing it even much broader that we look into all categories and all customers right now. And we will present to the board in May by the way to look where we put our dollars behind and where we might walk away or make sure that we don't invest too much money to make sure that we're really going after the opportunities, which are giving us the best yield for our dollar. So that's good. In terms of the culture, what is good is that with the acquisition, we got a lot of energy from the company, which is very commercially focused and that will help us as well to focus on our customers and make sure that we get the best out of the customers and that we have a good service in place here as well. So that will be my answer, but Rich, you please supplement. Richard O'Leary: Yes. I think, Jon, it's -- in some ways, the fundamentals of the cultural change are similar in the sense that the biggest thing back under Doug, Kevin was a shift in focus and understanding from just top line growth to profitability and margins and accretive business, the whole EP focus. And I think I can clearly tell you that the Frutarom mentality, Frutarom DNA is all about profitable growth. And they focus on margins day in, day out. You've heard me take about their Executive Information System and they live through that day in, day out. They're focused on what are the -- what's the margin expansion, what's the mix improvement. So I think, from that standpoint, it's very similar in terms of we both companies recognize the importance of profitable growth. I think the challenge that we were going to have to manage through as an executive team is, now we have a much bigger business and the choices that we have are much bigger. And so we're going to have to manage through that because we don't have endless resources. So it's both a benefit and a challenge that now we have to allocate those resources and prioritize across a much wider spectrum of businesses. Andreas Fibig : And that was actually one of the reasons for the acquisition, as we said, we wanted to increase the option space for us because now, as Rich said, we can -- we have natural colors, we have health ingredients, we have food protection, we have flavors, we have fragrances, we've active cosmetics, and that gives us good choices. And actually, it helps us as well to balancing a very weaker global environment as well. So we believe it's good to have options, and we have no more options than we had ever before, probably more options than many of our competitors, and we believe that has positioned us actually in a very, very, very good spot. With that, I think, Mike, we will close the call for today, but I would like to remind you that we are at CAGNY next week. And we have a CAGNY dinner where we will display all of these new franchises and categories we have now in store, and we'll give you an explanation what we can do with it. And you can experience it, you can taste it, you can smell it, and we believe it will be great. So I hope to see a lot of you next week in Boca actually with much warmer and better weather. And you will see it will be spectacular. Thank you very much. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Flavors & Fragrances First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we announced our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release that we filed yesterday. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. For purpose of this presentation, we calculated combined numbers by combining our results of -- with the results of Frutarom prior to the acquisition on October 4, 2018, and adjusting for divestitures of Frutarom businesses since October 4, 2018. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. On the call today, I will give an overview of our operational performance for the first quarter of 2019. After that, I will go through our integration progress and priorities as we see them today. Once finished, I will ask Rick to give a more in-depth financial review of our business performance, and then I will provide an update on our outlook for the balance of the year and take any questions that you may have. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations as we achieved double-digit sales and adjusted operating profit growth, including benefits related to the acquisition of Frutarom. In the quarter, we delivered a record-setting quarterly sales of approximately $1.3 billion, a 39% increase over last year. On a comparable basis and excluding the impact of divestitures, currency-neutral growth was achieved in all 3 segments led by scent at 4%, Frutarom at 3% and Taste at 2% or 3% overall growth. We also maintained strong profitability levels as productivity initiatives, cost synergies and price realization offset higher year-over-year raw material cost. This combined with the addition of Frutarom led to a very strong 13% increase over the prior year period. Earnings per share, excluding amortization, came in at $1.57 as adjusted operating profit growth was more than offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding, both related to the Frutarom acquisition. In the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our portfolio via acquisitions and collaboration that expand our innovation platforms and product offerings beyond traditional flavors and fragrances. In January, we completed the acquisition of 60% of the share capital of Mighty, a leading Savory Solutions provider in Thailand. Mighty develops, produces and markets reaction flavors, with particular expertise in Savory Solutions. The company's portfolio includes flavors, seasoning blends, marinades and specialty function raw materials for the food and beverage industry. We also established an industry-exclusive collaboration with Aryballe, a pioneer in digital olfaction technology based in France. To refine and further develop the flavor and fragrance capabilities in applications of Aryballe's technology in portable, universal odor detection sensors. Together, we were focused on the development of odor sensing and quality control application with a goal of creating a platform for applications in the food, fragrance, cosmetic and other industries. In February, we announced that we expanded and strengthened our delivery capabilities for scent, taste and active ingredients so the acquisition of The Additive Advantage, a company that develops novel technologies with diverse capabilities that span many application and industries. TAA has the expertise to develop the next-generation 3D delivery systems, technology platforms that will enable the printing of flavors, fragrances, cosmetic and health and nutrition actives onto a variety of consumer products. We're excited about this technology as it builds upon our market leadership position and capabilities and delivery technology. And lastly, in March, we announced that we completed the acquisition of 70% stake in Leagel, a producer of ice cream and gelato ingredients in Europe, a family-owned company based in San Marino, Italy, which specializes in artisanal taste, texture and toppings sold directly to ice cream and gelato shops. We see great opportunities to combine Leagel with SDFLC, our existing Brazilian ice cream and dessert business to create a global platform for gelato ingredients, expand our geographic reach and leverage cross-selling opportunities. All four provide opportunities for us to develop stronger innovation and differentiate ourselves where there is competition. In terms of integration, I'm pleased to say that we are executing very well against our priorities. We've made strong advancements year-to-date on our year 1 cost synergy target of approximately $30 million to $35 million. In the first quarter, we achieved approximately 15%, and we expect savings benefit will accelerate throughout the year. Based on where we are today, we are confident that we can achieve our $30 million to $35 million cost-savings goal as our current run rate savings are already in excess of this target. We also outlined our cross-selling priorities and execution plan to provide a foundation for cross-fertilization opportunities across the organization. While we will discuss and disclose more details at our upcoming Investor Day, I'm happy to report that we already have achieved approximately $7 million of annualized new businesses from the quick wins. For those businesses, where we have aligned to our go-to-market approach as IFF, North America Taste and IBR growth was very strong increasing double digit. In the U.S., Frutarom's North American Taste business has successfully been merged into Tastepoint, our go-to-market approach to service small and mid-sized customers. The alignment of Frutarom's cosmetic active ingredients business with our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics is now complete, and we're seeing strong benefit with sales up double digits in quarter 1 2019. We have all created a global Savory Solutions organization under one leader to share best practices globally and collaborate with our taste division to ensure we continue to capture market share in this growing segment. I will let Rich discuss the financials in greater detail, including debt repayment and cash flow in a moment. Going deeper into our cost synergies, we continue to optimize our global footprint and have closed our Manningtree site in the U.K. In addition, our operations team is actively completing the necessary steps for further network consolidation, and we expect additional sites to be closed throughout the year, all in line with our plan. In regard to procurement savings, we have renegotiated a significant portion of our spend for leverage savings and are adjusting our saving strategy to benefit from significant make versus buy opportunities. With these in mind, we confidently believe that we are on track to achieve our full year target of approximately $30 million to $35 million, and again our current run rate savings are well in excess of our plan. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rich to take you in the details for financial performance. Richard O'Leary: Thank you, Andreas. In the Scent business, first quarter currency-neutral sales grew 4% versus a strong 8% year ago comparison with growth in nearly all regions and categories. Performance was strongest in Fine Fragrances, increasing double digits, led by strong new wins. Consumer Fragrances grew mid-single digits with double-digit growth in Home Care and mid-single digit growth in Fabric Care. Fragrance Ingredients was down year-over-year as price increases related to continued high raw material costs were more than offset by volume declines. Scent currency-neutral segment profit decreased approximately 3% at the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable year-over-year price to input costs, which reflects the unprecedented raw material inflation we have been facing since late 2017. Scent pricing was approximately 3.5% in Q1, however not enough to recover the full cost increase. As communicated previously, we will work to continue -- we will continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate these increases and are confident in our ability to fully recover the dollar impact. In terms of segment profit margin, year-over-year performance was down, however our margin profit remained strong at 17.6%. Turning to the Taste business. In the first quarter 2019, currency-neutral sales grew 2% with growth in 3 or 4 regions. Performance in the quarter was driven by mid-single digit growth in Greater Asia, where India and Indonesia grew double digits and in EAME, led by strong growth in Africa, Middle East and Western Europe. In North America, year-over-year improvements continued to be led by Tastepoint. In Latin America, year-over-year declines were primarily due to weak demand from multinational customers and market conditions in Argentina and Mexico. Taste currency-neutral segment profit decreased approximately 1% as volume growth and the benefits from productivity initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable price to raw material costs and weaker mix. For Frutarom, in the first quarter, sales totaled approximately $364 million. On a stand-alone basis, Frutarom sales grew 3% against the strong year ago comparison, excluding the contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses. Sales were driven by strong growth in Taste, led by double-digit growth in North America and solid increases in Savory Solutions despite challenges in certain segments. F&F Ingredients was pressured as a result of order patterns in their CitraSource business and raw material driven price decreases in the natural colors. In terms of segment profit, Frutarom delivered $29 million and $69 million, excluding amortization. The margin profile for Frutarom in the first quarter continues to be strong at 18.7%, if you exclude amortization driven by disciplined cost management. Given the several moving parts, we wanted to give you an overview of year-over-year combined company results. In this chart, you can see from the first and second bars, $930 million from IFF and $402 million of Frutarom would represent a combined $1.33 billion top line for the company in the first quarter of 2018. In the third bar, we had approximately $23 million of divestitures related to non-core Frutarom businesses in Central Europe and the U.S., resulting in a combined first quarter 2019 sales of $1.31 billion. Of the $23 million of divestitures that we outlined, most of it was driven by the accrual business that was previously announced as a divestiture as part of the Enzymotec acquisition last year. In the fifth bar, we estimated approximately $51 million of currency headwind to bring us to a currency-neutral combined first quarter 2018 sales base of $1.26 billion. Bridging to our $1.3 billion that we reported in Q1 2019, we achieved 3% sales growth on a combined currency-neutral basis. Moving on to adjusted operating profit. If you combine the first and second bars, combined adjusted operating profit of the company would have been $237 million for the first quarter 2018. We had approximately $2 million in divestitures related to the non-core Frutarom business, I just discussed. Next is approximately $30 million related to step up amortization, following the Frutarom acquisition. This represents a combined Q1 2018 adjusted combined operating profit of $205 million. From the year we estimated approximately $7 million headwind due to currency, brings us to a currency-neutral combined first quarter of $198 million. And finally, our $205 million in operating profit for Q1 '19 resulted in approximately 3% growth on a combined company basis. And finally, in terms of adjusted EPS amortization, combining the first and second bars of $1.78 for IFF and $0.70 from Frutarom, it would have been represented -- it would have represented $2.48. On the next bar, you can see the debt issuance last year had a $0.24 impact. The share count dilution from the equity issuance going from approximately 80 million shares outstanding in the first quarter of '18 to approximately 113 million shares outstanding now creates a $0.67 per share dilution impact on a combined company basis. This drives $1.57 adjusted EPS for the combined first quarter of 2018. We then estimate approximately $0.14 of currency headwind on EPS to bridge you to a currency-neutral combined first quarter ex-amortization of $1.43. We then bridge to $1.57 that we reported in Q1 '19. We achieved approximately 10% growth on a combined company basis. Before moving onto cash flow, I'd like to take a moment to provide you greater insight with respect to our organic top line performance relative to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transaction in emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies for our impacts to the hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. We believe this is much more accurate representation of underlying performance, but it is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a true assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help put our performance in perspective relative to the competition. For the first quarter of 2019, adjusted -- adjusting our currency-neutral sales growth calculation to a basis which we believe is comparable to have our competition reports, our consolidated organic currency-neutral sales would have been 3 percentage points higher or approximately 6%. As you can see, the largest variances come from countries with significant currency devaluations versus hard currencies. In the first quarter, on a consolidated basis 4 countries, Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia represented approximately 95% of the difference in the way we report and how our competition reports. We feel this is important to highlight the difference in reporting in assessing industry performance, given the potential significant impacts that currency movements can have on top line growth rates. Turning to operating cash flows. Our cash flow for the quarter increased $58 million to $47 million in 2019 compared to negative $11 million in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase is driven by higher earnings, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization and improved working capital performance. Core working capital improved driven by continued progress in accounts payable and more favorable inventory trends. From a capital allocation standpoint, we spent approximately $58 million in CapEx or about 4.4% of sales led by a new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia, which we have disclosed in the past. Regarding cash returned to shareholders, we paid approximately $78 million or about 42% of our adjusted net income in dividend payout. As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom combination, we paused our share repurchase program as we prioritize debt repayments going forward. In the first quarter of 2019, our debt repayment was approximately $36 million. We remain committed to reaching our 3x leverage ratio by the end of 2020, down from approximately 3.6x at the end of 2018. With that, let me turn it back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich. As we look at the balance of the year, we reconfirm our full year financial guidance. We expect our sales growth to accelerate in the second half, give more favorable year-ago comparisons. In terms of profitability, we also anticipate that adjusted operating profit will improve, driven by higher integration savings, continued cost control and productivity savings and more favorable year-over-year price raw material cost trends. For the full year, we expect to deliver between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion in sales in 2019, which represents 5% to 7% combined company growth, including M&A. We also expect to deliver between $6.30 and $6.50 in adjusted EPS, excluding amortization or 8% to 11% combined company growth. In summary, we're pleased with our performance for the first quarter as we delivered strong double-digit sales and adjusted operating profit growth. We achieved solid growth across all 3 divisions, all while maintaining strong profitability levels. We continue to make strong progress in the company's transformation following the Frutarom acquisition as we combine two strong organizations. We're executing well against our integration road map. For those businesses where we have aligned our go-to-market approaches IFF, growth is very strong. We also continue to make great progress in terms of cost synergies, and I'm very confident that we will achieve our $30 million to $35 million cost-savings goal in 2019. Given this, total expected improvement in the second half of 2019 that we confirmed our financial guidance for 2019. Before I open the call up to questions, I would like to take a moment to invite everyone to our Investor Day on June 5 here in New York City. We're excited to provide an update on our long-term strategy, give you deeper insights into our integration efforts and provide each of you with an opportunity to experience the best innovation of our organization. Registration links have been sent out, but if you need it again or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations Department. With that, I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about expectations for Frutarom sales growth going forward, given some of the positives and negatives, which you outlined in the earnings release this morning. So I guess, specifically, do you anticipate your annual sales growth to improve as comparisons get easier over the balance of the year, including in 2Q? And what is the current outlook for the expectations for that business, please? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you, Mark, for the question. Yes, first of all, the first quarter was in line with our expectations. We have seen some weakness in parts of our Russian business and the F&F business, in particular with CitraSource and that's it, material price decreases with natural colors. We don't believe that this will change in the short term, but we're working on it to make it grow significantly in the future. So we expect actually a higher growth rate in the second half of the year, and that's what we project. What we have seen so far is that, in particular Taste business has very good growth with the small and mid-size customers. And the businesses we have integrated in our, let's say, Tastepoint organization or Tastepoint like organization whether it's in the U.S. or in Latin America that they are growing quite nicely. So which is good and it reinforces, let's say, our strategy to have a much more balanced customer portfolio not just with the big CPG, but with some of the smaller and mid-size companies here as well, which probably is very helpful going forward in the mid and long erm. Mark Astrachan : Okay. So mid-single digits would still be the expectations for the business? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Mark Astrachan : And then also, Rich, what was the impact from the switch from like-for-like to organic for that business? Richard O'Leary: For the first quarter, it's really -- it's in the material. I mean, we had some divestitures going out and then the two deals were small. So it was clearly immaterial for Q1. Mark Astrachan : And then expectations for the year, does that change anything in the calculus either? Richard O'Leary: No, because I mean, we had -- these were in the pipeline, so it was part of the overall guidance of 5% to 7%. So I don't think that's changed materially in terms of the components, in terms of what gets us to the full year guidance. So I think we're on track to where we thought we're going to be from an M&A standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : My first question was on Latin America. So actually, I mean, Rich, it was helpful when you pointed out the FX piece of it, but that was a total company number. So I was just curious, it does still seem like Latin America decelerated pretty significantly. Is that -- can you just talk a little bit what might be going from a market share standpoint in the release you specifically called out multinational customers? So we're just curious a little bit more about Latin America. Richard O'Leary: Yes. Look, I think that there's two -- there's couple of things. One, overall and also in Latin America specifically, growth with multinationals was basically flat, whereas the rest of the Taste business was growing high single digits or higher. So I think that's certainly big piece of it. Then we're also seeing particularly in Argentina, the effects from a macro standpoint in terms of the devaluation and what it's having in terms of consumer disposable incomes and purchase underlying demand. I think we -- the third thing that we talked about in the release was in Mexico, there has been some market changes from a legislation standpoint, that's also we're seeing some pressure from a market standpoint in terms of the consumer behaviors. Other than that, I think, there is some small -- there is some business that, I think, we did -- we lost, but it was more it was things -- business that we didn't have before, but I don't see many major shifts in market shares in LatAm. I think it's mostly the macro stuff and then just our mix of customers versus the competition. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Actually, it's a good point on the large CPGs. We don't see too much volume growth, particularly on existing business. It's not that strong. It's a bit contrary for what we heard during the CAGNY conference. So I guess, it will take a bit of time until it turns to good growth again, but we will see in the months to come. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Great. And then also I just read about the 10-Q last night, and there was a comment around that for the next several quarters lower margin and then increases in selling and admin expenses. So it sounds like then the right way to think about it might be that even with the second half sort of acceleration that you're talking about that we still have EBIT margins down probably for another, call it, two quarters and a lot of the improvement is really fourth quarter weighted. Is that fair? Richard O'Leary: I think certainly -- yes, I think that certainly second half is going to be better. I think, as we get through -- as we start -- continue to get the traction on the price increases and the price realization, which the teams have done a really good job in the scent business so far, but that's going to continue to build. That obviously has a dilutive impact. I mean, Q3, again I think we've talked about along was going to be one of the strongest quarters. Q4 sequentially is always down versus Q3, but we should -- we still expect to see year-over-year improvements in Q4. Lauren Lieberman : Got it. So Q3 you expect EBIT margins to be up or just sequentially improving? Richard O'Leary: Yes. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Up. Richard O'Leary: Up. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. Okay. So the comment in the Q is really more focused on 2Q because it does say for several quarters and that's why I was trying to adjust... Andreas Fibig : Yes. Richard O'Leary: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : I have two questions. What is the total revenue divestitures from Frutarom on an annual basis? And in the quarter, did Frutarom prices rise? And if they did, by how much? Andreas Fibig : Okay. So probably, I'd take the second one first. So there was no price increase on the Frutarom side. That's #1. And the total year, Rich... Richard O'Leary: It's about $45 million, Jeff, in total. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. John Roberts : Thanks for the currency adjusted organic sales growth numbers. I was little surprised that Natural Colors was weak. I thought that was in the area of some early revenue synergies. Could you give us some more color on that, no pun intended? Richard O'Leary: Yes. Look for me, the organic -- the volume -- actually, unit volumes are quite strong. They are quite good growth. What's happening is in one of the key raw materials the cost is coming down and similar to what we see in the other parts of the business like the vanilla, there is a pass-through component of it. So all of the decline in the color stuff is really driven by cost pass-through, and so it's impacting the top line growth. Really no significant change into our overall operating margins. So it's really -- I think we feel good about -- structurally about the health of the business and the growth opportunities. So it's more just a market dynamic around the pricing. John Roberts : And then secondly, as you've been changing your portfolio, would you guess, how much of your sales are still via a formal brief process? And how much of your sales would be with no formal brief associated with it? Richard O'Leary: I guess, for me the way I think about it, I mean, still the majority of the legacy IFF business is driven by the briefs. We still have -- there is a still piece of it, which is proactive us going to our customers within technologies. I was characterized the majority of the Frutarom business as being more of a push business, where we are contacting them on a daily, weekly basis saying here what you need, here is what we have available. So I think it's more big -- I think we have a big picture between legacy IFF is still the majority briefs driven and Frutarom is a slightly different model. Operator : Your next question comes from Heidi Vesterinen of Exane. Heidi Vesterinen : So we talked about how H2 will be a lot better than H1. Would you be able to talk about what you're seeing so far in Q2 by segment, please? Andreas Fibig : Heidi, that's -- it's Andreas. Good afternoon. It's probably a bit early right now to talk about this and to different segments. The only I might say is that we still see good growth out of the scent business because of pricing, because we're going through our [indiscernible] but for the rest, I would say, it's still a bit too early to comment. Richard O'Leary: Heidi, look, I think we're seeing, I would say, some similarities between what we saw in Q1, we had a slow start to the quarter. And I -- look, some of the things that we talked about with Savory business, the CitraSource business, we are making changes, we are addressing those issues, but they're not going to change overnight. So I think we're confident in the full year, but I would not expect the major dramatic change between Q2, Q1. Heidi Vesterinen : And on the scent business, it seems like it's been a few quarters now where most of the growth is pricing and there is minimal volume growth. What has been driving that? And what is the outlook? Richard O'Leary: Well, the pricing -- still the majority of it is pricing, but -- I mean, that's clearly the pass-through of the -- or the recapture of the input cost increases. I think we are seeing good win performance in the commercial performance in terms of new wins or near the 5-year average. So I think we've seen continue improvement, particularly in the last 2 quarters. Volume erosion was well above the historical average, more than double from what it was over a 5-year average. So I think that's again more some of that gets into the customer mix. We've seen similar trends that the growth rates in the small- and medium-sized customers are double digits and more challenged on the global. So I think the other thing we feel really good about long term is we talked about it last year, we've gotten access -- more access to new business with the core list expansions we got last year, and that's going to provide a tremendous amount of upside to us over the next 3 to 5 years. Andreas Fibig : Which is actually, let me supplement on this. These three new core list access will give us access to $400 million additional business we didn't have before, and we see out of these three new customers that already two are very active in briefing and where we're getting business and actually early and faster than we had expected. Richard O'Leary: I think the other thing, Heidi, just, I mean, to put in perspective, I mean, we're still seeing good growth -- really solid growth on volumes in the compounds business. And where we're really seeing declines are on the Ingredients business, partly between because we're prioritizing the internal consumption and partly because we're raising prices and there are certain customers out there that have more elasticity in their demand. One thing I want to just go back to your question earlier in terms of the performance during the course of the year, we'll see sequential improvement Q1, Q2, Q3 will still be down year-over-year in Q3, but it sequentially will improve through the first 3 quarters, just to clarify my earlier comment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann of Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Just on the scent division, you said already that the majority of the growth is driven by price. I would have thought that the mix in scent should be very favorable as well. Finally find Fragrance is growing very strongly, double-digit is that, but the margin is down so much. So can you just elaborate how much you're still losing to raw material cost inflation? And if there was any other factors in there -- in your cost? Richard O'Leary: Sure. I mean, keep in mind, Gunther, I mean, we -- the teams have done a really good job, but we're not fully recovered in terms of the price realization. Year-over-year, Q1 input costs were up 10%. So that's still a significant headwind. You take that plus the cumulative effect of the price realization we had last year plus the first quarter as the dilutive effect on the overall margin. So I think we are on the right track. We're confident now we're going to be able to fully recover those costs during the course of the year and into early next year, but it does have a negative impact in terms of the margins. Andreas Fibig : But in general, we're very happy with the performance of our Fine Fragrance business as you're aware we're saying we're up quite significantly and that certainly is because of the good win performance here. Richard O'Leary: And that's helped to offset -- mitigate the impact of not being able to fully recover the input cost increases in Q1. Gunther Zechmann : And on the raw material cost, just a follow-up, the 10% increase that you mentioned, is that just for scent? Or is that for the group? And also what's your outlook? How fast do you expect those costs to flatten or partly reverse like we've seen with Vanilla and a few Synthetic inputs over the course of the year? Richard O'Leary: The 10% is just scent. And so I think again for the full year, I expect input cost percent to be up high single digits and 4% to 5% on a total company basis. So the full year guidance and expectations haven't changed. I would say, it's a little early to say when and if we would see some normalization right now for the year. We're not seeing anything significant. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Michael Sison : Just curious on Frutarom's operating margin. We saw what it was in the first quarter. How do you think that improves throughout the year and maybe run rate exits the year? And then when you think about sort of that metric longer term, what do you think we should be for Frutarom in the 2021, 2022 time frame? Richard O'Leary: Look, Mike, I think it's going to -- we expect it to improve, I think, similar to what we see in the IFF business Q2, Q3 will be stronger. Q4, I still would expect it to be better than Q1. So I think we're going to see improvement, obviously growing the return to our long-term expectations from a growth standpoint of being in the 5% to 6% range versus 3%. You get the fixed cost leverage there. So I think long-term, we still see significant upside in terms of profitability. Andreas Fibig : And when the synergies role in, and that's the brunt of the synergies will come in next year and that will have a significant impact on margin, obviously. Michael Sison : Right. Okay. And then so at what point do you think operating income will grow year-over-year? Will that start in 2Q? Or is that more of a second half phenomenon for Frutarom? Richard O'Leary: I would expect we would see it in the second half. I mean, certainly, again Q3 should be the strongest quarter of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Just going back to the raw material question, Rich, and just want to be clear. So are you implying that you haven't seen the Synthetics come off yet? Or it's just because of the way the lags you have in terms of your procurement and your inventory that any decline really wouldn't be felt till the end of the year? Richard O'Leary: I think it's both. I think that #1 we have the inventory impact, but we have not seen any significant movements in the pricing for the input cost yet. So that's -- it's both of those factors. Adam Samuelson : And is that -- would you say -- I mean, are you surprised at that just given brent -- I mean, it's valid year-to-date, but off of the highs that you saw in the second half of last year and especially with better -- seems like some of your major suppliers haven't had some of the bigger disruptions again? Just are you surprised you haven't seen any of those pricing declines at all? Richard O'Leary: Look, I think there's two things. One from an oil standpoint, remember we're the derivative impact were 4 or 5 steps down the chain. So the actual oil impact has much smaller influence on it versus the conversion cost. I think the second thing is a big piece of what we've seen over the last 15 months has been more driven around supply interruptions and that's really what we continue to see issuances. I mean, it started with the BASF stuff, but I think that is equally important as it is purely just a brent pricing impact. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just separately, just in the Taste business, I mean, I know the organic growth this quarter was similar to where you were in 4Q, and this is the hardest comp, the comps are still tough. But were you -- from a demand perspective, just seems like Latin America got worse as you looked at Argentina and Mexico and some of the issues you called out there? Is there anything in any other regions that you would call out as noteworthy positively or negatively? Richard O'Leary: No. I think the biggest thing to me is what I mentioned earlier is really is the lack of growth from a global standpoint, the multinational companies, as I said earlier, growth was essentially 0, flat for the Q1 as opposed to being high single digits up for the small and midsized customers. So that's what we're seeing. I think it was more acute in Latin America for some of the things that I mentioned, as you said for Argentina and Mexico. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Jester of Citi. Daniel Jester : Just first on the synergies comments you made about hitting the run rate for the full year already. I'm just wondering what we saw 6-plus month left to go in the year, is there a reason why you're not lifting that synergy goal? And just maybe walk us through about how we should be thinking about the progression of that through the rest of the year? Andreas Fibig : The thing is that we have the most improvement on the procurement savings and the run rates are really, really strong here, but it's also driven by our inventory and that's the reason why it takes some time that it falls through the P&L. So we have the better contract in place, but we still until it hits the P&L, we have to decrease our inventory and bring new material on. That's the reason. But for us, it's -- we're optimistic because it will have a very good impact on next year already because the team is doing an extraordinary job to make that happen. That's basically the main reason. Richard O'Leary: Yes. I think it's the inventory impact is the primary driver at this point. Daniel Jester : Okay. That's very helpful. And then on Taste margins, they have been down year-over-year for a couple of quarters, I think the raw material issue seems like it's a lot more of a scent related issue. So I'm just wondering if you can talk about margins in case and how you see those progressing? Richard O'Leary: On the taste side, I think, Q1 was certainly impacted on from a mix standpoint, it was unfavorable. There was some price to input cost more timing related to, I would say, on the Vanilla side. Overall, I would expect this to see more or less in the same range. I mean, I think it's still quite healthy at the levels we're at. I mean, the margins are still quite healthy in the 24% range. So I think it's -- I don't see any major change in it. I mean, we're happy where they are. I mean, the business is performing quite well when you look at the underlying details. Operator : Your next question comes from Brett Hundley of Seaport Global. Brett Hundley : I just have two questions. My first one relates to raw materials. You guys sound pretty confident in being able to recover the inflation you've seen as you move into next year. I acknowledge this is a tough question, but just taking U.S. and China trade as a backdrop, citral, PG, a number of chemicals are on that tariff list. Can you just speak to that a little bit insofar as describing your confidence in being able to recover raw material price increases whatever they may be into next year? And then separately, my second question relates back to a comment that you made, Rich, in just talking about legacy IFF and the composition of your sales contracts or briefs rather than how they have dominated that commercial side of the business for a long time now. As MNCs revisit growth and innovation again just after years of cost cutting, I'm imagining that product technology and speed to market are going to become increasingly important just as they have been for the L&R customers out there for a while now. What does that mean for the briefing process and pricing in your view, if anything? Do you have any thoughts on that? Richard O'Leary: Let me take the first one. I mean, I think from a -- keep in mind that our U.S. basis is quite small, it's less than 25% of the totals of our sales base. So when we look at rate in the current environment, when looking at the tariff discussions and what's in the current framework. It's not a material number, I mean, it's in the $10 million to $20 million range, potentially if they weren't fully implemented then we have alternatives on how to -- where we can source it. So I don't -- we don't see it as a significant headwind in terms of overall operating model. Let me just turn over to Andreas for the second. Andreas Fibig : If I take the second part of the question on legacy sales and MNC performance, indeed what we see in our discussions is that the topics are now more growth related and growth should be simulated by innovation, which is great, because we have in IFF internally now an excellent pipeline in terms of new technologies. And as you have seen even in the first quarter, we've acquired a couple of technologies, which will help us to grow our business, which is good because I wholeheartedly believe that the competition and the differentiation works through technology, and that will help us to win more business. By the way some of these innovations or technologies we have or had in the pipeline helped us to win the 3 core list last year. So I'm very optimistic on this one going forward. Now the only thing we need the big MNCs getting their volumes up and that certainly will lift the tide here. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I just have one follow-up, which may be a little bit more long-term and strategic. So as you're managing the Frutarom business, I was just curious like this continued pace of acquisition that you currently look is going to bear out, why are you going so quickly? I would just -- and just wondering if there wouldn't be benefit in slowing that down, getting your arms fully and completely around what it is that you now own. I don't know maybe it's the competitive -- that there is a competitive landscape for these small deals and you're worried if you don't do them you will miss your window, but I [indiscernible] a lot of benefit kind of slowing that piece down while you work through understanding the portfolio you've acquired. So can you just explain why that wouldn't be the case? Why keep going at this type of pace? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Lauren, I think it's a very valid question and super important. Look, there are probably two parts of these small M&As. The one part is, let's say, strengthening the business in some of the adjacent parts of our business like the ingredients for gelato which we believe is a fantastic business, and we will demonstrate during our Investor Day. And we had already a piece of the business in Brazil and now we are having a nice platform to growth. So these small acquisitions in some of these adjacent business, you will see going forward. And they will impact the integration not so much because these are kind of stand-alone businesses who we are helping -- who will help us to grow us in terms of sales but profitability as well. The second piece and you saw it for the first quarter, actually 2 of these 4 smaller deals were technology deals, which were basically technology deals or investments in technology companies to help us to bring better innovation to our customers. One is the 3D printing, we have talked about this for quite some time, which will help us to win core list, but also win business and that's not an integration in the business sense, it's an integration in our R&D, and we believe it's the right thing to do. Aryballe on the other side brings us into the digital piece of faction and measurement. It's right now used in the first use cases in quality control. So you will see these kind of technology deals going forward, and they certainly are not a barrier or distraction for the integration of Frutarom. I hope that, that helps to put context around these deals. Richard O'Leary: And for me, Lauren, I mean, we're certainly being -- in my mind, we're being more restrictive in terms of the hurdle rates and the thresholds that we have for pursuing deals in terms of returns, in terms of strategic importance. As Andreas said, 2 of the deals were very technology driven that are fundamental to the scent business or to our delivery system platforms, which are, we believe, key strategic advantages. The other two deals were really in the pipeline already is -- prior to the acquisition. So I think -- and there is close linkage to the Frutarom businesses already. So I think we are -- I would characterize it as being quite selective already. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you very much for the participation. I hope it helped to put context around the results, and we're looking forward to see you at the Investor Meeting in June. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions]I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2019 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for our third quarter, second half and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release that we filed yesterday.Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and is on our website.With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. On the call today, I will like to provide a recap of our vision 2021, which we shared at our Investor Day the past June. After that, I will provide comments on our second quarter financial results and give an update on our integration progress. Once finished, I will ask Rich to give a more in depth financial review of our business performance and provide an update on our outlook for the balance of the year. Then we will take any questions that you may have.We are very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Thanks in large part to our industry leading innovation, both in diverse customer base and superior product portfolio. IFF has a history of strong sales growth and proven profitability. We are excited about the future as we believe that combination of IFF and Frutarom will create significant value for our customers, employees and shareholders.At our Investor Day in June, we outlined our new vision 2021 strategy. The Vision 2021 strategy has been designed to leverage our newly combined organization, our enhanced product portfolio, increased naturals position, expanded market access, broader customer base and greater innovation pipeline, all with our customer at the centre of everything we do.Our four strategic pillars include, unlocking growth opportunities, while we'll capitalize on our expanded product portfolio on a customer base, and extensive geographic presence. We also expect that cross selling and integrated solutions are relatively new capabilities set will lead to 100 million sales over the 2019 to '21 period, driving innovation while we will invest in high growth and high return platforms to continue to drive our industry leading R&D pipeline.I'm pleased to say, with the combination of IFF and Frutarom on R&D is the strongest it has been in the company's history. We have expanded R&D capabilities with cutting edge research, all carefully prioritized platforms based on future return potential.Managing the portfolio, while we will focus on optimizing our portfolio to maximize value creation, our business portfolio is much more broad and diverse with a range of growth potentials and margin profiles. To maximize value creation, we are focusing on disciplined resource allocation, where we establish clear guidelines to prioritize our investment decisions as we move forward.Accelerating business transformation, while we were successfully integrated Frutarom on delivering 145 million of synergies, but also continuing our strong productivity agenda in our legacy business for incremental 100 million in savings. And of course, culture, technology sustainability, M&A and talent all remain critical enablers to our strategy.From a long-term perspective, we're excited about where we compete. Our market potential is now approximately 50 billion with an estimated 4% total market growth rate. This is a significant increase from just one year ago, while estimated market was approximately 26.5 billion with an average growth rate of 2% to 3%.So Frutarom, we have gained broad exposure into many attractive adjacencies where growth is approximately 6% in the next five years. This additional access not only provides us with incremental market potential, but we believe growth over the mid and long-term should accelerate as needed as nearly all these adjacent markets have higher intrinsic growth rates.To ensure we capture the opportunities ahead, we are we aligning our business to take effect in 2020. Frutarom's tastes and flavor solutions were transitioned under our legacy taste business unit. We are also adding Frutarom's inclusions business, which comprises Taura, Inventive and Leagel, our ice cream ingredients business into legacy taste. The remaining parts of Frutarom will be grouped into a new nutrition and ingredients division. This high growth high, margin business will include Frutarom's natural product solutions, as well as the flavor ingredients business. At the business unit level, we are focused on prioritize our strategy to ensure we capture future growth potential.Within scent we serve customers across a wide spectrum of scientists. However, the bulk of our market is composed of multinational companies who work via co-lists. We recently won a new co-list access, providing us with the opportunity to compete for 450 million of market potential we previously didn't have access to. This was a significant opportunity for growth. And as such, we are focused on capitalizing on our new access with maintaining strong improvements with regional and local customers.Our go forward goal in scent is to drive value creations with disciplined portfolio management, investing in high margin businesses and fixing profitability in categories that have been disproportionately impacted by higher raw material cost. In addition, we've identified and executed on opportunities to streamline our organization within the scent business unit, which is already contributing approximately 4 million of savings through the first half of 2019.In taste, the focus on effectively integrating the Frutarom businesses and our go to market approaches by expanding our case point model to ensure we serve and capture opportunities with faster growing small and mid-sized customers in other key markets around the world. We are also targeting higher growth geographies, for example, Africa and the Middle East and enhancing our portfolio by expanding savory solution and inclusions globally.In nutrition and ingredients, it's all about geographic expansion, focusing on differentiating natural and clean label technologies and targeting value enhancing acquisitions. The majority of the categories within the division natural health ingredients, natural food protection and natural colors all have strong future growth potential. And we are focused on increasing our scale to disproportional growth at accelerated rates.At the core, we anticipate that based on encouraging natural growth to be approximately 3% to 5%. Then we believe that we have incremental opportunities to long-term to add an additional percentage point for cross selling and integrated solutions, as well as another percentage points for acquisitions. The net result is that we expect overall currency neutral sales growth to average 5% to 7% over the next three years.Taking a step back, we now have the broadest and deepest portfolio of businesses in our long history, one that provides a variety of investment options. To maximize value creation, we have established portfolio roles and clear guidelines to prioritize our investment decisions. There are three approaches to managing our portfolio growth, where we will accelerate margin accretive categories through incremental investments, such as fine fragrance and cosmetic active ingredients.Balanced, while we'll self fund investments to maintain gross margin cash flow and fix. But we will have limited investments until margin goals achieve targeted levels or we de-prioritize. An example of this is creative marketing, while we have de-prioritized our approach given the margin profile or the businesses we exited earlier this year. As you can see, we have categories in all of these three portfolio certifications. These certifications will streamline our category management, and fine tune our strategic efforts to ensure we grow sales and also improve our margins.We have strong programs in place to drive profitability. From 2019 to '21, we expect margin improvements to be driven by our portfolio optimization strategy and 145 million of integration savings from the Frutarom transaction. As discussed, portfolio optimization is expected to profit as margin, management, pricing, cost leverage and selective pooling of our low margin and non strategic sales will drive overall margin expansion.Within our planned integration synergies from the Frutarom acquisitions, we are rationalizing and harmonizing our procurement activities via leverage spent and make versus volume. We are also optimizing the global footprint as we expect approximately 35 sites globally to be optimized, which will generate additional efficiencies. The last piece is streamlining our overhead expense, which is intended to reduce non-strategic costs and eliminating redundant expense expenses. We are highly confident in our ability to achieve on 145 million in cost savings target at the end of 2021.In addition to our integration synergies, we expect approximately 100 million savings and additional productivity programs. Beyond margin expansion these industries are key in a journey to fundamentally transform how we operate, focusing on process improvements, simplifications and centralization. This will provide flexibility to drive bottom line is results and reinvest in our growth engines.Our long-term financial objectives are clear. This includes total shareholder return on drivers of 5% to 7% currency neutral gross, margin expansion to be less than three times net debt to EBITDA in 18 to 24 months, 10% plus adjust EPS growth, excluding amortization and approximately 2% dividend yield. Our vision 2021 strategy is focused on discipline execution and integration. We remain steadfast in our approach and belief in the long-term value equation for all of our stakeholders.Turning now to the second quarter, year-over-year results on a consolidated basis were strong, including the contribution of Frutarom. Reported sales increased 40% with the largest driver being the contribution of additional sales related to Frutarom. As communicated at our June Investor Day, currency neutral performance on a combined base was soft due to significant volume erosion with multinational customers within taste and a continued pressure within Frutarom driven by decline in F&F ingredients, notably citrus source, natural colors, pricing, parts of savory solutions and trade and marketing, While Rich will go into details in a moment, I feel it's important to highlight several strong performances within the quarter to ensure we do not lose sight of the progress we're making.In scent we delivered mid single digit sales growth with growth in all categories and doubled digit adjusted segment profit growth rose on a currency neutral basis. Within the rest of the business, several of the high growth categories continue to have solid performances led by beverage and savory and taste, natural food protection, gelato, the ice cream ingredients business and algae in Frutarom. In addition, the businesses we have acquired since the beginning of the year, Mighty, Leagel, and Wiberg Canada are all growing at or above our expectations.From a profitability perspective, we are also pleased that adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization improved 80 bps, year-over-year driven by productivity initiatives and acquisitions related synergies, a market acceleration as opposed to our first quarter performance. I'm pleased to report that our integration efforts are well underway. We're making excellent progress. Those businesses where we have aligned our go to market approach with IFF growth was strong, increasing high single digits.In terms of cross selling and integrated solutions, we have already achieved 8 million in run rate sales. Longer term, we believe that we can deliver at least 100 million of top line sales by 2021. We are leveraging the compelling combination of R&D technologies and capabilities of both organizations. As stated many times, innovation drives differentiation and is critical for long- term success. I'm pleased with the progress the team is making and as they strengthen our product offering to our customers.Turning to cost synergies, we've made strong advancements year-to- date, as we have achieved approximately 15 million in the first half of 2019, based on our progress to date and our expectation in savings benefit to accelerate throughout the year. We're now forecasting that we will achieve approximately 40 million in cost savings in 2019 up from our previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million. In terms of debt repayment and cash flow, our operating cash flow was up 130 million in the first half of 2019 compared to the previous year period and we repaid 47 million in the first half of 2019.With that I would like to turn the call over to Rich. Richard O'Leary: Thank you, Andreas. In the second quarter we delivered quarterly sales of approximately 1.3 billion. On a combined basis currency neutral sales grew 1% driven by acquisitions and strong growth in scent. We also maintained strong profitability levels led by productivity initiatives, acquisition related synergies and favorable price versus input costs.This combined with the addition of Frutarom led to a very strong 29% increase over the prior year period and adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization improved 80 basis points year-over-year.Our financial results were in line with my comments at our Investor Day, when I said we would be between 1% to 3% depending upon how June progressed. And while we did not finish as strong as we had would have liked in terms of sales, we did a good job delivering overall profitability in line with our expectations.From a cash flow projective perspective, we had significant year-over-year increases in operating cash flow and free cash flow driven primarily by higher earnings and amortization. As we've done previously I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare with our peers.As a reminder for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in US dollars or other hard currencies for our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When recording our currency neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange related price changes in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers.We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a true assessment of underlying currency neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the US dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition.During the second quarter and first half of 2019, the stronger US dollar environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2% currency impact of growth if we included emerging market pricing. This is essentially driven by large the evaluations in three countries, which represent less than 10% of our consolidated scent and taste sales.Turning to business unit performance, in scent second quarter currency neutral sales grew 4% against a solid year ago comp a 5% with growth in nearly all regions and categories. Performance was strongest in fragrance ingredients and consumer fragrances, both increasing mid single digits. Consumer fragrances was led by high single digit growth in home care and fabric care. Fine fragrance also grew low single digits following a double digit performance in Q1, led by strong new wins, particularly in EAME.But should be noted that raw material driven pricing increases represented approximately 4% in the second quarter on a consolidated basis, with the strongest increases in fragrance ingredients. In fragrance compounds, the composition of growth was balanced, with equal contribution between volume and price. Same currency initial segment profit increased 19% benefiting from cost and productivity initiatives and more favorable price to input costs.We believe that this was due to the timing of raw materials between the inventory and our P&L as we continue to see year-over-year increases in our purchases. Raw material costs remain elevated significantly above historical levels and we will continue to work with our customers on actions to mitigate these increases. In terms of segment profit margin, year-over-year performance was up approximately 200 basis points to 19.2%.In taste, second quarter currency neutral sales decreased approximately 1% against the strong growth of 6% in the year ago period. Growth was strongest in Greater Asia with year-over-year improvements in China, India, and the ASEAN region. We also post the growth in EAME led by strong performance in Africa and Middle East. In Latin America and North America, volume origins with multinational customers were significant and intensified throughout the quarter.When comparing to historical averages, our volume erosion rate in the second quarter was approximately three times our historical average. Taste currency neutral segment profit was adversely impacted by volume declines, unfavorable price, the material costs and a week or mix. Nevertheless, segment profit margins will remain best in class amongst our industry peers.For Frutarom in the second quarter sales totaled approximately 382 million. On a standalone basis for Frutarom sales were flat, driven by the contribution of acquisitions. Excluding the contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, Frutarom sales declined low single digits or 4%. Similar to what we communicate at our Investor Day, results were primarily driven by decline in F&F ingredients, most notably citrus source where one of our competitors are no longer purchasing from us, as well as well as raw material driven price decreases in natural colors and weaknesses in savory solutions related to weather conditions in Europe and Canada, and trade and marketing, where we are the de-prioritizing.While all of these are very similar to what we have discussed previously, it is worth noting that Frutarom's taste volumes decelerated throughout the second quarter driven by weakness in the UK and Ireland. In terms of segment profit, the Frutarom delivered $37 million and $77 million in profit excluding amortization. The margin profile for Frutarom in the second quarter continues to be strong at a robust 20.1% if you exclude amortization. This has been driven by acquisition related synergies and continued cross discipline.For the first half of 2019, we have delivered 15 million in integration synergies. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are now expecting to achieve approximately 40 million in cost synergies in 2019, up from our previous estimate of 30 million to 35 million driven predominantly by procurement optimization. In addition, we continue to deliver on our core productivity program, where we drive process improvement simplification and centralization. On a year-to- date basis, we've achieved approximately 25 million of core productivity savings in the first half of 2019. Together we delivered approximately $40 million in year-over-year savings are about 19% expressed in terms of operating profit growth on a combined basis.Operating cash flow in the first half of 2019 was up significantly from 55 million last year to 185 million this year. Performance was driven by higher earnings and amortization. Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payable, improved modestly driven by receivables and payables. Inventories continued to remain at elevated levels, primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the scent division. Expected inventories will begin to improve in the second half for the year.In the first half CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6% driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia, as well as creative centers and integration related investments. For the full year we continue to believe that CapEx as a percentage of sales will be between 4.5% to 5%. Bringing all this together, we had a strong $78 million increase in free cash flow in the first half of 2019.A key component or overall TSR algorithm for our shareholders is a competitive and attractive dividend yield. We believe that the 2% threshold is an important one that broadens our potential shareholder base. Together and today we are pleased to announce we have authorized 30% increase in our quarterly dividend executing on our long-term strategy and our strong financial position and should be noted that this marks the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases.Considering our year-to-date performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our full year sales and adjusted EPS excluding amortization guidance. For the full year we now expect to deliver between 5.15 billion and 5.25 billion in sales in 2019 as we're approaching the low end of our original guidance of 5.2 billion to 5.3 billion. On a combined basis and excluding the impact of currency, growth is expected to be 3% to 5%.The forecast now reflects low versus mid single digit growth for Frutarom driven by three areas, F&F ingredients, savory solutions and trade and marketing. Within F&F ingredients, citrus source is the primary contributor of the decline as one of our large competitors has significantly reduced his purchases. We are shifting our focus of this business to mid versus high to drive value creation. In savory solutions, performance was impacted by first half weakness, as well as a modestly revised second half outlook related to reductions in volume. We also will de-prioritize trade and marketing based on our strategic category management approach.From a taste perspective, continued multinational volume erosion in Latin America and North America has lowered our expectation. It should be noted that we do not expect the second half to be strong in the first half. But taste performance in the third quarter will be challenged by a strong prior year comp. We now expect adjusted EPS excluding amortization to be 615 to 635 and I will go through the changes in a moment. On a combined basis and excluding the impact of currency, adjusted EPS excluding amortization is expected to be 6% to 9%.To provide additional detail related to the adjusted EPS ex amortization change, I would like to walk you through the drivers. Our original guidance was 630 to 650. In the second bar, I highlight the $0.10 impact related to the change in top line expectation, which is essentially $15 million in sales at low margins given the impacted businesses like trade and marketing, citrus source and PTI. Mitigating this is the incremental 5 million in integration savings that we announced earlier today. Combining the two, the net operational impact is a reduction of approximately $0.05 to our adjusted EPS excluding amortization.The larger impact on adjusted EPS excluding amortization is related to a change in the average effective tax rate on the amortization of intangible assets, as well as the small changes in redeemable non-controlling interest. The net impact of these combined is approximately $0.10. In the end, our revised guidance for adjusted EPS excluding amortization is now 615 to 635.With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich. In summary, we believe we have the framework to achieve our long-term ambitions with our 2021 strategy, which is focused on disciplined execution and integration. With that context, we have a long-term commitment to 12% total shareholder return which is expected to be driven by about 10% EPS growth and a 2% dividend yield. In the second quarter we achieved broad based improvement in sales, margin and cash flow. For the full year we believe we can deliver solid operational results. We're taking actions of strengthen to the overall growth profile of our business, as well as ensuring we capture synergies to generate strong margins and returns for our shareholders. Expressing our confidence in our long-term strategy and future prospects, we also raised our dividend, the 10th yearly consecutive increase.With that operator, we are now happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everybody. Andreas Fibig : Good morning, Mark. Mark Astrachan : I guess it's done on Frutarom not really sure where to begin, but maybe starting, how confident are you, there won't be further discoveries at Frutarom related to the alleged bribery negatively impacting sales in other geographies or any sort of things that you can find from an accounting standpoint or anything else. And do you know of or anticipate any US authority to investigate the goings on there at this point? Andreas Fibig : Mark, thank you for the question, I'll take it. And given that we have done compliance disclosure here. I'll take a moment to reiterate what we have said in our former disclosure. During the integration of Frutarom, we were made aware of allegations that two Frutarom businesses operating principally in Russia and Ukraine made certain improper payments, including two representatives of a number of customers. So we promptly commenced investigations. We have a very robust program in place here in particular when we take over companies. So that's very clear and it's clear SOP on our side, we have notified relevant US regulatory authorities and relevant Israeli regulatory authorities. So I think that's good and done. We have not uncovered any evidence suggesting that payments had any connections to the US. Based to the information we have, we believe that these improper payments are no longer being made. The estimated affected sales represents less than 1% of combined pro-forma net sales for 2018.So we do not believe the impact from these methods is or will be material to our results of operations or financial conditions. I believe that's a super important point as well. We've taken or we'll take appropriate remedial actions with respect to the matters I have described. And I want to assure you that we have committed to the highest standards of ethics and compliance and have strict compliance policies in place. Although, investigation are continuing, based on the results to date and other compliance related integration activities. We are not currently where similar instances of this conduct in any other geographies. So I would say all in all, we stick to what we have said in our disclosure, we feel very comfortable that we have a good handle on it. And I'm actually very proud about the program we are running here and how all the teams are working together to get these things done in the appropriate manner. Mark Astrachan : Okay, staying with Frutarom, I guess your organic sales decline was much worse than was expected, I think including your own expectations. So what gives confidence that can get back to growth in the second half of the year apps and easier comparisons and what is a reasonable long-term growth rate for the business going forward? And I just wanted to follow up on the first question, just so how confident are you that there's not going to be another stone unturned that that finds something else that you're not anticipating at this point? I mean, how thorough has the investigation been by the board and the committees? Andreas Fibig : Yeah, sure. I think Mark that's a fair question. Principally, despite that investigation, nothing has changed since our Investor Day because we feel very good about our strategy. We see also that the portfolio of the acquisition is helping us in terms of getting exposure to some of the higher growth areas like the health ingredients or natural food protection, which is even shown in the second quarter or the inclusion business as well. So portfolio wise, we are very happy. What we do certainly is that we prioritize our portfolio as we said, we are trying to maximize returns and we are de-emphasizing the marketing and trade business for example, because there's not a lot of profitability in and that obviously shows. We are very, let's say clear and happy about the customer portfolio. We haven't lost too many customers here and I think still, we believe that some of the small and midsized customers have good growth rates and that will help us with the business. The portfolio is proving to towards naturals and that's a trend which is not changing through that event.Talking about the integration, I believe what is important to see here is that in general, despite the compliance topic we just talked about, we are very happy with what is happening during the integration because you see it on the cost synergies, everything in terms of integration whether it's North America, Latin America, Asia or Europe is working as planned. We see that we get more cost synergies and Rich just mentioned that in his presentation, all of them we saw then that's predominantly driven by procurement, which is good news because first of all, it has no impact on our employees and no impact on our customers as well. So that's an important one. On the sales side, certainly, the second quarter was softer than I would like to have it. But we will see that this will turn around in the second half as we've said during the Investor Day as well. And we believe a mid single digit growth rate for the business is very doable. In particular, if we emphasize the strong parts and the high growth parts of portfolio.Having said this, we have now a real good team in place for the cross selling synergies. You will hear more about this over the next couple of calls. We haven't seen too much of a result, it's Rich just mentioned the 8 million, but there's certainly more to come and actually very exciting opportunities for us to cross sell the portfolios to the different customer groups on both sides of the business. Having said this, I would like to mention as well that we have seen now a nice turnaround on the scent business side that has not too much to do with Frutarom, just a smaller part of it. But we see that we're turning around despite the crisis we had with raw materials in the last year, Nicholas's business is going in the right direction, growth wise as well. So we're very optimistic on this front as well. And you know that was a bit of a trigger in the last year as well. And the turnaround is pretty strong year. So that's how I would guess like characterize where we stand in terms of the Frutarom business, but making a remark on the total portfolio as well. Richard O'Leary: Andreas, may be just \u2013 Mark a couple of quick comments on my part. I mean, I reiterate what Andreas said, I think we feel strongly in the ability of the Frutarom business to grow mid single digits, mid to long term, I think we're still going to some of the challenges that we've seen for the last three quarters like citrus source and trade and marketing and the savory business are not going to correct overnight. I think we would expect to see low single digit growth for Frutarom ex M&A in the second half of this year. But we're not going to get \u2013 I think it doesn't change our long-term perspectives, in terms of the potential of the business. Andreas Fibig : What we see and I might add this, but it's more mid to long-term markets, on the R&D technologies, we have very optimistic what that can deliver for us going forward, but that takes bit of more time to realize. Mark Astrachan : Okay. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey guys. I guess the two \u2013 Andreas Fibig : Mike, good morning. Mike Sison : Good morning, two quick ones, I think in the \u2013 your compliance commentary mentioned that there were some senior management that Frutarom involved are they still around? How have you sort of changed that dynamic culturally and then as a quick follow up, what are you looking for, for Frutarom in the second half of the year in terms of either constant currency growth, it was down 4% you mentioned in 2Q and maybe just kind of thoughts on profitability. I think you said operating margins ex amortization was still pretty healthy, do you expect it to stay at that levels in the second half of the year? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Okay. Let me let me take the compliance piece first. We have taken very remedial actions on the involved people. The good thing is it is very contained to geographically, so that that makes it makes it easier for us to act on that. Culturally, we have started with actually day one and all of our town hall meetings in the new company, as we usually do when we take over companies that we educate people on the compliance codes, on the code of conduct. Everybody is going through the sort of training whether it's a live training or training via their computers. So we feel good about this. And this is coming actually nicely together. This is an unfortunate event, but as I said, it's geographically very limited. And then I hand over to Rich on the margin question. Richard O'Leary: Yeah, so my two things, one on your question on the second half, I just want to clarify the answer I gave the Mark. Frutarom, second half of the year, I think it's low single digits on a two year average basis. Given the week Q3 last year for Frutarom, it will be a stronger Q3 versus Q4. In terms of in terms of margins, I think we had a very strong quarter, Q2 despite the challenges from the top-line standpoint. You heard the comments I made regarding the very strong quarter and margin performance for scent. I think some of that, as I said in my comments were timing and so I don't expect that. I think this Q3 and Q4 will be a bit more pressure on the scent side in terms of margins with input costs remaining elevated, the teams have done a very good job in terms of mitigating that, in fact, they did the price realization, but there is timing in terms of inventory when the raw materials flow through the P&L. And then when you get to Q4 obviously, there's a bit of seasonality where our margin profiles in Q4 are generally the weakest of the full year. So I would expect the second half to be modestly below where we were in the first half of this year. Operator : Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Andreas Fibig : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : So first just on the compliance question, can you detail how long were the alleged payments actually happening? And specifically, you've cited in the last couple quarters of some sales declines in the savory business and through in Eastern Europe. Is there any nexus or common customer overlap between those, just want to be clear on that point? And then secondly, on the taste business, maybe just a little bit more color on the volume declines that you're seeing in the Americas in the second quarter and the first half of the year, they seem to be a bit darker than what we would see from the food and beverage companies. So just a little bit more color, perhaps by category or kind of where you're seeing the greatest pressure is? Thank you. Richard O'Leary: So let me start with the last one in terms of the volume side of it. As I've said in the comments, and I think Andreas said also, I mean, what we're seeing on the taste side is significant volume erosion on the existing business. Again, if you look at our fundamentals, we don't believe we're losing share, when you look it up on the pricing, adjusted volume growth or total top line growth in on a two year basis for the first half of the year, we're very much in line with competition, so we have confidence that we're not losing share. We are seeing significant volume erosion on existing business. Our win rates remain good for both businesses, pretty much at five year averages, so we're not seeing any erosion in the business. We've talked about in the past that we see significant upside going forward on the scent business in terms of access to new business.So we believe is very much a volume erosion piece where Q2 was much worse than what we saw in Q1. It's one of those things that I've seen. These trends occur over time and it's hard to predict when those things sort of return to the norm. And it can vary from their underlying product mix and the categories where we operate with a particular customer, their supply chain, so it's hard to predict, but I don't see this as being a long-term trend. As I said in my comments related to the Frutarom piece, it was primarily an issue in Europe. Again, it was quite strong with mid to low single digit growth in the EAME taste business for Frutarom through the end of May and then it was a very disappointing and challenging June which drove the declines that was a bit unexpected from where we felt we were going to be. From a compliance standpoint, based on what we've seen through the investigation, they may have been occurring for a few years. But we there's never been indication that there are material amount in any particular year. Andreas Fibig : Maybe I add to the first point Rich made, if I look at our taste business, we had, in particular in '18, very, very strong growth in the first and the second quarter, 6% each. So it's strong comparables. And we can say that in the third quarter, we have had to slightly better start into the third quarter, for the taste and for the Frutarom. I think that's important. Richard O'Leary: And yeah, last question, which I forgot Adam was, in terms of customer overlap it's pretty negligible customer overlap, particularly in this business. Operator : Our next question will come from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Heidi Vesterinen : Hi, good afternoon. So if we step back and think about your performance over the past year, we've seen that you've tended to underperform on your top-line targets and once again this year despite help from a 53rd [indiscernible] and strong pricing in response to exceptional inflation, you're still below targets in terms of organic growth. So can you help us understand what you're doing internally both on the legacy IFF side and the Frutarom side to get back on track? You think maybe some more radical changes might be needed, may it be in terms of investment or personnel or so on to ensure that you can get back to your long-term targets? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : So Heidi, that's a good \u2013 it's a good point, because I would say all the other parameters and KPIs are going actually pretty well. And we focus a lot on the top-line growth and for me or actually for us as a management team, the recipe is very, very clear. What we need is we have to focus our activities on the most driving parts of the portfolio where we have now a much better portfolio than we had before. So we have a couple of let's say areas, which might be small at the moment, but still from the market perspective, really nice growth for us, like the inclusions, like the health ingredients or natural foods or even the active cosmetic. So we believe that's the first one. The second thing is, where we have to look in is, our customer structure. And here we have to drive through and particularly on the taste side, with some of the smaller and midsized customers. Here certainly the acquisition helps a lot. We take the blueprint we have from our Tastepoint. We will drive it through. We have now integrated the Frutarom taste business into Tastepoint already in the US.And actually in that regard, if I can give the detail, we have a double digit growth on this side. It's a very nice growth of the business, so we like that a lot. The next thing is on the scent side, because I don't want to shortchange us too much, but we have no access to more our co-lists, our most important customers. And I know that there are a lot of activities are ongoing. And you know, these are all big customers it takes let's say nine to 12 to 15 months to really capitalize on it. But we see strong interest, we see strong first let's say wins on our side. And that will help us to let's say accelerate the top-line side on the scent business as well. On top of it and that's what's in the works and we will report on this is the cross selling aspect. We have now moved the leader of our bigger key accounts from the taste business into the role of being the head of cross selling and total solutions business. He is building a small, but very, let's say powerful and nimble organization to facilitate the cross selling between the two organizations. And we believe that can deliver very nicely on our top-line growth. So if I add this all together, I think we can come back to the good growth rate we have outlined the 5% to 7%. We believe it's very, very doable. And the first, let's say \u2013 initial, let's say, signs we see are going in the right direction. Operator : Our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Hi, guys. I just wanted to put some numbers to what's going on in the taste with the 3x erosion, so is it like, normally you see 10% to 15% of product discontinued in any given year by taste customers. And normally they replace that, but now you're seeing something like 30% to 45% kind of discontinued older products and even though you're having the new wins, they're not launching the new products at an offsetting rate here, is that the dynamic that we're talking about? Richard O'Leary: John, put it in perspective, I mean, on a five year trend volume on existing businesses slightly negative, so call it low single digits and is down 1%. For the last \u2013 and now at the current rates particularly in Q2, we're in a mid single digit range. So that's by far the single biggest driver. I mean, as I said earlier, our win rates are in line with long-term five year trends. Pricing is slightly positive a little bit below the five year average, but part of that's been driven by what we've seen over the last three years with vanilla. So I would not say it \u2013 fundamentally, it's all the volume erosion on existing business. Some of it may be driven by shorter cycle times, but that's the fundamental driver in terms of the biggest change in the last two quarters. Operator : Our next question will come from Alexandra Thrum with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Alexandra Thrum : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on margins, in both the scent and taste division you've sort of explained what's happening in the top-line dynamics, but when I look at taste, could you break up how much that margin decline is driven by volume versus \u2013 also the pricing versus growth. And then on the flip side is margin development has expanded quite decently. I expect because the managed the pricing in scent, but could you please break down that margin expansion both between pricing versus growth and volume? Richard O'Leary: Sure, Alexandra. I mean, in terms of taste, I mean, the pricing impact was pretty negligible. And the biggest driver for taste is on the input costs in terms of it's more of a mix issue. I mean, I think our overall view in terms of mix of consumption as opposed to mix a product, I think that's a smaller impact from a mix standpoint. But as similar to what we've seen on the taste side as we consume individual lots or product by product, we can have some fluctuation there. So the biggest driver into the margin pressures in taste is, one, the input costs and two, is the lower volumes hurting us from an absorption standpoint. From a taste standpoint, you heard in the comments that pricing is a bigger driver from a taste standpoint, certainly on the scent standpoint, certainly on the ingredient side, but also in the compounds.As I said earlier in my comments and teams have done a very good job of aggressively pursuing price realization to offset that. And I said earlier, we had \u2013 why we call it a unique situation in Q2, where we had mix of consumption of raw materials, which drove a favorable margin progression in Q2, which I don't expect to repeat in the second half of the this year for scent. So that's why I said earlier, I would expect margin profiles in scent to come down from where they were in Q2, given the mix of raw materials. We still are seeing elevated prices from scent. They're at near all time highs. I think we've seen that the rate of increase has slowed. So I think that's starting to be a positive trend, but we don't expect to see any relief in the near term from a input cost standpoint. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks. Thanks very much. Can you talk about the change in global expenses from the first quarter to the second? I think you went from about 19 million to 13 million. And then to go back to 13 million sequential decrease in cost of goods sold. I would think maybe 3 million is from volume and maybe there's 2 million or 3 million from Frutarom. But I take it there are some hedging gains in there. And can you describe what went on from a raw material standpoint a little bit more precisely, if you don't mind? Richard O'Leary: Sure, Jeff. So from a corporate expensive standpoint, the single biggest driver is the cash flow hedging as you said, it's about a $5 million impact. And so that's the biggest driver as you said, it also impacts COGS. I think, clearly the volume impact is further reasoned in terms of $15 million impact. I think the other thing that keep in mind, as I said earlier, we did have I'm going to call it a mix impact in terms of scent, in terms of the raw material consumption, as it flowed through from finished goods and raw materials into COGS. So there's a timing impact there. I think those are the biggest drivers. In terms of the sequential performance, from an overall perspective we still expect to see mid single digit inflation from a raw material standpoint for the full year. But that's in line with what we've seen our expectations from the beginning of the year. And as I said just a moment ago, I think starting to see some slow down in terms of the rate of the increase, but we're still at very elevated levels. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brett Hundley with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Brett Hundley : Hey, thank you. Good morning, guys. Rich, I just have one detailish type question for you. So if I go to the change in EPS guide for the year. I wanted to focus in on the change in non-controlling interest piece and just ask you whether is that related to like the carrying value of those fruit subs dropping below the redemption value? Is it due to a changeover to consolidated status away from non-consolidated status because I will admit your other income line in Q2 was less of a benefit than I thought it would be relative to Q1. So sorry for the detailish type question, but just wanted to understand that better. Richard O'Leary: No, look, I mean, I think \u2013 so you added that $0.10 \u2013 I'd say probably $0.06 to $0.07 of that is the change in the average effective tax rate on the amortization, so that one's clear. On the non-controlling interest, it's really a mark-to-market adjustment that we have to monitor and adjust each quarter based on the results and the outlook for the individual entities in which the minority interest had \u2013 there is a redeemable component of the minority interest. So it's based on the underlying performance and the projection is for those businesses and so there's been a slight change between where we were at the beginning of the year and based on latest projections. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. So I'll turn it back to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yeah, thank you very much for participating. I think it was an important call with a couple of really important messages we wanted to make and we are now basically happy to take all the one on ones we want to do and give you more explanation around some of outcome of the businesses. So thank you very much and talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2019 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR Web site at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release all of which are on our Web site.Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and is on our Web site.With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rich O'Leary. We'll start with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Michael.On the call today, I would like to provide comments on our third quarter financial results and give an update on our integration progress. Once finished, I will ask Rich to give a more in-depth financial review of our business performance and provide an update on our outlook for the balance of the year. Then, we will take any questions that you may have.Let me start by saying that positive momentum is building at IFF. In the third quarter, we delivered a sequential improvement in our combined currency neutral top-line growth rate. Scent continued to perform well, growing low digits disclosed in all regions and nearly all categories.On a standalone basis, Frutarom sales increased 5% including the net contribution of activations and divested businesses. Organically, tastes were flat in the third quarter, a sequential improvement from the second quarter results with an improvement across many subcategories.In taste, our win rates remain at a high level, however, performance continued to be impacted by volume erosion primarily with multinational customers. It should be noted that on a two-year basis, growth remain solid when we factor in the 7% growth we achieved in the year ago period.We are pleased to also report a continued improvement in profitability as we drove a 60 basis point improvement and adjusted operating profit margin ex-amortization as we deliver productivity savings in our core business and benefits from an acquisition-related synergies. Our integration efforts, Frutarom are progressing well. Cost synergies continued to be a source of strength as we achieved approximately $30 million for the first nine months of 2019 and now expect to deliver approximately $50 million for the year significantly ahead of all $40 million estimate that we announced last quarter.We also substantially completed our review of the Russia and Ukraine allegations as well as a second aerial view of Frutarom operations in certain other jurisdictions including those that we deem as high-risk. These reviews supplement our prior global compliance and initiatives that we've conducted subsequent to the closing of the Frutarom transaction. While I will speak in more detail in a moment, I want to state that we have confirmed in this investigation the total affected sales represents less than 1% of IFF and Frutarom combined net sales for 2018. And that the impact of the reviews including the cost associated with them to-date have not been and are not anticipated to be material to IFF's financial conditions or results of operations.In addition no evidence has been uncovered suggesting that any of these compliance methods had any connections to the United States.Finally, as we look to the fourth quarter, we have started strong as all three segments grew mid single digits in October as a continuation of this trend, we believe our full year 2019 sales and adjusted EPS excluding amortization will finish in line at the low-end of our previously stated guidance range.As I reflect on the year in entirety and ignores that many moving parts both good and bad that have occurred, I am pleased to say that we are on pace to deliver solid top and bottom-line results. On a combined company and currency neutral basis, a testament of our industry, our exceptional business and unbelievable employees that make it happen. And as we build it stronger more competitive organization for the future 2019 provides the foundation grounded in resilience that gives us confidence and optimism for a journey ahead.Now circling back to our third quarter 2019 financial performance, we delivered broad based improvements in sales profitability and cash flow. Our sales totaled approximately $1.3 billion, one of our highest in company history, on a combined basis, we saw a sequential acceleration in currency neutral sales growth as we grew 2% driven by activation and our scent performance. An absolute value, the additional Frutarom provided a very strong benefit to currency neutral adjusted operating profit excluding amortization, which increased 45% over the prior year period. This combined with margin improvement initiatives in acquisition synergies led to a 60 basis point expansion in just operating profit margin excluding amortization.The net result was a benefit to cash flow generation where we achieved improvements in both operating and free cash flow.Our integration efforts are well [Technical Difficulty] to deliver against our plan. We are currently strengthening our go-to-market approach with the expansion of our taste point model in key markets around the world as a blueprint for success. Our intent is to continue to serve the fast growing local and regional customers with a differentiated service model built on speed and agility to help them win in their marketplace.In terms of cross-selling and integrated solutions they have already achieved approximately 14 million run rate sales and have identified greater than 800 projects in the pipeline representing approximately 110 million of sales. And while we are on track to deliver our stated target of 100 million by 2021, we expect that this number will only increase over time as we capitalize on our innovation pipeline, broad category exposure and vast customer base.We continue to strive towards our ultimate operating model of scent, taste and nutrition and ingredients which will define organization moving forward. Talent and culture within the organization remains paramount as we execute our talent agenda to enhance our high performing corporate culture with extreme accountability, bias for action and effective collaboration.We also continue to deliver strong cost synergies achieving 30 million through the first nine months based on our progress to-date and our expectation that savings benefits will continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter, we are now forecasting that we will achieve approximately 50 million in cost synergies in the year 2019. In terms of cash flow, our operating cash flow was strong up 181 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the previous year period.We also improved our net debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.6x in the second quarter to 3.4x. As a reminder, debt repayment continues to be our number one priority in our capital allocation as we progress towards our net debt to EBITDA target of below 3x by the end of 2020.As I just mentioned, we are further increasing our year one cost synergy target to approximately 50 million. With this, we are not expecting to deliver greater than 60% higher synergies in 2019 against our initial target of $30 million to $35 million. In the areas were we are focusing on our cost energy efforts. We continue to see significant progress against our goals. We are meaningful outpacing our original procurement savings target driven by purchasing power, [indiscernible] and tail spent.We also have completed the closure of five plants and announced an additional eleven closures via our manufacturing network optimization program. Expanding our focus, we are driving operations, excellence initiatives to generate incremental savings. Some examples include logistics and packaging synergies which will benefit all of our segments.Assessing what we are today, our team has done a very good work generating incremental savings. Looking at our one 145 million goal, I believe we are on track to over deliver upon this target further supporting the business and driving value for our shareholders.As a follow-up to our complaints disclosure in the second quarter, I want to take a few moments to provide a more formal update. That's a reminder as disclosed last quarter during integration of Frutarom, we were made aware of allegation that two Frutarom businesses operating principally in Russia and Ukraine made certain improper payments to a number of customers. We are pleased to report that we have now substantially completed a robust review for the Russia and Ukraine allegations, we have substantiated the allegations and have confirmed that key members of Frutarom senior management at the time were aware of such payments.As a result, we have taken appropriate remedial actions including replacing senior management in relevant locations and believe that such improper customer payments have stopped. We have also conducted robust secondary review of Frutarom's operations in certain other jurisdictions including those that are deemed high risk. These reviews supplement our existing global compliance initiatives that were implemented at Frutarom in connection with the closing of the Frutarom transaction. These secondary reviews were conducted with the assistance of outside legal and accounting firms, including Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Deloitte. These reviews are substantially completed.Following [indiscernible] review, we confirmed that the total affected sales represents less than 1% of IFF's and Frutarom's combined net sales for 2018. And that the impact of reviews including the costs associated with them to-date have not been and are not anticipated to be material to our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, no evidence has been uncovered suggesting that any of these compliance matters at any connection to the United States.With that, I would like to turn it over to Rich to take you through our financial performance in more detail. Richard O'Leary: Thank you, Andreas.Combined currency neutral sales grew 2 percentage points over the prior year driven by the contribution of acquisitions as well as growth in the scent division and a stabilization at Frutarom. From a profitability perspective, we're also pleased that adjusted operating profit margins excluding amortization improved 60 basis points year-over-year driven an increased emphasis on productivity savings and the benefit of acquisition-related synergies.From a legacy IFF standpoint, we delivered very strong operating profit leverage with currency neutral adjusted operating profit up 6% and 1% top-line growth. As I have done in the last few quarters, I would also like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare with our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, for our indexed hard currencies, when we have to invoice in local market currencies.When reporting our currency neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange related price changes in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investor with a truer assessment of underlying currency neutral growth especially when there are large emerging market valuations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to our competition.During the first nine months of 2019, the stronger USD environment plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 2% currency impact, if we include emerging market pricing. You can see from the chart that three countries outlined represented less than 10% of scent and taste sales, but have significant devaluation.Turning to business unit performance for the third quarter, in scent currency neutral sales grew 3% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Performance was strongest in fine fragrances strong mid-single digits led by robust growth in EMEA and Greater Asia.Consumer fragrances grew low-single digits with increases in nearly all categories led by home care, hair care and fabric care. Fragrance ingredients was flat as price increases were offset by volume declines related to supply chain destocking.Scent currency neutral segment profit was flat as the benefits of productivity initiatives and mix were offset by unfavorable price to input costs. We believe that the timing impact of raw materials between inventory and the P&L that we saw in Q2 reversed in the current quarter.We are starting to see signs of raw materials easing, but the costs remain elevated given the 20% increases, experienced over the past two years. In taste, third quarter currency neutral sales declined approximately 2% against the very strong growth of 7% in the year ago period.Growth was strongest in greater Asia with high single-digit growth, contributing to this growth for improvements in key markets such as Indonesia, India and China. However, as expected the volume erosion with multinational customers that we outlined last quarter continued into the third quarter offsetting growth. From a category perspective, it should be noted that performance was strongest in beverage and savory led by new win performance.Despite a challenging pipeline, taste segment profit grew 4% on a currency neutral basis driven primarily by productivity initiatives and cost management. This focus to over 90 basis point margin improvement year-over-yearBefore moving on to Frutarom, I want to share some additional context on taste. The fundamentals of this business remain quite strong. Our project pipeline and win rates are both up about 25% year-over-year. This bodes well for the future. As I just mentioned volume erosion worsened further in Q3 and is now more than 5x our three year average. However, I'm pleased to say that we have already begun to see this inflection in the fourth quarter of 2019 as new win contribution contributions time and volume erosion has begun to normalize.In the third quarter Frutarom totaled of $364 million. On a standalone basis currency neutral sales increased 5% driven by the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses as organic sales remain constant. Performance was driven by growth in taste and savory both offset by some of the same dynamics that we shared in the second quarter with continued pressures in the F&F ingredients mostly notably citrus sauce and note natural products or solutions particularly raw material -- more material driven price declines in natural colors.We are seeing growth stabilize in the third quarter and are expecting an improvement in the fourth quarter as we start to lap some of the transitory issues. I'll discuss this in more detail in a moment.In terms of segment profit, the Frutarom division delivered $828 million and $68 million of profit excluding amortization, third quarter margin profile continues to be strong at 18.7%, if you exclude amortization. Margin continues to be strong driven by cost management and acquisition related synergies.Turning to cash flow dynamics. Operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2019 was up significant from $202 million last year to $383 million this year. The performance was driven primarily by higher cash earnings, core working capital defined as inventories, accounts payable and accounts payable improved year-over-year with progress in all three metrics. Inventory still remain at elevated levels primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the scent division. However, in the third quarter we saw a positive inflection and the levels are continuing to improve.In the first nine months of 2019 CapEx as a percentage of sales was 4.2% driven by new plant and capacity investments, mainly in [indiscernible] as well as creative centers and integration related investments. For the full year, we continue to believe that CapEx as a percentage of sales will be between 4.5% and 5% of sales. Bringing this all together, we had a strong $123 million increase in free cash flow in the first nine months of 2019.Before turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, allow me to bridge our expected full year 2019 organic growth to our long-term growth aspiration of 5% to 7%. In '19, we've been impacted by two specific challenges, one in our taste segment and the second in our Frutarom segment.Starting with our combined organic growth, we expect to finish 2019 at approximately 2% organically. As we communicated throughout the year, we had been impacted by higher than normal volume erosion on our core taste business, particularly with multinational customers. The impact of this on our consolidated growth is approximately a 0.5 on a full year basis.At Frutarom, the combination of the transitory issues we outlined including citrus source, natural colors, trade and marketing as well as the compliance investigation had approximately 1.5 adverse impact on our top-line growth relative to expectation. If we adjust for these items, our normalized, combined organic growth would be approximately 4% this would be in line with the long-term organic growth guidance we communicated at our Investor Day in June this year. Then, when you layer on approximately a percentage point of cross-selling benefits which we will see a significant ramp up in 2020 and a percentage point from additional M&A, similar to the one percentage point we achieved in 2019 you get to 6% which is the mid-point of our long-term range of 5% to 7%.Looking at the cadence of our growth in 2019 combined company currency neutral sales, inclusive of M&A has improved sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And while we're early in the fourth quarter, we do expect the improving sales trend to continue up mid-single digits in Q4. As noted by Andreas, the start to Q4 puts us on a trajectory to see this level. We are seeing a strong rebound in taste as volume rose and is normalizing and we are targeting positive growth at Frutarom as we began to lap several of the isolated issues I mentioned a moment ago.Taking into account our year-to-date performance and if the strong start to Q4 sales trends continue, we expect to be at the low-end of our previous guidance range for sales and adjusted EPS excluding amortization. Delivering upon the low-end of our previous guidance represents very good results in a challenging year with currency neutral sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted operating profit ex amortization, increasing mid-single digits both on a combined basis. The operating leverage is even more pronounced in the second half, in excess of 3x times.With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rich.As we look ahead, there are several potential near term catalysts that we believe will provide tailwinds. From a sales perspective, taste volumes are starting to rebound as Rich just mentioned, which we expect to increase mid-single digits in quarter four as destocking ends. In scent, we will capitalize on a 450 million incremental excess via additional three global coreless assuming we only achieve our fair share that can provide a couple of percentage points of growth over the next few years.And Frutarom we expect to see improving cleanse as Q3 was better than Q2 and Q4 was expected to be better than Q3. Then as we cycle transitory issues which highlighted [indiscernible] to our mid-single digit trend. To compliment this cross selling benefits are expected to trade approximately 100 million by the end of 2021.From a profitability perspective, we expect to benefit from acquisition related cost synergies. 2019 have already had great success achieving 50 million savings for the full year and expect the incremental benefits, we will be no less than an additional $50 million in 2020 as we are internally targeting more.At the core, we will also deliver on the 100 million productivity initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day. About one-third will be achieved in 2019, two-thirds coming in 2020 and 2021. And finally, we're starting to see signs of raw material deflation following a 20% increase we experienced over the past two years.Translating this into go forward financials, we continue to expect to deliver 5% to 7% currency neutral sales growth and a 10% plus in adjusted EPS excluding amortization, including both cross selling benefits and bolt-on acquisitions.In summary, the third quarter was a quarter of good progress, with positive momentum building. We delivered a sequential improvement in growth and achieved adjusted operating profit margin expansion excluding amortization via synergies, productivity and cost management.We are confident in our execution of our integration plan and in turn have to live at increased cost synergies in year one. We have started quarter four strong and given this trend, we are reconfirming our full year 2019 financial guidance.Looking beyond 2019, we have strong value creation opportunities via many near term catalysts. I'll pause forward is clear deliver strong value creation for all of our stakeholders, the growth acceleration, margin expansion and a successful integration.With that operator, we are now happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks. Good morning everybody. I guess a few questions. So, maybe just start the commentary about the strong start to the fourth quarter. I guess what gives confidence that you can sustain the improvement through the quarter, last quarter sequentially worsened through the quarter. So what gives confidence that this time is different? And I guess two, if you're talking about October being better, you've got the extra week at the end of the quarter, so then by definition wouldn't the number be materially better for the fourth quarter? I guess maybe, can you reconcile some of that for us, and then, also confirm whether Frutarom is like-for-like in that it's excluding the three days at the beginning of the quarter that weren't in the base. Andreas Fibig : Okay, Mark. Good morning, first of all. It's Andreas. Let me get started. So from the visit visibility point of view, we have already five weeks, which I think is good. We see what we have in the order book and we have in particular on the taste side, very, very strong win rates. So, these are the things which make us confident for the first quarter. And as you just mentioned, we have the 53rd week as well. So, all-in-all we see good development starting into the first quarter. And in particular we are happy about taste, that we had a couple of quarters which were not going so well. Certainly, again, a very, very strong comparison last year, but that's turning the corner quite rapidly and absolutely in the right direction, but Rich might add to that. Richard O'Leary: Yes, Mark. I think you are right. If you recall, the comment I made was that as the trend continues through the end of the quarter, we're on target to exceed the mid-single-digit, which includes the 53rd week. So and doing that would enable us to get to the low-end of the guidance. Mark Astrachan : And on Frutarom piece, so that excluded in the fourth quarter numbers? Richard O'Leary: It's the standard 445, and excludes the M&A also. Mark Astrachan : Got it. Okay. And then, thinking about 2020, I realize it's early and you may not want to want to talk about it, but I guess just a couple of puts and takes to it. So, you've got a bunch of headwinds in terms of things that you're lapping, like the extra week, incentive, comp reset, hedge gains FX, et cetera.So it seemed like, maybe it's a little harder to get to the longer term earnings algorithm for next year, unless sales growth accelerates, I guess a, is that directionally a reasonable way to think about it, and then, b, from a currency neutral sales growth, obviously it's a longer way off. But, directionally, how should we think about the commentary you just gave about the bridge from the 2% fiscal '19 organic to this normalized growth of six next year, which would seem like you need a little bit to go right to get to. Andreas Fibig : Look, we Mark we have a lot of positives and I actually believe we will start in the next year was quite a bit of tail wind. Let me talk about it. The first one is, is certainly that we see that the tastes volumes are rebounding very, very strongly. So that's one which is really important because it has direct us down in 2019 then we have now these more core lists with our scent business which gives us access to 450 million in incremental sales potential. And we see that we have already won some businesses with these customers this year, which will then materialize next year. So, that's another an important move for more forward. We are lapping some of the Frutarom transitory challenges like citrus source for example.And then, the brush share case so that that's a good thing as well and thing which talked always to it that we can see a good mid single digit gross for the assets from mid, mid of next year. So that's good. And what we do makes me very optimistic is that we see the first nice cross-selling wins. We have this as an extra budget line in. We have a very, very strong pipeline of more than 800 projects already, which is really, really, really good. And on top of it, if you take a very close look to the cost synergies, we are very happy what the organization has delivered this year in particular on procurement savings because procurement is so important because it doesn't distract the organization from anything. And we're delivering all cost savings in general this year of 50 million, which is way above what we had expected and we call this at tailwind into 2020 as well.Then the usual core productivity programs which are running. And then, we see some tailwind on the [indiscernible] as well. So that's, I think these are a lot of very strong positive scoring are going forward. Certainly hedging in FX might be a bit of a headwind, but it all depends on the currencies develops, but Rich, you might comment on that. Richard O'Leary: Yes. Look, I think Mark, there are -- as you said, I think when you look at absolute year-over-year, there's going to be some headwinds from currency. We don't have the 53rd week. So that could be, 50, 60 basis point headwind year-over-year. We do get the benefits from cross-selling. I think the fundamentals are strong and I think that's what we feel good about. As I said and as Andreas mentioned, is how I said on the last call. I think it's going to be more towards the middle of next year when we lap some of these transitory issues. So I'm not ready to say we're going to get to the 60% next year because I think we have clearly some transitory issues we have to work through. But the foundation solid and I do think the long-term, our beliefs are that the long-term growth potential is there and that view hasn't changed. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. I'm looking at slide 15, in the 1.5% sales headwind from transitory issues in Frutarom, I think that's about 20 million or that would've been about a 5% sales headwind to the Frutarom segment sales. So, as a way to think about this is an underlying business trends for Frutarom, excluding these headwinds is mid single digit currently. And do we get that that should accelerate to be above the corporate average sale? Are you still consider Frutarom to be one of the highest growth longer term segments in the company? Richard O'Leary: Yes, John. I think it's, look at, you look at the underlying mix of businesses and the categories. That's the right way to think about it that it's an above average grower. Once we cycle through that those transitory issues, some of which will continue into next year. But yes, that's, that's consistent with our view. Andreas Fibig : We have seen a couple of these segments within the legacy Frutarom business like inclusions where we have good double-digit growth and we believe that this will continue going forward. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey guys. Nice quarter. In terms of the Frutarom effect on earnings, that it was 1.5% hit on sales. What was the hit on earnings or EPS, which, where do I look at it? And does that come back with higher leverage, longer term? Is that you got more cost savings and synergy to support that growth? Richard O'Leary: Yes. From an overall profitability standpoint, if you include the synergies, it's not a hit, right? I mean from an exclusive of the borrowing cost and the cost of capital. But from a growth standpoint, we move forward some of these businesses that we're cycling through that we've talked about in the past, citrus source, the trade and marketing, some of the compliance related stuff, our lower margin is lower than average margin profiles compared to the overall Frutarom level. So, so as we've cycled that, there's a -- actually a favorable pickup going forward. So I think, overall, it's not that much of a drag in terms of from a P&L standpoint. Great. Thank you. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. So, I noticed in the Q, you talked about raw material headwinds persisting for the next two quarters. I think even partially offset by cost savings. So does that imply that margins will be under pressure for the next two quarters 4Q and 1Q? Richard O'Leary: I think for me, Lauren, we have to think about is that they're still at elevated levels. I mean, I think we're starting to see some signs of stabilization. As I look at sort of the net of input cost to raw material -- pricing of raw material costs, they were definitely a negative for the first half of the year. Q3 were basically breakeven and I expect it to be slightly favorable in Q4. Andreas Fibig : Yes. And what helps us as well as that Nicholas and his business unit have done a good job to keep let's say take some structural cost outs to be very competitive in this field and that's helping here as well. Lauren Lieberman : Okay, great. And then, Rich, it wasn't in the Q, what was the incentive comp tailwind for the quarter because that'll help off with modeling next year. Richard O'Leary: Between $5 million and $10 million. Lauren Lieberman : Okay. All right, great. And then, if you can talk also just North America taste point, I was just curious kind of your thoughts on why that business has slowed because I felt like that was sort of an advantageous model you'd put together. And so any commentary you can offer would be really helpful. Andreas Fibig : Yes, absolutely. And that's a very, very good point. We have seen it in that very quarter, but it's already rebounding strongly in the fourth quarter. I would say it's a transitory topic for the quarter driven by vanilla in a sense that some of the customers went from a natural vanilla to more the one and the synthetic solutions, which is good from a profitability point of view, but not so good from the sales point of point of view. And we see now a good start into the quarter. So I would not interpret too much into it. The concept stays and the concept survives. So, we are doing very well here.. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Gunther Zechmann : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a few to run through please. The overall synergies with Frutarom, you kept unchanged a hundred million revenues of a three years, 145 million cost synergies. You speak very confidently about achieving or overachieving those targets. What makes you hold on to the numbers that you originally came with then? Or what would trigger you to actually raise the synergy target? That's number one.The second one is on the mid-single-digit growth that you've seen in October. Just wanted to clarify that this is local currency sales growth rather than organic. And is a drive that in Q4 you should have just about over percentage planned of consolidation gains on the revenue line as well. And then within my one question, very briefly, it just CapEx 2020, what should we expect? Thanks. Richard O'Leary: Let me just make sure I get the three different items in the question, Gunther. So, first let me start with October. It is currency neutral organic growth, so it excludes the M&A and that's the results through the first five weeks of Q4. In terms of CapEx next year, I would expect this to be around 4.5% plus or minus, we're still working through that, but it's the peak year in terms of '19 to '20 as we've talked about. We're finishing up a couple of the key investments in Asia, India and Indonesia. We've got the probably the peak of the integration CapEx. And then, from there we all move down pretty quickly into 2021 going forward along the lines of the 3.5% that I've talked about previously.In terms of the synergy guidance, just keep in mind, where are we seeing the traction and where we've -- over-delivered in 2019 is really on the procurement side. I think we're very, very confident in our ability to deliver that. Obviously that, plateaus and I think we still have a lot of work to be done next year, particularly around the footprint and the site integration work. So it's a little bit early for me to raise the target from the 145, as I said in my comments, I think it puts us on a trajectory to do that, but I'm not ready to declare victory. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning. So a couple of questions. I guess, first, if I look at some of your competitors and how they're doing, it seems to me that they haven't seen the type of volume erosion that you have this year and accepting that there seems to be a turn in October, but I wanted to see if you had any thoughts on why that is. And what can you do to align yourselves more with those that are winning? Richard O'Leary: No. I think from a big picture standpoint, we're on all the core list that we want to be on. And where it makes sense is to be on it beyond the coreless from an, from an economic standpoint. Certain of our customers are not performing as well. When you look at a two-year trend, for the first nine months of the year you adjust for the peer-based currency dynamic. We're very close to our largest competitor. So, I think we don't believe that we are fundamentally losing share and that we're performing well in the market and once we pass the transitory issue.So, I think we're the best thing we're doing and we're focused on, is actually carrying on our plan. Andreas has talked about the opportunity we have going forward on the scent side in terms of nearly $450 million in core lists access, as, we progressed on that that provides real upside to the scent business. I talked about some of the commentary around. On the legacy taste business about the order book and win rates being up significantly year-over-year, that bodes well for the future. So, I don't know if there's -- look, we have to execute and battle every day and we compete every day. And that's what we're focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Good morning everyone. I was hoping you could provide us a little bit more color on the taste kind of growth outlook and the confidence you just have there about that kind of returning in 2020 just given the performance this year, just you really think it's concentrated with the multinational customers and just categories where you feel your win-win. Win rates with suggested accelerations in the offing. Thanks. Andreas Fibig : That's absolutely, look, listen, we will see the turnaround already in the fourth quarter. What we have seen in the first five weeks and what is in the order book looks, looks very, very strong and usually the business goes a little bit in [waves here] [ph] and we are not on the upswing right now. We see a good demand in many areas in particular in very innovative areas. We see it in, in the plant based proteins for example, which is becoming a really important driver of the business. We see that we have more of these solutions available. So the portfolio we inherited through Frutarom, which is helping as well. Some of it will be accounted in the cross selling and total solution space. So, we are actually very optimistic that this is going in the right direction and the team is thriving.And what I just said for taste point is actually important as well because certainly the last quarter was not great for taste point, but we are seeing a good rebounding on this one with many of our core call customers and we see in particular also a good winning on the beverage side, which is very helpful. So all in all, all the signs are very, very positive on that business. And I think that the team is fairly optimistic and motivated for the next couple of quarters. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Unidentified Speaker : Good morning. It's [indiscernible] for Jeff. How are you? Hi. I have a on your productivity initiatives outside of Frutarom. Can you talk about like where you stand so far, so I think what you've announced is that you've picked like a $40 million charge in there, 190 positions to be eliminated and maybe like a total cost will be 20 million. So, there's some to go. So, where are you in terms of the program and what do you think the savings might be that you'll see from this year and next year? Richard O'Leary: Yes. So I mean, it's, I would say we're on track to deliver the a hundred million that we've talked about remember there's different components of it. A big part of it is in the scent business, on the cost transformation line -- that part of it is in the early stages now. What you're seeing some of the charges for relate to on the scent side, the overhead, the realignment of the business, finance transformation is some what we're going through now. I think we're going to basically deliver probably a little less than a third this year and then the remaining two-thirds equally over 2020 and 2021. Andreas Fibig : What is really exciting on this area as well as that the reason why we spent good amount of CapEx, this year is to modernize much of our manufacturing footprint where a lot of more OpEx and AI goes in, which will help us in the mid and long-term to a very competitive manufacturing costs in place. And that's helping as well. And that's what Rich said, because we have to finish up a couple of projects in Asia, which will have, we are just building the most modern and biggest flavors and fragrance manufacturing plant in India. We're doing something in China and in Indonesia. And also with the optimization of the footprint we bring in a lot of technology which will help us to come to a very, very competitive manufacturing costs. Operator : We'll take our next question from Heidi Vesterinen with Exane. Please go ahead. Heidi Vesterinen : Hi. Good morning. So, you had a new comment in the 10-Q highlighting potential risk of a goodwill impairment. What was your rationale for adding that comment this quarter and are you prepared to roll out impairments at this stage given the underperformance? Richard O'Leary: Heidi, look as we go through the normal process at the end of the year, it's a required update in the disclosure. Look, at this point I consider it unlikely that we'll have impairment. And as I said earlier, we haven't changed our change, our view on the long-term impacts and potential of this business. So, I consider it unlikely. Heidi Vesterinen : And then, if I could ask another one, another question from the 10-Q. So, you've also announced you've entered into a new factoring agreement. What explains the rationale for this and does this in parts, explain your confidence over cash flows? Richard O'Leary: Yes. I think it's consistent with our plan. To me, I look at it as it helps us accelerate the de-leveraging plan the cost of capital to do the factoring on a short-term borrowing rates versus our long-term cost of capital rates. It's an attractive trade-off. And so, we're being opportunistic about that aspect. Operator : We'll take the next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. Just let me start with a detailed, when you talked about acceleration in Frutarom for the first few weeks of October, can you confront that means it's growing organically, not just by acquisition, but growing organically where it was flat I think last quarter. Thank you. That's quick related\u2026How would roughly flat organic for last quarter have compared with your original plans when you laid out the 145 million synergy target? And I guess related to that and finally if there were any kind of, you've emphasized procurement as the main source of synergies and that makes a lot of sense, but is there any rationalization going on here in Frutarom that is effecting the growth rate where you're going in and getting rid of unprofitable or tail business and that's maybe slowing the business down versus what the kind of organic growth rates but the deal? Richard O'Leary: No, John, I mean, you know, I think there's a couple of different pieces there. I think when you ask where the growth rates were and Q3 being flat versus our expectations obviously is below where we wanted it to be and where we expected to be. It's driven by some of the transitory issues that I talked about previously in terms of colors issue and in [NPS] [ph], the trade and marketing the citrus source businesses.So, if I look at the core taste part of the business as you call on a Q2 call, we talked about a very challenging June in the taste business, particularly in Europe. Some of that continued into Q3, but again, we've seen a good start to Q4 and than certainly higher where we saw in Q3 all for four regions in the taste of Frutarom as well as for the savory business. And that's why I think ultimately, we have the confidence in the structural capability of that business.In terms of impacts related to integration, the reason why we're highlighting the procurement savings is that's really what's accelerating and what's changed. The biggest driver or difference in terms of our expected synergies -- that started the year at 30 to 35 and where we are now in 50. We're making -- we are on target and we are making good progress against the site rationalization you saw on -- I think it was Andreas' comments when we talked about the number of closes we've announced. So far and completed in the second half of this year. That will accelerate into 2020 and that's a big part of the driver of the increased synergies year-over-year between '19 and '20. I think from a, you get to the point about businesses that are -- on less attractive margin profile, profitability profile. I think that's more of a mix effect that we'll see going forward. Operator : Our next question's from Brett Hundley with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Brett Hundley : Hey, good morning guys. Rich, I just wanted to go back -- just want to go back to the Heidi's question related to the -- your comment on the factoring agreement. Do you, do you see that pulling anything forward from Q4? What's normally a pretty big working capital quarter for you? And then, if I can just follow on with a separate question. Just going back to raw materials are we seeing any new synthetic production coming online out there that might help to combat some of the issues that we've seen in recent years? And does that play into some of your confidence about the go forward there? Thank you. Richard O'Leary: Excuse me. For the first part on the working capital piece of it, it might have a small impact on what we typically did before, but it's not, it's not a huge program. I mean, I still expect to get the -- the improvement in Q4 that we typically see given the cyclicality and the way things operate in the fourth quarter. In terms of new capacity input costs, I think certainly the first thing is that we've seen, I'll say a stabilization of the supply chain. And that's the starting point. I mean if you think about what I talked about, Q2, Q1 was they were still a lot of volatility out there.Inventory levels remain high on the scent business for us and our competition, but we are seeing signs that as I said, that it starting to stabilize and I think the industry as a whole is starting to rebalance inventories and get away from safety stocks. The talk that we saw some improvement in Q3 in terms of inventory levels coming down. I expect that to continue in Q4. There's new capacity coming on from VASF in the fourth quarter. I think some of the capacity that was out of the market because of the fires is coming back on. And I think that helps provide a trajectory going forward for us to reduce inventory levels. And provide, as Andreas said, we're starting to see some signs that we may have some easing next year or going forward. Operator : Our next question is from James Targett with Berenberg. Please go ahead. James Targett : Hi, good afternoon. I'm just one question for me, on the compliance update. Can you just confirm, you talk about being substantially complete when you do expect it to be complete and what's outstanding? Thanks. Richard O'Leary: Yes. I mean we're substantially complete in terms of doing the investigation as in anything like this, there's things that have to -- we have to finish putting, resolving issues whether it's people that are on garden leave that have to then go through. But it's the normal sort of follow up and clean up that that has as a result of something like that. Andreas Fibig : Yes. It's also cleaning up all of these documents we have screened. So, Deloitte and some of our legal partners here as well, I think in the first quarter we should be fine with that. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's Q&A session. I'd like to return the calls of Andreas for final remarks. Andreas Fibig : Thank you very much for all the good questions and the attendance here. And we will follow-up with was one-on-one sessions with many of you. Thank you. Take care. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF\u2019s fourth quarter full year 2019 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website.Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the first quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, and our press release.Today\u2019s presentation include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and is posted on our website.With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla, who will begin with prepared remarks, and then take any questions that you may have.With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. And a very special welcome to Rustom, our recently appointed CFO, who joined us about three weeks ago. We could not be more excited to welcome him to the IFF team, as he brings a strong track record over 30 years of operational and financial leadership across several international markets with significant experience in managing global finance teams, developing strategy, driving efficiency initiatives and completing acquisitions. So, welcome Rustom.I would like to take the opportunity to thank Rich O\u2019Leary for his service as our CFO and looking forward to his contributions as our integration lead for the DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences combination. He has deep institutional knowledge, insights and perspectives, both financially and strategically and will be enormously valuable as he takes on his new role as our Integration Officer.On today\u2019s call, as usual, I will give an executive overview of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, including an update on the progress we are making with the integration of Frutarom. Following the discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide the financial review of the business and take you through our financial expectations for 2020.We will also recap IFF\u2019s transformational journey and the exciting opportunities we see with our combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences business, which we announced in the fourth quarter 2019. Upon the completion of our prepared remarks, we will take any questions that you may have.Let\u2019s come to 2019. 2019 was a transformational year in IFF\u2019s history. It can be categorized as a year of great progress, despite some challenges. Over the course of the year, there were many positive accomplishments, including development of our new strategy, strong progress against our integration synergy targets, unlocking incremental access to new businesses via core lists and announcing our combination with N&B unparalleled in our industry as it will broaden our product offerings and create a global leader in innovative integrated solutions.I\u2019ve also to acknowledge that there were several challenges are like continued raw material cost increases; impactful end market dynamics like destalking, isolated sales pressure, including delayed launches and the dissynergies, as well as the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue, which I\u2019m pleased to say that has now been fully completed and closed.In that context we surpassed $5 million sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization, a testament to our team\u2019s focus, dedication and commitment to delivering strong results and executing our long-term strategy. We ended 2019 with meaningful growth in the fourth quarter, seeing 7% currency-neutral revenue growth, including the 4 percentage points related to the 53rd week. We also achieved currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 23% excluding amortization, led by volume growth, integration synergies, productivity initiatives, the Brazil tax recovery, as well as more favorable tax rate and higher other income.In the fourth quarter, the team was able to continue to exceed expectations on Frutarom cost synergies, capturing approximately $20 million cost synergies driven by procurement harmonization and manufacturing optimization.This very sustained focus across the organization ultimately positioned IFF to accelerate our vision through the announced combination with DuPont N&B business at the end of the year. The exciting combination will allow us to develop integrated solutions with greater global scale to meet what our customers demand, high-quality products, innovative solutions and strategic partnerships to deliver growth.But, let\u2019s take a step back and look at the full year 2019. I\u2019m pleased to say, we delivered solid top and bottom line results in a very challenging environment. We realized sales of $5.1 billion, expanded adjusting operating profit margin excluding amortization by 30 bps to 19.2%. We also delivered strong adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of US$6.17, principally led by adjusted operating profit growth, realized synergies and improved productivity. Ultimately, we have many strategic accomplishments that built momentum throughout the year and drove significant value creation.Our investment innovation includes the opening of IFF centers of excellence and innovation hubs in New Jersey and Texas. Specifically, our new Center of Excellence for Food Service and Seasonings in Carrollton, Texas; the opening of our Home & Fabric Care Innovation Center at Bell Works in Holmdel, New Jersey; and the openings of our global service center in Budapest and L\u2019Atelier Du Parfumeur in Grasse, France, reflects our commitment to environmentally responsible real estate development.In addition, we also modernized our largest Scent creative centers in New York and Paris, and continued our investment in Greater Asia, including two new plants in India and China, which we will complete -- will be completed in 2020.In June, we took another bold step forward in leading our industry on sustainability when we articulated IFF\u2019s new purpose, to redefine and transform how we live and care for the resources of the world. In line with this mission, we accelerated our global industry leadership in sustainability, opening the industry\u2019s largest solar array of our facilities in New Jersey and signing on to the United Nations\u2019 pledge to help limit global temperature rise. Most recently, IFF was named once again to CDP\u2019s A List for climate change and water security, placing our company among a prestigious group of global environmental leaders with AA distinction. And just a week ago, we were named to Barron\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable Companies List for the third consecutive year.Throughout the year, we continued to complete important work of bringing our colleagues at Frutarom more fully to the IFF family. We have addressed the most significant outselling challenges related to bringing these businesses together and are now in a position to accelerate growth by capturing new opportunities and delivering the solutions our customers need. But perhaps most importantly, we have continued to achieve significant cost synergies throughout integration process, well ahead of our year one cost synergy target, including approximately $50 million cost synergies in 2019. This is mainly driven by procurement excellence, but we also have made progress on our operational footprint. We have closed 10 sites in 2019. And I really believe we are on track to deliver more than $145 million in synergies, further supporting the business and driving value to our shareholders. We expect to substantially complete the Frutarom integration by the end of 2020.The efficient operational execution was complemented by solid year one run rate revenue synergies of approximately $15 million. We\u2019ve identified a strong pipeline of cross-selling opportunities of more than 1,000 projects, representing approximately $150 million of sales and plan to build on this momentum in 2020.We have accelerated expansion of our Tastepoint model to serve the fast-growing local and regional customer segment through increased speed and agility, enabling them to win in the marketplace. We will fully consolidate Frutarom into our legacy IFF business. As we refine our structure and reporting, we\u2019re aligning our talent organization and responsibility based on our new structure. With this in mind, starting in Q1 of 2020, we will report financial results as Taste and Scent, incorporating most of Frutarom within our Taste segment.Lastly, we continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was up $261 million year-over-year in 2019. We continue to deleverage our balance sheet, improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 3.6 times to 3.2 times, putting us on track to deliver on our commitment to be below 3 times by the end of 2020.With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom to take us through our financial performance in greater detail. Rustom Jilla : Thank you, Andreas.First, let me say how delighted I am to have joined IFF at this exciting time as we move past the integration of Frutarom to the combination with DuPont\u2019s N&B business, and the many opportunities and challenges this will bring.For my part, I expect to focus on first, improving execution and accountability; second, enhancing effective collaboration across the business, that\u2019s legacy IFF, Frutarom, and soon N&B third, strengthening our cost discipline; and finally, delivering solid ROI.Now, on to the numbers. Reported sales increased by 29% in 2019 with three additional quarters of Frutarom being the major driver. Excluding Frutarom, currency-neutral sales grew 3% with 2019\u2019s 53rd week contributing 1%. I\u2019ll provide more color on sales by segment as we go through those slides.Our full year adjusted operating profit margin excluding amortization, rose by 30 basis points, driven by productivity initiatives, acquisition-related synergies and a Brazilian tax recovery. It\u2019s also worth noting that in our fourth quarter, our currency-neutral EPS ex-amortization, grew a robust 23%, driven mostly by acquisition-related synergies, volume growth, lower incentive compensation, a Brazilian tax recovery, and a lower effective tax rate, which more than offset a headwind from higher raw material costs and mix.As the IFF team has done in previous quarters, I would like to highlight the impact of emerging market pricing on our growth rates to better compare to our peers. As a reminder, for a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies, or our index to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. So, when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets. But, this is different from our peers. We believe that our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it\u2019s important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition.For the fourth quarter of 2019, the stronger U.S. dollar environment plus emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets had approximately a 1% currency impact on growth, if we include emerging market pricing. For the full year, this impact represented approximately a 2% currency impact on growth.Breaking it down a little further. Let\u2019s move on to Scent, on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6% to $478.3 million. Fourth quarter performance was strongest in Consumer Fragrance, increasing in the high single digits from the prior year, driven by growth in Home, Fabric and Hair Care. Fine Fragrance grew in the mid single digits year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in both Greater Asia and in Latin America. At the same time, Fragrance Ingredients declined in the low single digits from last year as price increases were offset by volume declines, mainly as a result of industry destocking.For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by 4% from 2018 to $1.9 billion with growth across all regions and in all categories, especially those that are a strategic focus. Both Fine Fragrance, with record new win contribution, and Consumer Fragrance grew in the mid single digits from 2018. Our performance in Fine Fragrance was driven by double-digit growth in EAME and Greater Asia, while as in the fourth quarter, Consumer Fragrance was led by strong improvements in Home and Fabric Care. For the year, Fragrance Ingredients improved by low double -- by low single digits, driven by price increases.For the full year, currency-neutral segment profit grew 6% and margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.3%. Drivers included raw materials-driven price increases as well as benefits from productivity initiatives that ran the gamut from manufacturing, procurement and make versus buy to innovation.Moving on to Taste on slide 12. In the fourth quarter, currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 8% to $429.9 million. This performance was led by double-digit growth in Greater Asia and high single digit growth in North America. Sales to multinationals, which had been under pressure in the last few quarters, grew mid single digits, indicating an inflection point in Q4. We also saw a much stronger growth from regional and local customers. From a category perspective, we were strongest in Beverage and Savory, helped greatly by strong new win performance.For the full year, currency-neutral sales increased by approximately 2% to $1.7 billion, driven by high single digit growth in Greater Asia and low single digit growth in EAME. As discussed during the year, we had some challenges in North America and Latin America related to volume declines with multinational customers. And as in the fourth quarter, full year 2019 growth was strongest in Beverage and Savory.For the full year, Taste posted an industry-leading 22.1% segment profit margin with $383 million in segment profit, which was supported by productivity increases, integration-related synergies and lower incentive compensation expense.Now, let\u2019s move on to Frutarom\u2019s performance on slide 13. In the fourth quarter, Frutarom currency-neutral sales increased year-over-year by 6%, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses, which is a sequential improvement in underlying performance. Organic currency-neutral growth for the quarter was 2%, essentially led by our Taste and Savory businesses.As discussed in past calls, Frutarom experienced compliance and portfolio-related transitory headwinds. Excluding these, organic currency-neutral growth would have been 6%. For the full year, sales were $1.5 billion for the segment, up 3% on a currency-neutral basis from the prior year, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses.In 2019, organic sales growth was flat. And if you exclude the transitory issues, organic currency-neutral sales growth was 3%, driven by solid growth in Taste and Savory solutions. The fastest-growing categories at Frutarom include double-digit increases in food protection, inclusions and algae.For the first for the full year, Frutarom\u2019s segment profit was $127 million or $286 million, excluding amortization. And we finished the year with a strong quarterly segment profit increase of 24%, led by acquisition-related synergies. The full year operating margin excluding amortization was 19.2%, supported by delivering on our acquisition-related synergies and by disciplined cost management.Slide 14 provides some additional color on cash flow. As you will see, operating cash flow for the full year was up significantly from $438 million in 2018 to $699 million this year, a $261 million or 60% increase. This was driven primarily by higher cash earnings from Frutarom -- with Frutarom included for the entire year.Core working capital, defined as inventories, accounts receivables and accounts payables, improved year-over-year with progress in all three metrics. Inventories still remain at elevated levels, primarily due to raw material cost increases and safety stocks within the Scent division. However, in the fourth quarter, we saw continued positive trends.For 2019, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4.6%, which is a significant investment in the future. Throughout the year, we made new capital -- made new plant and capacity investments, mainly in Greater Asia as well as creative centers, and we invested in high-return integration-related synergy projects such as manufacturing optimization. Bringing all this together, we had strong $195 million increase in free cash flow for 2019, representing a 73% increase year-over-year.Moving on to slide 15. We expect full year 2020 sales of between $5.15 billion and $5.35 billion with adjusted EPS excluding amortization between $6.20 and $6.45.At this point in time, we expect a modest impact on sales from the recent coronavirus outbreak, but we are unable to quantify this as there are just too many variables and uncertainties. In addition, we have already incurred some relatively modest costs related to the outbreak as we acted to mitigate the impact on our supply chain. Right now, it\u2019s too early to quantify the impact on our results, but we did widen both our sales and adjusted EPS ex-amortization guidance ranges to make some allowance for this as well as for continued volatile operating environment.The next slide provides some additional color about what we expect to drive our core sales growth for the year.Looking into our 2020 sales growth expectations and given the several moving parts, we felt it was important to give you an overview of the drivers. As you see from this slide, sales growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 1% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of about 0.5 percentage point impact from portfolio adjustments, namely the carryover impact from compliance and CitraSource, and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period. Excluding these impacts, our core currency-neutral sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.5% to 6.5%, which includes approximately 2% to 5.5% from the organic business, 0.5% to 1% from cross-selling, and little to no impact from M&A.Now, let\u2019s move to slide 17 for some additional color on what is driving our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 3.5% to 7.5% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a headwind of approximately 5 percentage points related to an incentive compensation reset, which is due to our performance versus our internal budget in 2019, an anticipated 0.5% impact due to our due to the portfolio adjustment, and an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Excluding those impacts, core currency-neutral adjusted EPS ex-amortization is expected to grow in the range of 4% to 8%. We also expect to have a 6% positive contribution from integration synergies, which when added to our core growth, puts us in the double-digit growth range.Moving on to slide 18. I\u2019m pleased to tell you that we remain on track to deliver on our commitment to delevering down to below 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020 while maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are already down to approximately 3.2 times, down from 3.6 times a year ago, and we will continue to focus on improving working capital, tightly managing our CapEx while making the necessary investments and of course growing our cash earnings. To further support achieving this goal, management incentives are aligned to repayment of debt.With that, let me turn the call back to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom. Very well done.I now want to spend a few moments and highlighting the evolution of IFF from a traditional leader in the flavor and fragrance space to now as it uniquely positioned to redefine our industry at a time when consumers\u2019 demands are forcing changes across our customers.With Frutarom, we took the first big step. We can now reach one of the broader set of our CPG customers of all sizes in the world and added critical depth to our proposition as a top provider of flavors, savory solutions and natural taste solutions.As I mentioned, we are seeing some excellent cross-selling opportunities further supported by our Tastepoint model. With N&B, we take the next leap forward in delivering integrated solutions that allow us to partner with our customers to solve their most pressing problems. It is a truly powerful combination. IFF\u2019s leadership in natural solutions and N&B\u2019s leadership in clean label, including cultures, enzyme and soy proteins, will be a vital component in creating solutions that meet customer needs for better-for-you products.Our complementary product portfolio will be among the most balanced in the industry. Together, we will have number one or number two positions in the high-value most in-demand ingredients categories across our shared end markets of food and beverage, health and wellness, and home and personal care. Ultimately, what we are doing is strengthening IFF\u2019s position to serve our customers.We are witnessing powerful trends that are forcing all of us to think differently, and we have received very positive customer feedback about that combination. We will be a very powerful leader with even better R&D and application development capabilities and even deeper and more robust product development pipeline in addition to a portfolio that will be among the most balanced in the industry. Importantly, our shared cultures, led by science and creativity, will drive our strengths to unlock the potential of this combination. And again, it\u2019s really about how we can deliver highly compelling value propositions to all of our customer types. For many of our global to multinational customers, we will bring deep experience with high-growth segments, faster speed to market and very deep consumer insights.For local and regional organizations, we will provide global reach to support regional and/or global expansion, paired with a strong local presence and a culture of collaboration. For new brands, we will be their end-to-end partner from idea to production, providing the reliability of scale and the power of global reach. The opportunity before us is clear and compelling, and we are taking the wide steps to ensure that we are positioning positioned to bring these two businesses together as efficiently as possible.As we announced along with Rustom\u2019s appointment back in December, Rich O\u2019Leary has been named as the lead the N&B integration efforts for IFF. Similarly, Angela Naef, N&B\u2019s SVP of Global Tech and Innovation, will oversee the N&B integration lead. Each brings unparalleled knowledge of the respective businesses and a diverse operating perspective to this team. We believe that their combination of experience and leadership best positions us to bring this combination to life. As I have had the opportunity to meet with leaders from across N&B business, each of these conversations has reaffirmed that IFF and N&B are perfect partners.While we look forward to hitting the ground running, the deal close is targeted for the first quarter of 2021, providing significant runway for planning and integration-related execution. As you can see, we have already been diligently working on planning to execute our road map to integrate these businesses. On slide 22, we are showing that while our N&B integration planning has started and is working in parallel with our ongoing Frutarom integration work, we do expect the business integration work of Frutarom to be completed in the third quarter of 2020, with 90% of the manufacturing consolidation complete as planned. This ensures that we are ready to begin the DuPont N&B integration. We will tap the combined integration muscle of both IFF and N&B along with robust external subject experts. So in summary, we delivered solid top and bottom line results and took clear and significant strategic steps on our journey to lead our industry as an invaluable partner for our customers.In 2019, we surpassed $5 billion in sales for the first time and expanded adjusted operating profit margin, excluding amortization by 30 bps. I\u2019m pleased that we ended the year with a significant acceleration in growth, seeing a 7% currency-neutral revenue increase and a robust 23% increase in currency-neutral adjusted EPS, excluding amortization. Reflecting on the year, we have a lot to be proud of. Our key accomplishments include significant integration-related synergies, strong progress in cross-selling, great strides in sustainability and completion of the Russia and Ukraine compliance issue. At the end of the year, in the fourth quarter, we also saw a fundamental improvement in our Taste segment, a key inflection point as we head into 2020. But I also want to acknowledge that not everything went in our favor in 2019.We experienced significant raw material cost increases across both segments, and sales came in lower-than-expected across all segments for the various reasons we explained earlier. As we look ahead in 2020, leveraging the key learnings from 2019, our priorities are very clear : drive growth and profitability in our business, substantially complete Frutarom integration and lay the groundwork to begin successfully combining with N&B. With continued focus on execution, we will be well positioned to become a global leader in innovative, integrated solutions and be able to deliver value creation for all of our stakeholders. And while we are early in 2020, we are pleased to say that started of the year strong with growth in all segments.With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan : So, two questions for me. First, on the sales forecast range, so it\u2019s a bit wider than we\u2019re accustomed to seeing. It\u2019s a bit wider, I think, too, relative to some of your peers. I guess I\u2019m curious why you\u2019re giving a wider range. I hear the China commentary, but I was under the impression, it wasn\u2019t particularly large as a percentage of business. So is there something from a macro standpoint? Or is there something from a customer standpoint that you\u2019re hearing or worried about? And then the second question is Frutarom. So I get organic growth for 4Q down about 4%, if you back out the acquisition contribution and the piece of the business from the closing of prior year that you did known for the full quarter, so that gets a full year number down about 1%. So, I guess, the question there is you\u2019ve owned the asset now for a little over one year. What\u2019s a reasonable run rate of growth? You\u2019ve talked about 6% of that target longer term, but it just seems like it\u2019s not the case anymore. So maybe you\u2019re still thinking 6%, but if you could kind of walk through how you\u2019re thinking about it, if that\u2019s the case. Or what are the moving parts today? That would be helpful. Andreas Fibig : Mark, thank you. First of all, on the guidance range, that was certainly a discussion we had internally. What do we do in an environment where we are in, which is a pretty, let\u2019s say, volatile. It\u2019s on one hand, certainly, the corona situation, I\u2019ll come to that in a second. And then also tariffs, which are not easy to plan. But corona was probably the tipping point for us because it\u2019s very hard to quantify, but we know that it will have an impact. With our manufacturing plants actually closed up to last Monday, Tuesday, well, we opened it. We have relatively soft demand. We will see whether we will make it up. We have seen that we have also modest cost increases already on particularly on transportation.We have to make sure that we manage our inventory well in this situation because you have, let\u2019s say, disruptions in the supply chain. And one of our bigger customers also said that the travel retail is actually pretty down because people are not traveling too much any longer. Just to give you one very personal example, my family came back from Europe yesterday. My wife told me in Frankfurt that the at the border control, there was nobody else. And the airplane, Lufthansa airplane was a smaller one than before, and it was just half booked, so just as to validate what we are seeing and reading. So we said it\u2019s probably a prudent thing to widen the guidance range because we just don\u2019t know. We hope at least that we will make it up. And as I said, our manufacturing plants are open again, and we are starting to manufacture, and it seems to be all good. But that\u2019s how we see it. And I hand it over to Rustom to talk a bit about the guidance. Rustom Jilla : Sure. Thanks. Thank you, Mark. Very little to add there except specifically, we didn\u2019t quantify on the coronavirus because it\u2019s too early. It\u2019s just too early to tell and understand it. And but what we did do was widen the ranges, and we can come back at some point subsequent in the year as we know more. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Let me take now your second question on Frut. We believe when we cycle through, as we said, probably over the course of last year, through some of the onetime effects, we see that this business has good potential of mid-single-digit growth in average, and I come to some of the exceptions here. What we have to cycle through is our compliance issues, we issue we had in Russia. Thanks God, it\u2019s solved on the legal front now. We have to make sure that on the business side, it\u2019s running well. The second thing is the CitraSource, where one of our peer companies lost their big customer, and they are our biggest customer in that business. And then we had the impact on raw material prices on Natural Colors. So we believe that within the second quarter, we will cycle through these effects and we will grow this business around about mid-single digits. We have actually if you look at the different categories, some of these businesses are doing extremely well and have even double-digit growth like inclusions, where gelato is part of it, and the Food Protection business. So we are driving this, and we see also that these businesses are helping us with our cross-selling activities, which is basically reflected in the guidance, by the way. And most of it, it\u2019s a Frutarom business. Okay? Mark Astrachan : Okay. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Sison : I didn\u2019t want to get a little bit of color in terms of what\u2019s driving the growth, the 2.5% to 6.5%. I know you have a nice little color, columns there. But in terms of the organic business, can you maybe walk through I think you\u2019ve won some business in Taste or maybe it\u2019s Scent, I can\u2019t remember. And what gives you confidence that you can actually grow organically in 2020? Andreas Fibig : Yes, okay, absolutely. And I\u2019ll take it, but please, Rustom, you add here. First of all, as we said before, we have basically access to three more very important core lists on the Scent side. What we see is that the team is executing with the customer very, very closely now on new projects. We will see already some good wins in 2020, but the bulk of it will probably come in 2021. But we see that this is working out very well. And I was myself at the BIC Congress, ACI, the American Cleaning Institute, and I talked myself to many customers. And particularly, the ones where we have won the new core lists, and that\u2019s very positive because they\u2019re happy with the innovation provided by IFF, and the projects are already starting to ramp up. That\u2019s number one. Number two, and that was super important for us last year. We saw the inflection point now with the Taste business. We had basically three, almost four quarters, not so great growth. It was fourth quarter in 2018 and then up to the third quarter in 2019. And we saw that many of our bigger CPG customers had very slow volumes. Not that we were losing businesses but just the volume was very, very low of our business with these customers. And we had on the other hand a very good win rate over the course of the year, and that started to materialize now in the fourth quarter. And we see already a good start into the first quarter as well with good January numbers. So, it looks like that we are coming back on the Taste business to our usually average growth rates. And when I go back here on my spreadsheet, the last three years, the average CAGR was 3.9%, last five years 3.7%. And that\u2019s certainly a number the business can achieve.Then, on top of it, we look at the Frutarom business, I just gave the answer to Mark. It\u2019s a bit backloaded in general because of the cycling through of the topics I just mentioned. Well, what comes on top of it, we see actually a good activity now on the cross-selling. It started slower than we expected, but right now, we have run about 1,000 projects which have significant value for us, where we see that we can combine our products, that we can cross-sell products into combined customers. And that\u2019s something which is really, really good and gives us confidence that the growth is will be good in our core business over the course of 2020. So that\u2019s how we see it. I don\u2019t know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything. Rustom Jilla : Just one thing probably in pricing and in Scent, pricing and Fragrance Ingredients. But otherwise, I think you covered it all. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open. John Roberts : Thank you. Welcome, Rustom. That was a good presentation for somebody only on the job a couple of weeks. Now that the year one guarantees have expired for the key Frutarom employees, are you seeing any increase in turnover? Andreas Fibig : Yes. John, that\u2019s a very, very good question. Let me address it into two parts. The first thing, if I look at total employee population of legacy Frut, we have actually lower attrition rates, voluntary attrition rates than we had before, which is actually pretty good, knocking on wood, it stays like that. And on the key employees, we didn\u2019t lose key employees we didn\u2019t want to lose. And that\u2019s a good, let\u2019s say, message for us as well. Some of them are driving important businesses for us. For example, the leader of the Inclusions business, which is really driving it, the Savory solutions business. They\u2019re all leader from the legacy Frut unit. John Roberts : And do you have any update on the timing of a filing for the DuPont deal? And just remind us what are the key long lead time critical items on the path to closing on first quarter 2021. Michael DeVeau : So, it would be -- John, this is Mike. There\u2019s no change from what we communicated back in December. As we progress through this year, obviously, there\u2019s the separation component that the DuPont team is working on from that standpoint. And then as we progress concurrently, we\u2019re working to look at doing the appropriate filings with the SEC, specifically, the Form 4, that will probably come, let\u2019s call it, mid-year. And then after that, we\u2019ll move into the voting discussion. Andreas Fibig : And closing has not changed. We believe that first quarter next year is very realistic. And we don\u2019t expect any antitrust issues here with the two businesses. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Your line is open. PJ Juvekar : One question is on Taste. North America were challenged due to volume erosion from large multinational companies. I thought that destocking in packaged foods was mostly done by end of third quarter. So is there incremental destocking? Or is this issue with underlying demand with these multinational companies? Andreas Fibig : I think, PJ, good question. We are done with destocking for, let\u2019s say, third quarter last year. Fourth quarter was already done. And I think it has reflected very nicely in the rebound of our business in the Taste division, so we are very happy with that. PJ Juvekar : And my second question is, one of your priorities was getting IFF\u2019s technology into Frutarom and the cross-selling you had talked about. Can you give us an update on that and if that\u2019s happening through Tastepoint? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Absolutely. It\u2019s happening through Tastepoint, and we\u2019re doing it for some of the bigger customers as well. What we see here is, in particular, on the Food Protection side, very good sales. So Food Protection is basically antioxidants to increase the shelf life. That\u2019s something where cross-selling works very, very well. We see it in the first examples on Natural Colors and on the Inclusion business, which you see the legacy Taura one. We see it in the number of projects, as I mentioned. We have around about 1,000 different projects running with a value of more than $100 million. Not all of them will hit certainly this year, but it shows the strength. If I would look back maybe one year, 1.5 years, I would have hoped it comes faster. But I have to say now, since we are having a really dedicated good team on it and exploring it more, it comes much better than we have expected. So little slower than I would have wished for but higher in terms of the opportunities than we have seen before. I hope that helps, P.J. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Faiza Alwy : So, I have two questions. One is just on gross margin. It looks like you took a step back this quarter, and I was expecting an improvement. So maybe if you could share with us what some of the puts and takes were there. And how we should think about raw materials and gross margin in 2020? And then my second question is just if you could give us a sense of how we should think about cash flow and CapEx in 2020. Rustom Jilla : Sure. So, it\u2019s Rustom. So, let me take this. So, in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable mix, right? So from what I\u2019ve learned in my first couple of weeks, raw material costs can fluctuate monthly, quarterly due to inventories. And in Taste in Q4, that\u2019s really where we saw it. They were primarily impacted by the timing of raw material cost for the balance sheet, the P&L. And that\u2019s not much different from what happened in the second quarter. We have Scent, raw materials came in much more favorable. And then if you want to think about specific commodities, in Taste, it was primarily vanilla, and incentive continues to be turpentine in China tariffs, right? Capital, you wanted to the cash flow, yes, roughly about 4.5%, next year as well. 4.5% of sales, sorry, 4.5% of sales on capital.And then, the final part of your question or at least the intermediate part of your question was about raw materials and how that would flow through into next year, right? And look, in 2020, we believe that raw material costs will stabilize, specifically in the Scent division, where we had the largest raw material increases. Our current purchases are stabilizing. And look, it\u2019s important to note, they still remain elevated at levels and that we will, as we always have, work with our customers and actions, including price increases, to cover that exposure. And I think those were your questions, right, it\u2019s good? Andreas Fibig : Actually, I think that\u2019s perfectly fine. Rustom, fantastic in the third week. No, just one word on the CapEx to give it to contextualize it a bit. As we said before, last year was our highest CapEx spending for all the reasons I said during the call, because we did a lot of investments. We have to finish off this year. And from the next year onwards, the CapEx plan is much lower and it goes more to a maintenance level of 3% to 3.5%. Because we are finishing up India and China this year, the creative centers, centers are done. And then we have just the maintenance investments, which is actually a good sign for us, and it will have a positive impact on the cash flow. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question today from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : And maybe first, just to clarify on the coronavirus, just impact. And I know the guidance doesn\u2019t officially kind of contemplate an impact, but it also you\u2019ve put a wider range to give some just some room there. Could you just contextualize for us the just to be clear, the China sales exposure? And also, just Fine Fragrance, as far as you can tell, how much you think that actually goes through global kind of duty-free and travel channels? It\u2019s probably the two areas most at risk. And similarly, on the production side, how much of your raw material production do you source from China? Andreas Fibig : Should I get started? I\u2019ll start. Adam, so we do own about 6% of our combined sales in China. That\u2019s China for China, so to say. On the travel retail, I can\u2019t tell you now because it has usually a time lag. It comes from our customers. But if you look at our one of our big beauty and cosmetic customers, they just made an announcement, and that made us think as well what the impact might be. And then the third piece is that we have, we are sourcing some of our fragrance ingredients out of China. And we certainly have other suppliers in China as well. Here, we feel much better, of course, since the factory is and that specific factory is opened since last Tuesday, we are probably on safe grounds that we can supply our ingredients to the rest of the company. But that was a bit of a worry for us as well, whether we can export out of China. So 6%, China for China. Travel retail, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re just listening to our customers because they are closer to the frontier. And then on production out of China, we believe we are good on this side. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just maybe following up on the prior question on the gross margin performance in the fourth quarter. And clearly, it came in below your plan. And I just want to be clear. I mean, if it was raw material costs and inventory, just I presumed you would have had more visibility to it. Was there a sharp kind of divergence in sales mix and the decline in Fragrance Ingredients, I would have thought it would have been a tailwind to the margin performance. I just want to make clarify a little bit, just to the surprise relative to your own plan, cycling back a couple of months, it seems like a bigger variance than I would have thought. Rustom Jilla : So yes, I mean, look, mix sales mix definitely. I mean sales mix was in there. And nothing structural, really, as we look at our and we\u2019re probably going to see gross margins recover as we go into the early part of this year in 2020. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Absolutely. And it\u2019s more timing than anything else on that one. And the good thing is that the raw material prices are now softening, again, which is helpful for this year. We certainly have taken last year, in a couple of moments, inventory positions, just to make sure that we can supply our customers, but that seems to stabilize. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question today from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Hey. I just wanted to follow up again just a bit on Frutarom. So a few things here. One is that with Frutarom being folded into Taste, to what degree will we really get visibility into this inflection you\u2019re expecting in 2020? Because when I look at Frut in the fourth quarter, even if I can see it and say, the four points, the things that you\u2019re calling transitory are, in fact, transitory, organic was still down 2%, even excluding those things in the fourth quarter. So, I\u2019m just struggling with why mid single digits is comfortable. And how and if will kind of get visibility if that would again being folded into Taste as we get into 2020? Rustom Jilla : So, Lauren, it\u2019s Rustom. Let me have a crack first at how we\u2019re -- the second part is how we track it and how we manage it. So, yes, we are going to report as two segments, but what we are going to do over the course of the year in 2020 is we\u2019re going to, as much as possible, track the Frutarom elements separately too. Now, remember, as we continue to integrate, there will be some sales that come from Frutarom that now show up that naturally migrate over into the legacy Taste part of the business. Right? So, it won\u2019t be perfect, but we\u2019re going to do our absolute best for ourselves as much as anything else to track and control that. Then... Michael DeVeau : Yes. I think, the second question and then just as kind of a point for just a reminder perspective, I think Lauren was asking -- looking at the organic growth from a Frutarom perspective, ex the ex the 53rd week, ex the three days, I think the run rate number or the right number is probably flat in the quarter. And so how does that transfer as we go forward, the confidence level at... Andreas Fibig : I would say, confidence level is pretty high right now that when we cycle through these one-times, and Lauren mentioned it and maybe when we\u2019re next week at CAGNY, we have more time to talk about it. When we go through the Russia topic from the commercial or legally, we are through. When CitraSource is basically cycling through and we see a recovery of the Natural Colors raw materials, then we will see actually good mid-single-digit growth going forward. And we will provide some visibility on this one as well. Where it is tough, and I\u2019m building here on Rustom\u2019s comment on to create visibilities on the cross sales. And you see cross sales is 0.5% to 1% point growth for this year. And most of it actually, it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio and that\u2019s tough to track. But, I think you can model it that most part of it comes out of the Frutarom portfolio, and that should be helpful for you when you model the legacy Frut business. But we are bringing it together with Taste as actually two reasons. One is a very practical business reason. It is helping with our cross-selling activities and bringing the technologies and the people very well together. That\u2019s number one. And the second one is in gearing up for the N&B integration, it simplifies our structure because we will have them in the first quarter next year, another change. And we thought it\u2019s a prudent thing to do exactly that. I hope it helps, Lauren. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : In your remarks, you said that you knocked out $20 million in costs in Frutarom. But the year-over-year increase in operating income is about $5 million. And even if you compare it to the first quarter of 2019, maybe you\u2019re $3 million up. So why isn\u2019t Frutarom earning, I don\u2019t know, $45 million if you\u2019ve lowered your cost structure by that much? Why is the number so low? Rustom Jilla : So, part of this would be currency, the currency impact as we go through the numbers. And part of the, I guess, the cost synergies that we have also have been associated with extra cost that we put in as we take out the synergies to, right? Sometimes the double operation of factories and the migration as we consolidate. Andreas Fibig : Yes. It\u2019s a fair point because we had for some of these, we had double-running costs because when you close down a factory, and basically, the receiving end, you have to ramp up already and to get it into the new one. I think that\u2019s important. And that will go away because we have closed down 10 factories last year. We will do another dozen probably until October of this year. So these double-running costs, at least for the 10 we have closed, it\u2019s gone. I think that\u2019s good. And then we had a couple of smaller divestitures versus previous year as well, and that\u2019s impacting it. Jeff Zekauskas : So, should your Frutarom operating income grow at least $50 million next year as you realize incremental synergy costs? Or that\u2019s not the right number? I mean, even if the business doesn\u2019t grow at all? Rustom Jilla : Sorry. I was going to cut in there. That number is the right number, but it\u2019s going to be spread across the three businesses, the business units. Well, 2, as we go into next year. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Because -- and let me explain why many of the savings are coming from procurement. And we see procurement synergies also in the Scent business because we just get some of the raw materials to better price, transportation. We have significant savings, for example, of packaging material, and that\u2019s the reason why you see it in the different businesses as well. But in general, the number is right. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andreas Fibig for any final or closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you very much for the discussion and the good questions. I hope I will see many of you during CAGNY, next week. That\u2019s number one. And then, we have certainly, as usual, a lot of one-o-ones planned. Have a good day. And see you soon. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFFs first quarter 2020 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the companys performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the second quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 3, 2020, and in our press release.Today\u2019s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday.With me on the call is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. At IFF with global operations in 44 countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with new challenges, but also revealed the best of best humanity at the same time.On behalf of everyone at IFF, I want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by the pandemic. I also want to thank everyone in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontlines to continue to keep our society moving towards as our thanks to all the essential workers in the consumer good supply chain of which IFF is proud to play an important role we thank you for responding so quickly and moving swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world.It is very clear that we are still in the early stages of adjusting to the challenges that pandemic poses to our world. As we will review in more detail later, the IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets. The steps we have taken in recent years including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into more categories have only served to further strengthened our ability to be a vital partner to our customers and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles.Like many, were seeing uneven impacts on our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15% of our revenue not including Fragrance Ingredients that is subject to the downward pressure right now.However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later, but while we navigate through this challenge, we are committed to providing as much for what outlook as we can. So you understand the trends driving earnings.On today\u2019s call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for the first quarter 2020, before offering a more in depth review of IFFs management of the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed financial review of the business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is very strong given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward.As you may also have seen today, we announce important progress related to our pending combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom\u2019s remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of all prepared commentary, well take any questions that you may have.Our strong performance for the first quarter of 2020 affirms the strengths of our organization and the essential position and serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start of the year with mid-single digit sales and double digit adjusted EPS ex-motorization growth. Most of which are currency neutral basis.Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to integration of the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies. As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support or combination where the DuPont N&B business and I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to build the foundation for this combination by continuing to contribute to IFFs day to day operations. All the teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers and have gone above and beyond to support our communities around the world during this time.Our strong quarter as a testament to their unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong and we have taken appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic.Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter, I am pleased to say we delivered strong improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, I have achieved sales of US$1.3 billion, which represent a 6% growth on currency neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 excluding amortization, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted operating profit of 9% to US$271 million.In addition, we expanded our operating margin excluding amortization by 60 basis points to 20.1% driven by volume growth and productivity.In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and continue to deliver currency neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February. However, for March onwards we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business and we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end markets.Rustom will touch on this in more detail later. I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today\u2019s new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world\u2019s most important manufacturers in food and beverage, as well as essential home personal care and sanitation supplies.IFFs broad-based exposure across regions, categories, and customer positions us to remain resilient, so the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and corresponding economic challenges, were as seeing certain reduction and demand in our Fine Fragrance, Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact.This represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing tremendous pickup in areas with the solutions that IFF poised absolutely critical to the production of essential products.Our categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue.Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the wellbeing of all people. Second, we are committed to preserve and continue to across the network so that we can continue meeting the needs of our customers.Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do what is the best for people and our business. At core working group, including representative from our executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged to this extended period of disruption.We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address COVID-19 developments and we are coordinating our response was federal and local health and government entities around the world. We have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our people including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at operational facilities and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, were instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well.Given IFFs vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected challenges has been India.Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business designations was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the diligence of our team and a strong working relationship was regulated. We were able to move ahead of time and response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands to the shutdown while keeping employees safe.In terms of all operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics and our lead times have increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation on raw material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material shortages might have for our customers.While we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and engaging remotely as needed and I\u2019m happy to say that all project pipeline remains solid across our entire portfolio.As I mentioned from the outset, while our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving situation, we continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of financial strengths. Specifically, we are adapting and especially disciplined approach to cost management. This means were tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that can preserve our margin profile.We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while pushing out our longer-term investments as appropriate and were considering additional ways to optimize our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections.Lastly, we have a strong cash position with US$1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence and ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn. Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have mobilized to support frontline healthcare workers and first responders across the global IFF network. IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the companys unique capabilities and innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community focused initiatives, including from New Jersey to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacturer and distribution of hand sanitizers.Today, IFF has donated more than 65 metric tons of hand sanitizers globally to first responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creative team quickly developed a new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers.Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first develop globally. In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals and police stations. These actions speak to how I\u2019m please continue to embody our commitment to care for the resource of our world and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities.I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global pandemic.With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in greater detail. Rustom Jilla : Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, I am taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance. On a currency neutral basis, IFF delivered broad based sales growth of 6% versus 2019 first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies, volume leverage and productivity initiatives and discipline research, sales and administration or RSA cost containment. And this helped produce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales.I am therefore pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency neutral margin expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis. COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in the final weeks of the quarter.It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the quarter causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be in expenses. Our currency neutral earnings per share excluding amortization grew a strong 13% with robust operating profit growth boosted by lower year-over-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate.FX adversely impacted our reported numbers pulling sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies collapsing globally against the dollar and the Euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year adjusted EPS growth.Now looking at our Scent division, on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency neutral Scent sales grew 7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in consumer fragrance with the double digit increase led by robust growth at led by robust growth in Fabric, Home & Hair Care. And while we did experience a volume lift on COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection categories, we also benefited from strong new wins including with customers where we have recently gained access through their colleagues.We also saw high single digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients led by robust volume growth. At the same time, Fine Fragrances sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail market. And it pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter.Fine Fragrance has started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1 double digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact and I will elaborate on this shortly. For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin and segment profit grew to $105 million, up 19% on a currency neutral basis driven by volume growth and lower operating expenses.Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter, having achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid-to-high single digit growth in LATAM, Greater Asia & EAME. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with very strong growth in EAME, our largest market and also LATAM.Flavors grew low single digits led by Greater Asia and Latin America and this was driven by strong commercial performance or new wins in particular in the attractive categories of beverage and dairy. Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taste business, we did commit to continue providing updates as to how sales were doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured Frutarom as a stand-alone currency neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year.For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million led by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that Taste segment profit margin appears lower than you are used to see. This is because Frutarom is now included and there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets.Now, I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page 15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter down from $47 million in 2019s first quarter primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1 2020 as well as the 2019 calendar effect.We expect the portion of this will normalize as we moved through the year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019s first quarter. We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom integration.Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6% and this was versus last years 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year in a moment. The net impact on our free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, were a negative $31 million.As a reminder, Q1 is a seasonably lowest quarter of the year and last year it was a negative $11 million. In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in the prior years first quarter and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs.As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time, given the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protective downturn. We are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term including the likes of travel, entertainment, consulting, et cetera. COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We had experienced supply chain disruptions as various countries to block down action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and, in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we\u2019ve seen in India.We also paying some of our smaller and/or COVID-19 impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted and this could be expected. We are experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine Fragrance customers. Of course we are working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuously during COVID-19 with the need to not over order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so.And we are pursuing collections from customers with overviews at being proactive with those where there is credit risk. For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing the highest returning projects while delaying longer-term investment that are not absolutely necessary at this time. And of course practically COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch or complete projects where significant travel is required. But moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in a flexible and healthy ecosystem.Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving forward, we\u2019ve outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and long term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3 times.Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with $1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close of the DuPont, N&B transaction. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. As stated in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below three times net debt-to-EBITDA within the following 24 months.Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize, I expected sales dynamic in Q2. I wanted to highlight the many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our Consumer Fragrance business. The demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high and we are well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this.In the middle box, there\u2019s Fragrance Ingredients where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and in particular the Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance Compounds business. The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service where the vast stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors have impacted away from home consumption, Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives where the retail channels have been temporarily closed and travel retail is down both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being discretionary in nature.Now more than ever IFFs broad based exposure across the regions categories and customers positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues comes from categories exposed to package food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection. So parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment.Having said this, were not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April\u2019s currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong Consumer Fragrance and Flavors offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as the additional COVID-19 related costs.We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will need for our business performance and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as Andreas noted, well provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily operation to pivot quickly and modify a daily operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business. The constantly evolving global responses to COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well.Even the extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity.With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom. I\u2019m also very pleased that today were introducing the next step in our planned integration process with N&B. As you know, we are extremely excited to combine our two customer focused and consumer led organizations with leading positions in higher value categories. Together, our product portfolio will be among the industry most robust and diverse. We have a coveted R&D program with an industry leading pipeline and most importantly we will be poised to redefine our industry by delivering essential solutions to our customers.Well remain on target to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021, until then IFF and N&B will remain independent entities and will operate separately. Since we announced our merger in December 2019, our teams have been hard at work bringing this combination to life. We have formed an integration management office, create the U.S. regulatory process, filed for regulatory clearance in Europe and China and filed our initial registration statement.The potential of this combination continues to excite our teams and we are working diligently to make sure we can hit the ground and full sprint on day one. Some of our important highlights over the past four months include completed strategic assessment of the future combined company portfolio, joint cross-function integration program in place and operational, created ideation framework to identify, assess and prioritize synergy opportunities.Today, we took another significant step forward. We have announced our purpose, vision and operating model and executive committee for the future combined company. In short, we are announcing who will be, what we intend to do and who will lead our incredible team once we combine forces with the N&B business in the first quarter of 2021. Our purpose is the why that drives everything we do. The combined companies purpose, applying science and companies for a better world. We\u2019re focused on our intend to push past traditional industry boundaries and commit to be a force for better, more sustainable future.We will shape the future of our industry with best-in-class solutions at the intersection of science and creativity where passionate organizations, made up team members who see their job as so much more. Our collective purpose inspires us every day to strive for better. It\u2019s not just that we are talented scientists and creators, but that we are passionate about using those talents to generate results for customers and for the world. We need both the rigor of scientific expertise and the imagination of new possibilities to create the best results.The fusion of both that will lead us to realizing the full potential of this combination. Everything we do is for the purpose of improving the world, lengthening life spans, replacing our sustaining resources, enhancing sensorial experiences, solving house problems and more. And together, we can do even more good.Creative science, scientific art, when science and creativity intersect, the possibilities are better. Here, innovation isn\u2019t a business department, it\u2019s our business. Incredible curiosity, relentless drive, purposeful impact, innovation is simply our way of operating and now with double the R&D resources unmatched in the industry. If you are keeping track, our people can\u2019t wait to get starting collaborating on something new. We are shaping the future of the industry for the better.Our vision is our strategy for future success. It articulates our aspirations and guides the development of future strategies and initiatives. It is a filter by which the endeavors can be evaluated. Our vision is to be the partner for essential solutions. From day one we will bring unmatched innovation and leading edge insight to anticipate what will be essential to tomorrows consumers. Helping all customers meet consumers need is at the heart of our business.We are more than a vendor or supplier. Yes, we supply the ingredients, components and solutions you require, but we also united in understanding and meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow. Essential solutions means that we will work to make both our relationship and what we provide invaluable to our customers business. It pushes us to supply the technology and knowhow that no one else can. There\u2019s customers of all sizes across the globe from startup to multinational, we have the agility and the expertise to deliver more of what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading edge insight means we are already anticipating what will be essential to tomorrows consumers. As we come together as one organization, we can help our customers meet consumers needs faster.On the operational model well leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day one and well into the future. The complimentary structure will focus organization into four divisions, taste, food and beverage, scent, health and bioscience, and pharma solutions. We carefully examined how each division goes to market, including customer overlap R&D focus and service level requirements. Among other several factors to make sure we created global divisions that we have built for success.Just as important as our four operating divisions will be our global centralized functions, each of these will work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out in particular that we will be establishing a new integrated solutions center of excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and total product solutions. We\u2019re also creating a center for commercial excellence to support our business and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource deployment, and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These two are extremely important as it will be instrumental in collaborating with the business to achieve all revenue synergy goals.We also noticed the executive committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you are interested in the teams background, please check out on stronger, innovationtogether.com. I won\u2019t go through all of these distinguished leaders here, but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significant large organization we will be able to create many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the careers of all employees.I\u2019m also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors, we are beginning to assemble. As shared at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen will join the board of the combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of the transaction and will serve as Lead Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021. I am also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont will be joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational effectiveness, and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks the value of the merger.In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined company following the close of the transaction. Mr. Davidson, is a CPA with more than 30 years of leadership experience across multiple industries. He has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco International Ltd. and Dell Incorporated and financial leadership roles at Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Davidson is the elite Independent Director like Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team, both Board and management, I know our combined company will chart a new path forward for our industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us.Stepping back, I will say that I\u2019m deeply impressed even more so during COVID-19 by the dedication of focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies would be a strong cultural match and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this combination was only grown as our teams began more and more to collaborate. As we look ahead, we are focused on executing the next key milestones and well do so within the same spend and diligence we have achieved thus far.In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter 2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial steps forward and bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life.I\u2019m also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved during these challenging times, not just for our business but for our partners, our customers and all communities.While global conditions remain volatiles in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company.I would now like to open the call for questions Operator : [Operator Instructions] Well take a question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everybody. Andreas Fibig : Hey. Good morning Mark. Mark Astrachan : Speaking of promotions, by the way congrats. Andreas Fibig : Thank you. Mark Astrachan : Senior Vice President, well-deserved there. So I guess I wanted to talk a bit about just general sales ordering patterns. You basically talk a bit about whatever you can on emerging versus developing markets, anything notable there as well as between multinational, and local and regional customers, especially related to the Frutarom business.And what are you hearing from customers regarding timing new product launches? And how does any change impact that or even just category dynamics? Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Okay, Mark, I will take it. The emerging markets in the first quarter where particular strong, Latin America by around about 10% and greater Asia by five plus nine. What we see in terms of the different categories in particular the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high teens, as well as Flavors high single and Savory Solutions in high teens as well, so really, really good results, probably strongest from the multinationals specifically in the HPC field. In Asia was all about Consumer Fragrance as well. So mid teens, really good, Taste in high single digits, most required to COIVD-19, I would say.And here, in Asia, very much across both multinationals, as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around about 4% growth with some benefits of small M&A, but still very, very good performance.I would say country-wise it depends where the COVID-19 wave has started. We have seen the first impact in Asia, particularly in China, then it moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So that\u2019s probably what you can see in the first quarter.In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all of that, it is really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our creative labs are basically almost all open. They are working on new launches. They are working on, lets say, better, lets say, improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say a very strong picture, certainly impact on Fine Fragrance because \u2013 and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive, but all the essential products are really going actually very, very strong. Rustom you might comment on that. Rustom Jilla : Yes. No, I actually agree. There\u2019s not much to add there Andreas, you covered it. Andreas Fibig : Good. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And once again, that is star one. If you would like to ask a question. Well move next to Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Sison : Hey guys that you guys all sound happy and a nice start to the year. Andreas, you\u2019ve made some progress on the transaction, getting your operating model leadership team in place. How much can you do before you close the deal to get the integration synergies accelerated? And then \u2013 and maybe just talk about how you think about the business, the transaction different now given the current environment. Andreas Fibig : Let me start probably with the second part of your question first. So combination with the DuPont N&B business is fully on, on track. And if you look at the product portfolio, its now among the industry in particular are in this COVID-19 situation, one of the most robust ones and very diverse. We are in all of the categories, number one and number two in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with combined spend upon around about $550 million, more than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows its an essential business. Probiotics are going gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas, as well.Coming back to the integration piece, so as you know, we have formed an IMO as an Integration Management Office, we cleared antitrust in the U.S. we filed in Europe and in China. The combined integration planning team can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times and I\u2019m very, very pleased how they work together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, its very, very interesting. So we really make sure that we are ready for the day one. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then the financing and then the close, hopefully in the first quarter of 2021.So I have to say that this COVID-19 has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong, very resilient business, very great market position. And I believe we\u2019re in a very, very good spot right now. Operator : Well move next to John Roberts of UBS. Your line is open. John Roberts : Thank you. For the 15% of sales that are impacted by COVID-19, have you had two sequential weeks of stable sales yet or were they still declining at the end of April? And where are those product lines sales in China versus the start of the year? Rustom Jilla : Good morning. John its Rustom, let me take that. No, we have still had sales decline even as we go through and look at that area. Its Fine Fragrance and Food Services that we really see. But let me just step back for a second. From March onwards know as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally, we had locked downs, changes in customer order patterns. We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the package food and beverage categories, as well as hygiene and disinfection, right. So we have continued strength there.I mean the part that you\u2019re referring to is that the part that we\u2019re not immune is the category is most exposed to retail end markets where stores closed and travel dropped sharply and that hasn\u2019t changed as of now. So that\u2019s Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives as well, right and also the away-from-home channels. So we\u2019re seeing that impact, and we are choosing to be \u2013 try to stay resilient, flexible, close to our customers as we possibly can be and always sort of trying to be cognizant of the safety of our employees and wellbeing as we go forward.China, regarding the China part of your question, Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio. I mean based on category demand, I mean less than 2% of total Fine. And although it was quite strong in Q1, I mean, lets see, China is opening up as well. Now Food Service in China was particularly challenged in Q1 and that\u2019s obviously COVID. And I think that answers your questions John. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Thank you. So I also just wanted to hone in on, trends that you\u2019ve seen since the quarter in April and May. And in particular, I was wondering if its possible for you to maybe disaggregate the benefit from potential stockpiling versus underlying demand. And then particularly focus on Consumer Fragrance where you had double digit growth. And I know you mentioned that emerging markets were particularly strong where I don\u2019t think that was much stockpiling. But I was just wondering if you could offer more perspective there and how you\u2019re thinking, what terms you have seen since the end of the quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about the sustainability of growth there as we go through the year? Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Sure, absolutely Faiza. Let me get started and then I hand it over to Rustom. It is hard to disaggregate the underlying demand versus stockpiling. But when we talk with many of our customers and we believe on the Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softness \u2013 its very much demand, its not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products are really used. Its not just that people put it in the pantry. That\u2019s what we see.And also on the food side when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there\u2019s no tomorrow, which is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working-from-home, instead of going to the company cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull yogurt and that\u2019s your lunch. So we see some categories very much its consumption, its moving, but I cant give you all the details.What is for us right now really important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies, we know how the consumer behaves right now, but what is sustainable so that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the new product development towards things which might, will come. We believe that everything in terms of sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products, in particular, fortified with vitamins or probiotics will stay. But there\u2019s more and more to come. So that\u2019s the work we are doing right now. So in many areas the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But Rustom, please comment. Rustom Jilla : Thanks Andrea. Thank you, good morning Faiza. So yes, look at the raw materials part of your questions. And yes, we\u2019ve had some limitations in raw material sourcing and logistics. And we activated our contingency plans very early to limit the disruption to our customers, right. And the disruptions were from material shortages because of government restriction of various sorts. As Andreas said earlier, Italy, Spain, India were three of them out there.I mean the part of your question \u2013 then you also talked about sustainability, right? Sustainability of Consumer Fragrance, we do believe this will continue to be robust, where consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately, it\u2019s just hard to get those products right. But let me address one aspect, too. I mean that\u2019s same profitability because of specifics and we got to fine right. Same profitability without [indiscernible] will be adversely impacted in Q2.I cant get into spend or can I get into specifics, but based on our largest \u2013 what our largest fine fragrance customers are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So Id expect the same for IFF and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest margin categories, well above consolidated average and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional COVID cost that we\u2019ve had in Q2, a full quarters worth, and that\u2019s just another factor. Andreas Fibig : So it all depends right now when the economy is opening up and the stores are open. And some of these products can be sold again to our all consumers. I think that\u2019s what we all are waiting. And the big experiment is not so much China because its very small for this category as Rustom said. But what will happen now in Europe, you see Germany is basically open. And we will see next week France is opening again and then Spain and Italy and then we take it from there. So its a very volatile environment, but we are very well prepared for it. I hope it helps Faiza? Faiza Alwy : Yes, thank you. Operator : Well move next to PJ Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open. PJ Juvekar : Yes, hi. Good morning. Rustom Jilla : Good morning PJ. PJ Juvekar : Andreas quick question for you. We talked about this restocking quite a bit here in the pantries, and so on and so forth. When do you think orders go back to normal level? And then as the economies open up, is there some destocking in the pantries? And related to that, that\u2019s the inventory at the sort of the core household level, but what are the inventory levels that you are applying and in the supply chain? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Okay, yes. Its a very, very important point actually. And we are looking at this. I would say in some of the countries we have seen already, normalization because people are back to work and people see that they can buy everything. You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was a very precious article around the world in many of the supermarkets, but that\u2019s back to normal.So actually we have seen already quite normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory has changed. Its different than pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping the diabetes products better for three or four months instead of one month to make sure that they are covered. But here I think in many cases we are already back to normal.On the plants, its a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges with lockdown as well. So you really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here you probably will see some elevated inventory levels for quite some time. But again situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that\u2019s our plan or basically what we assume for now, but it might change because its very dependent on the demand as well.But Rustom may be you comment. Rustom Jilla : I mean again, I mean you covered it. I mean PJ, I mean, this is really hard to predict, right, because we\u2019re going into government regulations, consumer psychology and also the possible fear of any wave twos or anything like that. I mean you never know. Its hard to predict. But even after COVID19, I mean, consumers, actual consumers, might maintain higher stockpiles as a common practice. Who knows. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Hi, guys. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Andreas Fibig : Hi, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Hi. I was hoping to get a little bit more on the performance in the first quarter in the Taste segment, specifically around the margins, I\u2019m just trying to think about margins that were essentially flat year-on-year and kind of just thinking about the against pretty healthy top line growth. So how do you construct that in terms of mix, in terms of incremental Frutarom synergies, in terms of COVID related costs? And then just thinking about the balance of the year kind of has the expectation on Frutarom synergies changed? Specifically, kind of, can you do all the facilities closures you were looking for this year given the pandemic? Andreas Fibig : Hi Adam its Rustom. Let me say that. You actually were triangulating in on exactly what the factors were. So in the \u2013 first of all, we are on track with our cost synergies target through Q1 Frutarom I mean. With more than 25% of our $50 million full year savings coming in Q1. And in terms of geography, its about three quarters Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay? The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scents performance, there\u2019s leverage. But Taste, where you\u2019re homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions which is a lower margin business. We had the lot citrus [ph] sales and then we have some added costs, right, manufacturing and procurement, and unit costs head up in the balance sheet and everything. But we also had some bad debt as we increased our bad debt provisions, not actually bad debts, but actual provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in here. Rustom Jilla : Now as for your, second part of your question, about the ongoing plans that we have, I mean, yes, there will be some delays. There is a little bit of disruption to achieving, in particular, the manufacturing synergies that we expected from Frutarom around, right. And that\u2019s quite simply because we cant \u2013 that people are not traveling out to various sites, even we are working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has mentioned too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling out to sites. So there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through.And the same thing on procurement, on the procurement end by the way, because with the huge disruption that we\u2019ve seen out there in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn\u2019t shown up in our P&L, but that\u2019s because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all this without disrupting our customers, right. But something gives and that something has one of those things that have given is pushing through some of those other synergies. Andreas, is there anything you want to add there as well? Andreas Fibig : Actually just one thing on the closure of the factories, we might have in some cases a delay of maybe two to three months. That\u2019s what we are planning, right now. So we will be done with what we saw in the mid end of third quarter, mid and end of fourth quarter. So that\u2019s the planning right now. I hope Adam that helps. Adam Samuelson : It does. Thank you. Operator : Well take a question from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. It\u2019d be good to actually just clarify that. So I think in the queue on the food integration, there were risk associated was not being done this year and said it could even extend into not just fiscal 2021, but into 2022. So into 2020 kind of clarify that versus what you had just said about only a three months delay on synergy. And then just more broadly on Frutarom, I was just curious to know kind of what drove the upside in the quarter. Is it sustainable? From what we can see, it looks like Savory was a big part of that. And just is that also \u2013 we talked about some mix dynamic, the areas in Frutarom that are coming through maybe a bit better than expected. Is that also another drive on mix? Thank you. Rustom Jilla : Okay. Let me start with a second piece first. We have seen a couple of elements of the legacy food business which performed very well and we believe its sustainable. So everything which is connected to health, we believe will be sustainable because its an incredible drive for these healthy ingredients. That\u2019s number one. The second one is on food protection, because people really want to increase shelf life and make sure that this works out well so that\u2019s going extremely well double digit. But we believe it will be also sustainable.And then on Savory, we will see the Savory Solutions has made actually extremely progress in terms of bringing it together with the legacy flavors. And we have seen good developments. This is certainly not sustainable in a double digit growth rate, it is more dependent on how quickly the economies open up and how much is in the Food Service area because that\u2019s certainly has more negative impact here as well.On the other hand this is part of this famous butchers business. People in Austria and Germany were eating meat like there\u2019s no tomorrow because all the restaurants were closed. And that helped us with sales as well. So sometimes \u2013 these are interesting dynamics. But I hope it helps us as an explanation.And then on the food integration, risk associated was not being done with the integration work before merging with DuPont. It is basically \u2013 some wanted to, on our manufacturing plants, we just hold back because we believe with N&B now we have a different way forward where we can use these capacities and can use them for some of the N&B products. So we do now everything, which we have said we are doing. Despite the things where we believe with the N&B combination, we have a better way forward when we have N&B in Board as well. So that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only thing. And that\u2019s on Tilburg in Holland, but that\u2019s it. We can talk more in detail. I hope it helps. Operator : We are now past the top of the hour. And well now conclude the call. I now want to hand it back to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yes thank you very much for the time. I hope everybody is healthy, and stays healthy. And we certainly have time to speak over the next one or two days. Thank you very much. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a good day.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2020 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 3, 2020 and in our press release, all of which are on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and which is posted on our website. With me on the call is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into some of the highlights and key accomplishments for the first half of 2020, I would like to take a moment to recognize essential workers around the world, including some of our IFFers who continue to fuel our global supply chain and keep our economy moving forward. Your strength and dedication are truly commendable and I thank you for your efforts. While we continue to operate in challenging times, I'm proud to say that our employees have continued to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our customers around the world. Today, I will focus my remarks on a review of the highlights from the first half of 2020, as well as an update of business dynamics with regards to COVID-19. Rustom will then provide a more detailed review of our Q2 financial performance. Lastly, we will provide an update on our progress towards completing the previously announced transaction with DuPont N&B. There is no question that over the last several months, our business has been operating in a very difficult environment. Nevertheless, we have acted quickly to maintain continuity across our global operations in 44 countries, while simultaneously integrating the Frutarom business and establishing the foundation for our pending combination with DuPont N&B. I'm extremely proud of what our teams around the world has accomplished as we continue to move our business forward and tirelessly serve our customers. In this uncertain environment, our business has proven to be resilient. Fortunately, approximately 85% of our portfolio serves end markets that remain in high demands for COVID-19, including food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection. Our strong performance and growth in these areas, which in the first half of 2020 was approximately 5% on a currency neutral basis, helped to partially offset expected weakness in our segments that have been most affected by the pandemic. These markets, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, have been particularly sensitive to the downward pressure of the pandemic and have seen a double-digit decline over the first half of 2020. The challenges of 2020 also affirms to us that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for the world's most import manufacturers in food and beverage, as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies. IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. Amid these challenges, we remain on track with our Frutarom integration efforts, with only modest delays due to COVID-19, achieving very good cost synergies. We continue to expect to have majority of the integration completed by the end of this year. Similarly, we continue to make significant progress with our efforts to complete our merger with N&B. We have now achieved regulatory clearance in the United States, China, Colombia and Serbia. We have filed our definitive proxy statement and look forward to the shareholder award on August 27. We continue to make significant strides in our integration planning, which is very exciting when you consider the long-term potential of the combined businesses. As we shared in our business update in June 8, 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The pandemic continues to be significant and a volatile factor in our lives. It creates uncertainty around the world, with rapidly changing operating environment and economic impacts. We are fortunate that a majority of our end markets continue to operate with relative strengths, but, as we have discussed before, our business is not totally immune from disruption of the pandemic. Turning to slide 7 and an overview of our financial performance in the first half of 2020, the first two quarters, we achieved $2.5 billion in sales, with currency neutral sales growth of 1%, which is largely attributed to the strong growth we saw in the Consumer Fragrances, which grew double digits and Savory Solutions, which was up mid-single digits. We also generated an adjusted operating profit of $478 million and adjusted EPS of $2.99, both excluding amortization. While this performance is moderately down year-over-year, these metrics reflect pressure from lower sales volume and adverse mix, as well as higher costs as a result of COVID-19. Through the prioritization of CapEx and improving our core working capital, I am pleased to report that we are able to generate significant free cash flow. For the first half of 2020, cash flow improved double digits, with operating cash flow increased 12% and free cash flow growing a very strong 94%. I'm encouraged by the resilience of our business through incredible challenging environment of the second quarter, where we saw the global peak to-date of regulatory restrictions. Moving to slide 8, I would like to walk you through IFF's effort and approach to managing through the pandemic, while ensuring the safety of our employees and our continued uninterrupted partnership with our customers around the globe. As our teams have led a truly admirable performance to deliver through the challenging period, we have also begun to look ahead to our operations in this new normal. Like I've said before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has and always will be our utmost concern and is number one priority at IFF. As many countries and cities have begun to reopen and are moving out of complete lockdown, we are keeping a close eye on the recommendations of local and global public health officials, especially as it relates to implementing our return to work protocols. With each region recovering along varying timelines, our approach is to evaluate each of our facilities and offices on a case-by-case basis. While all of our manufacturing sites are open and operating fully, most remain limited to essential employees only. As for our corporate offices, all of our non-essential employees continue to work from home as of right now. Logistics remain an operating challenge, with lead times still higher than they would be on a normal basis, but we have been able to adapt fairly quickly to new local policies with minimal incremental expense. On the procurement side, costs remained elevated, as there are still some challenges in obtaining various raw materials. We are proactively addressing the situation to secure these necessary materials going forward and evaluating opportunities to mend processes of our supply chain for the future. Finally, when it comes to our creative centers, I am proud to say that even amid a global pandemic, in typical IFF fashion, we are creating innovative solutions to support our customers, whether in person or remotely. As restrictions and closures ease, we have already seen significant improvement in our pipeline. With that, I will turn the call over to Rustom, who will discuss the Q2 results in greater detail. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Andreas. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. On slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q2 2019 and primarily driven by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which represents approximately 15% of our portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products, collectively grew 2% in the quarter on a currency neutral basis, though offset by a 38% decline on a currency neutral basis in Fine Fragrance and Food Service combined. In addition to lower sales volume, we were impacted by an adverse sales mix and unfavorable price to raw material costs in the quarter, which pressured our operating profit excluding amortization and offset operational expense savings in the quarter. Despite a lower effective tax rate and more favorable other income, therefore, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was similarly impacted in Q2, driven by the decline in operating profit. Before moving into the details, I want to take a moment to remind those that are new to the IFF story about the currency neutral sales growth methodology difference between the way we report our growth and our competitors report. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in US dollars or other hard currencies, or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency neutral sales growth, we exclude these foreign exchange-related prices in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the US dollar or euro. However, it's important to have all of you understand our performance relative to competition. During the second quarter of 2020, the stronger USD environment, plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets, had approximately a 2 percentage point currency impact on growth, if we include emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, our second quarter sales decline would have been 2% rather than 4%. Turning to slide 10, it's important to take a closer look at the underlying dynamics of our various business segments. In our first quarter 2020 conference call, I presented this slide in the outlook section as I believed it provided a good summary of the many moving parts we saw at that point in time. As we now see, much of what we expected and communicated came to fruition. As we've said before, we remain fortunate that most of IFF's business serves end markets and categories with relative strength. The categories most exposed to temporary disruption of customer access to retail markets, such as Fine Fragrance and the away-from-home channel, such as Food Service suffered. And yet, increased demand for products used in packaged food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection categories has led to strong results in Taste, excluding Food Service and in Consumer Fragrances. In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong. Yet, the pandemic created a raw materials headwind as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business forgoing external sales. I'm happy to report that in the month of July, as restrictions have eased, we have seen that the business has returned to growth, a trend that we expect to continue in the third quarter. As we approach the new normal in many regions across the world, we expect that the supply chain complications will ease and demand for away-from-home products will slowly return. Looking at slide 11, I'd like to review the underlying drivers impacting our profitability in the quarter. COVID-19 has clearly had an impact on profitability, significantly influencing volume, mix, and costs. The year-over-year change in profitability is mainly a result of a significant drop in volume, representing approximately half of our adjusted operating profit decline. Unfavorable price to raw material costs also impacted profitability, primarily in Fragrance Ingredients where prices were reduced to reflect future commodity cost reduction and where we are working through higher cost inventory. Unfortunately, with the steep decline in Fine Fragrance, sales mix was unfavorable and we also saw incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and procurement costs. To minimize these impacts, we were focused on disciplined cost management and continued productivity, both helping to protect profitability during this difficult time. We were encouraged by the realization of cost synergies from the Frutarom deal and expect this will remain core to our profitability story as we see revenues return in the coming quarters. Now, looking at our Scent division on slide 12, currency neutral sales declined 4% in the quarter. I'm happy to share that for the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, which can be attributed to robust growth in fabric, home, hair care, and personal wash. And while we did benefit from COVID-19 in some areas through higher volume, our commercial performance, or new wins was very strong, nearly 50% higher than our previous five-year average for the second quarter. Also the new core lists (16:34) where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 85% in the second quarter and represented nearly 20% of our Consumer Fragrance growth. At the BU level, this was offset largely by the 40% sales decline in Fine Fragrance due to the disruption of our consumers' ability to reach retail markets and reduced travel needs. This had an adverse impact on volume in the existing business, which was down double digits, as well as new wins which traditionally are very strong but were also down as a result of COVID-19. We also saw lower Fragrance Ingredients external sales as we prioritized our Fragrance Compounds business due to supply restrictions in India. This has now improved, and we expect performance will continue to improve going forward. Cumulatively, the Scent business had sales of $450 million, down 4%; and a segment profit of $70 million, down roughly 25% at a 15.6% profit margin. Now, moving to Taste on slide 13, we saw currency neutral sales decline 5% in the quarter. From a category perspective, as COVID-19 restrictions kept consumers from eating outside their homes, away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, saw a significant 36% decline in the quarter. To put this in context, the decline in Food Service represented about 5 percentage points of the sales decline, meaning the business would have grown, excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, North America showed resilience, yet emerging markets underperformed, given significant COVID-19 driven regulatory restriction in places like India and Latin America. India alone, which represents about 4% of total Taste sales, saw sales drop by almost 30%. From a customer perspective, we saw weakness across smaller local and regional customers, mainly Food Service. This was most evident in Frutarom, where standalone sales declined high-single digits in the second quarter. Discontinued Frutarom businesses, which will not be in the comparative periods going forward, remained headwind in Q2. So, for Taste overall, the business had $748 million in sales, down 5%; and segment profit of $107 million, down 15% for a 14.3% profit margin. Now, turning to slide 14, I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's cash flow performance and it's probably more useful to look at this year-to-date. The chart on the left is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was up 12% in the first half, which was primarily due to improvements in core working capital levels in Q2. Within core working capital, the improvement was largely driven by days payable outstanding, while days sales outstanding ended better than expected. We will continue to effectively manage our balance sheet by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and to maintain ample liquidity even during a prolonged global downturn. We also continue to invest in the business, especially as we work towards completing the Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditure as a percentage of sales was roughly 3.1% compared to 4.6% the previous year. The improvements in core working capital levels combined with the prioritized CapEx structure has led to strong free cash flow of $128 million, up 94% from the year ago period. Reflecting our confidence in our future cash flow generation, we are pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.77 per share. This marks 11 years of consecutive dividend increases and underscores our confidence in our business, our long-term strategy, and strong cash flow generation. Moving forward, we will continue to take a thoughtful approach to managing cash flow, continuing to prioritize the focus on core working capital and CapEx. Before passing back to Andreas, I want to take a moment to provide an update through the first month of the third quarter. On slide 15, you can see our sales trajectory during the first half of 2020 and the marked rebound we have seen unfold in the third quarter so far. We started the year strong in January with mid-single digit currency neutral sales growth. And although the emergence of COVID-19 impacted sales from mid-March, we are starting to see a notable performance in \u2013 improvement in performance in July. As global mobility is gradually improving and restrictions and closures are eased, the categories and markets impacted in Q2 are showing promising signs of improvement. Should the environment continue to improve, we're quite hopeful that we can regain a more normalized level of growth. And with that, let me turn back to Andreas. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rustom. Now, as we consider what the remainder of 2020 will look like for IFF, we're doing our best to anticipate performance in a global environment that remains quite volatile and unpredictable. We are actively evaluating evolving global market dynamics and regulatory conditions to understand and anticipate how these factors will impact our business performance, our people, and our customers. We are proud to supply solutions and ingredients for essential products in the food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection product categories, especially as these drive 85% of our current portfolio. As Rustom has stated earlier, our July sales performance has improved, growing in low-single digits. Consumer Fragrance continues to grow double digits and we are seeing a double-digit trend in Cosmetic Actives. Fragrance Ingredients had also improved as restriction eased, growing mid-single digits in July. In Taste, growth in Flavors in North America led by Tastepoint is more than offsetting pressure in Latin America. And we are seeing robust double-digit growth in health-oriented products, as well as an improvement in natural colors. We do, however, anticipate that Fine Fragrances and Food Services will remain impacted by market pressures in the second half of the year, but expect improving trends versus what we experienced in Q2. A good example of this is that our gelato ingredients, a category severely impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter is now up low-single digits to-date in the third quarter. As we enter the second half of 2020, we will continue to effectively manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow by targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. With the positive signs of improvement in our performance that we are beginning to see in the third quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further market improvements in the quarter and beyond. Turn to slide 17, I'm very pleased to share with you now an update on where we stand with the integration planning of our previously announced merger agreement with DuPont N&B. We made a lot of headway in the first half of 2020, reaching key milestones like clearance in the US, China, Colombia, Ukraine, and Serbia, regulatory processes and announcing our combined company's progress vision, operating model, and leadership team. We are well on our way to establishing the foundation and framework that will be essential to achieving the potential of this exciting combination. More recently, in July, we filed definitive proxy and set the date for our special shareholders' meeting in connection with the merger which will occur later this month on August 27. We expect to earn our shareholder support for this exciting combination in the coming weeks, and remain on track to completing our transaction and uniting our organization in the first quarter of 2021. In summary, I'm proud to say that IFF has stayed resilient through the first half of 2020 amid the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. We have achieved solid financial performance, while delivering for our 30,000-plus customers globally and executing on the integration processes for Frutarom and N&B. As we have said before, IFF plays a central role in the global CPG supply chain as a vital partner to world renowned brands, regional leaders and new innovators alike. Our position across end markets, customers with our global reach has created a real resiliency in our business that shines through these difficult times. With Frutarom, we are realizing the significant potential that our enhanced capabilities and expanded customer base will have for the IFF's long-term growth. Similarly, we look forward to joining forces with DuPont N&B and have made significant advancements in our integration planning and paths to regulatory and shareholder approval. I am deeply grateful to our employees across the globe, whose commitment and dedication to IFF and our customers has been unwavering. We have started to see improvements in our performance in July and remain cautiously optimistic about how this may translate into financial performance in the second half of 2020. IFF and our balanced portfolio remain well equipped to adapt and succeed in this unpredictable global environment. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : We'll take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan - Stifel Financial Corp.: Hey, good morning, everybody. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Mark Astrachan - Stifel Financial Corp.: I guess just to start. So, if you look at the broader share trend, even normalizing for how you're accounting for FX relative to peers, it seems there's a bit of an increasing divergence in your results for sales versus those of the largest F&F peers. I guess, I'm curious. Do you see the same thing, or it seems somewhat obvious to the folks from the outside in? So, I'd be curious to that perspective. And then if so, what is driving it and when should we anticipate those trends to normalize? And sort of related to that, it would seem, maybe, to trace back to the Frutarom deal. So, if true, what are you doing, best practices and such that you're putting in place, so as to not repeat those when you close the DNB (28:09) deal early next year. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Mark, for the question. I'll take it. As you alluded, certainly, it's good to take the FX reported numbers and compare apple-to-apples. I think that's number one. Number two I would say, we should judge our performance beyond just one quarter and should look at multiple quarters. And if you see, for example, in the first quarter, we led our industry in growth. I think that's a topic. The second one is, if you look at Q2, the emerging markets were pretty much under pressure. And you see that we are a bit over-indexed in the emerging markets. For example, India, we're a market leader in India with our Taste business, for example. That was actually a pretty bad hit on that business, which is, by the way, rebounding. And then we are \u2013 certainly, we're winning some smaller customers, which plays a role here as well. Fundamentally, I believe both will help us with our long-term growth, the smaller customers and the emerging market as well, as soon as we see the COVID pressures are easing. And if you look at July, I expect, actually, that the third quarter already will be \u2013 will look much different than the second quarter. That's what we have seen in our numbers for July. I think Rustom has shown it in his slide. We see it, in particular, in some of these areas where we have a good and strong performance on Consumer Fragrances, for example. You see that categories like home care or personal wash are really up in very, very high single digits. We believe that's a trend to stay. So, hygiene products will stay even after the, let's say, acute COVID crisis, quite as strong. We see a good rebound already in Fine Fragrances, so not as bad as we have seen it before. And the same holds true actually for Food Service. I just looked it up. April was our worst number and Food Service was down by 44.1%; in July, it's down by minus 7.7%. Just to tell you that the weak spots I think are improving, and the strong pieces of the portfolio are staying strong and helping us to grow our business going forward, which will help us with our mix going forward in the third quarter as well. I hope that helps, Mark. Mark Astrachan - Stifel Financial Corp.: Sure. Thank you. I guess just somewhat related to that, maybe sticking on the commentary about June versus July. So, I guess, I was surprised a bit that June was worse, given that most of your customers kind of talked about sequentially improving trends through the second quarter. So, maybe why, beyond the obvious, the comparisons for you are easier in 3Q, why did you see this improvement beginning in July? Why was June a bit worse? Does it speak to inventory levels for customers? Is it just simply third quarter, people started ordering more product? Where do you think inventory levels are for those customers? And how do you think about the durability of what you just said about July through the quarter? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, on inventory levels of the customers, it's tough to comment on, because we see huge differences from customer-to-customer, from region-to-region, and category-to-category. That's a big difference. I would say July is better for us because some of the categories which were hard hit in the second quarter, like Food Service, are improving better. That's certainly helping and that some of the emerging markets like India, for example, are performing much, much better. In July, we have actually a double-digit growth going forward and that helped us a lot. Why June had a little bit of a dip even compared to May? If I look at our daily sales, it's not so much. I think it's a comparable. I would not take this too \u2013 I think it depends also on the order pattern and what we see right now, as I said, July pretty strong for us and the order book for the third quarter is up mid-single to high-single digits as well. So, I believe that the trend will continue. So, it's a bit of phasing in there as well. But, Rustom, you please or Mike, you please comment. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I agree, Andreas. I would just \u2013 you've seen the phasing, you've seen the average daily sales. There's no deceleration in the numbers. And then coming through into July, I mean, you've seen a very nice \u2013 we've seen a very nice in comparative terms pickup in areas that were like Fine Fragrances where \u2013 compared to where they were going through May, and then June, and where July is, and then Food Service, as Andreas said. So, nothing, but reiterating what he said really there. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I wanted to just shift gears a little bit actually, and talk about N&B because it feels like \u2013 so you have your shareholder vote at the end of this month, and it feels to me that the deal might close soon after that, maybe earlier than your target. And I'm looking at slide 17 and I was wondering, Andreas, maybe if you could give us a little bit more color around how do you expect to go from at close, like the second to last box that you have on that slide to the revenue and cost synergy capture by end of year three. So, I'm sure we'll get into it in more detail as time goes on, but I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of a preview of how you are expecting things to play out from here. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, first of all, our assumption is still that we're closing first quarter next year. That's actually the plan also for the carve-out of the business. I think that's important. And right now, we are focusing a lot on, let's say, closing on our food integration. So, the remaining piece of it, which will happen in the early part of the fourth quarter, I think that's important. On the N&B side, as we said, we are progressing actually absolutely according to plan, in some of the areas even a couple of days ahead, which is quite interesting during the COVID environment. I think the teams are doing really a fantastic job. We see also \u2013 and just as a remark on the N&B business, you have seen when they reported, actually a bit of growth with 1%, a strong mix. 85% of the portfolio is pretty resilient against the COVID crisis as well. So very similar and a good mix in particular tilted towards the probiotics. But maybe, Rustom, if you can comment as well on the page 17? Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Absolutely, I'd love to Andreas. We're \u2013 and good morning. We are also \u2013 in a very detailed way on the synergies, on the sales synergies, we have teams from within the project from the IMO, the integration team working with our business unit people and specifically identifying opportunities to have revenue synergies and what pre-work needs to be done as much as possible. Now, obviously, we can't work together with the N&B people, but we can plan together at this point in time. And so, we are trying to do that. Likewise, on the costs, I mean, I can sort of put on a functional hat for a second. I mean, we are looking at our structure, looking at their structure, looking at our systems, looking at their systems, and basically in a very methodical way going through and trying to identify opportunities to optimize the business and make it stronger and get greater revenue growth without cost and also areas where there's duplication of costs that we can take out. So, just a bit more detail, but it's moving. We want to basically hit the ground running. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. And absolutely, and I would say on the cost savings, we're really on both parts, on the sales savings or synergy certainly as well. We have pretty robust plans in place. I just give you two numbers. We certainly have for the cost savings internally a higher number, which we are working towards. And secondly, we have started with, I think, 400 projects, which could help us with the sales synergies. We narrowed it down to around 100, to make sure that we really focus on the most important ones. And I would say these are really good and robust plans we have in place. And we still have a couple of months until day one. And \u2013 but it gives us a good feel because in some areas, as Rustom said, it's robust and we are probably even ahead of plan, which is great. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. You noted double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. I assume that included a decline in emerging markets outside of China. So, maybe you could peel that apart, how much was emerging markets, excluding China, down in Consumer Fragrance? And then how \u2013 actually how high was the rest of the portfolio? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So, we see actually a good rebound in our China business, that's for sure. But we have to say that it's not just China, we saw, for example, in July already, actually, a very strong performance of our Consumer Fragrance business in India. Actually, it might just because we looked at the numbers, it was more than 40% for July, which was kind of amazing. But it is because we had a couple of good wins and it's going very well. And we have actually a quite significant and good performance in Latin America as well, believe it or not. So, it's not just China, it is also on the Consumer Fragrance side, some of the emerging markets. Not all of them, but some of the emerging markets are actually performing better than we have expected as well. But maybe, Rustom, you give even more details. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. So, the emerging markets, there's \u2013 John, there's variation between the emerging markets rather than treating them as a particular group, right. India has been the outlier in terms of underperformance. But we have also had an impact in Latin America, in Brazil, and where we have switching from Consumer from \u2013 into Fine, where we have a significant market over there that we have seen come off. We don't really think that what's going on in emerging markets is necessarily predictive of what the future is going to be. I mean, it's just as you look at different countries, country-by-country on where they are in terms of the \u2013 on the curve of handling COVID is really what we're seeing in terms of Consumer, Food Service, Fine, I mean, all the areas basically. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: What might be interesting, John, for you and for all the colleagues on the phone as well, what we try, because in this very volatile environment, we have doubled down on our consumer insights' studies, and we look certainly how the Consumer looks like during COVID and what can we expect after COVID. And we have never drawn down on three scenes which we're sharing with our customers as well; it's health, home, and hygiene. So, we believe that in some of the areas, like, for example, hygiene and we see it in our Scent products we are selling there, this is a trend which will stay even post-COVID. And as I said, our home care in July, category is up by 27% and personal wash by plus-16%, just to show you what the impact on the business is because these products are so much in demand. On the other hand, it's the home area. We believe that this cocooning at home will stay at least for a couple of months through the winter. So, culinary, everything which is culinary products for home cooking will stay up. We believe that malodor control is an important one. And on the health side, we see that all of our health ingredients, most of them we got through Frutarom, are very much in high demand, that the modulation of sweet is in high demand because governments are again starting to double down on sugar and products. So what I tried to say here is, that we have looked at the consumer insights quite carefully and we are basically now looking how we can orient our organization towards these trends where we believe they will stay for a while to make sure that we get more than a fair share of growth out of these categories. So that's what we're doing, just to give you a bit of a bigger picture and an outlook beyond the third quarter. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And I didn't answer the specific question by the way. The emerging market is actually mid-single digit. Just to put it in context. So not negative or anything like that, but not as strong as the developed markets, which were obviously much higher to get us to the average. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Oh, yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: A lot of ground's been covered on the revenue side, so maybe just switching to the cost side a little bit, a lot of moving pieces in the second quarter given the volume declines in mix and COVID costs. And I'm just trying to make sure I understand kind of what happened in 3Q, if we're back to organic revenue growth. Price cost, just how do we think about that dynamics playing out over the balance of the year? Kind of what's the incremental COVID-related cost expenses you expect to be absorbing in the next couple of quarters? And just thinking about kind of the operating leverage that is or is not in the business if the revenue growth is back to the trend you saw in July? Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, let me... Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely. We take this. Rustom, you take it. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Yeah. So, let me break it up and give you a thing. First of all, I'll give you the COVID-related costs, okay? And then primarily procurement, logistics and manufacturing costs. And in Q2, they were about $6 million, okay? $6 million and we would expect this to start declining as we go through the rest of the year, right? Because Q2, as we've already said, is when we thought we had the highest point. There will still be some continuing manufacturing, because as Andreas has said many times, we put the safety of our people first. And so, there are things that we are doing differently until the vaccine comes, in terms of how we manufacture. Then the second part of your question, I believe, and if I missed something, take me back. But the second part of your question was really about pricing and raw material costs, right, and what we have. So, in Q2, it was negative. I mean, our pricing actions did not fully recover our higher costs. And Fragrance Ingredients, for example, we talked about that as well. Now, moving forward, we have the oil-related costs selectively helping us as we move forward. And we should see a benefit from some of those \u2013 from \u2013 in general, the input costs, we will see a benefit coming from them, right? Definitely. We, however, will have a negative on pricing and that comes a lot from vanilla. I mean, vanilla has dropped back. It was in the 500s. It's dropped back into the 200s. I mean, it could go even lower. And so, you will see that impact on pricing. So, what we are projecting right now is for the net price to raw material costs for the rest of the year to remain negative. Did I cover the \u2013 your \u2013 both aspects of your question there? Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then just maybe following on, the cash flow performance in the second quarter was very strong. Is there any reason why that wouldn't persist in the second half of the year? Any cash flow dynamics we should be mindful of? Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I mean, we'll continue to work on cash flows. So, let me sort of just break up the components, right? I mean, first of all, on our CapEx, I mean, we've been very focused on our CapEx, very early literally from probably February or so. And we set ourselves the target of spending roughly about 10% less on our CapEx for the year than our budget. And we're running even below that, by the way, at this point in time, but that will continue. That's the CapEx, right? We're watching our cash expenses, in general, across the board. And some things are obvious and you'll see that like some things benefit EBITDA, like travel, which will keep coming through. But the other biggest one is working capital. And on our working capital, if you remember what we said even a few months ago, we deliberately moved to build up our inventories so as to avoid customer disruption. I mean, because the two things we tried to do is keep our people safe and avoid disrupting our customers, right? And so far, we've managed to do both. Inventory, we \u2013 inventory actually, because of lags in actually receiving it, we were actually a little bit better in Q1 than we expected, a little bit worse in Q2. We do expect that to start to come down now gradually as we go through Q3 and Q4 as we have built it up, right? On our DSO, which is the other big area where we flagged that we were expecting an increase, we actually did particularly well in terms of \u2013 compared to where we expected to be. And that was just, say, a lot of focused management from the teams. And that should continue and we would hope as the broad economic situation abates and things get a little bit better, we'd hope to do well on that, too. And then the last component of it was just payables. I mean, we managed that very tightly, in terms of making \u2013 sometimes accelerating payments and there's smaller suppliers that we want to keep afloat. And other times, just managing it very tightly, like you'd expect from any company of our size. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. So first, could you update us on regulatory developments on Nutrition & Biosciences transaction in Europe? Why haven't we received a ruling from Europe and do you expect to get one before the shareholder vote? Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We expect actually in the August-September timeframe the ruling. We were going back and forth with them to answer the questions before the summer break. And I think in the next couple of weeks, we should get the clearance in Europe. That's what our lawyers are telling us. So I think we should be on track. Whether we can make it before the shareholder vote, I'm not 100% sure, but early September will be my best guess right now. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then secondly, it looks like your Fine Fragrance business in the first half was down, I don't know, 25%, and maybe your key Swiss competitor was down 16%. Can you talk about the differences in like-for-like sales growth? Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Look, the differences, I would say, are, probably, with the customers. If you look at many of our big Fine Fragrance customers, you see even worse performance than the minus 20%, 25% and that's what's driving it. Because the win rate in our Fine Fragrance business is still pretty good. We see also a good influx of new projects coming. And, as we said, the start into the third quarter was actually pretty encouraging, what we have seen for Fine Fragrances. So, I would say the main differences is the customer structure and how much the customers are selling of their actual products. But I actually expect that this will normalize over the course of the year, because in general, I think our win rate in that area is a very, very good one. And we will see the \u2013 and just the \u2013 the most important season is right before the holidays, that's where we sell most of our Fine Fragrances. So, end of third quarter, early fourth quarter is actually \u2013 that's where you win the year. And that's what we have to watch and I hope when we have the third quarter announcement, that we can give you more news on that one as well. I hope that helps. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just wanted to \u2013 good morning. I wanted to ask a bit first about the US. So, the business was down slightly in the second quarter. It was a sequential improvement, because it was down closer to 1% in the first quarter. But can you talk a little bit about what's going on there because given the first half performance, it wouldn't seem to be specifically COVID-related? All consumer packaged goods sales are through the roof, when you kind of look at what's going on from an end market standpoint. So, what's going on in that business? Maybe have you lost any big contracts or things like that, because it's kind of fallen off because the performance there is, candidly, a bit surprising still? Thanks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, Rustom, can you take the numbers? Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, yeah. I mean, I think you're \u2013 are you comparing \u2013 are you including sales of Consumer Fragrances in there as well, with the Fine Fragrances or what (51:56)? Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm just looking at just US sales. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: In general, Taste and Fragrances, everything? Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Correct. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: In general, our North American business has held up relatively well. I mean, we have seen \u2013 if you look at Taste and you look at some of the performance that we've had there, we haven't really seen any big disappointments. We did have the impact in Fine, specifically in North America and Europe. And that could be coloring part of our numbers there because that's where our large global customers are concentrated, right. And in terms of our Consumer business, our Consumer business did well across the board. I mean, in developed markets and I don't have the North American number in my fingertips, but if you look at developed markets, it was in the high-teens, the growth in Q2, Consumer specifically. So, I mean... (52:52) Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. I think the numbers in the Q suggested the US entirely did not grow in the second quarter, nor in the first, and North America, in total, was like 1% or 2%. So, again, it is a huge contrast to what the majority of the customers are doing. But we'll look back at the Q and double check I haven't misread something that's in the filing. Thanks. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Sure. And we can always follow up. We can always follow up later as well, too. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. That would be good. Let's follow up on that one. Operator : We'll take our next question from James Targett with Berenberg. Please go ahead. James Targett - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Hi. Good morning. Two questions for me. Just, firstly, on innovation, you mentioned that you see the project pipeline improving as restrictions are minimized. But just generally, could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of customer appetite for innovation, new product launches, generally? Obviously, we're hearing a lot of CPG companies talk about rationalizing their innovation programs, cutting tail innovations, SKUs, et cetera. So, any color you can give on your position that'd be great. And secondly, just on the \u2013 sort of the recovery momentum you're seeing in July. Can you maybe talk about a little \u2013 any sort of differences you're seeing between the momentum in your large customers, your global customers versus your smaller or more local ones? Thank you. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely. If I touch on innovation, what we have seen actually when the COVID crisis was on its peak in Europe and in the US, so starting in March, April, even parts of parts of May, we've seen a slowdown in our innovation pipeline. Also, driven by the demand of some of the packaged food, for example, or some of the Consumer Fragrances. So, everybody was trying to get the existing product on the shelf as fast as they could. Since then actually, starting with May, we have seen actually a continuous influx of new projects, actually across the board, in all of our different categories we are playing in and there's more coming. We saw it first, obviously, in China, because that was the first country basically out of the gates in \u2013 after the COVID crisis for them and they are already almost back to normal. So, we see that many of the bigger CPGs and also the smallers are now really are back to normal. It's certainly depending customer-by-customer, but many are coming again with new projects to us. So, that's on the first one. On the second one, on the recovery, we see a recovery. We should look at country-by-country and category-by-category. Let me start with not maybe countries, but with regions. Here as well, in the recovery, Asia is now big, in particular India is surging, after India was very impacted in the second quarter. It's really coming back. We see a good comeback on Europe as well. The US is very, very good for us, maybe with the exception of the Fine Fragrance business. And we see an impact on newer projects in Latin America, where we see \u2013 and in particular in Brazil and Mexico are now at the peak of the crisis. In terms of the categories, we are happy to report back that not just everybody is looking for solutions on hygiene products, but we see also more demand and new projects on Food Service products, which is really good. I commented already on the Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrance are coming back as well. On the customer base, we certainly see it with large customers; with smaller customers, it's probably more of a mixed situation where we are in, but some of them are coming back to us as well. So I hope that helps to picturize how we see the situation right now, in terms of innovation, but in terms of recovery as well. And as I said, look, I don't want to bank too much on just the July results, but we see that the order book is quite strong as well for the rest of the quarter and that should help us, actually, with a positive performance as far as we see it. Rustom? Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. And we talked a fair amount about Scent earlier on and maybe a little bit of color on our Taste categories, right? If you look at Flavors and if you exclude the impact of India, which we have covered in Food Service, right, the big negative, all our other businesses grew at around 2.5%, and that was mainly due to an increase in North America and Greater Asia, driven by strong commercial performance there and some decrease in EMEA in EAME, due to some postponed new wins, and then of course Latin America, where you have the big negative because of COVID. Savory was another strong quarter, I mean, comparatively. I mean, the in-home consumption channels were up like over 5%, call it, mid-single digits. And again, strong performance in North America and Great Asia offset by some weakness in EMEA and that was due to Food Service because we have a lot of small Food Service customers in EMEA. And then inclusions, I mean, obviously impacted a lot by COVID, but this \u2013 as Andreas said, I mean, with gelato coming back quite strongly with what we are going there since \u2013 in the last several weeks. And finally, MPS, mixed performance in there. The health aspects of it is extremely strong. And then in some of other food protection areas, there have been some delayed launches and stuff like that. So, all in all, I mean, that just gives a bit of additional color that we didn't share earlier. Operator : We'll take our final question today from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Just two quick things. How much differently would you run your operations if we did have a long-term shift to more meals at home, a limited restaurant recovery? I'm wondering how big a restructuring that would be for you. And second, I was just hoping you could help me understand your exposure between quick serve and regular restaurants, and whether those two trended differently as you started to see recovery. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, for the meals at home, actually, we are pretty well positioned with our Savory Solutions business because we have an extra culinary area, which we're using for that area. We certainly would look and double down what we can develop here. So, I think that's an important aspect. So, I think it \u2013 I wouldn't say it would benefit us more, but it would be certainly very manageable for us as well. On QSR and retail restaurants, we have almost a similar mix. I think that's an important one. And what we see is that some of the quick service restaurants are really coming back now, which is good and it's helping us on the Food Service area as well. But, Rustom, you may comment if you have any more insights. Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I mean, it's a mix of those two. I mean, we're actually seeing the restaurants coming back as well too, if you looked at our most recent Food Service numbers. But apart from that, the quick service is clearly coming back faster. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Very good. Operator : Thank you. And this will conclude today's Q&A session. I'll return the floor to Andreas for closing remarks. Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Thank you very much for your time. And these are very exciting times. I hope we gave you good insights on how we see the business, even beyond the second quarter. And we are looking forward to the one-on-ones. Thank you very much. Take care and stay healthy. Operator : We'll conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael Deveau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.  During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in our yesterday's press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website as well. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into our third quarter performance, I would like to, once again, take a moment to thank all of our frontline workers and dedicated colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly throughout the course of this year to continue fueling our global supply chain and meeting our customers' needs. But every business is built to weather pandemic. But over the last few months, we have continued to show that our business is well equipped to navigate the most unpredictable of storms. I can't thank each and every one of our passionate employees enough of their continued hard work, dedication and focus throughout this difficult year. On today's call, I will start, as usually, by reviewing IFF's recent third quarter performance and summarizing the trends that we are experiencing across the business before providing a more in-depth review of our year-to-date performance. Rustom will then provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financials. I will then provide an outlook on the road ahead for our business and provide an update on our merger with DuPont N&B and the integration planning efforts that are well underway.  Despite the COVID-related headwinds, we saw a strong sequential improvement across all key financial metrics in Q3. We achieved 1% currency-neutral sales growth in the third quarter, a 500 bps improvement relative to our second quarter 2020 results. Outside of Fine Fragrance and Food Service, IFF's portfolio remains resilient with growth of 3% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and 4% year-to-date. Nearly every category, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, is growing, led by a third consecutive quarter of double-digit currency-neutral growth in Consumer Fragrance.  We continue to experience challenges in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which saw improve relatively in Q2 sales, declined 14% this quarter on a currency-neutral basis. These segments continue to be the most affected among our portfolio by pandemic-driven trends in retail and away-from-home channels. On our second quarter earnings call, we presented this monthly chart to provide increased transparency during the uncertain period. At the time, July finished was about 2% growth. In the subsequent months of August and September, we saw a modest deceleration in sales performance versus July, actually, largely due to weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I would like to review our year-to-date performance 2020 basis. Our Flavors category, excluding Food Service, is resilient, growing low single digits. Outside of Food Service, all categories are growing. Inclusions led the segment with impressive double-digit growth, followed by mid single-digit growth in Natural Product Solutions and Savory Solutions, again, all excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, growth was led by a double-digit improvement in North America and Greater Asia, where new win performance is strong. In EAME, results were challenged, which is in an area where we are focused on improving as we move forward. I want to take a moment to formally welcome our new Taste division leader, Kathy Fortmann. On October 1, Kathy officially took over leadership of our Taste division. She is an outstanding executive with experience across our industry and joined IFF early in 2020 as part of our succession planning for IFF as well as post our combination with N&B. In her short term with IFF, Kathy has already brought tremendous expertise and insights to our team, leading IFF integration of Taste with N&B food and beverage platform. With a proven track record of delivering growth and innovation at global food and beverage ingredients organizations, I'm confident Kathy will do an exceptional job leading our Taste business now and the Taste, Food and Beverage division following transaction close.  I also want to thank Matthias Haeni who has retired from IFF after 30 years in our industry. He had a long and successful career. And during his tenure with IFF he has advanced our position as leader within the taste industry. I wish him the very best for his next chapter. Overall, IFF Scent division continues to perform very well. I'm proud to share that we have achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, with double-digit growth in Fabric Care, Home Care, Air Care and Personal Wash. Our new core list customers where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, are growing more than 50% this year, in the third quarter provided a double-digit contribution to Consumer Fragrance growth. Particularly, I want to note that our entire Consumer Fragrance team have worked diligently through the pandemic to differentiate our offerings, win new business and achieve strong market share gains. In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong. Yet the pandemic created a raw material headwind in Q2 as we prioritized the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business foregoing external sales. As restriction has eased, the business improved sequentially, but on a year-to-year basis remains down slightly. The areas most impacted by COVID-19 have been Food Service and Fine Fragrances. On a year-to-date base, Food Service and Fine Fragrances are down almost 20% as COVID-related actions impacted consumer behavior as well as retail channels have been temporarily closed, and travel retail is down.  As I stated earlier, we are encouraged that the Fine Fragrance and Food Service improved in Q3 relative to Q2 sales on a currency-neutral basis. Yet we remain cautious about trends given the increase in COVID-19 infections more recently. Excluding Fine Fragrance, Scent has achieved strong currency-neutral growth rate of plus 8% year-to-date, while Taste has improved 2% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding Food Service. With that, I would like to pass it over to Rustom to provide more details on the third quarter. Rustom Jilla : Thank you, Andreas. Slide 8 provides a high-level overview of Q3's financial performance. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, a 1% increase from 2019's third quarter. Scent was up 4% and Taste down 1%, and I'll provide additional divisional color in a few minutes. As Andreas noted, Q3 sales recovered from Q2's low point and over 3/4 of our $69 million sequential improvement came from Scent, and total IFF sales improved in all 4 regions. In the third quarter, our adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, increased 1% to $241 million on a currency-neutral basis from 2019's Q3. Our gross profit and gross margin were both higher than the third quarter of 2019 despite higher COVID-19-related manufacturing expenses and logistics costs. Continued OpEx controls and lower T&E essentially offset additional personnel-related COVID-19 costs and other inflationary increases. On a currency-neutral basis, interest, other income and expenses, taxes and noncontrolling interests together amounted to an additional $1 million headwind versus last Q3. And adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.40, up 1%. Note that FX movements adversely impacted our reported numbers. On a reported basis, Q3 sales were flat and adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, was down 4%. Balance sheet revaluation FX losses had a large negative impact in other income and expenses as a result both of weaker emerging market currencies against the dollar and a stronger euro. Currency volatility has impacted OIE all year, with Q1 and Q3 negative and Q2 positive. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market currency devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition. So on Slide 9, I want to take a moment to show what our currency-neutral growth in the third quarter would be using the same calculation methodology of our peers. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local currencies. So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude those foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. During the third quarter of 2020, continued currency devaluations year-over-year in several key emerging markets would have added approximately 2 percentage points to growth if we include those foreign exchange-related price changes in our emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, we estimate that our third quarter currency-neutral sales growth would have been 3% versus the 1% we have shared. And using this methodology Scent with its strong LatAm businesses would have 8% plus Q3 growth, while Taste would have been flat. Moving on to Slide 10. It is worth taking a closer look at the underlying business and market dynamics influencing our overall profitability in the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, our sequential improvement in sales was accompanied by a strong rebound in profitability relative to our Q2 performance. Our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, grew 1% in Q3, clearly not what we want, but substantially better than the year-on-year decrease of 19% we reported in the second quarter. As expected, price to raw material costs was a gross margin headwind as was unfavorable mix due to our Fine Fragrance business.  Also affecting profitability for the third quarter were incremental COVID-19 costs, which essentially doubled from Q2. The incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses related to COVID-19 that we had incurred in Q2 flowed into the P&L in Q3 as inventories were used. And we also paid a bonus to our essential workers around the world as they continued their exceptional service to our customers during this unprecedented time. In the end, we were able to offset these negatives through a combination of productivity initiatives in Scent and Frutarom cost synergies in Taste and tight cost management throughout IFF.  We have been very careful with hiring, with headcount down over the course of the year, have been tighter in general within expenses and, of course, have had lower T&E costs like most businesses. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were up less than 1% despite absorbing the usual inflationary increases and COVID-19-related costs. As we forge ahead, especially in this uncertain environment, we will continue to drive growth but also review our cost structure to find additional opportunities to support overall profitability levels. Now turning to Slide 11, where we take a closer look at the performance of the Scent division in the quarter. Scent sales totaling $503 million were up 4% overall as Consumer Fragrance continues to outperform. Specifically our Fabric, Home, Hair Care and Personal Wash product categories all experienced robust growth and are also benefiting from the pandemic-related increase in global consumer staples purchases. As Andreas noted earlier, it's not all COVID-19 related. We are seeing strong growth from our new core list customers that we recently gained access to.  While Fine Fragrance sales remain challenged, Q3's 14% decrease is a significant improvement from last quarter, where sales were down 40%. Importantly, our Fragrance Ingredients business, which was impacted by COVID-19-related supply constraints in Q2, returned to growth, led by double-digit gains in Cosmetic Actives. These metrics are encouraging and reflect the recovery this summer in global retail markets and consumers' ability to reach them. In addition, the Scent division saw meaningful profit improvement this quarter, as segment profit grew 20% to $101 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, strong benefits from management productivity initiatives and cost discipline and tight OpEx controls. Moving on to Slide 12, where we focus on the performance of our Taste division. While we saw sequential improvements in Food Service compared with a 36% decline in the second quarter of 2020, this remained under pressure in the third quarter, declining 13% on a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year as the pandemic limited food consumption away from home. To put this in context, Food Service took Taste's overall sales growth down by roughly 2 percentage points. That said, the rest of the Taste portfolio, excluding Food Service, delivered positive currency-neutral growth across all global markets. One particular bright spot was North America, where IFF realized double-digit growth in Taste across nearly all categories.  We continue to see weaker growth in the other regions due to COVID-19 and related regulatory restrictions such as EAME, Latin America and Greater Asia. Natural Product Solutions, our food ingredients business, and our North American Flavors businesses were the strongest performing in the quarter, while Savory and Inclusion both more impacted by Food Service were negative in the quarter. Frutarom declined 2% compared to the prior year as their strong presence in Food Service and customer base of mostly smaller local and regional customers continued to be more adversely impacted by COVID-19. For  Taste overall, the segment achieved a 13.3% profit margin, with $102 million in segment profit on $765 million in sales. Benefits from acquisition-related synergies and tight OpEx controls were more than offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable price to raw materials costs and higher COVID-19-related costs.  Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's strong and growing cash flow position. The chart on the left illustrates the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow and includes all key drivers. Operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 8% and 30% this quarter, respectively, led by core working capital improvements and stepped up reviews of capital expenditure. Our thoughtful and disciplined approach to investments amid the pandemic has resulted in CapEx of approximately 3.3% of sales versus 4.2% the prior year.  While continuing to support our customers and suppliers, our teams have also been very focused on optimizing working capital, and our cash conversion cycle has improved 8 days year-over-year. We clearly need to generate cash, given our leverage and the impending merger with N&B. So it's good to see the improvements in days payables outstanding and days sales outstanding. Where inventory is concerned, we did see a small improvement in inventory days with more originally projected for Q4. But now with COVID-19 picking up again, we will increase our safety stocks. Note that we are not expecting to repeat last Q4's strong cash flow performance this year, primarily because of the benefit last year from extra sales and collections in the 53rd week. Further, despite continued stress in all industries across the globe, we believe that this quarter's strong balance sheet is a testament to our continued capital allocation focus and discipline. Moving to Slide 14. As we look to remainder of 2020 and into 2021, we will remain laser-focused on maintaining discipline across our balance sheet to ensure that IFF is well positioned as we navigate a prolonged challenging market environment. The situation remains highly uncertain, given the steady increase in global COVID-19 infections and the potential for additional regulatory restrictions in various regions. We're incredibly fortunate that the majority, roughly 85% of IFF's portfolio, has remained resilient and essential around the world for food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products. Unfortunately, the persistence or even worsening of the pandemic will likely translate into continued weakness for Fine Fragrance and Food Service in Q4.  I will also remind you that we face a very strong Q4 comparison to last year, which had a 53rd week of sales and profit contributions. As we noted at the time, this represented about 400 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter last year and is a large, roughly $50 million headwind, this quarter and will occur all in the last week of December 2020, impacting our monthly performance comparative significantly. This extra week last year also clearly came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it is hard to be precise, we estimate that this will represent a $15 million to $20 million headwind for us in Q4. We began the fourth quarter with low single digits growth in October on a currency-neutral basis, in line with Q3's results. Based on this first month and given the uncertainty, it's unlikely that we will see higher growth for the full fourth quarter than the 1% we achieved in Q3. That is before taking into account the headwinds from the 53rd week. In this uncertain and difficult environment, we are more than ever controlling what we can control such as OpEx and also capital expenditure. And of course, we remain focused on driving strong cash flow and reducing leverage. And with that, I'll hand it back to Andreas to discuss the near-term road ahead for IFF. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom. Before providing an update on our pre-integration work with N&B, I want to spend a moment on the progress we have made on our Frutarom integration. On Slide 15, I'm pleased to share that we have made strong strides with our Frutarom integration work. As of the third quarter 2020, we have complete integration of our business teams and believe that by the first quarter 2021 we will substantially complete our manufacturing optimization plan essentially at 90% of the consolidated -- consolidation complete. As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related complexity, we are delayed about 6 to 8 weeks was our original projection, but remain on track to be largely complete in the first quarter of 2021 around the time of our transaction close with N&B.  As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom integration initiative, we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites. For the end of 2020, we are on track to close between 20 to 24 sites around the world and expect to be completely finished by the end of 2021. With the integration of Frutarom, we have learned a lot. This experience has been important for IFF, and we will leverage these experiences and apply lessons learned as we take next step with DuPont N&B. First, we have put more ability to deliver value through cost synergies. We know how to build teams to quickly and efficiently identify and capture these opportunities in ways that create real shareholder value.  Second, revenue synergies need to align with the product development life cycle. We need to recognize in our planning that this can mean that these synergies take more time to achieve, but the key takeaways being start early to ensure delivery. As of today, we have a strong pipeline of Frutarom-related cross-selling projects, over 2,000 with a pipeline potential of approximately $235 million, and we believe we are on track to meet or exceed our target for 2021. Third, we need to recognize the potential for sales dis-synergies plan accordingly to properly mitigate and anticipate when it can't be avoided. Fourth, we must build teams and organizational functions that protect base business growth. This was a major consideration how we designed the organization structure at our future combined company. Growth through synergies and innovation have to be incremental to core business growth.  And fifth, we need to move with speed and be decisive. There's always an urge to be cautious through integration as 2 cultures learn to work together. We have to break down these barriers with focused, accountable leadership towards clear shared goals prioritizing profitable growth. I will also add that moving towards a transformational merger and working through the challenges of a global pandemic has forced all of us at IFF to work in new ways. We have learned quite a bit in these last several months and in many ways it has forced us to take a fresh look at our business in a way that I think will prove beneficial as we continue in our transformation journey. Turning to Slide 16. I'm pleased to share an update on our integration planning process for our previously announced merger with DuPont N&B. As you can see, we have reached all targets for the second half of 2020 and are on track with our targeted close date of February 1, 2021. The 3 notable milestones we achieved in the third quarter 2020 include a successful shareholder award, the completion of the permanent financing and the announcement of the executive team minus 1 leadership teams. I'm pleased to have received a strong support of IFF shareholders who have recognized this unique opportunity to create significant long-term value.  With more than 99% of the votes cast in favor, IFF shareholders have overwhelmingly approved the issuance of shares pursuant to the merger agreement, through which IFF and N&B will combine to create a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions for global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. We also completed a successful pricing of the $6.25 billion bond offering in September. This financing, together with the previously procured term loan facility, will provide N&B with the funding needed to make the special cash payment of USD 7.3 billion to DuPont in connection with the completion of our merger with N&B. I'm happy to report that there was tremendous interest in the bond offering. The interest rates were favorable and the offering was significantly oversubscribed. I'm also happy to announce that at the end of last week, we received antitrust approval in Mexico, which was 1 of the 2 remaining jurisdictions where we needed for approval. As we move towards close, we have only a few integration milestones left to reach and are confident in our abilities to execute on our post-closing time line. We anticipate receiving antitrust approval for Europe in December and will be filing our amended S-4 with updated pro formas in the coming months. I continue to be very excited about the combination between IFF and N&B. I believe we have a significant amount of opportunities to create strong shareholder value in the future. We actively review our portfolios on a constant basis, especially in light of the future combination with N&B to look to maximize our returns by driving growth in accretive categories and deprioritizing our low-value businesses by reducing allocations of expense and capital fixed or exit completely with divestitures. Moving on to Slide 17. In summary, I continue to value the continued resilience of our portfolio during an exceptionally challenging time for all industries and communities across the globe. Despite this unpredictable environment, we have delivered sustained growth across some of our largest segments and returned to growth in others in the third quarter. Our 1% currency-neutral growth for the quarter marks an important sequential improvement from Q2. And excluding Fine Fragrance and Food Service, we are pleased to have delivered 4% year-to-year currency-neutral growth with improvement across nearly all categories. We also made great progress in our N&B pre-integration planning and remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021.  As global conditions remain volatile and unpredictable, we will continue to focus on controlling the controllable, to drive strong cash flow, maintain strong operational capital discipline and leverage the strength of our portfolio to depth and succeed. I'm proud and grateful to all of our employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to ensure the continuity and resiliency of our business, all while delivering for our 30,000 customers across the globe and executing on the integration process for Frutarom and N&B. While we recognize we always have opportunities to improve, in particular, on within our Taste division, I'm confident that as we move ahead, we will improve our performance as we did in our Scent division over the past few years, both in terms of sales through new customer, core lists and margins through operational performance programs. I believe that we have the strategy and the team in place to position our organization for long-term success both now and upon uniting with N&B. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about adjusted EBIT and EBITDA performance versus your peers. So the European peers, at least by my math, have seen profit growth in the first half and anticipated for the full year. Based on what you just walked through, Rustom, I get down mid-single digits or so for your business on each in 2020. So I guess the question is why has IFF underperformed? And perhaps, could you walk through the specifics of pressures on gross margin and SG&A? And when do you anticipate those trends to normalize versus peers? And just related to that, a quick one for you, Rustom, probably. Could you just provide the Frutarom synergies in the third quarter as that was no longer provided in the Q? Rustom Jilla : Will do. And yes, a long question, so let me make sure I cover all of it. Look, first of all, on the competitors' performance, I mean, I can't really comment on our competitors' performance. But let me take you through ours and give you some context. So our year-to-date -- so, see not Q3, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, is down 4%, and that's on currency-neutral sales growth of plus 1%. So that's clearly not good, but here are the drivers. So we had a negative type this quarter. We had a negative sales mix. I mean, Fine Fragrance -- I mean you've seen the impact in Q2 in particular and minus 40% and then Q3 as well, much lesser, but you've seen it in there. There's unfavorable price to raw material costs. Now that's mainly Fragrance Ingredients, and that's mainly price reductions in advance of raw material declines. There's COVID-19-related incremental costs. I mean, we put the -- we've shown you the bridge on the slides in the quarter.  But if you look at the year, I mean we're talking about almost just a little under $20 million in costs that we've actually incurred on COVID. And incentive comp, I mean incentive comp as well year-on-year, if you remember, we expected a year-on-year headwind when we finish because of everything that had happened last year. And that has played through and to a little extent in the quarter and certainly in the full year as well. Then, of course, you've got the basic. And then on the other side, some of the positives in the year-to-date, it's been a negative on volume, and that's because of Q2. But in Q3, volume was actually a positive. And synergies, I mean, synergies have been a positive all year-long in what we've seen. And then, of course, there's productivity and cost discipline, right? So I'll come to Frutarom in a second.  Earlier in the year, we were unsure as to the severity and the duration of COVID-19. So we choke back hiring. And we acted to control expenses, but we decided against taking costs out of IFF. And now with infections rising and no line of sight as to countermeasures, I mean vaccine comments notwithstanding, we are planning on acting to reduce costs over the coming months. And then Frutarom. You asked about Frutarom. And look, despite COVID-19, we're still on track to deliver on the procurement and manufacturing optimization cost synergy of $50 million that we outlined earlier this year. We did modify the 10-Q and it's not required to disclose the exact amounts every quarter. But I can tell you, we had $10-plus million of synergies in Q3. So when you combine that with the first half savings of $32 million, that puts us at $42 million, $43 million, something like that, and clearly on track to achieve our full year $50 million goal. And Mark, just to remind you, our target was $100 million by year 2 and $145 million by year 3. Did I cover everything in there that you asked? Michael Deveau : His line may be muted. Rustom, sorry. So maybe we'll go to the next question. Mark, if you have another question, feel free to jump back in the queue. Operator : Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP. Heidi Vesterinen : So a question on Taste. I understand the pandemic related challenge in out-of-home, but it does appear that you've had additional challenges. This year, you have negative organic and margin hit by input costs. Your peers are not talking about this. Last year, I think it was destocking by multinational customers. Your peers were not seeing this. Can you talk about what explains this underperformance? And you finished your presentation talking about there being a strategy in place to change this. So could you maybe tell us about your action point? Andreas Fibig : Sure, Heidi. I can take it. I think, first, please remember that we need to adjust the reporting differences, specifically FX-related pricing. But I think Rustom talked about that. Certainly, we have an impact on the Food Service, which is happening in the home market for the competition as well. But despite that, we are not entirely happy, and there's more work to be done. We see if you zero down, in particular, some weakness in Europe, where we have to dig in and figure out how we go forward. We see actually a very strong performance in North America. And we have to model what we have done over the last, let's say, 2 or 3 years in North America, in other regions as well. So there's a program underway. And I might remind you, a couple of years ago, we had similar questions on our Scent business. We are taking it very seriously. And I think we have turned around the Scent business quite significantly. And I would say in that area, we are outperforming our competition now, in particular, on the Consumer Fragrance side. So that's what we see. And we will take the action to make sure that we fix what we have to fix here. Heidi Vesterinen : And just as a follow-up, you also talked about challenges with small and mid-sized customers. I think you had talked about it last quarter as well. Is this a short-term issue or are these business opportunities that have simply disappeared like a customer and you're exiting the market? What is happening there, please? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Sure. Absolutely. And that's a quite important question because it's strategic in a sense. We still believe that you need a good exposure to the smaller and midsized customers over long-term to grow your business. Certainly, the small customers had more impact of the COVID crisis than some of the big ones. We believe that most of them will come back to growth. And let me give you 2 examples. We see right now still quite a bit of an impact on the small customers in India, for example, where we are market leader with our Taste business, so that has an impact on our business.  On the contrary, we see actually very good results of our Tastepoint business here in the U.S., and we are starting to accelerate again with small customers. And I think what we are seeing is now since the, let's say, supply lines are again very robust and delivering, I think it gets better here as well. So you see, it depends on the region, it depends on the country, but we believe in the long-term that this is a customer base we would like to keep it because we believe we will get some good growth out of it. I hope that helps, Heidi. Operator : We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I wanted to catch up on 2 things. One was just thinking about some of the puts and takes to fourth quarter. I know Rustom you were specific on the 53rd week dynamics. But just how we should be thinking about the increased COVID costs, if there's any other one-off lapse that we should be aware for 4Q? And then the second thing was just looking back at the July S-4, the management projections that are shared there for the N&B transaction. It just struck us as interesting that you're pegging growth for IFF at 5% and for N&B at 4%. And for sure, IFF was delivering at that level before Frutarom, but not since. And N&B, I don't think has hit that number, I'm not sure, ever. So I just wanted to hear a little bit about the buildup of that projection. How much of that already assumes what you think you can do in terms of integrated solutions, but I am curious what those kind of baseline projections for the business is? Andreas Fibig : Sure. I take the first piece of it on the sales for the fourth quarter, then Rustom can comment on the cost, and then I come back on the S-4. Look, Lauren, in all honesty, it's tough on the fourth quarter. As Rustom said, we had a good start into the fourth quarter basically on all measures, in particular also on the Scent business, very, very strong start into it. But we are cautious for a couple of reasons. First of all, we see now in Europe, again, many of these, let's say, lockdowns, even if they call it soft lockdowns. So we will see what that brings for us in terms of Food Service, but Fine Fragrance business as well, which started well in October, but we will see what's happening here. But what we know is that we are running against a very strong fourth quarter last year, first of all, good growth but then also driven by the 53rd week. So still, good start into the quarter, also a good order book, but we remain cautious because of the 53rd week and also about the new lockdowns we have seen in Europe. That's the reason why we are taking a bit more of a conservative stance. But Rustom, please comment on the cost and then the operating profit side. Rustom Jilla : Yes, absolutely, Andreas. Yes, look, I mean, the situation is pretty uncertain. I mean Andreas made that point on the cost end of things, right? And we're fortunate the majority of our portfolio is resilient and essential, the food, beverage, hygiene, disinfection, all the rest of that. But we are looking right now as far as we can tell that a worsening of the pandemic, and that will likely translate into continued weakness in Q4 in our COVID-19 impacted areas, Fine Fragrance and Food Service, right? So we are kind of not 100% sure how that plays out. But Food Service already, as we think about it, we think that it's going to be probably slightly worse than Q3 was.  On COVID costs, by the way, Lauren, I mean, we had -- Q3 was big. I mean, we had close to around $13 million of COVID costs, and that's because we had about several million for the one-off costs, for the special payments that were made. In Q4, based on the run rate and how things flow-through from our inventories and all the rest of it, we'll expect a COVID cost, but much smaller number, probably closer to around the $5 million type range. So yes, you're right. And you do remember that last year as well, we talked about the 53rd week and it being 400 basis points in revenue and all the rest of that. That's a roughly $50 million sales headwind when you come around to this Q4. And the extra week also comes with a -- came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it's hard to be precise, okay, we estimate that this represents a roughly $15 million to $20 million headwind in Q4. So if you think about that, I mean, that's a big one.  And then if you look at the other numbers in there and what we may have, we also have in Q4 last year -- we had a Brazilian tax indirect, what is it -- indirect taxes last year that we got. And that was -- and that had been subject to litigation. We disclosed that in our 10-K. That was roughly about $8 million. So if you look at that, I mean, those items between them. And finally was the AIP, okay? We mentioned that the AIP was nothing -- for the whole year we talked about AIP being a $40 million headwind last year for the whole year projections in '20. And  about half of that amount will come in the fourth quarter, the delta year-on-year. There wasn't too much in Q3. But also going in the other directions, you don't think it's all simply negative, right? We have some positives. And last year in Q4 you may remember that we had inventory impacted much lower gross profit margin. And so this year, we fully expect to be at least $10 million better on that account. And then we have the synergies, as Mark asked about the synergies to start with. And so we'll have a similar positive amount compared to last year's Q4 in synergy and productivity benefits. So I think that... Andreas Fibig : Okay, Rustom. Thank you for that. So in summary, I would say, good start, but we are very cautious about the situation we are having. And I think the put and takes on the cost side Rustom explained quite well. Coming back to the S-4 question. And I think what plays an important role here is, first of all, the area where we want to focus on. What we have done a quite extensive, let's say, review of our new portfolio. And there are certainly a couple of areas, which have really good growth perspective. And I'm not giving you our guidance or budget for next year. But I would like to give you some background how we think about next year in terms of the different categories. So look, the Consumer Fragrance business has performed very well in the last couple of quarters, and we don't see any change in the fourth quarter, and we don't see too much change for the next year.  And that's a quite significant business between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, because we believe that the demand for hygiene products will stay high next year and Personal Wash as well. And as Rustom commented in his comments on the earnings, the 3 new callers are really producing now really nice growth and have enough critical mass to give us some additional growth. So that will be a good focus area. Fine Fragrance will come back eventually as soon as COVID is normalizing over the course of next year. And that gives us just technically already a nice growth going forward into the 2021. And then we see actually a good performance on the Active Cosmetic business and the Ingredients business as well. Since we have solved for the, let's say, raw material issues out of India, I think that's working well. So that should give us good growth going forward. On the Taste side, as I said, we have to focus on the most important categories where we can get growth. One of the fastest-growing areas was the beverage area for us, in particular, hard sales in the U.S. We believe that it's a good growth driver for us going forward. We see some of the Natural Product Solutions driving forward, which is -- could be the INFAT business, the food protection business and that helps us to grow nicely. And Food Service, over the course of next year, the quick-service restaurants should normalize as soon as we see some more regular business after -- in the post COVID period. So we believe that could give us good growth drivers going forward.  On the N&B side, even it's not our business now, but what I see from the outside and the pre-integration, you have a couple of business like the biorefinery business or microbial control business, which has challenges which should normalize after the COVID crisis as well. And then you see certainly businesses like the probiotics business or the cultures or enzyme business, which are going quite nicely. So we believe that could drive our growth going forward in 2021. You mentioned integrated solutions. That's certainly a growth driver as well. But I would expect this more in year 2 after the integration because it needs a bit of time that our customers not just, let's say, buying the concept, but launching these products in the marketplace as well. And then it will drive quite nice revenue synergies and certainly profit synergies as well going forward.  I hope it helps to unpack how we see the different portfolio pieces. Maybe just a remark on the regions. As I said before, we have nice growth in North America and a great momentum on both sides of our business, which is fantastic. I think Latin America is better than you might think. And hopefully, it will go better next year as well. We have a bit of a topic on Europe, which is certainly driven by COVID because Fine Fragrance has a big footprint in Europe, as you well know. Lots comes out of France and the Food Service business as well. So we will focus here to fix as much as we can. And then, hopefully, with the, let's say, introduction of the vaccine and the post-COVID period that can give us more growth going forward. So I talked a lot, but I hope that gave you a bit of a perspective how we see the world for now. Operator : Next to Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : Andreas, I have, I guess, two questions for you related to some comments you made regarding N&B. I guess the first thing is you mentioned that you've learned from -- there were some lessons that you learned from the Frutarom integration. And I'd love for you to dig a little bit more into that and how you think this one might go differently. So what are those lessons and how you intend to apply those to N&B? And then, secondly, you made some comments around the portfolio. It sounds to me like you're suggesting that there might be some divestitures. So just want to see if there's anything more -- if I'm reading that right and if there's anything more you can say regarding the timing or the size of that. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you, Faiza, for the question. Let me start with your last part. As I said, we have rigorously looked at our portfolio and there are pieces where we really want to accelerate our growth going forward because we believe it's the right thing to do. And there are pieces which might not fit too much any longer into our portfolio on the IFF side. And it's probably too early to talk about concrete pieces but we are looking actively into it, and we can't make a decision on N&B, but we are looking into the portfolio here as well. I think your read is quite spot on.  On the lessons learned, I would say there are a couple of lessons. The first one is that you need some time, if you bring these organizations together. You have to start with an aligned team and do as much work before day 1 as you can. Let me give you an example. Look, we have now announced basically up to the top 150, 170 leaders in the new organizations already. And we are still 2, 2.5 months ahead of closure. And hopefully, we will go down 1 layer further. We didn't do it because it was a shorter time frame with Frutarom. I think that's an incredible important step because we can hit the rubber or we can hit the road much, much faster than the Frutarom.  The second thing is we have done an extensive work on the integrated solutions and the cross-selling opportunities. And one of the learnings was, we were, even in food, never short of ideas, but it took longer to realize it. And as I said, we will achieve our top line synergies with food, but it took longer than we were thinking. And that was mainly driven not just selling these ideas to our customers, but until the customer was launching the actual products. And it just takes a bit of more time. And here, we were -- let's say, we started earlier. We tested more robustly our ideas. And we have planned for more time to realize it. I think that's an important one as well. And then I think we have learned a lot in terms of, let's say, optimizing our footprint. And that was going okay and well. On the food side, I think we are even better prepared now for the merge with N&B on this side as well. So a ton of learnings. I could talk even further, but this might be the most important ones. And it was very helpful. I think for us, to take on something like N&B without having had Frutarom before as an integration exercise, would have been a very, very tough one. But I think the key learnings have helped that quite a bit to be very, very well prepared. And I would say, right now, we are light years ahead of what we had with our last integration. That's what I always hear when I talk to my head of integration. I hope that helps. Operator : Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Can I ask two, please? Firstly, on the intra-quarter trends in Q3, thanks for providing that slide with the monthly sales growth. When I think back what you said with Q2 earnings call, I think I remember you said that July order book was up in the mid- to high single digits. So can you just talk about the difference between what you saw then in the order book and what actually came through to lead to the lower growth? That's the first question. And the second one, on the raw material side, Rustom, did I understand you correctly that raw material -- price to raw material was still a headwind, but you included the COVID costs into -- or some of it at least in the raw material cost? If you could clarify that, and how much that would be, if that's right? How much that would be if you strip that out? Andreas Fibig : Sure thing. Gunther, I take the first one. What we've seen in the COVID crisis is that many customers have changed a bit their behavior in terms of orders. We see at the beginning of the quarter probably more orders than usual because everybody tries to get their stuff they need. And that's true, by the way, for the fourth quarter as well, which is very high, but we are cautious because we don't know how that will, let's say, good on over the quarter. That's the reason. So we have seen, let's say, a deterioration also in the third quarter over the course of the quarter that the order book went down.  And you see sales went up a bit in October, again, but who knows what will happen in September -- in December. Sorry for that. And also the comparison is certainly a tough one. So as I said, a bit of a different order behavior of our customers, also depending on the region. We see now some movements in Europe, which is probably because of the lockdown situation. And you sit in London, and we see some movements now for the Brexit, which will now happen probably finally. And you see some movements back and forth as well. So that's the reason for that. But on the raw materials, please, Rustom, you comment. Rustom Jilla : Yes. Thanks, Andreas. Yes, in Q3, it was a negative, right? I mean -- and one of it was Fragrance Ingredients that I talked about where we continue to use high cost inventory, right? And COVID -- the COVID part within our raw materials of usage coming through was a few million dollars as well, which will be much less going into Q4, simply the lag of when we order and the inventory and when it gets used, right? In Q4, I mean, Gunther, we expect it to be still the net of pricing and raw material costs to be negative, but a very slight negative because we actually expect, in general, some positive input costs and then rest in there. So hopefully, that gives you the answer to that. Operator : Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Thomas Digenan : This is Tom Digenan on for Ghansham. So starting with Taste, could you provide some additional details on margins in the quarter and why they were down more on a year-over-year basis versus 2Q, particularly in context of the sequential improvement in Food Service and what appeared to be solid results otherwise? Rustom Jilla : Let me take that. Andreas Fibig : You go, Rustom. You go. Rustom Jilla : Thanks. Let me take this quickly. It's the -- it's COVID impact, right? If you think about the COVID costs coming through, we saw that the roughly $5 million of extra costs that we incurred in the quarter flowed through, and it was much more in Taste than it was in Scent when we had. I mean there was also -- Scent benefited -- you are comparing Scent and Taste implicitly and Scent benefited from Fine Fragrance coming back, I mean, like a minus 17% at the end and the minus 14% in the quarter. Those numbers is considerably better than the minus 40% that we had in Q2. So you saw the benefit plus a lot of productivity and cost discipline coming through the numbers. Taste was good in terms of its cost control -- of its OpEx cost control as well. But just the combination of the Food Service and the different businesses, I mean, on the gross margin, we had a tough quarter. Thomas Digenan : That's really helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. You called out a positive trends in October. Could you provide some more granularity on this from an end market and geographic perspective? And whether there's anything that's changed in November as lockdowns have been gradually reinstated? Rustom Jilla : October, I mean, Andreas, do you want me to take that? Andreas Fibig : Yes, sure. You take it. You start. Rustom Jilla : I mean, October, I mean, the sales -- I mean, it was basically -- I mean, basically, in the low single digits. I mean it was pretty much in line with Q3. We're not really seeing anything bigger from that perspective. The -- as the lockdowns come into Europe, which have been coming basically at the end of October into November, right, we do expect that's going to have a bit of an impact on our Food Service, in particular. Andreas? Andreas Fibig : No. I think that's exactly right. What we have seen actually is stronger sales on Fine Fragrances, which was positive in October, which is actually -- it's great. We will see how it pans out over the rest of the quarter. It's an important season for us because it's ahead of the holiday season. So that's important. That's what we have seen. And we have seen still a double-digit growth on Consumer Fragrances, which is great as well, but not too much of a change, as was some said of the previous quarter. And as I said, we are really looking here from week-to-week how we are moving forward. And Gunther's question was the same as how is the order book? The order book is strong, but we will see whether it deteriorates over the course of the quarter. And that's the reason why we are cautious. In terms of regions, I think Rustom is right. Europe is our focal area right now. I think it's good for North America. North America is good. Latin America is probably better than you would expect. Asia is okay because now we see that India is coming back, which is great. But Europe is still a focus area. And that's certainly driven by the new lockdowns we see all over Europe. Operator : We'll go next to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : I just have 1 question. One of the N&B revenue synergy examples cited earlier was plant-based meat. Could we get an update on what's going on in that marketplace, since it seems like there have been a lot of developments recently? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you, John, for the question. It's certainly one of our focus areas because I believe we are exceptionally strong positioned in that area going forward because we have all the ingredients to satisfy by the market here. What we see is that basically, many companies are now moving into that area. The category was suffering at the beginning a bit from quick-service restaurants being down. That is coming back now in some of the geographies, which is good. But you see more and more that these products are going into supermarkets like Whole Foods and others alike. So what I want to say here is they had a bit of a hard time at the beginning of the pandemics with the quick-service restaurants. They are coming back. We see more companies moving into that area, and we see that the whole category is growing, and that's our expectations for the years to come as well. I hope it helps, John. Operator : We'll go next to Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : A question on the way you report and walked through all these slides. Like why not use the same currency-neutral sales results as all your peers? It just seems like we're wasting time walking through all these quarter-to-quarter and candidly it's odd that you plan to flag on kind of fundamentals with this? Andreas Fibig : I couldn't agree more. I give it to Rustom. Rustom Jilla : Look, it's something we're looking at, honestly. I mean we do believe that our way of looking at it is more right, as I said earlier. And -- but at the end of the day, I mean, it is frustrating that when you compare it to our peers, it makes the report, the numbers that we put out, we're doing ourselves a disservice in an environment where the emerging currency -- where the emerging currencies are weakening. As I said in there, I'll just say 1 quick thing in point. So if you just look at our Scent's performance and if you look at our Scent performance reported on apples-to-apples basis, right, I mean we're talking about 8% type growth. So anyway, I'll leave it at that. Andreas Fibig : Yes. It's a discussion with our Audit Committee, but we're working on it. Let's put it that way. Operator : Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I wanted to come back to something, Andreas, you said in the prepared remarks around lessons from Frutarom. And you made the point on sales dis-synergies. And I was hoping if you could kind of maybe provide a little more tangible examples of where within the Frutarom experience that has been a headwind? Are you just talking like resource or other businesses there that we should be mindful that they've been a little bit more pressured? Andreas Fibig : Yes, sure. Absolutely. Look, there were some dis-synergies we have seen. Maybe we have talked about the citrus business we had out of Florida, where we have supplied 1 of our competitors. They lost their big customers, but they also have built their own, let's say, capabilities here, and we lost quite significant part of the citrus business. That's actually probably 1 of the premier examples for sales dis-synergy. We don't expect too many sales dis-synergies from N&B. But we have built it in. And we said that if we look at the sales synergies, it always has to be a net number as it is on the cost side as well. So we are very aware of that. And we make sure that we really capture it in the right way. I hope that example helps. Operator : We are out of time for Q&A. I'll turn it back to Andreas for any closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you for all of your questions. Thank you for that. It was a good discussion, and we're looking forward for the one on ones. Thank you, and stay healthy, please. Bye-bye. Rustom Jilla : Bye-bye everyone. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. We appreciate your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.   I would like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2020 conference call. Yesterday evening, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and outlook for 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike, and thank you, all who have joined us today as close to tiptoe and legacy IFF and begin a new journey with N&B. We will begin by sharing a detailed look into all fourth quarter and the full year 2020 results, and then Rustom and I will highlight the go forward outlook and opportunity for the new IFF.  I'm really excited and proud to say that as of February 1, we have officially completed our merger with DuPont N&B. Our teams have hit the ground running, establishing our new company, as an innovation leader and the global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. For the close of the N&B transaction, we also unveiled a new brand identity and purpose intended to unify our organization and best position all divisions for success. As a purpose driven enterprise, we share a mission to build from strengths and transform our industry. We are now squarely focused on execution. Building on recent performance to leverage the exciting capabilities and brought our customer base of our new company. I'm confident that the direction that we are moving and the opportunity ahead of us will lead to accelerated growth and improve profitability as we generate strong value creation and total shareholder return. Beginning with Slide 6, I would like to recap what was truly a remarkable 2020. Amidst an unprecedented pandemic, the challenge to our global organization, we delivered solid financial results, while embarking on a transformational journey to create a new industry leader together with DuPont N&B. Rustom Jilla : Thank you, Andreas. I\u2019d only cover the P&L high points on this slide and get into additional detail as we go through the following several slides. In the fourth quarter, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, down 2% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. When excluding the roughly $50 million impact of 2019s 53rd week, a comparable currency neutral growth was plus 2%. And as I'll explain on the next slide up approximately 4% counting foreign exchange related price changes as appears in many CPGs disclose. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom. Turning to Slide 17, let\u2019s focus on 2021 and the new IFF with the N&B business. Our team\u2019s executed well on the tremendous integration planning for the transformational combination, despite working remotely due to COVID-19. This integration planning effort more than a year long has provided an opportunity to create the right team and operating model needed to secure a global leadership position. It has been driven by the lessons we have learned in past integrations across both organizations, running our plans and practical experience that will enable near-term execution. We set out an aggressive timeline in 2019 to close and complete integration planning in 2020. A global pandemic only challenged us even further. But I\u2019m very pleased to say that our teams work extraordinarily well together to compete every aspect out integration planning. I\u2019m confident that the new IFF is ideally positioned to succeed. With this planning complete, we can entirely focus on execution, delivering our commitment and realizing significant revenue cost synergies, resulting in significant value creation for shareholders for the years to come. Let\u2019s move to Slide 18 and take a second and we focus on the value proposition of the new IFF. Our new company is poised to realize significant value for all of our stakeholders. And these two highly complementary companies form a true innovation partner for all customers. The new IFF will be a force in shaping the future of our industry. Our R&D investment will be 1.5 times greater than our nearest sphere. We will have number one or number two positions on core categories and nutrition, cultures, enzymes, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances. This is coupled with a broadest and most diverse customer base in our industry more than 45,000 in total and about 48% of our annual sales from small, medium and private label customers. We are well positioned to drive profitable growth for our shareholders. This allows us to enhance the value we can deliver to our customers in a very powerful way. We can deliver value to customers in every interaction from leading product offerings to significant benefits of speed to market and supply chain simplification as we deliver market leading integrated solutions. I think it is important to remember that while the N&B transaction is a culminating and transformational move, it is completely consistent how we have been evolving the portfolio over the past five years. Our friendly focused on positioning the company for where the industry is going, not where it has been. As we acquired more naturals, more regional supply chains, reaching smaller customers and increasing technology and science that innovation. Actions like Frutarom, Lucas Meyer, Ottens Flavors and others were important foundational steps as we executed this strategy. As we look ahead, we are pleased we have the most complete portfolio in the business, while portfolio may change around the edges. It is complete and gives us a right base to grow and the right assets to drives a financial results you see from our long-term targets. Put simply the new IFF will be the strongest part that to customers worldwide to corporate essential solutions for on-trend innovation. Now to Slide 19, I would like to emphasize the long-term value creation potential we have seen for IFF. Our new company has substantial synergy opportunities that will drive growth and expand margins. So our integration planning we confirmed, the run rate revenue synergy expectation at approximately $400 million by 2024 was a contribution of at least $145 million of EBITDA by that time. In addition, we expect to achieve meaningful cost savings, including a runway cost synergy expectation of $300 million by the end of 2023. We expect that execution on our plan will unlock about $50 million in EBITDA contribution in 2021. I think it\u2019s important to say that any combination is not just about synergies, but also too strong and leading based businesses. Our leaders across legacy IFF and legacy N&B businesses are committed to running every part of this business, both space business and combined to use superior results. This requires a mindset of continuous improvement and operational excellence that we\u2019re embracing across the organization. It is critical to underscore that with a comprehensive structure in place to track our progress against the identified objectives. At the center of our discussion will be synergy realization, where we\u2019ll be track diligently, including the one-time costs in both expense and capital. Our hope is to highlight on a continuous basis, all value creation leavers to provide you with a critical how component of our value creation story. And in the end, while we are focused on synergy realization, success will not be defined just as that. It will be the cumulative results where synergies are edited to base business performance for a stronger total P&L. On Slide 20, I want to highlight the actions that will be immediately taken to begin the execution. One of the most questions we get from investors is not, what will you deliver, but instead, how will you actually do it? As you can imagine, synergy capture is all about the how. And as we mentioned on January 11, there are 85 separate initiatives behind the $300 million cost savings that in our plan on the cost side and another several initiatives on the revenue side. We tried to give you a flavor for the type of actions that are part of these initiatives. In terms of revenue synergies, we\u2019ve engaged with our top global and regional customers to introduce joint portfolio and capabilities accelerated co-development partnership with global customers, activated cost division on innovation and collaboration in R&D and launch combined commercial excellence and integrated solution teams. At a high level, I would characterize the cost actions as follow. First, whether it\u2019s the publication we elevate the duplication, you can imagine across two global companies, there\u2019s a lot of duplication in back office and admin functions. Second, we look to align our cost structure with best in class PS, where it is comparable. We have undertaken benchmarking cross functions like G&A, which gives us a tangible target for improvement. No two organizations identical. So we use this as a goal rather than prescription. So it \u2013 whether it\u2019s efficiency, we spread the benefits of dollars, spend across a larger base. Let me give you an example. Also, organizations invest in R&D, but can now leverage across double the categories and customers. This is powerful and shows you the benefit of global scale for supporting cutting edge science investments. First, I would report all the power of centralized services. We have had powered regional business leaders, who drive their P&Ls, but they have access to the best in class global shared service centers in areas like HR, finance and procurement, where there\u2019s a tangible benefit to scale and combined resources. And finally, we have set all of our incentive compensation metrics to reflect in align with our waste business and integration objectives. I really hope this gives you some flavor for the how, we now know the targets we want to deliver and we have told you our long-term goals. So over the coming quarters focus will be very much on these actions. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 21. The new IFF is set to deliver a best in class financial profile and maximize value for our shareholders. This slide summarizes our long-term outlook, which we introduce to investors at the beginning of this year. From a revenue perspective, we expect continued organic sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% over the next few years, led by our unrivaled product and solutions portfolio, which is set to benefit from our industry leading R&D programs. We also expect to see meaningful operating margin improvements for IFF, including an estimated adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 26% in 2023 up around 400 basis points from our 2020 performance. The new IFF will continue to generate strong free cash flows and we expect a significant increase to approximately $2 billion in 2023. As we pursue further gross, so our capital management and delevering, we remain \u2013 that will remain a core priority. We are targeting on those three times net debt to EBITDA ratio 24 to 36 months post-close and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining our investment grade rating. Finishing on Slide 22, I would like to thank you all again for joining our call. Across the world, our teams have worked tirelessly throughout a difficult year to ensure IFF continue to serve our customers and deliver strong business results. Our full year financial results showcase the strengths of our portfolio and most importantly, our people. So those challenging environment, we made tremendous progress on our transformational journey. The formation of the new IFF together with N&B has made us an even stronger company, better positioned to deliver value for our stakeholders. With the pre-integration process completed, it\u2019s now time to execute. We have the team and structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operating goals in order to shape the future of our industry and improve our world. By global volatility is expected to persists, foundational commitment to our people, customers, communities and planet will remain unchanged as we look to strengthen and redefine our role as the industry leading ingredients and solutions partner. I\u2019m really thrilled by IFF exciting new chapter, and hope that you will join us on our pursuit to revolutionize the industry and deliver for customers, teams and shareholders. So before opening to questions, please note that our plan for Q&A today is to focus on our results and outlook and not to address questions about market rumors. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator :  And we\u2019ll take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. I guess, one question two parts on the long-term \u2013 the new long-term targets. So on the sales growth piece, what gives confidence, you can achieve 4% to 5% organic growth when you haven\u2019t achieved that level in recent years. Or I should say even both businesses haven\u2019t achieved that kind of growth in recent years you\u2019re guiding, I think Rustom said 2% to 3% organic, something like that in year one. So how do you get there? And I guess also too, just mechanically, how much contribution from the change in FX accounting would add to that. And on the same long-term targets, EBITDA margins \u2013 why the same confidence to achieve those margins, when EBITDA or EBITDA margin had been essentially flat over the last couple of years, despite cost synergies, legacy business productivity initiatives. And I get the puts and takes in 2020, but your results have been below here\u2019s from an EBITDA growth standpoint too, in recent years. So maybe if you could just touch on those, I appreciate it\u2019s a long question, but it\u2019s hopefully important. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you, Mark. A very important question. I take the first piece and then I give it on the FX to Rustom. We are very confident that we are very much on track for the long-term targets. Let me explain why. You see that for example, Scent a very important division of ours has turned around quite significantly already in a very tough year, like 2020. And we see good signs also early this year that this journey will continue. So we are basically here on very much on track. The second one is taste. And taste has a bit of a performance issue in the years 2019 and then reaching into 2020. But we have seen some sequential improvement and a good start to 2021 as well. We have done all the actions we have to take to bring this division back on track. We have basically split the European region into Europe, Western Europe, Africa, Middle East to put more focus on the emerging markets and on the more mature markets. We have put a lot of, let\u2019s say, focus on integration efforts of the Frutarom organization, particularly in Europe last year. So fully integrated and we have restructured our go-to-market strategy and it looks like that we are starting to perform well. So I think that\u2019s very confident on the legacy IFF side. On N&B, I think it depends, you\u2019ve seen a lot of pieces of the portfolio, which has a good growth profile, and we will continue and we should not underestimate that parts of the portfolio was also particular last year pressured by COVID. And that will help, at least in the second half of this year to come out of that. And secondly, we have \u2013 certainly, we have seen actually good customer response as well on their portfolio. And in terms of recent wins. On top of it, we have the cross selling and integrated solutions, which will help us to increase our growth rate as well. So we are very confident that we can do it. On the EBITDA margin, we took on legacy IFF. We took actions, we started, as I said, was Scent division or just on sales, but on EBITDA as well. We see good improvement. The same will happen on the taste side and actually I\u2019m less worried about the N&B side, because there\u2019s not actually a good EBITDA, let\u2019s say increase of margins in the last couple of years. With that, that I hand it over to Rustom to comment on FX days. Rustom Jilla : Thanks, Andrea. Hi, Mark. The guidance that we provided Mark was in dollars, right, as we rolled out, if you think back, basically if you look at the S-4 and then when we talked about the synergies additional revenue synergies that we expected. So as we FX is very hard to call. I mean, we basically ran out the FX rates that we had as of the time we provided all those forward estimates. The new way of the new methodology, which we\u2019ve talked about in any particular period and as we look back does give us a better growth rate. It doesn\u2019t change the overall actual dollars, right? Mark Astrachan : Exactly. Rustom Jilla : Yes. I think Andreas covered everything else in your question there. Mark Astrachan : Thank you, Rustom. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gunther Zechmann : Hi, good morning, Andreas. Good morning Rustom. Hi, Mike. That\u2019s almost emotional for me that you changed the reporting to the way that the European TS disclose organic sales growth. So that\u2019s a bit of a long failed wish. Can I just clarify on your 2021 guidance, what is the organic component and how much do you bake in for FX pricing? I hear what you say Rustom about FX being difficult to predict, but maybe if we break it down to what is the volume expectation and what is the, call it, underlying pricing on the back of any cost inflation that you include in your 2021 guidance, please? And then I have a follow-up as well. Rustom Jilla : The underlying \u2013 the pricing, I mean, we do expect the raw material costs during the period. I mean, higher raw material costs and recovery of that is based into our pricing as well. So maybe I\u2019ll address the FX part of it. I mean, if you think about, weighted average basket of our currencies, and we look at the biggest currencies for us the U.S. dollar is the biggest, but the Euro/Danish krona, because that\u2019s pretty much tied to the Euro. That\u2019s the second biggest. It\u2019s actually, when you put in the Danish krona, it\u2019s about 27%. Okay. Those are the two big ones. And then the other is, I mean, the Reals and of the Japanese Yen, the Indian rupee or many others, right. If we look to the weighted basket of those and if we look at the \u2013 what is in our basic budget this year was 2020 \u2013 2021 versus 2020, it was about a 1% difference. That\u2019s what we had. And then if you look at spot today, it\u2019s actually running better than that from our perspective from revenue. So our expected 2021 growth rate remains about 3.5%. That\u2019s what we put out there, right? With a small contribution from synergies and no change to the S-4  and as you\u2019ve seen from our January 2021 preliminary sales growth around 3%, we\u2019ve started, we\u2019ve started roughly in line with expectations. Gunther Zechmann : Great, thanks. If I can just follow-up, what \u2013 can you talk us through the drivers positive and negative growth as you see 2021 as part of the guidance assumptions that you\u2019ve made around COVID place. Rustom Jilla : First top of the year, we resumed that the \u2013 we would remain more or less the same broad macro impact on us. That\u2019s on fine fragrance, food, et cetera \u2013 food service, et cetera, as the second part of last year of 2020. And we expect that we recover to the second half should be better. Operator : Next we have Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael DeVeau : Faiza, are you there? Okay, maybe operator, we can go to the next question. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So Andreas I know there are some activists who are more than the market, but I know, you can\u2019t comment. Hello. Andreas Fibig : Hello? Yes, we can hear you. Faiza Alwy : Can you guys hear me? Andreas Fibig : Yes, we can. Can you go ahead? Faiza? Faiza Alwy : Hello. Andreas Fibig : Okay. Now we hear again. Operator : And we\u2019ll move next with Matthew Deyoe with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew Deyoe : Good morning. So you\u2019d said food service was down double digits on the quarter and on the gear. Can you be more specific? And we\u2019ve seen a lot of European lockdown headlines as well. So is that the decelerated in 1Q. And I guess more holistically, why didn\u2019t taste ex-food service grow mid-single digits are better? What is keeping \u2013 what ex or excluding the food service businesses keeping growth and taste in maybe the 1% to 2% range versus closer to mid single digits? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Let\u2019s talk about the food service first and thank you for the question. So food service in general, we\u2019ll come back certainly over the course of 2021 following up to the level of 2019, that we will achieve next year. But we have seen actually a better start into January was down high single digit, which was much better than we have seen in the last year. I think that\u2019s good despite the lockdowns in Europe. So it was driven by many of the other regions as well. What was impacting a taste in general was probably also the customer structure, because we had probably more, smaller customers and mid-sized customers compared to some of the competitors. But we see no good recovery and a better pipeline of new projects coming in. And as we said, actually, the start into 2021 was very, very promising. I hope that helps. Matthew Deyoe : It does. And as we look at the Scent business in 2021, what do you expect, like, fine fragrance obviously has some pretty easy comps, as we move through the year, but consumer scent business could move the other way. And how much room is there left to run on the new business wins? It seems like you made some very good traction in the back half of 2020. Andreas Fibig : Yes, no, absolutely. And as we see it for now, we triangulate that we are gaining market share here. And that has two effects. One is, as you touched on, it is certainly a COVID volume effect on personal wash and hygiene products, which we are taking fully and which is helping us to fill the growth. But we have made three new core wins, maybe year and half ago and these core wins, we are winning and growing our business quite significantly, double-digit, in these three year counts. And this has now a critical mass that it gives us some tailwind into 2021. So now the question is, will it stay a very strong business over the course of the year? And what we see right now? Yes, it will. We have started year-to-year very well as well. So we believe we will have good growth in 2022 as well on the consumer fragrance business, driven by the demand volume demand, but also by  that\u2019s very, very promising. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, thank you. Sorry about that before. I hope you guys can hear me now. Andreas Fibig : We can. Very clear. Faiza Alwy : Okay, great. So Andreas, there are some activist rumors in the market, but I know you can\u2019t comment on. But I was hoping you could reflect on your tenure as CEO. In the last few years, IFF has underperformed peers. So what do you think has driven that operating underperformance? Do you think you\u2019ve been focused on the right customers and categories? Have you invested appropriately in R&D or maybe have you been too focused on M&A, sort of, is there anything you would have done differently over the last few years? Andreas Fibig : Very good. Thank you, Faiza. First of all, when we started actually laying out or looking at our strategy in 2015, I think what went well, we had a very clear strategy, because the environment is changing or was changing. So we had different customer demands, maybe more integrated solutions, more demands for naturals. We have seen that the smaller customers have taking a bigger share, and that adjacencies play a role, not just for integrated solutions, but in general to move the business forward.  So I believe our strategy was very clear that that worked out very, very, very well. And that has led to achieve when we look at the company back in 2014, it was slightly grow of $3 billion in sales with the limited offering that point in time, and now we're in an $11 billion company with a very broad offering. And in many instances, we are number one or number two in the defined categories.  I think so our strategy and our response to the changing market was very, very good. We have basically positioned ourselves really to deliver very significant growth over the years to come. If you look at things, which might have gone better, we can touch on food or my \u2013 I think what went well is it was strategically the right move. We have good synergies on the cost side. I would say top line was challenged for many reasons. I think we learned our lesson on compliance certainly. And we probably could have integrated faster the European organization, which has done right now. I think that was important. And then in between, we certainly had the crisis in Scent we supply, and we have to turn around the business and I think that worked out very well. So in balance, I think the right strategy, the right moves, on the food side, I think some areas on the top line where some of it is compliance, let's say related, but we fixed it. I think we \u2013 and we fixed it fast, maybe faster than others would have done it. And we finally have integrated the commercial structure here as well.  So that's all what look at the next \u2013 at the last five years, and I think we are tremendously good positioned for the next couple of years right now. And I can promise you there are certainly no big acquisitions coming in the next couple of years. It's all focused about execution and shareholder value. That's very clear, because we have everything we need. Operator : We\u2019ll move next with Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In terms of the effects of COVID on the DuPont business, in your business, you said that roughly 15% of your revenues were down 15%. So there's a 2.25% penalty. Is the penalty for the DuPont business bigger or smaller? And secondly, were you a customer of DuPont previous to the merger? And if you were, was it by a lot and are the other flavor and fragrance companies customers of DuPont, Chevy and Symrise. Andreas Fibig : I can take the customer piece first and then maybe Rustom you take the first part of it. So we had some customer relationships, but very, very little. The other flavors and fragrance companies had some business with legacy DuPont, because legacy DuPont was buying some flavors as well, but to a very, very limited demand. I think that's not another big movement, but Rustom if you could take the first piece of Jeff\u2019s question, please. Rustom Jilla : Sure. It's roughly about 20% as we're getting to the numbers of N&Bs business was also impacted by COVID, Jeff. And it varied the impacts on different areas with biorefineries, microbials, food service, they raised a little bit, but that brought 15% reduction number. I would think at this point, I'd say it's in the ballpark. Operator : Our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys, good morning. Andreas Fibig : Good morning. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks for putting me in. Just first off on Slide 14, where you listed out many of your 2021 assumptions. I'm just hoping you can just kind of help us with the tax rates guidance for 2021 CapEx as well on a pro forma basis. And also the EPS waiting between the first half and second half, just given your comments about the first half being challenging relative to the current COVID environment. Thanks so much. Andreas Fibig : Rustom? Rustom Jilla : Yes. On the tax rates, I mean look, we've got a sense of how and what the taxes are, the one more time before we come out with that, right. Tax rates because remember DuPont N&B is a carve out. It's a carve out coming out of DuPont and so a whole lot of entities set up at numbers and work to be done. Their tax rate is definitely higher than our tax rate, which was in the year, it was 17.5% rate effective tax rate DuPont\u2019s is higher. We\u2019ll come back with more details there on that. Regarding the \u2013 your questions on the EPS, we actually focused on EBITDA more as the metric that we'd like to think gives us all the best from our owner's perspective, gives us the most clearest, most transparent ways of looking at it, sales and EBITDA performance on the business. And because we haven't actually provided guidance on EBITDA for the first quarter, I'd rather not sort of answer the \u2013 how the ask breakout, if you don't mind. Ghansham Panjabi : I think Rustom, the question on CapEx for the full year expectation\u2026 Rustom Jilla : No change at all from what was in our S-4 that we had out there as it was like in the high 400s, 465, I think 470, somewhere about there. We have \u2013 we expected specifically $235 million from the N&B side and $230 million from ours. Sorry, missed, I forgot that one. Operator : We\u2019ll move next with Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Andreas Fibig : Hey, good morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman : Hi, so two questions. One was more a technicality is just to understand on the long-term target of 4% to 5% FX neutral. Does that target need to change with the new methodology for revenue disclosure? Because inherently you're including some effects driven pricing in that. So I just wanted to make sure I understand that. And the second was just a longer-term question on that revenue target. And while I certainly appreciate taking a more conservative view and leaving room for delivery on synergies and so on to provide upside. I just wonder what that implies about your view on market growth, because with this transaction and with the objective of creating a different business model for the industry, your long-term revenue targets are sort of what they were before. And I'm just wondering how that relates to your view on market growth, because it just seems like a lot of work to sort of grow at the same pace you were targeting before. Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Let me Lauren I take the second piece and then I handed over to Rustom on the first piece. So listen, the revenue target and we were discussing it internally a lot. The issue right now for us is in this COVID period, we have certainly for 2021, let's say time for a slower start, because as Rustom said for the first half of the year, it's still a COVID time was a lockdown in Europe. So we take it a bit more carefully before we go full force.  We believe that the market grows will be impacted this year, in particularly the first six months. So that makes \u2013 make certain the on, let's say for a slower start. But looking further, we are actually pretty bullish, because if you take the average 4% to 5% for the following years, we had 5% and that's actually is for the two combined companies quite a nice and good target to go. And it's certainly above the average, both organizations that have done in the last two or three years. So I feel good about it. And certainly it is the focus of the execution are very, let's say, very good exposure to some of the growth markets. And then certainly the cross selling opportunities, we are having and integrated solution, as you were mentioning, we are changing a bit the business model, yes. So that's how we see it, but more to come look at the end of the day, in these volatile times, we have to move forward into a debt as fast as we can. Rustom, if you can take the first piece of the question long-term target. Rustom Jilla : Yes. Lauren, we set our long-term targets in dollars and using effects assumptions back at the time if you said that, right, actual dollars. So the methodology that we use doesn't actually change. So if the exact same situation applied over the last couple of years, our revenue dollars wouldn't have been any different, but the currency neutral growth would have been higher, right. Having said that, this is kind of interesting, if you took this morning's spot rates and assume that they extrapolated out for the entire year. I mean they are a couple of percent higher than that weighted average that we talked about earlier to answer the earlier question, right, that maybe up a percent on the prior year. So you have another couple of percent, and that would translate out into reported group, for sure, the actual reported dollar numbers would be higher, but I mean, you wouldn't see the currency neutral percentages coming off. So it's a complex kind of way of looking at it. But the bigger point, if you're looking about the way we came up with the actual numbers back then, and this is the \u2013 I just want to reinforce that. We had in the out years of our business growth from the base business without synergies and anything like that, growing at 3.5% to 4%, and that we think is realistic based on our Scent and Taste business, right. If I go back to that and the N&B business was in that ballpark as well. Okay, we think that's realistic going through those numbers. You put in the synergies, which are like $140 million in 2022 revenue and $300 million in 2023 our expectation and that's how you get up to the 5% that number is out there. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom. Michael DeVeau : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more, if that\u2019s okey. Operator : We'll take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Hi, good morning. Andreas Fibig : Hi, good morning, PJ. PJ Juvekar : Thank you for taking my question. Good, good. So I got a couple of related questions on margins. Your operating leverage in the business is not coming through. And what I mean by that is if you take your effects out on cost and currency, in Scent, your sales were up 3% profit was flat, in Taste sales was down 5% at profit was down 10%. So why isn't the bottom line growing faster than the top line? That's my first question. And then I have a quick second question. Andreas Fibig : Okay. Rustom? Rustom Jilla : Bottom line actually is growing faster. If you looked at our full year number in Scent, you will find that it's a ballpark. The full year number for us is ballpark about 3% on revenue growth, right, the way you see where it goes and much that's on profit. If you look at the \u2013 if you look at Scent in the quarter, we had and/or even quarter three for that matter, we've had very large increases coming through on that.  So we are seeing that. We have the \u2013 I think what you're factoring in, and this is an important point is on a full-year basis and also particularly in the fourth quarter, we had a large increase from AIP, right. We had a AIP going up quite a annual incentive plan, because 2019 was so bad, that there was a credit in 2019 in the fourth quarter whereas this time there were costs put in that, that I think from memory was around $27 million just to swing. I think that\u2026 Andreas Fibig : Yes. And it\u2019s important because it will not repeat actually in 2021, so that's a good thing. Rustom? Rustom Jilla : The other thing was \u2013 yes, sorry. Andreas Fibig : Move on. Rustom Jilla : The other thing there is numbers is in the year is COVID. I mean COVID costs, not COVID the impact on revenue, which we've talked about at noseeum, but COVID the impact on cost. I mean the extra air freight costs, the extra sea freight costs, the extra personal protective equipment for our people, the working different ships, the paying extra compensation by the time you factor all of those in it's probably about 20 \u2013 it was around $26 million of extra cost in the year as well. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom. Operator : And we have reached our allotted time. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Andreas for any closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you for the good question. We know we have a big line still for questions. We will continue with our one-on-ones was really good to talk to all of you and yes, more to come over the next couple of weeks and months. Thank you for that. Bye-bye. Thank you. Rustom Jilla : Bye, everyone. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your line at any time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2021 conference call. Yesterday evening, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the first quarter as well as our outlook for the full 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. .: Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our first quarter results including a review of our performance by region and segment. I would also like to share with you an update regarding our efforts to integrate DuPont N&B business, which continues to progress well, following the completion of our transaction in February. Rustom will then provide a more detailed financial review of the business highlighting segment level business dynamics and performance and cover cash flow and leverage as well. IFF is off to a strong start in 2021, and I'm confident that the momentum we have built will continue for the remainder of the year and beyond.  Now beginning with slide 6, I would like to review our performance and notable developments in the first quarter. We achieved 3% and combined sales growth or 1% on currency neutral basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. Also, because of our change to a fiscal calendar, rather than a traditional 445 calendar, we have had less two days less in first quarter. If we were to normalize for that our combined currency neutral growth in the first quarter would also have been approximately 3%. And on a two year average basis to factor in our strong 7% year ago comparison growth would be strong at approximately 5%. Rustom Jilla : Thank you, Andreas. First, let me go a bit deeper into our consolidated financial results. In the first quarter IFF generated 2.5 billion in sales, a 3% combined year-over-year increase including foreign exchange benefits, or up 1% on a currency neutral basis, primarily led by strong performances in our scent and pharma solutions division. As you may recollect from 2021 onwards, we are applying prior year average FX rates to our currency or non-US dollar revenues to derive currency neutral growth rates. This is the more common practice and makes us more comparable to our competitors. Andreas Fibig : Thank you Rustom and thanks again to all for joining us today. I would like to wrap up today's call by first giving an enormous thank you to our 1000s of employees around the world who have worked tirelessly over the last quarter to successfully execute our business initiatives, deliver for our customers and achieve solid top and bottom line business results. All while making exceptional strides integrating and envy to the IFF family. It has truly been a busy quarter and we all have much to be proud of especially as this all was accomplished during a global pandemic. Looking beyond our solid Q1 financial results, I want to re emphasize the important first step that we took in tightening our business and optimizing our portfolio strategy by agreeing to diversify our food preparation business. By diversifying this non core business IFF will be more efficient organization with a great capacity to focus on growth and innovation across our key businesses, ultimately generating greater value for our shareholders. As we enter Q2 together, we're confident that we have the right team and the right structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet all financial operational goals. As I mentioned, we are targeting strong year-over-year financial improvements with accelerated test scores over the coming quarters backed by our commitment to delivering industry leading innovative products and services to our customers around the world. And as Rustom stated, we are pleased that we have started Q2 strong and optimistic that our full second quarter sales growth should be in a highest single digit range. I'm tremendously proud of all we have accomplished and I firmly believe that the best is yet to come by taking each and every learning from the N&B integration process to create a stronger, more agile and diversified company that defines the future of our industry and showcase what it means to be a leading ingredients and solutions partner.  With that I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator :  We will take our first question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Sison : Nice start to the year. In slide 8, I thought that was really helpful. You do show some businesses at that 4% to 5% sales growth range. If you think about you have owned the business for about three months now. Can you maybe talk about what needs to happen to the other businesses below that 4% to 5% and your confidence since you've owned the business now that you can get each of these product lines sort of in that range over the next couple years? Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you Mike for the question. Yes, first of all I think that we really expect that the growth will accelerate over the course of the year. And that's driven as Rustom said as well was a good start into the second quarter, which was actually the first quarter was our toughest comparison. So that's the reason why we raised our sales expectations for the year. I think that's important. So now coming to the different parts of the business. I would say first of all we see if you look at the scent business unit, the real good recovery on fine fragrances which is really fantastic in the first quarter and also starting the second quarter which is good. We see still a great growth on cosmetic actives. So that's basically super important for us as well and the consumer fragrances stay on elevated level. If you go to the health and bioscience business, you see a couple of elements. You see that health and the conscious and food enzyme business should grow mid single digits. And you will see a recovery of the microbial control business, which was very much hurt by the situation last year. So that's important as well. And then on the Nourish side, very solid performance on taste, in particular, the legacy flavors doing very well. But on the new parts, protein solutions, via alternative proteins are doing going very well. And then you will see a turnaround in the food service as well in the countries and economies are opening up. And that's probably a general remark. We have seen good growth as you've seen in the presentation and most of the regions but in Europe, and Europe will turn around as soon as these economies are opening up after the pandemic as well. So I hope, Mike, that gives you a bit more color here. Operator : We will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks. And morning, everyone. Andreas Fibig : Morning. Mark Astrachan : I guess, broader question. It's something that we hear probably most frequently from folks out there asking about your company is why what gives confidence that IFF can sustain the share gains implied by the 4% to 5% currency neutral, long term targets that you have when growth has been below peers in recent years even adjusting for FX changes and I guess related to that first quarter growth was below peers who also had tough comparisons not as tough as yours, but still tougher comparison. So what gives confidence that you can see an acceleration applied by the guidance over balance of the year as well as long term? And I want to just kind of squeeze in a related question which is just how do we measure or how do you measure maybe your peer performance? What does the group did you use to measure your fair performance versus peers and traditionally, it's been summarized now, who should we all be paying attention to? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : So let me start with the last question first. I think you are basically named all the companies which are relevant for us, maybe you should put carry in the mix as well, in particular for food service and some of the ingredients. And then you have actually a very nice peer group together. So what we want to do on the midterm is actually what we are doing, we have done completely a strategic assessment of all the categories where we believe that we have gross and margin potential. We certainly will emphasize in terms of our resources behind these categories. Some of these categories are just for example, on health, like the probiotics business, for example, where we put good resources behind to make sure that we can outgrow the competition here. And I think if you look at the start of into the year it's 3% of gross, if you adjust for the days, and there was a very strong comparison with 7% in the last year. So we are actually quite happy with the start and we have seen some of the portfolio pieces are performing very well. Like the flavors business is coming well. You see it in the everything which is plant based and protein related, and we see some that's a turnaround as well. And I mentioned before when Mike Sison asked on the microbial control which is coming back. We see the food service business are coming back. These are all good signals that we own a really solid track now to accelerate our growth and that's the reason why we said we raised our expectation for the rest of the year. Operator : And we will take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Andreas Fibig : Morning. Adam Samuelson : So I was hoping to ask about some of the color on raw materials and costs trends. Obviously, a very dynamic raw material environment the note the increases in trade are noted. Just trying to make sure I understand kind of the magnitude of how much that has increased relative to your initial look at the year provided a few months ago? How much incremental price you're calling for or expecting and reformulation and how we think we end the year on that kind of price cost balance? Rustom Jilla : Right. Adam its Rustom. Let me take that question. So we started 2021 expecting our inflation to be low single digits, okay, with some modest increases, mostly offset by cost declines. But since then we've seen some large increases in raw materials. We've talked about them soy, bean on a whole bunch of them. Also higher freight costs due to sharply increased rates, plus higher air freight volume in specific areas where we have strong demand in a couple of inventory and supply chain challenges. But in any case, to answer your last part of your question we do not expect raw material and logistics inflation combined to be in the mid single digits this year. And obviously this requires us to go back to our customers. Operator : And we will move next with John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Lucas on for John. Thanks for the lining on the website for the four segments the extra details, they were quite helpful. So on the fifth one on R&D could you provide some breakdowns of the new R&D budget? Do you spend roughly the same percent of sales for each segment? And how much of the R&D is centralized versus how much is in control of the four segments? Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Lucas thank you for the question. So the combined company budget for R&D is approximately $620 million is about 5.5% of our annual sales. And we are certainly a leader in terms of R&D within the industry. What we have done is we went through all the different categories and technologies and look where we can put actually the best R&D dollars behind. So we\u2019re vitalizing our investment towards the highest return opportunities. And that means that we spend actually a fair amount of money on health and bioscience. I think that's very-very important. So the biotech area is one of the main investment areas for example, probiotics, enzymes, and cultures just to name one. And then we have certainly a centralized R&D approach and we have probably at least half of it on the centralized R&D and the rest goes into application and application lapse. But as I said, the big piece of our investment goes into the biotech area, which I think is super important for our customers and certainly for the development of some of our technologies going forward. I hope that helps. Operator : And we will take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about we're in a time when a lot of CPG companies are looking to reduce their COGs . And I know for legacy flavors and fragrances business these only comprise about 2% to 5% of COGs. So often we've seen customers leaning in on these ingredients to differentiate their products while cutting some more expensive items or more expensive, maybe active ingredients. But how should we think about the sort of in context of the combined business, can be used to lower other more expensive ingredients, but just would be great to get some more color from you on this. And if there are any sort of early examples of how IFF is being impacted so far by your customers need to lower costs, and if there are any sort of areas of the business that stand to benefit versus those that stand to get hurt. Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Faiza, good question. And it ties very well with the R&D question previously. So certainly we are not just offering, let's say the flavors and fragrances. So we have now a much broader set of technologies and innovative solutions. So we can play with it. And that can first of all differentiators in the marketplace, but also can help to reduce costs. For example, on the legacy IFF side we can partner with our customers. We formulate allowing to reduce the cost for example we can use our modulation technology for that to reduce costs for sweeteners in their products. But also in terms of our new platforms we have now really the leading biotech platform. And that gives us really endless opportunities to use fermentation technology, reduce input costs, and basically create some of the ingredients via biotech pathways. So actually bringing everything together gives us a very synergistic approach to help our customers not just to find super innovative solutions which are helping them to win their own clients and customers but also reduce costs. I think we are in a very-very good spot and position here. Operator : We will take our next question from Matthew Deyoe with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Matthew Deyoe : Hi, yes. So I made some comments about India exposure and the legacy NMB business on its 1Q earnings call. Just kind of wondering if you could walk through what your exposure is to India and what you're seeing there. Is it the commentary made it seem like there was some elevated exposure perhaps it's relative to their current portfolio, but we did receive a number of questions it into the quarter. Andreas Fibig : Yes, Matt, thank you for the question on India. We're probably 1% to 5% of our business in India. Actually, the Q1 was up double digit. So it was a very good performance. And it's interesting that you're asking it because it's such a desperate situation in terms of the pandemic right now. So I talk on a regular basis with our country manager and we haven't seen any slowdown of the business which is kind of interesting, but we are cautious with India. So far we haven't seen any negative impact on the business. But we are cautious and the business has won about 5% of our total business. Operator : We will move next with Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Andreas as vaccines get deployed and mobilities improved in regions such as the U.S. and China, are you seeing a related increase in new product development at the customer level as they sort of position for perhaps a broader recovery? And then also separately to clarify, in the early question raw material cost inflation what are the positive offsets as it relates to the updated EBITDA guidance, given your cost inflation has been raised from the low to mid single digits? Thanks so much. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Let me get started and then I hand it over to Rustom for the raw material part. So we see more demands coming in from all our customers which is really good. So new product development is happening. And we don't see it just with our big customers. We see it with some of the small customers coming back as well which is I think it's a good and excellent sign. And we see it in many of our categories, even on the fine fragrance side, which has shown actually very strong development in the first quarter, and a good start or excellent start into the second quarter as well. So short answer, yes, we see an uptick our second part of it, and we see it all with smaller customers as well. Rustom if you go on the raw material. Rustom Jilla : Yes. Absolutely. So we do expect negative pressure on our gross margin this year. And that's because it takes a stain to go back to our customers. So students have the additional pricing discussions and all the rest of it. So we do not expect to be able to in this fiscal year to be able to recover the full extent of the raw material increases that we're seeing and we envisage okay. However, I mean, we do have positives. We do have positives coming from FX coming through. We do have positives from higher sales volumes. And we do have the positives from lower RSA as a percentage of sales. So on a operating margin perspective that reduces the negative down quite a bit. And at the end of the day, your EBITDA, I mean, combined with our focus on everything we've talked about the cost reduction or the rest of it, we're confident that we can achieve our full year adjusted operating EBITDA goal on a combined basis, the dollars. Andreas Fibig : I think that's an important point what Rustom was just saying, because we have now with the integration, good flexibility on the RSA side basically to buffer these developments. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Gunther Zechmann : Hi, good morning Andreas, Rustom and Mike. Can I just ask on your organic sales growth outlook? You have in the slide, a page 17, 6%, I believe that reported sales growth. Can you first of all split out how much of that is like for like please and then coming back to Rustom to the discussion around raw material. How much of that will be pricing? Because I believe when you last gave guidance still with a 12 months, you gave a 3% organic sales growth guidance. But most if not all of that would have been volumes. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : So look maybe I can start and then as usual Rustom can comment on the raw materials. The organic sales growth will be 4%. That's what, currency neutral. That's what we are planning. Rustom? Rustom Jilla : Okay, so I mean, that was the I mean, I was going to say the same thing that effectively FX is helping us as well in the 6% number as we see for the whole year. So on the, Gunther the other part of your question was just in terms of recovery, right. And we do expect to recover path but not all, we haven't quantified that yet, hasn't specified that path, but not all of the increase in material costs. Does that clarify? Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. I was wondering what's the magnitude of the divestitures that you contemplate? Is it 500 million in sales or 700 million in sales or a billion? What's the scale? And secondly, in looking at your global sales review, it seems that the issue was Western and Central Europe which contracted 5%. What is it about your business in Europe that's so different than your businesses in the other region, such that you have a negative growth rate and how does that region look for the remainder of the year? Andreas Fibig : Yes, let me, Jeff thank you for the questions. The magnitude of the divestitures for the non-core businesses might be around about 5% of sales growth. That's what we are targeting right now. And in terms of Europe I think what is really important that you see the COVID impact on Europe. And that's probably the biggest impact we see right now. Because the composition of the business has a lot of food service in, for example, we have at least up to end of last year fine fragrance was impacted because a lot of it comes out of Europe as well. And that was probably the main impact. And now with the hopefully opening up of the economies in Europe and increasing vaccination rates we expect actually a good turnaround on with our European business. And actually we have seen the first signs already in April which is really-really good for us. I hope it helps to answer the question here. Operator : We will move next with PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Hi, good morning. Andreas you've talked about food service, business and fine fragrances to businesses that cannot take a hit during the pandemic. As the economy opens up and people start going out, how quickly can they get to pre-pandemic level? And then one question for Rustom you mentioned sort of your top raw materials, rattle them off. Can you talk about sort of your top five or six rank order them so we understand what is the raw material exposure of the combined company? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Okay, let me get started first. I would say on the fine fragrance side, faster than we had expected. I believe we expected end of last year still that it takes us until 22 to get back to pre-pandemic levels. But now I will be more optimistic in what we are seeing right now which is really good. Food service might take a little longer, and particularly out of Europe to get back to the pre-pandemic levels, I think we will hit it probably next year. But I would say it's very-very dependent what's happening now in a second and then in the third quarter. But as we said, fine more optimistic than the end of last year. Food service we will see and the focus here is on Europe. Rustom? Rustom Jilla : Yes, I would say that soy and locust bean kernels do standout as two of the largest in there. And the vegetable oil is much smaller and several of them. And then I mean, turpentine is something we have as well, but much smaller dimension. And of the last one that we mentioned, propylene glycol that one is fundamentally it was force majeure related and will work its way back. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Tomkins with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ryan Tomkins : Thanks very much. Hello, everyone. Yes, I'm just wondering if you could give an idea now that you've secured your first invoice for core selling and solution selling or what you might think the profile of the customer will be or who you're getting better traction with maybe in terms of size, geography products, any information will be interesting there. And then there's more of a housekeeping one. I noticed since Q4, the D&A guide has gone up a little bit, and it looks like the tax rate guiding for is quite a bit higher than what was implied in Q1. So whether we could just have a comment about that that would be appreciated. Thank you very much. Andreas Fibig : Sure, absolutely. I\u2019ll take the first one, Rustom takes the second one. So the first thing we are seeing in cross selling is that we had to first big win with a big customer. And it was actually a cross sell in between our scent business and our health and bioscience business. So it's a combination where basically we get something on the enzyme side, because we have good access through our scent business. So bigger customer, European global customer. And I think on the product side, as I said, it's in the detergent area, which I think is very-very good and very promising because we see a good pipeline. Now also on the food side coming in also for our Nourish division. So it's going actually very-very well. And I think we can make the 20 million we promised for this year, actually quite-quite nicely in 21. And now I hand it over to Rustom. Rustom Jilla : Thanks Andreas. Yes. There is no change really, I mean, we had never before actually specifically guided to the P&L ex-amount, we thought that would be more useful, because as people have pointed out to us that when doing the modeling, I mean, we are talking about our EPS, EBITDA, all the rest of that. So that's really what we did. I mean, if you look at 2020, to clarify, I mean, the adjusted P&L numbers that we had for the whole year was 17.5% and the P&L ex- 18.5 right. And so the number this year, we're going to add 21.5 is just like the roughly about 100 basis points and the difference between those two, and then the and then the rest of it is just the fact that an N&B came with a higher tax profile, which we had communicated and expected. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thanks, Rustom if we look past the nice progress on working capital, do you think that the normal progression of working capital has changed very meaningfully leaving out any discrete benefits you continue to get from the merger integration? Rustom Jilla : No, look for the rest of the year, I wouldn't be looking working capital to improve the same way at all. I mean, we had a very-very strong first quarter. I mean, we had roughly an eight day improvement in working capital days and that was driven by HIF&F inventory. That legacy IFF inventory and legacy N&B payables driving performance. As we go forward in the year we'll actually be building inventory at legacy N&B to satisfy demand and lessen the strain on our supply chain and also, the raw material cost increases we're talking about are going to increase the dollars on hand. I mean, DSO pretty stable through the rest of the year. And so we haven't specifically forecast core working capital. But basically, by the end of the year, I would think we'd expect it to go up a little bit. And that's all factored in. We are still pretty much able to deliver the 1 billion of free cash flow that we have in mind for the year as well. And that's with the working capital with the CapEx with everything. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Lisa De Neve : Hi, guys, just two from my side. So far, we've talked about the segments where you expect sales to return back to growth. So talking about the other side of the coin, I mean, which segments should we perhaps consider to normalize as we're going through the coming quarters especially as it relates to for example, the consumer fragrance, immunity exposed sales, which some categories have done incredibly well. But as well, some of your peers have flagged quite a level of stocking in some categories in the first quarter. So it would be very helpful to sort of get your view on this. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Sure Lisa. Absolutely. If I look at the different categories here the good news is, if we look at our forecast actually almost all of the categories will see some growth going forward, which is actually a great situation where we are being in. I agree with you on the consumer fragrance side where we had double digit developments in the last year we might see a bit of a normalization, but we still expect good growth and maybe single digit growth in that very important category. Another category where we have very strong comparables is probiotics. You might have seen this for a couple of months, it was for legacy N&B double digit growth last year. So we will see a normalization here, but still grows in the mid single digit range going forward. So these are the two categories which I would call out all the others are looking actually quite strong going forward in terms of growth. Operator : We'll take our next question from James Targett with Berenberg. Please go ahead. James Targett : Hello. Good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to pricing and just ask about is there anything about the new N&B business, which makes past price through harder or easier than legacy IFF thinking in terms of how long pricing input cost may take a pass on that? And just to follow up on the I think on the last question we just did in the health and bioscience division, you're taking stock growth and health and negative in cultures and food enzymes. Is that just down to the top comp? Or is there anything sort of underlying in terms of market demand there? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Let me take it and start with the second question first. It is basically tougher comparisons. That's what it is because last year or end of first quarter and into the second quarter, it was very-very-very strong, very double digit. And that was hard to, let's say, to make up this year. We have seen, let's say, in Q1, for example on the health and bioscience piece we did double digit growth. And as soon as that normalizes we will see good growth coming out of out of H&B as well because the underlying business is actually very-very good. And the demand is strong. On the pricing side on, it's basically a pass through as you were saying it's easier to raise prices compared with some of the legacy F&F businesses and so that the time like is not as long as it is for some of the F&F businesses. I hope that answers the question the first part. Operator : And we will take our final question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. I know you have covered a lot. One more thing I was curious about was the free cash flow guidance being at a billion for this year. It just strikes me as a bit low given that I think the IFF, the management case for N&B was originally calling for something closer to like 1.3 billion for 21. I know that's a 12 month number, we're only looking at 11. But that wouldn't really explain all the difference. So I was just curious kind of thoughts on why that lower free cash flow guidance for the year? Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Rustom? Rustom Jilla : Yes. Lauren hi. The 12 months versus 11 is a factor, of course, coming through the number. We expect slightly higher CapEx than we originally envisaged as we invest in the business integration capacity, normal run, maintenance, all the rest of that. We're also building as we said, a little bit more inventory than we expected to and in the legacy N&B end of the business, and so that's going to add as well. And fundamentally I mean, the rest of it is a strong EBITDA, and then the business just flows through. Operator : And it shows that we have no further questions at this time. I would now I'd like to turn the call over to Andreas Fibig for any closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you for the participation. Certainly a very busy and good quarter for us because it was the first two months as the combined company and you've seen lots of moving parts also in the external environment. But I believe IFF handled that well and I would like to thank the employees again for that first quarter and then and also we see actually, a positive sales development and expectations for the rest of the year. With that I wish you a productive end of day and talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter financial results and outlook for 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR Web site at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in yesterday's press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our Web site. Please note that we'll be using combined historical results for the second quarter, defined as three months of legacy IFF results and three months of legacy N&B results. And for the first half 2021, defined as six months of legacy IFF, January to June and five months of legacy N&B, February to June, in both the 2020 and '21 periods to allow comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021.  With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have at the end. I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our performance during the first half of 2021, followed by an update regarding our ongoing efforts to fully integrate the N&B business following the completion of the transaction in the first quarter of the year. Rustom will then provide a detailed review of our second quarter financials, highlighting segment level business performance and the market dynamics we saw in the quarter. Before we jump into the question-and-answer session, Rustom will also conclude with an overview of our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our business highlights for the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that IFF has delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, which is a robust acceleration versus our combined Q1 growth and through the first half of the year. As I've said before, execution is everything and IFS has delivered strong financial results, while advancing our ongoing integration efforts, following the completion of the N&B merger in February. In the first half of 2021, IFF achieved $5.6 billion in sales, representing 8% growth or 5% on a currency-neutral base. For comparable purposes and to reflect the portfolio differences between our peers, I want also to highlight that both businesses performed well with legacy IFF achieving a very strong high single digit growth rate with nearly 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and legacy N&B growing in mid single digits. At the same time, we continue to operate in a challenging global environment, with significant headwinds in material cost and supply chain logistics. In the first half, combined EBITDA growth was a solid 6% and a combined EBITDA margin of 22.5%. Importantly, our strong free cash flow of $533 million enables IFF to maintain significant financial flexibility, including our efforts to de-lever. We remain on track to achieve our deleveraging targets of under 3 times by year three post transaction close, and we improved our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA leverage from 4.3 times in the first quarter to 4.2 times in the second quarter. Finally, we are also well on track with integrating the N&B business and continue to realize synergies in line with our expectation for the transaction. As we sharpen the IFF portfolio, we continue to progress on the divestiture of our food preparation business, which we expect to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the divestiture of this non-core business will create a more efficient IFF with an enhanced ability to grow and innovate across the key business segments. We are committed to ongoing active portfolio management and will continue to seek ways to increase value creation. Stepping back to reflect on the first half of the year. I'm very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish. We delivered strong sales growth, which is an acceleration versus historical performance for both legacy IFF and legacy N&B, in the midst of a transformational integration as well as a global pandemic. This is a validation of our strategy, motivates our team to continue defying industry expectations as we continue to see the benefits of our expanded product offering and capabilities. Long-term growth prospects of our business are strong, and we are making investments in capacity, R&D and plant technologies, as well as increasing inventory levels and incurring higher logistic costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim, specifically in the N&B business, as we maximize our growth opportunities going forward. As we look to the third quarter and second half of 2021, our objectives are clear, build on this momentum while executing on our integration plans, allowing IFF to fully leverage our new capabilities and achieve our long-term expectations. Turning to Slide 7. I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that influenced our results for the first half. Despite persisting global challenges and varied economic recoveries, we are pleased to report growth in each of our four key operating regions. In North America, we achieved growth in all of our business segments, led by a single digit growth in Scent, Nourish and H&B. Similar to the first quarter, our Asian markets continue to perform well, achieving a 5% increase in sales led by double digit growth in India and a mid-single-digit performance in China. While we had anticipated that growth would have been impacted in India due to COVID in the second quarter, the business was resilient and finished higher than we expected with strong double-digit growth in Q2. From a segment perspective, in Asia, strong increases across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses all contributed to this sustained growth in this key region. Latin America, our strongest performing region, we achieved 12% sales growth, driven by double digit performance in nearly all of IFF business segments and underpinned by favorable currency movements and the impact in Brazil, Mexico and South Cone all achieved growth in the first half. We are particularly pleased to report that our EMEA region has impressively rebounded in the second quarter up to high single digits. We achieved a 2% increase in sales in the first half as COVID-19 related restrictions eased. Our Scent and Nourish business performed particularly well in Q2, both achieving double digit growth. Bearing any newly emerging COVID-19 challenges, we expect this growth to continue through the remainder of the year as global vaccination rates increase and Western and Central Europe continue to recover. Now turning to Slide 8. I will provide a more detailed look at our sales performance across IFF's key business segments through the first half of 2021, particularly those that significantly contributed to our overall 8% sales growth or 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis that I mentioned earlier. We are pleased to report solid growth across all of our four core divisions, Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Nourish achieved currency neutral growth of 6%, driven by a strong performance in flavors, ingredients and food design. Similar to the first quarter, Scent remains our largest sales driver on a year-to-date basis, achieving 8% in currency neutral growth led by a strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance. Our Health & Biosciences business has returned to solid growth in the second quarter, following a challenging first quarter where sales were affected by COVID-19 pressures in microbial control and grain processing. While microbial control continues to be challenged, for the first half, we saw growth in grain processing, which showed a recovery in the second quarter as well as home and personal care cultures and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Finally, our Pharma Solutions business also delivered growth to the first half of 2021 against a strong year ago comparison. On Slide 9, I would like to discuss the underlying dynamics influencing each of our four segments in the first half. As I mentioned, we saw broad based growth in all Nourish categories, led by robust performance in flavors. Despite strong volume and continued cost discipline, higher raw material costs continue to affect margin when compared to the first half of 2020. However, on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA grew about 7%. Our Health & Biosciences businesses delivered growth in the first half, led by strong performance in Home & Personal Care and grain processing. This growth offsets COVID-19 related pressures in microbial control and a strong year ago comparable in health. Higher logistic costs related to capacity and strong demand impacted our margin. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by this performance and expect continued improvement as we move into Q3. Our leading growth and profitability driver, Scent, achieved an operating EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points and absolute EBITDA grew nearly 20%. This was driven by a strong rebound in Fine Fragrances as retail channels continue to recover, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and double digit growth in Cosmetic Actives. Scent also delivered strong profitability led by higher volumes, favorable mix and higher productivity, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year. Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, the segment's 1% growth was driven primarily by improvements in industrials. So our margin was significantly challenged due to higher energy costs, lower manufacturing utilization and result in a weather related raw material shortages. Now on Slide 10 and 11, I would like to discuss our continued synergy progress in connection with our merger with N&B. From a revenue synergy perspective, we remain on track to meet our $20 million revenue synergy target this year. Coupled with continued demand and positive feedback from our customers, we are also confident in our ability to meet our 2024 run rate revenue synergy target of approximately $400 million. I would like to spend a moment highlighting how we realized this significant opportunity and share additional context on some of our recent wins. In only six months since completing the merger, we are already seeing strong affirmation in the opportunity before us. Our Home Care segment is a perfect example of how our expanded portfolio and combined capabilities with N&B delivers creative solutions for our customers and creates new opportunities for our business. Recently, our Health & Biosciences division saw an opportunity to collaborate with our Scent division, a global Scent customer expressed a need for enzyme technology and IFS capabilities across divisions allowed us to deliver an integrated solution and ultimately create a superior dishwashing detergent. Together with IFF's leading fragrance capabilities, our enzyme technology ensures fit-for-purpose delivery and performance, which creates a differentiated product for our customers. This opportunity represents more than $5 million in annual sales potential. At the same time, we're actively working with other customers across our IFF network to develop solutions that require capabilities across our four divisions. The food and beverage category, we continue to see demand for plant based meat alternatives that showcase the best of our expanded portfolio. For low sugar, low fat yogurt, we are introducing new flavor technologies with improved texture and speed to market, which are key advantages for our customers. Lastly, in our health category, we are developing an integrated solution for fiber gummy that leverages our unmatched scientific and technical expertise combined with our best-in-class flavor offering. These are just a few examples of the cross selling opportunities that we are seeing customers increasingly demand and differentiator for our business over the long term. We made significant strides in the second quarter from an integration perspective, ramping up our cost synergies from a few million dollars in the first quarter to a total of approximately $15 million on the first half basis. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings program we have implemented in the second quarter, which allowed us to leverage our increased scale to reduce our indirect spend, benefit from various office consolidations and renegotiations and rightsize our organization. Additionally, because of our operational strengths and commitment to the integration process, early on, we were all able to accelerate exiting our various transition service agreements with DuPont. I'm very encouraged by the continued progress on this front, and we are on track to deliver at least $45 million cost synergies for the full year and ultimately, our three year run rate cost synergy target of $300 million. And now I will hand it over to Rustom. Rustom Jilla : Thank you, Andreas. I will begin with an overview of our consolidated second quarter results on Slide 12. In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on a combined currency neutral basis, primarily driven by double digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and a strong Health & Biosciences performance. Though our gross margin was pressured by higher input costs, raw materials and logistics inflation and higher air freight volumes, this was partly offset by our disciplined cost management practices, administrative expense reductions and cost synergies. This enabled us to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.50 for the second quarter. On Slide 13, I want to provide a perspective on sales performance in Q2 versus pre-COVID. There is no doubt that 2020 was an extraordinary year due to COVID-19, so it makes more sense to also evaluate our performance relative to 2019\u2019s levels. And as you can see, all four divisions in the second quarter delivered strong sales growth as compared to the space period. Total company sales were up 8% on a two year basis with double digit growth in Nourish and Pharma Solutions, a high single digit increase in Scent and mid single digit growth in H&B. With the exception of a handful, all of our subcategories have grown relative to their pre-COVID levels. Most notably, we are pleased to report that those categories most impacted by COVID-19 are ahead of their respective Q2 2019 levels, including Cosmetic Active, which is up double digits; Fine Fragrance, which is up high single digits; and Grain Processing, which is up low single digits. Foodservice and microbial control, while we had strong growth in the second quarter of 2021, remain below Q2 2019 levels but we expect will continue to improve as we move forward. This performance underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio as well as our position as an essential partner to our customers. Now on the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the second quarter financials of each of our four divisions. Beginning with Nourish on Slide 14. Sales for the division increased by 15% year-over-year or 11% on a currency neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors, with Frutarom contributing to growth and a strong ingredients performance, particularly from our protein solutions, cellulosic, locus bean gum and food protection categories. Nourish also saw a strong rebound in food design, including a very strong 24% growth in foodservice as pandemic related restrictions continue to ease and consumer behavior in away from home channels continue to normalize. As I mentioned in the previous slide, higher raw material costs put relatively modest pressure on the margins at most of our individual segments, although we are pleased to have delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. Pricing continued to accelerate in Q2 and contributed over a percent of growth in the second quarter. As we will discuss later, we expect this will increase significantly in the third and fourth quarter as more of our pricing actions take hold. Turning to Slide 15. Our Health & Biosciences division saw year-over-year growth of 9% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home and Personal Care. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are particularly encouraged by Health & Biosciences return to growth this quarter, led by our microbial control and grain processing categories strong recoveries and from the industrial and supply chain challenges related to COVID-19. Performance in our health category was challenged based on the particularly strong double digit probiotics year-over-year comparison, although this did not offset the rest to the segment's growth, and we remain confident in the health category\u2019s trajectory moving forward. Health & Biosciences also delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5%. While you see that the division's margin was down this quarter, this was due to higher logistics costs in order to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long term growth and invest in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year. We are incurring significantly higher airfreight costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim and this is impacting our EBITDA margin. Now turning to Slide 16 to discuss the results of our Scent division, which continued to be a standout growth contributor this quarter. Our Scent division generated $550 million in total sales, representing year-over-year growth of 16% or 13% on a currency neutral basis. Scent also achieved adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 34% with margin expansion of 300 basis points, driven by robust volume mix and productivity, which did offset some inflationary pressures. While Consumer Fragrances was down slightly this quarter against a very strong double digit year ago comparison, a significant rebound in Fine Fragrances, which grew by approximately 85%, led by new wins and improved volumes, more than offset Consumer Fragrance\u2019s more modest performance due to last year's double digit growth. Our ingredients category also contributed to the division's strong performance, growing double digits, led by strong performance in Cosmetic Active and Fragrance Ingredients. Overall, we are extremely pleased with Scent's continued strong performance. Lastly, turning to Slide 17 to discuss Pharma Solutions. Currency neutral sales were flat against a strong year ago comparison with industrial Pharma the most significant performance driver for this division, led by Global Specialty Solutions. Core Pharma's performance was challenged against a very strong year ago comparison. On a two year basis, growth was solid at about 3.5%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was pressured this quarter with the margin decline due to higher energy costs and lower manufacturing utilization due to a couple of plant shutdowns as a result of weather related raw material shortages. Specifically, we had raw material availability issues related to the Midwest storm in the US earlier this year, which meant we were not able to run production and absorb our fixed costs. Going forward, the supply chain is improving, which we expect will lead to stronger margins in Pharma Solutions for the balance of the year. Now turning to Slide 18. I'd like to review our cash flow position, leverage dynamics for the first half of 2021, which remain a top priority as we continue to navigate a recovering global market. As you will see in the first half, IFF generated $533 million in free cash flow with free cash flow from operations totaling $698 million, driven by an improvement in core working capital. CapEx for the first half totaled $165 million or approximately 3% of sales as we continue to invest in growth accretive areas that we believe will ultimately prove rewarding over the long term as well as integration related activities. In the first half, we also delivered $274 million in dividends to our shareholders. As we look ahead, we are confident that our cash generation will remain robust, and have announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases. From a leverage perspective, our cash and cash equivalents finished at $935 million with gross debt holding steady at $12 billion. Our trailing 12 month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.61 billion and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.2 times. We are slightly better than we expect to be at this point in time and we are still expecting to de-lever to below 3x net debt to EBITDA in the first three years post the transaction close. Now moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2021. IFF has built a solid foundation in the first half of the year and delivered particularly strong second quarter performance. And we expect strong growth will continue through the rest of the year. For the full year 2021, we are once again increasing our forecast for total revenues with an expectation to achieve 2021 total revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, which equates to about 7% growth. This is up from our previous $11.25 billion or 6% growth as we have confidence in our sales momentum continuing into Q3 and through the rest of the year. Breaking down the contributors of growth, we expect currency neutral sales to be about 5% and FX benefits to be approximately 2%. While pandemic related uncertainties persist, we are encouraged by the strong performance and important recoveries we are seeing across the business, which we believe position us well to capture continued strong sales growth in Q3 and Q4. At the same time, we now see full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin at about 22.5% versus approximately 23% previously. A part of this reduction is related to our margin performance in Q2 for all the reasons I explained earlier. We also continue to see inflationary pressures across the supply chain. From a raw material perspective, we have seen raw material costs continue to increase over the course of the year. In the first half, we are successful in raising our prices to recover a portion of the cost increases and continue to expect close to full cost recovery in the second half. It should be noted that we're also seeing more broad based non-raw material inflation, such as higher energy costs that we are managing through. Our expectations for airfreight has also increased significantly as rates are higher but mostly higher volumes to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We are absorbing higher logistics costs to grow the business in the short term and expect this is only temporary until our capacity expansion projects are complete. The combination of unfavorable price to raw material costs and higher logistics costs are negatively impacting operating margin in 2021 by more than 100 basis points. However, through higher sales, strong cost discipline and our focus on unlocking additional cost synergies, we believe we will end up only about 50 basis points lower than our previous expectations with higher revenues and a roughly similar dollar EBITDA level. For modeling purposes, please note that depreciation and amortization, interest expense, CapEx as a percentage of sales, adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization and weighted average diluted share counts, all remain the same as what we shared in Q1. Overall, we are confident that we are well placed to continue capturing additional growth over the next two quarters and beyond, while maintaining our focus on execution, continued financial discipline and leveraging our significantly bolstered resources and expertise as a stronger, more diversified company. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Andreas who will provide some closing remarks before we open the line for our question-and-answer session. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom, and thanks again to all of joining us today. Before I wrap up today's call, I would like to first recognize our thousands of employees around the world who continue to display their unwavering commitment to serve our customers, unify our teams together with N&B and deliver for our communities. Despite the uncertain environment that we have continued to navigate, IFF's first half and Q2 results showcased the strengths of our combined portfolio and our ability to execute our ambitious business objectives. And I'm incredibly proud to lead such a talented and passionate group of IFF-ers. We have much to be proud of this quarter as we move ahead. I'm confident that we have built the financial and operational structures needed for our combined company to reach even greater heights. As Rustom and I have mentioned, we are targeting a strong full year performance, indicative of our post pandemic aspirations and I know we are exceptionally positioned to achieve this. And we are seeing the strong top line momentum continue in the early days of the third quarter. Together, we will further our mission to be an innovative force for good and redefine what it means to be a leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator :  And we'll take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I guess the question is more around sales guidance. So I guess, why not raise more considering the strong second quarter result? Obviously, comparisons remain favorable over the back half of the year. Rustom talked about incremental pricing. So maybe if you could just talk about that generally? And then related to that, was there any borrowing in 2Q from the back half of the year? Is that something that we should listen for watch for kind of thing and how do you think about that? And then on pricing, how do you think about the increase in pricing, which seems to be much more around the DB portfolio and thinking about the elasticity there relative to the legacy business? Andreas Fibig : Let me get started on it, and then Rustom is talking about the pricing. So first of all, your second question, there's no borrowing from the third quarter for the second quarter. I think that's important. Number two is what is driving us and the strong performance in the second quarter and also the start into the third quarter, because July we had the sales already. So it's a strong win rate. It's a very robust demand we are seeing. In some areas, it is also a superior technology, in particular in parts of the enzyme business and a really good R&D pipeline here as well. So the question now is why we are not going higher. Look, it's a  environment for us right now and as for everybody else. So we have now the COVID Delta variant. And we said, look, let's be careful here what we do, we\u2019re not getting ahead of our skis here and make sure that we have a very realistic target on the sales side. And Rustom, if you could talk a bit about volume and pricing that would be probably helpful. Rustom Jilla : Look, our focus on the second half is on ensuring that we achieve the pricing needed to recover raw material and logistics costs. We do recognize we had very strong growth in Q2, predominantly volume driven. But also, I mean, there is uncertainty out there with Delta COVID, as you heard. So we've calibrated our guidance. We think appropriately to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing. And the composition is a bit different of our first half and second half growth. I mean in the second half, we're expecting that, on average, pricing will contribute close to 2.5 points of growth with volumes at a similar level. So this is all without FX of course. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Andreas, just curious, you sounded pretty positive on the sales synergy momentum that the teams are putting together. Any thoughts or any changes in the contribution potential in '22 and maybe even the second half of this year? Andreas Fibig : Mike, so we are very, very confident that we achieved what we have set for this year. Second year, we will see how the run rate turns out. I'm very impressed actually what the teams are doing. I'll give you a couple of examples. I did know since we are going a little bit lighter on the pandemic. I did a good trip in the US and in Europe actually twice. And I saw what the power is combining, let\u2019s say, an ingredient sale with a flavor sale. So I'm really optimistic that we are, let's say, are moving in the right direction. But it's probably too early to raise the forecast already for next year. That might be in the next call where we can take a very detailed look. The most important thing for me is how natural the teams are already combining ingredients at Flavors, for example, and what kind of opportunities we have in areas like the Home Care with superior edition washing detergents, for example, and in the health area as well, which were not so much on our forefront when we started this all endeavor. And that's really good. So I'm optimistic but it's probably too early to raise it right now. Okay, Mike? Operator : We'll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : So I wanted to ask a little bit more about Health & Biosciences. I know you had previously talked about capacity constraints in that business due to elevated demand. So maybe I was expecting higher growth in that segment because of this, but I wonder if your capacity constraints sort of limited the growth potential this particular quarter? And if you think growth should accelerate in the back half or if there's any other color you can provide sort of within the various subsegments within Health & Biosciences to help us think about the business going forward? Andreas Fibig : Absolutely, Faiza, and that's a very core part of our portfolio. And we see for almost all the enzyme categories, we see a really robust demand and in some areas, really our superiority in technology as well. So answering your question, we had probably more demand than we could satisfy. And our priority right now in this business is actually to debottleneck some of our manufacturing parts, investing in more, let's say, manufacturing lines and making sure that in the next, let's say, 12 to 15 months, we are really able to deliver the strong demand here. So indeed, we had more demand than we could deliver and we are working now really 24/7 to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity. I don't know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything? Rustom Jilla : I mean, look, strong demand in enzymes has led to the tight capacity in the short term. But to be clear, capacity is not a medium or long term constraint. And Andreas covered everything else. Faiza Alwy : Just to be clear then \u2026 Operator : And we'll take our next question from\u2026 Andreas Fibig : Operator, Faiza, if you want to jump back on the line that would be great, you cut out . Faiza Alwy : I thought you guys were moving on to the next question. But I just wanted to clarify the capacity constraints aren't going to be listed in the back half, it's more of a longer term solution. So more thinking ahead to 2022. Is that the right way to think about it? Andreas Fibig : Yes, some of it in the fourth quarter but most the bulk of it in 2022. Yes, absolutely. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : You mentioned active portfolio management. Do you anticipate any more significant divestments to accelerate debt reduction? Andreas Fibig : I would say, at the moment, we're working hard to look at what we do with our portfolio. It's probably too early to say something more in detail. Yes, that's probably, and I don't know Rustom, if you want to say anything? Rustom Jilla : No, I wouldn't add anything. John Roberts : Secondly, there's continued to be some turnover among the senior management team. How concerned should we be about that? Andreas Fibig : Look, we are always concerned if we have a turnover on the management team. So far, I think we keep it in a way that we make sure that we are really firing on all cylinders and that we find the right people. Because it's a big task we have here right now on one hand, delivering on our numbers, integrating the businesses and then we are still in the pandemic, which makes it not easier. But in general, I think we have it very well under control. And as you can see, most of these units are performing actually very, very, very well and we expect the same actually for the third quarter as well. Operator : And we will take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : A couple of questions, please. Firstly, on raw materials. You continue to guide for 5% for this year. Is that sort of time of the year where you start supply negotiations for next year as well? How should we think about that more like a two year stack of 5% each, or what do you see in those negotiations, please? And then secondly, on the Nourish and the strong growth there. It's quite remarkable, not just the growth in itself but also versus Sivanto and Symrise that you outperformed. And I appreciate there's been one extra working day in that, but that still outperformed. So can you talk about the sustainability of growth versus peers going forward and what's driven the outperformance in the quarter? How much of that is just food services and portfolio mix and how much is win rates, please? Rustom Jilla : Andreas, you want to take that and then I'll \u2026 Andreas Fibig : Let me get started. So yes, we are very optimistic on the Nourish right now, also in comparison to some of our peers. And there's a lot of good wins coming in, very strong wins, particularly on the flavor side, and it's really good for what we see the pipeline is pretty filled. We see as well that now having the ingredients helps us to open up customers for flavors, because you do always with the CPGs, first, the ingredient sales and then the flavor sales. And the dynamic right now is if we see an ingredient sales, we try to cross sell already the flavors, which is working actually quite nicely. So win rates are really good and strong. The demand is very, very robust, what we see as well. And we started being very short term, strong because Nourish as well, actually super strong into the third quarter. And Rustom, if you could talk about the raw mats, that will be really good. Rustom Jilla : Actually, we're looking at closer to about 5.5% now. We've seen continued inflation in logistics and in raw materials. So yes, we have started the Nigerias getting close to starting negotiations and working on all of that. But Gunther, at this point in time, we are not seeing any deceleration in inflation. In fact, if anything, we're seeing it continuing and exacerbating, in general. It actually has a -- there's another impact to this as well, because even when we recover 100% of the cost increases, I mean that does push down our operating margin. And you can actually go and take the -- just do the math, anyone interested. You go back and pick a number, even add like $225 million of cost and $225 million of price recovery to our 2020 results and keep everything else unchanged, and that alone takes about 50 basis points of our operating margin, that's just pure math. So I mean there's different factors in here. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I was hoping maybe it kind of ties off the last question, but maybe thinking a little bit longer term. How do we think about the cost pressures and inflation this year? You're going after pricing aggressively to recover that. How do we think about that impacting some of the -- or the trajectory impacting the medium term targets around revenue growth, around EBITDA margins by 2023? Did it have any impact in terms of the timing of synergy capture over the next 12 to 24 months? Because I know procurement was a big part, a big bucket in terms of the targeted cost synergies. I'm just trying to think about how the experience this year and some of the market dynamics at play impact the forward trajectory? Andreas Fibig : And I have to say that was a big focus for our team right now to look because we didn't get the procurement savings in the second quarter we wanted, and probably not in the third. So we shifted actually pretty agile, the way how we deliver the synergies. So it was more cost out in particular in terms of headcount in other areas as well. And we are now planning for next year getting more of the synergies from procurement and then certainly in 2023 because, at some point in time, it will ease. So I think we did a good job to just, let's say, reachc shift where we get it from. On the revenue growth, before I hand it over to Rustom on EBITDA, it is certainly positive because you will see also carryover effect into next year on the sales line if you have raised the prices, which is good and good to see for us. But I guess everybody in that marketplace is doing it right now. But Rustom, if you can talk about the cost pressures, in general? How you see it and the EBITDA margin. Rustom Jilla : Like I said, I mean, the impact of the -- even with full recovery, it depresses our operating margin. If you look at some of the other factors we're getting this year, it's not so bad, like capacity expansion projects as we talked about with Pfizer, they come online in 2022. So the negative air freight impact that we are seeing will go away when you think by the time you come into 2023. And yes, so we recognize the 26% numbers a little further away from where it is right now compared to when we are there. But as we started, it's three year number and we are committed to it. And what we're looking at is so far this year we've got stronger sales. And as you can see, slightly lower op margin than we expected. Andreas Fibig : Actually a good point Rustom is making, because a big portion of it is driven by airfreight. And as soon as we have enough capacity available, we will reduce the airfreight quite significantly, which is super helpful on the cost side as well. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Why were Scent margins up year-over-year and Nourish margins down? Was it that Scent had a better pricing dynamic or is there some other factor, and how large is the fruit preparations business? Rustom Jilla : So let me take the part of that. So most of the cost increases that the raw material draft cost increases that we've seen coming through and are still coming through are impacting Nourish. I mean if you think about $220 million-ish sort of cost hit that we're having right now, a part of which is freight rates, not the freight volume that Andreas and I talked about, but freights. Probably close to 80% is impacting Nourish. And it's a few specific areas, it's soy meal, soy protein, that's the biggest one that we see there. There's LBK, lotus bean kernel that's very close behind. And then there's also like vegetable oils, propylene glycol, stuff like that. I mean the Scent business, the impact turpentine cedarwood, it's there, and it's coming in, but it's coming in more in the back half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year, and it was smaller compared to Nourish. Nourish is where we had the biggest impact. So that's what you're really seeing driving the business there. Jeff Zekauskas : And the fruit preparation business, how big is that? Rustom Jilla : That's a small business. I don't know if we've -- the seller wanted us to disclose that, so I won't. But we have been talking, it's a very small and sub-$100 million. How is that\u2026 Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I guess first thing was just with the comments that you expect legacy IFF to be up double digits for the balance of the year, which is really impressive set of expectations. I think it would imply that the N&B side of the house would be decelerating pretty considerably. I mean it sounds like that might be due to the capacity constraints. But I was just curious if you could comment on that first? Andreas Fibig : Rustom, you want to take it? Rustom Jilla : Actually, the comment is that in Q2, heritage IFF currency neutral growth was low double digits and in Q2, N&B's current leg heritage N&B\u2019s currency neutral growth was mid single digits. I mean I think that's -- so I mean I thought perhaps it was it, Andreas? Andreas Fibig : No, actually, look, what we see is we'll recover in the second half in pharma, because we are recovering some of it through all the cold snap we had in the Midwest. So that will come back but probably not to the degree we have to demand. And on the Health & Bioscience piece, it's certainly driven by our manufacturing capacity, which is limited but also with higher comps we will see for the last two quarters. So we will see how it goes. We are very careful here on this side but it will be more positive than what we have seen in the first quarter. Certainly, we saw already an acceleration in the second quarter and it will go in the right direction. So we are observing it quite carefully. What I can tell you also in the third quarter, the legacy N&B businesses had a pretty strong start. And then certainly, part of it is in the Nourish business as well and reflected in the Nourish numbers, in particular, the Ingredients business, we should not underestimate that. And by the way, having you on, I hope you have seen the really strong performance of Fine Fragrances, which are really going in the right direction, helping with the mix on the Scent side quite significantly. Lauren Lieberman : Yes, absolutely. And I also know that IFF has had a number of the big new launches in the industry or IFF perfumer work. So I've definitely seen that. I had one more question, though, on the capacity additions and that you're still going a little bit about so far. I was curious to the degree as you've now gotten further in with the N&B business, if it feels like perhaps that's been a bit underinvested and whether it was in the 12 to 15 months prior to deal close or even before that, because the need to be investing in CapEx, the call out of higher than expected logistics separate from rate. But just again, because of these capacity airfreight and so on suggests that there's something there. So just curious about that. Are you yet to a point where this could be a multiyear period of investment in capacity, not just one year you've got the cash flow but just curious about that. Andreas Fibig : No, it's a good point, Lauren. And I would say there are two things which come together. One is the very robust demand and a lot of wins we had in particular on the enzyme piece and that came a bit of a surprise to the unit. So that's where we need some investment here to deliver on it. I would not say it was underinvested but it was probably also through the pandemic, not on the real time horizon. We could have had some of the expansion already probably six months earlier than we would be in a better position. But it is as it is. And we have now adapted our CapEx plan going forward that we can deal with these, let's say, shortages quite nicely over the next, I would say, 15 months. The positive for me is that demand is very robust. And the other positive is that we see some superiority of our products in that market, which is really good. And there's something which we haven't talked too much because it might be more midterm but the R&D pipeline, in particular, what comes from N&B is super strong and it will help us with our wins going forward. I don't know, Rustom, do you have anything to add? Rustom Jilla : I guess, Andreas, I mean just think -- Lauren, it is a little bit of multiyear. I mean we're probably going to spend about another $450 million in total, but it's actually good. We can use more. We've got good strong business. I mean, I view this as a positive and we have the cash flow and so we're going to use it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Andreas, just kind of thinking about your portfolio at this point. Obviously, mobility is starting to directionally improve globally and you're seeing the impact on Food Service and Fine Fragrances and some other businesses. On the same token, you're seeing CPG companies talk about moderation at volumes, whether it's food or just consumer products more broadly. So how do you see those dynamics sort of netting out for IFF as we progress over the next couple of quarters? Do you see categories that are starting to moderate? And if so, would that affect the sales growth that you're anticipating at this point? Andreas Fibig : I would say if I go to the different categories, we see still strong demand for Fine Fragrances. And this is not just driven by the robust demand right now but also by our win rate. We are winning more than our fair share and that's very, very helpful. Consumer Fragrance, here, I would say, in general, for the market, you see a moderation and that's what you hear in the market from the big CPGs as well. But again, we are in the good position or lucky position that we are on all the core lists we wanted to be. And then we talked over the last couple of quarters about the street callers we made a year and half ago and they are really contributing. So that's helpful for us. But in general, we see some moderation. Another one is active cosmetics. We see a big, big and strong growth going forward. On Health & Bioscience, I would say, very strong in Home and Personal Care, but more driven by our wins and our technology than by the whole market. So that's what I would say. And then grain processing and microbial control are coming back out of, let's say, modest performance in last year. And animal nutrition is pretty good as well. On the Nourish side, I would say we haven't seen any slowing down of demand. And that might be also driven because we are now in a unique position that we can offer from the ingredient, to the flavor, to the total solution that we are in a different position than many of our competitors and that helps us actually to position us in the right way. So answering your question is we see some markets, we see the market's moderation, but not too much for us because of the position where we're in right now. So that will be my overall comment. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Mark Connelly : Andreas, when you think about COVID reopening, what are the big opportunities if we continue to move along? And what are the risks if we all start to mask up and away from home dining gets hit. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you are ex health and wellness, because as you just point out, you're in a very different position than you were when we went into COVID? Andreas Fibig : I would say, if we're starting to close down, again, if the delta variants really proving dangerous for us. I would say the food service is the only business I could think of right now, which could be impacted, maybe fine fragrance. But what we have seen is much more online usage but these are the two categories where I see an impact, or a negative impact. On the other hand, if the close down comes, I would say that Consumer Fragrances, in particular, in terms of the health and the hygiene products, are going up. And as you said, on the health side as well because people are trying to fortify their food, trying to be healthy, getting more probiotics in. And so I would say we have at least as many opportunities as we have risk to another close down. So that's how I would describe it for now. Operator : And we'll take our next question  with Citi. Unidentified Analyst : Just quickly, you had good growth in Scent, particularly 85% growth in Fine Fragrance. Are you back to pre-pandemic levels in Fine Fragrance? And was there any inventory building in the Fine Fragrance channel that we should think about? Andreas Fibig : We are even outperforming our 2019 number. And this quarter will show whether there's an inventory building or not because now they're starting to order for the Christmas business. And so far, it's a strong start into the third quarter. So I would say not so much inventory building and then there's an extra effect on our side for Fine Fragrances that we are winning really a lot of business and a lot of good fragrances as well, which are very nicely marketed. So that's how I would describe it. I don't know, Rustom, anything to add from your side? Rustom Jilla : No, that covered it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : So questions for you on the margin and margin outlook. I guess, first, what happened to pharma cost? Can you dig in a little bit more on that? It seems like you're blaming, Yuri, but that was mid-February. And so how do you improve from there going forward, at what rate do we climb out of this hole? And then if I look at the 100 basis points of margin hit you mentioned, Rustom. Can you break that down a little bit between what would be raw material energy inflation type stuff that the whole industry would be experiencing? And maybe what percent of that 100 basis points is unique to IFF given air freighting capacity issues, outages, et cetera? Rustom Jilla : So let me do the first one. I mean, yes, it came from the February outages but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, with methachloride. And it shut down two of our plants temporarily during the period, which meant that it's a pity because we could have sold every single thing we produced, obviously, and then we also had underutilization. So that's what came through there. If I was to roughly look at the break in general, at the percentages in general between raw material and freight about, call it, 85% or so of the total comes from raw material increases and about 15% from freight. But interestingly, freight is a much smaller portion. If you break up that 5.5% that we talked about, the material cost impact is probably about 5% inflation we're seeing. I'm rounding all these numbers. And the freight rate increase is probably about 8% and may even be slightly higher with the way that's going. I mean containers are 3 times to 4 times sea freight as high as they've been. And also, there's one more complication even when we have contracted rates we and many others experienced, there's lots of delays going on and stuff. So we sometimes book -- we can't get the stuff on the contracted rate still much later and have to pick spot rates. And we\u2019re also forced sometimes to look at different modes of transport from a reliability perspective. So a lot's going on there. Operator : And there appears to be one last question. We'll take our final question from Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Lisa De Neve : Two questions from me, and then follow-up. So back to the Scents and care business, I mean, you delivered very strong margins. Can you share to which extent this was related to favorable product mix towards Fine Fragrance and Active, and how we expect this to trend in second half given raw materials were kicking in a little bit more meaningfully? But at the same time, you did mention you were still going to see relatively good demand for Fine Fragrance. That's my first question. The second one, early in the presentation, you mentioned that in the second half, you may see a fairly similar contribution from pricing, about 2.5% and 2.5% from volumes. And I'm just trying to understand why you're being so cautious on the volume side, or maybe I just misunderstood this. Andreas Fibig : Rustom, can you take it? Rustom Jilla : I mean on the volume side, I mean, our focus in the second half is on ensuring that we get pricing to recover raw material costs. We're trying to recover close to 100%, and that is really important to being able to the EBITDA and the numbers there. And we did have very strong growth in Q2, predominantly volume driven. And so what we've -- our guidance, Lisa, in the second half is sort of we're trying to guide to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing again. So that's really what you're seeing over there. And on the first part of your question, I mean, yes, for the Scent business, the margin expansion was really driven by the mix for sure. I mean, for sure. I mean when you have Fine Fragrances going up 85%, that's tremendous. So it was mixed but there's also volume growth, in general. I mean you've seen Cosmetic Active was super as well and then productivity, and that offset inflationary pressures and costs which you're seeing there as well. And in the second half, we'll see more costs coming the way of the Scent business, not on the scale of nourishing what we've seen. Anything to add there, Andreas? Andreas Fibig : No, I think you captured it very, very well. I just want to make a general remark on mix. Obviously, we try for all businesses now to push basically all the parts of the portfolio, which have the higher profitability and the higher growth areas, which over time should really help us with mix. And I think what you see with Scent, it's something which is a very positive driver for our profitability going forward. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Andreas for any closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yes. Thank you. We are incredibly proud on the second quarter because, again, as we said, first of all, we delivered strong growth, even in comparison to 2019, which is real good parameter here. Secondly, we\u2019re integrating well with the N&B business and we do it in time of a pandemic. And I think, again, I would like to use the time to congratulate all of our teams around the globe for what they have accomplished. And I think it\u2019s not an easy task and everybody did really as best and that\u2019s where IFF stands for. Thank you for that, and talk to most of you later. Thank you guys. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.  . Participants will be announced by their name and Company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of 1 question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael Deveau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2021 conference call. Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the Company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.  For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in yesterday's press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website. Please also note that we will be using combined historical results for the Third Quarter defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results, and 3 months N&B results.  And for 9 months year-to-date, defined as 9 months of legacy IFF, January to September, and 8 months of N&B, February to September in both the 2020 and 2021 periods to allow for comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1st, 2021. With me in the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig and our recently appointed Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks, and then we'll take any questions that you may have at the end. I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. And I thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our performance results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated colleagues throughout the world, who have continued to work tirelessly in a challenging environment to fuel the global consumer goods supply chain and meet our customer\u2019s needs. I can't thank each and every one of you enough for your hard work, dedication, and focus. I also want to take a moment and welcome Glenn Richter, who is joining us on today's call for the first time.  As you know, Glenn joined us a little over a month ago as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'm sure you will all find that his experience aligns perfectly with our strategic goals, making him an incredible asset to our team. I also want to thank Rustom for his leadership and contributions during his time as IFF's CFO. Rustom played an important role in our combination with  N&B, and for that we are immensely grateful. He has been important putting IFF in the strong position it is today. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors. On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of year-to - date performance, including the progress we have made so far on our integration.  I will then turn it over to Glenn (ph) who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question-and-answer session, Glenn (ph) will also speak to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, as I mentioned, I'd like to kick us off on Slide 6 by discussing our financial highlights for the first 9 months of 2021. Throughout the third quarter, we remained laser focused on extending the momentum IFF established in the first half of 2021. In the first 9 months of 2021, IFF achieved $8.6 billion in sales, representing 10% growth with 7% on currency-neutral basis.  A strong reflection of the strength of our market-leading platform, and the compelling position we have established with our customers as a combined Company. We delivered a 22% adjusted operating EBITDA margin and a combined EBITDA growth of 5%. As we will discuss in more detail, we continue to confirm meaningful inflationary pressure due to higher raw material, logistic, and energy costs. We have maintained our robust cost discipline efforts and are entering the fourth quarter with continued financial strengths, having achieved $884 million free cash flow or approximately 10% of our trailing 9 months sales, driven by strong cash generation.  This cash generation has enabled us to stay on track to meeting our deleveraging target. Finally, as I've mentioned in previous quarters, continued refinement and optimization of our portfolio is a critical component of our ongoing integration efforts. I am pleased to share that we have completed divestiture of our food preparation business, and are on track to complete the divestiture of all Microbial Control business in the second quarter of 2022. Together, these 2 important divestitures will create a more focused IFF, allowing us to hone in on the constraints of our core business segments and create a stronger, more-focused business.  We will continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio as we move forward with our integration, looking for opportunities to rapidly divest in other non-core businesses. We started this year with a simple commitment, to focus on execution and deliver on the potential of the new IFF. I'm pleased to say that even in a very challenging global environment, our team has met our integration objectives by delivering strong results with continued sales momentum and profit growth.  Now, turning to Slide 7, I'd like to walk you through some of the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the last 9 months. First, I'm excited to share that we continue to experience strong growth in all 4 of our key operating regions despite ongoing and unique market uncertainties that have persisted across each geography. In North America, we achieved 7% growth across all 4 of IFF's business divisions, led by high-single-digit growth in Nourish and Scent. These 2 divisions have continued to perform exceptionally well quarter after quarter.  In Asia, we experienced a 7% increase in sales led by continued double-digit growth in India, as well as a low single digit growth in China, even in it's particularly strong recent market complexities in the region. From a business unit perspective, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions continued to carry the region's growth throughout the year to-date. Latin America continues to be our strongest performing region and sales growth leader, having achieved 12% growth largely fueled by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and continued local currency strengths.  Perhaps, most impressive is a 7% sales growth at our EMEA region achieved to date, which includes a robust double-digit increase in the third quarter and prices performance on our Scent and Norridge divisions stock. This encouraging rebound, with Scent delivering double-digit growth led by our client fragrance business, and Norridge delivering high single-digit growth, led by our food service business. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year and we will stay diligent to ensure our business remain nimble, positioned to perform against any new supply chain challenges that may arise.  Moving now to Slide 8, I'd like to take a closer look at our 9 months year-to-date sales performance across our key business segments. Our largest division, Nourish, has been a strong performer throughout the year, achieving currency-neutral sales growth of 9% with broad-based strength from all flavors, ingredients, and food design businesses. Scent has had a similar strong year delivering 8% in currency-neutral gross to date led by impressive double-digit growth in fine fragrance, as well as strong growth in Consumer Fragrance and ingredients. Health & Bioscience has seen strong demand in key focus areas, including Home and Personal Care, animal nutrition, and  food enzymes.  As you know, we are in the process of selling our microbial control unit, which has continued to experience headwinds through this year, but has rebounded from COVID impacted loss with growth in both Q2 and Q3. This divestiture should further enhance the performance of this important division. Pharma Solutions, despite significant challenges, is flat so far for the year. Supply chain challenges have had an outsized impact on this divisions throughout the year. While we have seen encouraging growth in our industrial business, the division still struggles to meet customer demand due to all mature availability challenges and logistics issues.  Now on slide 9, you will see that we have outlined some of the factors influencing the gross profitability of each of our 4 divisions so far this year. As I previously mentioned, Nourish had had a strong year with Flavors & Ingredients experiencing double-digit growth. We have been working hard in our execution to manage the volume and costs to limit margin impact from higher raw material costs, which continue to be a headwind on our profitability. While we have seen some margin impact of about 20 basis points in the year, we are proud of how our execution has mitigated much of the negative headwinds while delivering meaningful growth.  Our team has done an exceptional job increasing prices to combat inflationary pressures, something that will continue to be critical as we move forward. At Health & Biosciences, we mentioned broad-based growth across the markets. But here we are seeing significant margin impact from higher logistic costs. As shared on our second quarter call, part of this that freight rates have increased significantly, but also, we have -- having higher logistic costs to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth. Investing in R&D and Plant technology to increase output later this year and into 2022.  The Scent division is certainly realized the strongest all-around bounce back as consumer demand rises across end markets. Notably, Fine Fragrances alone as realized, 36% growth year-to-date was double-digit growth in cosmetic active, and continued solid performance in Consumer Fragrances. At the time, since profitability expansion of a 110 basis points has been led by higher volume, favorable mix, and higher productivity. As I mentioned, Pharma Solutions was the only division in which we did not experience sales growth due to continued global supply chain challenges that have impacted our ability to meet strong customer demands.  These challenges, including supply and logistic constraints and ongoing inflation, have in turn, significantly pressured our margin compared to the first 9 months of 2020. Moving through the fourth quarter and entering 2022, we will be closely tracking supply chain dynamics and will continue to prioritize returning our Pharma Solutions business to the profitability we know is achievable. And in the fourth quarter, we're expecting year-over-year, top and bottom-line performance to improve. As we have been talking about today, IFF is realizing very strong sales momentum across our business.  This is a reflection of a powerful new position we have created through our combination with the N&B business, and the compelling value proposition we can offer to our customers. While we are pleased to put many of the gross hesitance relates to the pandemic behind us, it is important to understand that our growth this year, is in fact meaningful above pre-pandemic results. If you look at the total business, you will see that on a comparable 9 months proforma basis, the new IFF has realized 9% sales growth over 2019 results. This strength is broad-based to each segment is realizing strong rose above pre-pandemic levels. Nourish as a business that was particularly hard hits with the pandemic involves strongly growing with sales growth of 9% compared to performance 2019 in 9 months period. And for important, especially given that much of the integration work is coming from within this division. These results showcase how acquisition in the market has been fundamentally strengthened through the merger and how our teams are delivering the full potential of IFF to our customers. Moving to slide 11, I would like to discuss a strong progress we have made in terms of synergy realization.  For just 9 months since completing our merger with N&B, our synergy progress reaffirms the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us as a combined Company. Having received significant and highly encouraging positive feedback from our customers, along with persistent robust customer demands, we are confident in our ability to meet our revenue target. To date, revenue synergies have started to contribute to our top-line performance and we are pleased that our project pipeline is strong and growing. The first 9 months of 2021, we've achieved approximately $40 million in cost synergies, representing nearly 90% of our 2021 cost synergy target was 1 quarter to go.  This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings programs we have implemented, where we are leveraging our increased scale and optimizing on our organization. I'm confident that we will more than exceed our $45 million year-one synergy target. And I'm encouraged by the continued progress we're making towards achieving our three-year run rate of cost synergy target of $300 million. Now, before I turn the call over to Glenn (ph), I want to spend a second to really underscore what he brings to us here at IFF. His background is perfect, but there are 2 areas I think really standout.  First, he brings a tremendous  was private and public companies and leading finance teams to enhance discipline and built processes that drive towards a goal of shareholder value creation. He has time and time again shown an ability to help businesses accelerate top-line growth while driving margin expansion. In this way, he consistently implements productivity initiatives with lasting impact. Second, he has been through several large-scale M&A integrations with a track record of strong success. As we continue to execute on our multi-year transformational integration, this experience is invaluable. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn (ph). Glenn Richter : Thank you for the warm welcome, Andreas, and good morning, afternoon and evening to everyone. Since joining IFF in late September, I've had the opportunity to briefly meet many in our investor community. And the most common questions I've been asked is why did I join IFF? And what are my near-term priorities? Consequently, before I review our financial results, I thought it would be helpful to briefly provide these perspectives as an introduction. There were 3 very compelling reasons for me to join IFF. First and perhaps most importantly, IFF is a Company that is truly making a difference in helping solve some of the world's biggest challenges.  We're delivering reliable, innovative, and sustainable solutions that are directly helping address issues such as improved nutrition and wellness, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating a more sustainable environment. Second, the industry has very attractive organic growth characteristics benefitting from continued strong consumer tailwinds. From increased consumer focus on wellness and natural and sustainable products, increased demand in emerging markets, and new consumer needs presented by aging demographics in developed markets. I also believe that scale will become an important basis of competitive advantage. As customers demand leading ESG platforms, increased innovation and speed-to-market, global supply chain resiliency and help in navigating increasingly complex regulations.  Third, I firmly believe that the combination of IFF with DuPont's legacy N&B business has uniquely created an industry leading platform. And since joining IFF, I've tried to immersed myself in the business completely. Visiting sites, meeting with our business and operations teams, and spending time at our R&D in creative centers. I've also prioritized hearing from you, our investors and analysts and frankly, today I'm even more bullish on the strength of IFF 's global capabilities and the tremendous long-term potential we have to drive strong top and bottom-line growth.  Relative to my near-term priorities, I have 4 primary areas of focus. By far, our most pressing priority is to tackle the challenges from the global inflationary environment and to successfully execute broad-based pricing actions across all of our businesses. Second, I'm also focused on enhancing our core financial processes and metrics, including better forecasting, improved business-level return metrics, and tighter disciplines for our investment decisions, so that we're maximizing our growth potential and return on invested capital.  A third area of focus is ensuring we fully deliver on our merger synergies, while also accelerating our focus on sustainable productivity. And finally, while we have made very good progress to date on our portfolio optimization, there is significant opportunity remaining. In the days and months ahead, I look forward to learning even more about this organization and engaging with all of you. With that, I'd now like to provide an overview of our consolidated third quarter results. In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 12% year-over-year increase, primarily driven by the continued double-digit growth in our Nourish division, and strong increases in both Scents and Health & Biosciences. In terms of contribution, volume performance was the primary driver of our growth. As pricing represented approximately 2% points in the quarter. So, our gross margin continued to be challenged by inflationary pressures.  It was somewhat offset by our strong cost management focus, which resulted in adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. While we had solid year-over-year EBITDA growth, our gross margin was down by 210 basis points, as our pricing actions recovered only about 65% of our raw material increases, or approximately 50% in the third quarter when we include raw material, logistics, and energy, increases. As we move forward, we are squarely focused on improving this recovery rate relative to the total inflationary basis. But expect that in the short term, specifically the fourth quarter, we will see a similar pressure given the time lag of price realization.  Let me finish on this slide by saying that we achieved strong earnings per share, excluding amortization of a $1.47. On the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the third quarter financial results for each of our 4 divisions. Turning to slide 13, I'll start with our Nourish division, which had an exceptional quarter. In Q3, Nourish achieved 17% year-over-year sales growth, or 15% on a currency neutral basis. Driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors for the second consecutive quarter. Ingredients also grew double-digits with all subcategories, protein solutions, pectin and seaweed extracts, emulsifiers and sweeteners and cellulosic, LPG and food protection increasing double-digits.  Food Design also grew double-digits led by Food Service, where pandemic related restrictions continued to be lifted with away-from-home consumer behaviors returning to more typical levels. As a result of strong volume growth, price increases and our focus on cost management, Nourish achieved an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 19% and margin expansion of 30 basis points. On Slide 14, you'll see that our Health and Biosciences division saw year-over-year sales growth of 7% or 5% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home & Personal Care and high single-digit growth in Cultures and Food Enzymes.  Our health category was soft this quarter due to a particularly strong double-digit year-ago comparison, so we are pleased with the results when we look at it on a two-year basis. As Andreas mentioned earlier, inflationary pressures and higher logistics, and energy costs to keep up with the robust customer demand has challenged our margins across our business with H&B particularly impacted, which drove an operating EBITDA decrease of 12%. Unpacking this a bit deeper, the bulk or 70% of our year-over-year EBITDA decline came from higher airfreight volumes, where we have increased inter-Company shipments to manage available capacity. As we shared last quarter, we have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and have also invested in R&D and plant technology to increase output. Until then, we will be incurring higher costs to support our customer demand, and this will impact our EBITDA margin. Turning now to Slide 15. Our Scent Division continues to perform extremely well and experience strong growth, achieving 10% year-over-year growth or 9% growth on a currency neutral basis. This performance was driven by Fine Fragrances continued rebound, which grew approximately 36%, led by new customer wins and improved volumes. Our ingredients category also continues to perform well, and contributed to Scent's overall success, seeing double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter, led by strong performance in both cosmetic actives and Fragrance ingredients. While our consumer Fragrances business saw modest low single-digit growth against a strong double-digit year-ago comparison, this is a marked improvement from Q2 and we expect further growth as we move forward. On a 2-year average basis, Consumer Fragrance remains strong at 9% in the third quarter. Scent also experienced adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 10% driven by strong volume growth and favorable mix.  Margin was down modestly to the higher raw materials and logistics costs a trend we see continuing. I will provide what content shortly. Lastly, in our Pharma Solutions business, we saw a current seat neutral sales decrease of 2% due to continued supply chain challenges related to raw material availability and logistic disruptions, which have made it challenging to meet persistent and growing customer demand. While  has continued to recover from COVID-19 lows, our core Pharma business saw soft performance against its solid year-ago comparison.  The division's adjusted operating EBITDA margin also continue to be impacted by higher sourcing, logistics, and manufacturing costs. We also continue to see the impact of force materials and raw material shortages with suppliers and shutdowns due to Hurricane Ida, resulting in unplanned outages in some of our product lines. While we expect the current market environment and macro supply chain problems to continue challenging the segment, we remain optimistic. And as Andreas mentioned earlier, we remained focused on returning the division to profitability as these injured sheet conditions stabilize.  Now, on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position, and leveraged dynamics for the first 9 months of 2021, both of which remain a top priority for us. So far this year, IFF has generated $884 million in free cash flow, with cash flow from operations totaling approximately $1.1 billion. As the team has mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in our growth accretive businesses as well as integration activities. Year-to-date, we have spent $242 million or approximately 2.8% of sales on capex and expect a significant ramp-up in fourth quarter as our annual spend is traditionally more back-half weighted.  From a leverage perspective, we are continuing to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target with our cash and cash equivalents at finishing at $794 million, including $122 million restricted cash with gross debt reduced by $446 million versus the second quarter to $11.5 billion due to our debt maturity schedule as part of our deleverage plan. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.7 billion, with a 4.1 times net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA. With our continued strong cash flow generation, including proceeds from divested non-core businesses, we remain confident that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of less than 3 times Net Debt to EBITDA by within 20 to 36 months post transaction close.  Turning to slide 18, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the cost inflation trends that have impacted our business this year. As I mentioned earlier, IFF's and the industry at large has seen significant year-over-year inflation increases, which have been accelerating in the recent quarter. The inflationary pressures we are seeing today are significant. Just as examples, vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October. Price of wheat is up almost 40% in the last 12 months through October. Brent crude prices have more than doubled over the past 12 months to the highest level since October, 2018. In the U.S. natural grass prices are up 100% from a year ago.  And in the U.K., they're up about 500%. And transportation rates have increased significantly given the high demand and limited capacity to ship. Across the raw materials, logistics, and energy markets, like many industries around the world, we have seen cost accelerate each quarter, which has led to our margins being adversely impacted. For example, in the first half of 2021, gross margin was down about 150 basis points. Following the third quarter, we were down about 210 basis points. As we look ahead, we are being prudent in our planning as we expect these inflationary pressures will continue throughout the fourth quarter and over the course of 2022.  Consequently, this will require us to successfully implement significant pricing actions across each of our businesses, as well as improve our sourcing efficiencies, accelerate operational improvements, and capture targeted integration synergies to drive profit growth. Now moving to slide 19, I would like to share with this means for our consolidated financial outlook. For the full-year 2021, we are maintaining the increased total revenue forecast we announced in September to account for the strong demand. For the full year 2021, we are targeting $11.55 billion in total revenue, or approximately 8.5% growth up from the forecast of $11.4 billion or 7% growth that we disclosed in the second quarter.  We also expect our sales growth to continue in the fourth quarter as our Q4 quarter-to-date sales trend is solid. As mentioned, unprecedented macro supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures continued to impact our industry. And we do expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. While we are intently focused on offsetting these inflationary pressures through pricing actions, these are lagging the inflationary pressures. And as a result, we have further revised our adjusted EBITDA margin to be modestly below 21% down from approximately 21.5% that was forecasted in September. About half of this reduction is due to lower gross margin in the third quarter, and the other half stemming from higher cost trends we see in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we are targeting low single-digit EBITDA growth, a solid improvement in light of the external challenges. We also adjusted our capex spend outlook down, as we have been very thoughtful in balancing near-term operating priorities with the need to add capacity to support accretive growth across our businesses. Overall, we are pleased of the progress we've made to-date. Strong, top-line growth, and the commitment to meet near-term macro cost pressures. And we're confident that IFF is on the right path. Employees  continued success across our core business. I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Glenn. Before I wrap it up, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of IFF and our thousands of employees around the world who have showcased a remarkable resilience toward an evolving and continuously uncertain industry environment. They have continued to deliver strong year-over-year sales and profit growth and I'm confident that with our top notch financial operational structure supported by Glenn's financial leadership, we will be able to maintain and bolster our strong financial profile by continuing to deliver for both our shareholders and our customers.  Q4 is off to a solid start, and I know that our momentum will propel us to achieve strong sales growth for the full year and bring us another step closer to achieving our synergy targets. In some, it is clear to me that IFF is in an incredible strong position. We knew entering this year that the new IFF was poised to change our industry. But to do so, we had to execute. As we look at industry-leading sales growth for the full year, I'm just so proud of how everyone here stepped up and executed on our vision and delivered against our potential. IFF is once again the clear leader of this field, creating another iconic chapter in this Company's 132-year legacy.  This core strength of the business is why I felt now was the perfect time to start to transition to find IFF's next CEO. I have every confidence that now is the right time to let the next chapter of IFF's legacy begin. As we announced, the search has begun for my successor, and we expect that person to be in place by early 2022. I'm fully committed to a seamless transition and look forward to talking to you all about this more in the near future. Thank you all for your support. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : . In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of 1 question per person. Our first question comes from Heidi Vesterinen, with Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Heidi Vesterinen : Good morning, everyone. I have a question for Glenn, actually, and thanks for the info on why you joined IFF. What do you think of IFF's long-term targets rate? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the question. I would have to break them down relative to component parts. First of all, relative to topline, as we mentioned, we're very pleased for tracking extremely well versus the long-term targets and then when you take a look at how we're tracking versus competition, which is another great indicator. We're actually very pleased in terms of yards. So, we check that we'd say relative to our deleveraging target, getting below 3 times by year 3. We are feeling very comfortable with that. Combination of the cash flow generation from the business remains strong.  And as you know, we've announced a couple of divestitures and we'll continue to look at other non-core businesses. So, I would check both that -- both the deleverage as well as our free cash flow. The area that really needs to work is around our long-term margin objective. As you know, we have a 26% EBITDA margin target that was easier when we started off with a higher number at the beginning of the year and versus the most recent guidance. We're now about 500 basis points off that relative to the guidance this year. So, as we approach our '22 plan, we're spending energy thinking about that multiyear target.  I think structurally, there are couple of factors that we think still play in the favor of not only increasing where we are from an EBITDA margin, but potentially getting us back to that. 1, is clearly the biggest impact this year unexpected, has been the inflationary environment. And  we thought would talk more about this, but we lost about 200 basis points this year at our margin, relative to inflation, net of what we expect to price, and in addition, we've had some pockets of higher use of freight costs in a couple of our business. So that's about 200 basis points.  We still feel very confident on achieving the long-term synergy objectives, the cost synergies. And I would submit there are probably additional productivity in the business. I believe we strip out the material side of our business. We have over $4 billion of costs between our manufacturing operations and then our S&A, and I think we just sort of begun to scratch the surface relative to that with our synergy targets. That being said, we are working very intently right now to sort of think about -- and actually -- our pricing initiatives and also think about a longer-term productivity as well. Heidi Vesterinen : Thank you. Glenn Richter : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Your line is open. Matthew Deyoe : Good morning. I appreciate all the added detail in the slides on the cost side, but just trying to understand better the margin contraction a bit, and how we got to the point where we're cutting the guidance again. If I look at 3Q and then moving into 4Q, could you talk a little bit about how costs are coming in versus where you had budgeted them. And on that end, can you push price to offset logistics costs for businesses that you've just won recently, or is this just a cost of doing business in that margin component is going to come down or improve when cost and capacity come out. Glenn Richter : Yes. So good morning, Matthew. This is Glenn. I'll start with answering and maybe turn it over to Andreas. In general, the biggest hit as I just mentioned, on our business this year has basically been material costs, broadly impacting our business. Of the 200 basis points, it has impacted us and anticipated impact is about 200 basis points in terms of margin. About 2/3 of that is related to rate increases. So that's a combination of our raw materials, our energy, and our logistics costs. What's happening relative to each of those buckets is earlier in the year, we were thinking mid-single-digit relative to inflation and raw materials.  It's now high-single-digit approaching 10% in terms of the annual inflation. We're seeing logistics costs continue to accelerate that to the mid-teens. And then energy, as everyone is well aware, has been extremely volatile, and it's been trending up about 30% year-over-year. By the way, the planning posture for '21 is we really had relatively flat inflationary pressure, so we didn't expect at any of our material costs to go up. So, we have a much, much more significant impact relative to what we'd anticipated just a couple of quarters ago.  I would say the rest of our cost structure is working quite well. We have actually delivered strong results against our R&D sales, and administrative expenses were actually exceeding plan relative to our costs, so we're actually lower at that point. In general, manufacturing is working on productivity, although constraints in our system have limited some of the capacity gains, we can get and some of the efficiencies out of the system. The pricing dynamics that we are working very, very aggressively on capturing the pricing.  But today, we're capturing and expect to capture only about $0.50 on the dollar from inflation this year. And that's simply a lag factor relative to our ability to go to market and implement. I will note that as we look out in '22, we are anticipating those inflationary trends to continue into next year, and we are basically planning our pricing actions accordingly. I.e., each of our businesses are thinking about not only what has hit this year, but what we anticipate to hit next year, and we're executing against that. To your last point on pace, that depends by business. We have some but not a lot of multiyear contracts. In a lot of most cases, we have annual contracts.  And in many, if not most of those cases, they tend to run on a fiscal cycle, so beginning of year forward. But my last comment I would make is, we're in, I'd say unprecedented environments given the level of inflation. So, it is affording us an opportunity to go back in almost all cases to our customers and discuss the inflationary environment this will be our pricing going forward, even when we have sort of contractual relationships in place. So, let me maybe turn it over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, I think it's very comprehensive. So just on 1 aspect, you asked Matt on the logistics. Obviously, we go back on logistics as well, either as price increases or surcharges, and it's a bit tough up for newly won contracts, obviously, but we try what we can do because that has a huge impact in all businesses, particularly on the Health & Biosciences business. But here, I think there's another element in it is -- we are working to increase capacity because there's a lot of demand for -- in particular for Enzyme business.  And we are building -- we just installed a new fermenters and . And there's more to come for the first half of next year which will help us to decrease logistic costs as well and pull through when we get in terms of demand from our customers. We're very optimistic on this one because the technology is superior and then certainly good growth driver for us going forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks. And good morning, everyone. I guess just building on the last question, Glenn, maybe specifically, if you're willing to talk about it, and obviously you're early in the process, but how do you currently see inflation for '22? And how should we think about when you expect to have enough pricing implemented to cover inflation? Obviously, you talked about $0.50 on the dollar, but what's the timeline for more pricing to be in place? And also, how do you think about offsets in terms of dollars versus margin recovery in the timing they're in? Glenn Richter : Hey, thanks for the question, Mark (ph). You semi answered it with the intro is -- we're in the early phases of locking down a '22 plan. We desire to go out early in the year with it as much as we can, relative to our pricing actions. However, the pace at which we're able to implement that vis -a - vis the pace of inflation, we're not sure if you will when the curves will cross over from a standpoint. It's likely to be sort of late second quarter into the second half of the year, but I would say stay tuned. We're really still working on that. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess first, Andreas, you talked through some of the regional and business sales trends a little more on a year-to-date basis. Hoping you could frame that from the third quarter and into the fourth, where some of the pluses and minuses are. And specifically, with that organic sales guidance, where pricing was in the third quarter and where you think it's going to be in the fourth as we evaluate what the tailwind in 2022 could be, as you go back to customers on price.  And if I could just sneak a quick other one in on synergy realization and just help us think about the cadence of cost and revenue synergy realization in '22, especially on the cost side, where would seem like an inflationary environment makes it harder to risk to achieve some of the procurement savings that had been previously targeted. Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Yeah, thank you, Adam, for the question. So, what we have seeing in Q2 and Q3 is that we have grown about percent price. The risk was for volume going forward. We might see a little bit more in the fourth quarter in terms of price. But as you said, we had a good start sales wise into the fourth quarter. So, October can come in. Good that we don't have the final P&L here, so we can't talk about that. Synergy realization is going, actually, on the cost synergies extremely well. As you have seen, we have already realized the 40 million in the first 3 quarters of the 45-worth promised. So, it's very, very likely that we will over-achieve. On the sales synergies, we are very much on track.  And I see, when I visit our facilities and I was basically out in the field, the last week in Europe, but the teams are working very nicely and very, very well together. So, we see that more sales synergies are coming in. And that shows that we are building a very, very strong position for the Company going forward. In terms of the different categories as well, we see still a good performance on the Fine Fragrance side, which is very, very helpful. So just a good recovery, but its growth -- with growth rate here as well. And that's helping the whole results for the Company going forward. I think that's what we can say about the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Your line is open. Gunther Zechmann : Hi, thanks for taking my question and welcome, Glenn. The photo on the flight looks very youthful so it must be an active ingredients from Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Thanks for sharing the percentage change in raw materials. Can I just check if the numbers you gave earlier, Glenn are what you include in the full-year guidance, or current run rate. And then pricing is up to 2% of sales in Q3. Can you share the exit run rate out of Q3 or and October if you have it? And what further increases you expect to push through, please. Glenn Richter : Maybe, yeah. Good morning or good afternoon, Gunther. Good to hear from you. I'll answer the second question first. Q4 pricing  rate from Q3 is going to be very consistent with Q3, so it's about 2 points. It's slightly higher in Q4 versus Q3. And as a result of that, actually the inflation pressures are going to slightly outpace once again within the quarter, just given the cost increases from the standpoint, just as a follow-up to that, really we are focused on aggressively implementing late this year into '22 on that front.  Of the full-year margin guidance and relative to the freight impact, we have about 200 basis points associated with cost. About 2/3 of that is pure rate and about 1/3 of that, or about 60 basis points is related to higher usages of freight, principally air and principally to support our H&D business because of capacity limitation, so that piece as Andreas had mentioned, will take us some time to work out through '22 as we address some of the capacity constraints. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open. John Roberts : Thank you. And best wishes, Andreas, for the future, and welcome, Glenn. Andreas, your customers are seeing a lot of bulk raw material cost increases, so they're probably feeling even more cost pressure than you are. Do you see more reformulation going on? And is that providing any opportunities for more wins if your customers are reformulating their products a little bit more frequently here, because of their cost pressures? Andreas Fibig : So, I'm saying -- first of all, thank you for the question. It's -- we see reformulation. Is it massively more than what we have seen before? Probably not. But what we see in general, what comes in terms of projects, are bigger projects -- less projects, but bigger projects, which is actually good for us. Taking into consideration that we will win more of these projects, the cost for us is reducing in terms of the average projects, so that's what we see it at the moment. Indeed, many of our customers see good balance increases.  But the discussion with the procurement people on the customer side is going okay and well because they know what's happening on the raw material front here. So, I think that's where we are, what we see is still that we have really good strong demand from most of our customers. And that's very helpful in terms of the business and also in terms of the momentum we have as a business growing going forward because we have to take into consideration, we are still in the integrational phase, and we're gaining share. That's what we see or some comparison to our competitors. And we are making good, good progress in the integration as well. So that's all what I am to. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In your initial remarks, Glenn, you said that there remains significant opportunities for portfolio optimization. Does that mean that there's another, I don't know, $500 million to $1 billion in revenues that can be monetized? And second, can you describe or articulate your capital expenditures for 2022 and '23. And what's the arc of capital expenditures? And what are the priorities to spend on? Andreas Fibig : Good morning, Jeff (ph). This is Andreas. On the portfolio, as we said, we own about 5% of sales. That's what it is, and we are working on it. More will come probably early next year and then we can be more transparent around it. But we're very happy with the moves we have made on the portfolio and there's more to come. On the capex, I hand it over to Glenn (ph). Glenn Richter : Sure. Good morning. So, as you recognize, we updated our guidance for this year relative to our full-year capex spend at 4%. And that's in part because of just the ability to execute our capital programs well. given all of the different priorities we have in the business and far that is just continuing to be more surgical I'll say, relative to our investing capital. We do anticipate that that will ramp up next year as we're putting together our '22 plans, largely focused on our higher margin and higher growth businesses.  And a big piece of that actually is really the bottlenecking and enhancing our capacity situation into next year. So, I'll say more to come around the plan standpoint. We had -- I think previously guided to having spent a little bit more capex around the business playing forward for capacity reasons. And then the other area I would just note although it's a much smaller portion around IT. So, IT through an integration activity. We have some additional activities as we go into next year as well. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I had two questions. First, was the generally operating expenses in the quarter, both SG&A and then R&D specifically, were down quite a bit. And I was curious if you could comment on how sustainable those changes were. If it reflects maybe incentive compensation again or more tactical reductions given the gross margin pressures. I was curious about that piece. And then the second thing unrelated, was on Pharma.  You've given the capacity constraints that you've seen and demand outstripping supply, which is great. The question is, what -- where is that demand going? What's the risk that rebuilding, if you call it relative market share, when you do get capacity up is a challenge? I mean, where is that business going, and how confident can we be that that will come back when you get the capacity up? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Lauren, for the question. The first keys, Glenn will take and then take the follow one. Glenn Richter : Good morning, Lauren. As a relative to our R&D sales and administrative expenses, as I mentioned, we are favorable to plan and down from prior year, but that is not R&D. Actually, R&D is trending right on plan. And by the way, of our roughly 2.1 billion of annual spend for RS&A, about 30% is, R&D, and the residual is fairly equally split between sales, our commercial team, and an administrative.  We're seeing actually more efficiencies in the commercial teams as they come together post-integration and the back-office. So, the administrative teams as well. So that's really where we're seeing and are pushing more of the productivity, not R&D, we're always looking for ways to more efficiently spend our R&D budget, but we sort of directionally want to make sure that we continue to stay within the guidance we provided relative to our ongoing R&D spend. Andreas Fibig : On the former part of the question. They're seem to be about the Pharma recipients, businesses, is such as a very stable business. And it's predictable in the sense because you know, when you're in the product or in the pharmaceutical that you stay in because everything else would execute require a change that with the FDA that means that our customer base is very stable. So, there's probably no big groups that if we increase our capacity, that we have too much capacity in place.  We see as I said, good and stable demand. And despite the capacity on our manufacturing side, we had some issues with CB harvesting, which goes into one of the products of our big, big customers, which is -- I can give you,  are all one-to-one. And harvesting now is going better because we have new fields in front of Norway, which we're discovering right now and using much to increase our manufacturing on the side. So just to give you a bit of detail around the Pharma business but there's certainly no danger that the overbooking. Operator : The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with BaGird, your line is open. Mark : Hi, good morning. This is actually Mark Kreuer (ph) here, sitting in for Ghansham. Sorry to belabor the point a little bit here, but can you talk about where we are at from a price cost perspective across both the legacy IFF businesses and then the legacy Du Pont businesses, maybe on a dollar basis. That would be helpful. And then what's the historical price costs catch-up period for the 2 legacy businesses? Is there any meaningful difference in catch-up period across your various segments or regions? Glenn Richter : Yeah, relative to -- good set of questions. It's relatively inflation, we're seeing higher rates in legacy N&B then IFF, although we're seeing inflation across all businesses. But generally, we're in mid-single-digit range for legacy IFF and then low double-digit relative to legacy N&B. Catch-up period, generally 3 to 6 months. Certain businesses like H&B may have slightly larger percentage that are either an annual contract or a multi-year, so they might be  slower. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Your line is open. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you very much. Just based on the growth outlook for certain pieces of the acquired N&B assets, are there any parallels which may require additional capacity in the coming years just giving healthy outlooks? The legacy owner used to speak about some recent expansions already essentially being sold out, so just trying to gauge where the portfolio stands. Thank you. Andreas Fibig : No. Thank you for the question. So, you will see probably the biggest expansion on our side on capacity in the health and bioscience area, in particular, on the enzyme business, where we believe that our technology is really top notch, and we see a huge demand from our customers as well. So, most of the investments goes into that area. We've seen some capacity increases, as we said on the Pharma business, but not to the same degree as on the IFF's Health & Biosciences business. The rest is basically a business that's usually on Scent and on Nourish, which is partly legacy N&B as well. But more, let's say, maintain than it is investment into new plans. Operator : Our final question today comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Your line is open. Jonathan Feeney : Hi. Thanks very much for getting me in. Just a quick one. As the pricing process and your assessment of how easy that is to do, the dialogue, is there any significant difference in the acquired N&B businesses in the legacy businesses that you're running into? Because I did notice that it seems like the lag is a little bit greater in the segments that are heavier on acquired revenue, but there may be other ex-plant nations for that. So just curious about the general nature of the business. Is it tougher to take pricing there? Glenn Richter : Well, I think one thing we have to consider is the legacy N&B businesses just has a higher ramp. So, the inflationary pressures are more significant in that side. So basically, it just requires, if you will, a bigger lift relative to the implementation from that standpoint. Andreas Fibig : Absolutely. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to hand the program back to A - Andreas Fibig for closing reQ - Marks. Andreas Fibig : Thank you very much for participation. I hope that it helped to explain where we are. We are very pleased where we are in the integration process, and certainly with the volume performance we're doing as a Company, which is good. Thank you very much, and have a good day. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2021 conference call. Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter financial results and full year 2021 financial results and outlook for 2022. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the Company's performance and outlook based on the current state of the business. These statements contain elements of uncertainty, which we've laid out on Slide two of the cautionary statement. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in our press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website. Please also note that we will be using combined historical results for the fourth quarter defined as three months of legacy IFF results, and three months N&B results and for the full year defined as 12 months of legacy IFF January to December and 12 months of N&B February to December in both the 2020 and 2021 periods to allow comparability in light of emerge of completion of February 01, 2021. With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end. I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Mike and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, I think it's important to acknowledge that this has been a transformational year for IFF. We continue to make tremendous progress amid the global -- the complex global operating environment. With a world-class team and an unmatched portfolio, IFF has become a global leader in high value ingredients and solutions for the global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. IFF is a significantly larger, stronger and more diversified organization than when we begun our transformation several years ago. The enhanced scale gained through our combination with N&B makes us an even more powerful innovator and trusted partner to our customers. On a personal level, I must also reflect on what has been a tremendous and highly satisfying journey leading IFF. Together, we have taken a number of strategic actions that have transformed IFF into the category defining leader it is to day, and I'm also incredibly optimistic about IFF's future. The company's leadership team going forward has the right expertise to lead IFF's next chapter of growth and excellence in execution. I and the entire IFF team are pleased that Frank Clyburn will join IFF as our Chief Executive Officer effective, February 14. Frank brings extensive experience leading complex global businesses and overseeing large scale integrations. He is approved operate and will enhance the team's focus on execution to benefit our customers, teams and shareholders. It has been a privilege to lead such a talented global team and I know that was a recent appointment of both Frank and then IFF will be in good hands. We also recently announced the appointment of Barry Bruno to IFF's Board of Directors as an Independent Director. Barry is a welcome addition to our board as he has significant experience leading innovative consumer brands that will benefit all of IFF stakeholders as a company executes its strategic and operating priorities. Barry joins a board eight of which are new to the IFF board within the past year when Frank begins next week. That consists of proven executive with deep experience leading global organizations overseeing transformative merger integrations and executing business strategies across a diverse set of industries. On today's call, I will begin with providing an overview of IFF's full year 2021 performance and discussing the progress we have made so far on our integration. I will then turn the call over to Glenn who will provide a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question and answer session, then we'll also speak to our outlook for 2022. I'd like to begin on Slide six by reflecting on our strong performance for the full year 2021. IFF's financial results in 2021 reflect the strengths and durability of our extended portfolio and the exceptional dedication of our teams. Within the challenges of today's global operating environment, we delivered strong sales growth across our business divisions, including meaningful recoveries in the segments most affected by the pandemic. For the four year 2021, IFF delivered $11.7 billion in sales representing 10% growth or 8% on a currency basis consisting of very strong volume growth and modest pricing contributions. Like so many companies now persistent inflation and global supply chain challenges pressured our profitability margin. Yet, we achieve 3% growth in our combined adjusted operating EBITDA. Glenn will cover these topics in greater depths, but I want to note here that we are taking significant actions to best position the business amid evolving macroeconomic environment, including significant pricing actions. IFF continues to operate with a very strong financial foundation having delivered $1.04 billion in free cash flow or approximately 9% of our driven by robust cash generation. Given our strong financial position, we continue to make significant progress towards meeting our de leveraging target, having already reduced net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA to 4.1 times. We also delivered meaningful synergies in connection with our integration initiatives. Importantly, we have all performed our cost synergy targets for year one, post close of the N&B merger and our ongoing focus in execution positions as well to further drive synergy realization and productivity improvements. In 2021, we also made significant strides to optimize our portfolio, including the successful divestiture of food preparations business, and the announced sale of our microbial control business, which we expect will be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Once our microbial control sale is complete, the combination of all of these two transactions will generate approximately $1.4 billion in gross proceeds. Growing IFF to more rapidly de-lever the balance sheet as we continue to progress with our integration objectives, Frank and team will explore additional opportunities to optimize our portfolio driving greater focus on the core parts of the business and enhancing shareholder values through rapid eLeveraging. For IFF, 2021 was filled with exciting achievements and meaningful change that continue to propel us forward and solidify the importance of our business within the global supply chain. Our business is delivering strong growth as an indispensable partner to our customers and while we are operating in a challenging environment, our leadership team is taking the right action to position our business for the future. We are delivering on our commitment to boldly reinvent, deliver consistent execution and transform our ability to reach and partner with more customers around the world. 2021 was a foundational year and one that I have no doubt that the company will build on as it accelerates into the future. Now turning to Slide seven, I would like to walk through the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the of full year 2021. I'm pleased to share that we saw strong growth in all four of our key operating regions. In North America, we achieved 8% growth across nearly all segments led by high single digit growth in health and biosciences. In Asia, sales increased by 9% led by continued double digit in India and China, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions all perform particularly well in Asia with strong growth and momentum throughout 2021. IFF achieved 11% growth in Latin America region with double-digit growth across nearly all countries. Our Nourish division delivered strong double digit growth with health and bioscience and Scent businesses growing in the high single digits. Our EMEA also delivered strong sales results with 9% sales growth driven by the double-digit growth in fine fragrance business. EMEA was also bolted by strengths in our Nourish business. We saw significant growth led by food service. Moving now to Slide eight, I would like to discuss our sales performance across IFF business segments that contributed to our overall storm growth for the year. For the full year, Nourish achieve currency neutral sales growth of 9% was broad based strengths in our flavors, ingredients and food design businesses. Health and Biosciences delivered 6% currency neutral growth in 2021, primarily driven by strong performance and home and personal care, animal attrition and culture and food enzymes. Scent also delivered strong 8% currency neutral growth led by fine fragrance, consumer fragrance and ingredients. Pharma solution achieved 2% currency neutral growth driven by demand in our industrial business, while we continue to see headwinds related to ongoing limited material availability and logistical constraints. Now on to Slide nine, I would like to focus on the underlying dynamics driving segment perform. For Nourish, consistent strong performance included double digit growth in ingredients while our margins were impacted by our costs of raw materials, EBITDA increased 8% from strong volume growth, pricing actions and a continued focus on cost management. In Health and Bioscience, strong growth and home and personal care aim processing and cultures and food en enzymes were key drivers. Higher costs for raw materials and logistic remain a challenge which is adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 26.8% in the segment. Our Scent division benefited by particular, strongly rebound from last year in fine fragrances. In addition to continued solar performance and consumer fragrances and double-digital growth across cosmetic actives. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew 11% as margin expanded 30 Bps led by volume growth, favorable mix and higher productivity and finally, in pharma solutions, we saw significant customer demand and double-digit growth in the segment's industrial business. Global supply chain issues however, remained an overhang for 2021 margin performance. Moving now to Slide 10, I'm very pleased to share that our full year sales result exceeded pre-COVID levels, which is particularly encouraging for the year ahead. As previously outlined, sales goals was consistent across our business segments, reflecting the strengths and resilience of our extended portfolio and IFF's position as an essential partner for customers in critical industries around the world. It is clear that IFF continues to deliver enhanced value to our customers as a result of our merger with N&B and the work we are doing to strategically integrate our businesses and focus on execution. Simply put, we are a stronger business today and our customers recognize the unique value we bring as a trusted innovation partner. Let's move to Slide 11. I would like to reiterate our strong progress to deliver synergies and connection with the N&B combination. In 2021, we exceeded our year one target of $45 million to deliver approximately $60 million in cost savings. This includes approximately $20 million in savings in the fourth quarter. Revenue synergies also were a modest contribution to top line performance with a projected pipeline continuing to develop. Execution and operating discipline remain the top priority for our leadership team and I'm pleased to see results that reflect this commitment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Andreas and welcome everyone. Thank you again for being with us today. As Andreas highlighted, 2021 was a strong year for sales growth, including a strong fourth quarter finish. Looking more closely at our consolidated fourth quarter results, IFF generated greater than $3 billion in sales representing a 10% year over year increase on a currency mutual basis, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Health and Biosciences division, as well as high single digit growth across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma divisions. As with our full year results, our fourth quarter margin performance continued to face inflationary pressures, much like our entire industry, which offset positive volume growth, solid price increases, and the benefits of synergies and productivity. Early in the fourth quarter, we recognized a significant escalation in inflationary pressures and as a result, we quickly mobilized to prepare to implement significant pricing actions across all businesses to protect overall profitability. I'll discuss these actions as well as our efforts to accelerate productivity and operational excellence when I discuss our 2022 outlook. On the next several slides, I will briefly dive deeper into the fourth quarter financials of each of our core business segments. Turning to Slide 13, I'll begin with our Nourish segment, which experienced both a solid quarter and overall performance in 2021. In the fourth quarter, Nourish achieved 9% year-over-year sales growth on a currency neutral basis, driven by strong volume growth and price increases. Our Flavors business in particular realized strong growth with increased sales across all regions. Ingredients grew by strong double digits to increasing customer demand and both food design and food service also drove growth for Nourish in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating EBITDA declined slightly due to inflationary pressures. Pressure on profitability occured despite strong volume growth, increased productivity and strategic price increases in the segment. On Slide 14, our Health and Biosciences division delivered fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth of 13% on a currency neutral basis led by double digit growth in health, microbial control, animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, cultures and food enzymes and home and personal care each grew at a high single digits against strong year-over-year comparisons. Our adjusted operating EBITDA increased 4% due to volume growth and higher productivity, while margins faced pressure due to inflation and higher logistics cost. Turning now to Slide 15, our Scent division continued to perform well and achieved strong growth in the fourth quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year growth or 7% growth on a currency neutral basis. This performance was supported by a continued rebound in fine fragrances, which saw double digit growth driven by new wins and increased volume. Our Consumer Fragrances category delivered single digit growth against a strong high single digit year ago comparison. The ingredients business continues to contribute to the success of the overall segment with double digit growth in fragrance ingredients. Despite solid volume growth and favorable mix in the business, scent adjusted operating EBITDA growth was affected by higher cost of raw materials, which we continue to take action to mitigate. On Slide 16, our Performance Solutions segment delivered year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 9% from 2020 as a result of volume strength and price increases. Both our core pharma and industrial categories contribute to our strong performance in the quarter. Performance Solutions adjusted operating EBITDA and margin was also impacted by higher raw material and energy costs. We recognize the challenges the segment is experiencing due to the current market environment in macro supply chain constraints and are optimistic that as the global situation recovers, we will recognize the full potential of Pharma Solutions. Now on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position and progress in de leveraging. For the full year 2021, we delivered strong cash of over $1 billion and our on track to meet our de leveraging goals. 2021, CapEx was $393 million or approximately 3.4% of sales as we made strategic investments in the most attractive segments of our portfolio. Overall, our capital expenditures were lower than originally planned in part due to slower implementation of projects due to some vendor delays and a continued of the COVID environment. We also paid out $667 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2021. From a leverage perspective, we continued to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target, finishing 2021 with $4.1, net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. IFF reduced gross debt by $124 million to $11.4 billion versus Q3 and we finished 2021 with cash and cash equivalence of $716 million. We remain competent that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of three times net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA by year three, post close, further supported by additional divestitures that I will touch on in a moment. Turning to slide 18, I'd like to provide commentary on our business outlook for 2022. For fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion with adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We also are forecasting foreign exchange rates will be a headwind in 2022, approximately two percentage point headwind to our revenue and a four percentage point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA in '22. As you are all well aware, we continue to operate in a complex market environment with ongoing uncertainties from pandemic, global political tensions and supply chain challenges, IFF, and our industry at large have been impacted by these issues and we expect and have planned for that these challenges will remain into 2022. As I shared on our third quarter call, we expect inflationary pressures to be significant in 2022, as we see large cost increases in raw materials, energy and logistics. As a result, we are taking significant pricing actions to fully offset our dollar cost exposure, which we expect will result in strong sales and profit growth, but will depress margin. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to recover margin to pre-inflation levels as we are focused on improving returns to generate strong value creation for our shareholders. We also remain intently focused on driving cost reductions through synergies and increased productivity efforts throughout our business. In addition, we are increasing CapEx in 2022 to approximately 5% of sales as a result of '21 CapEx carryover and increased investments to the passive expansion in key technologies, which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs. Finally, we will also be increasing inventory by approximately $300 million to more appropriate levels to ensure we can continue to serve our customers. Now moving to Slide 19, I would like to focus more specifically on the cost inflation trends that we saw in '21 and now forecasts to see in '22. Heading into 2022, we expect certain costs, including raw materials, energy and logistics will continue to rise much as they did in '21. Overall, we expect '22 cost increases to be double digits, call it approximately 10%. We are seeing most of these increases related to inflation in raw materials with double digit increases in  oils, cellulose, pulp, turpentine, aroma chemicals, petrochemicals, fragrance specialty chemicals, savory ingredients, specialty chemicals, agriculture, grains and sweeteners. The inflationary pressures manifest themselves differently between the legacy N&B and IFF businesses. Most of the higher energy and logistics cost in '22 are related to legacy N&B. With added capacity coming online later this year, we hope to start to mitigate some of the logistics headwinds we have been facing due to an imbalance in supply and demand. If you look at legacy IFF portfolio, we are seeing high single digit raw material inflation similar to our flavor and fragrance peers. Recognizing these challenges, we have been aggressively pursuing broad based pricing actions and accelerating synergy and productivity efforts. Turning to Slide 20, I will provide a bit more insight into our sales guidance for 2022. Our $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion sales expectation represents continued momentum on top of our strong to 2021 results. To get a more comparable revenue basis, you must add back approximately $500 million of sales related to N&B in January of 2021 as N&B results were not part of IFF until February 01 of 2021. Our sales guidance also accounts for the removal of June to December '21 revenue results following the anticipated completed sale of our microbial control business, as well as the first nine months of '21 sales for their fruit prep divestiture which we closed in October of last year. That gets you to our comparable '21 revenue base of $11.85 billion as indicated on the slide. As I said earlier, we are significantly increasing our prices in order to fully offset the dollar cost exposure of our inflation for 2022. With that in mind, we anticipate pricing to be significantly larger contributor to the top line in '22. This pricing impact plus more months volume growth following a strong '21 will be central to our overall sales performance in '22, where we expect to grow approximately 6% to 9% year over year on a comparable currency neutral basis. Now, in terms of our guidance on the adjusted operating front, we also had to make adjustments for comparability. If you add that EBITDA related to N&B general results and subtract the EBITDA related to seven months of EBITDA as a result of the anticipated divetiture of our microbial control business, as well as the EBITDA related to the fruit prep business for the first nine months of '21, you get to a comparable '21 base of approximately $2.5 billion. As mentioned implementing broad base pricing actions to offset inflationary pressures is critical to our '22 plan. Over the last three plus month, each of our business has executed pricing actions across essentially our entire customer base. As a result, we anticipate to completely offset projected '22 install pressures with pricing actions. The majority of these actions will be implemented in the first and second quarter. I would also note that we anticipate that 2023 will benefit from an additional $200 million of net pricing benefit due to the full annualization of our pricing actions, which will be equal to a 100% capture of the combined 2021 and 2022 inflation impact on our business. Importantly, we also continue to closely monitor the global supply chain environment and will be prepared to execute additional price actions as appropriate. By adding anticipated volume leverage plus synergies and productivity, we expect comparable EBITDA growth in '22 to be strong, up approximately 4% to 8%. It should be noted that the synergy and productivity contribution here is a net number where it is a combination of the benefits of synergy and productivity, net of cost of living increases and reinvestments in the business. Our guidance implies that our adjusted operating EBITDA margin will be down modestly versus '21, principally due to our net dollar cost recovery, which equates to approximately 100 basis points. Over the course of '21 and '22, we will see more than $1 billion of total inflation and while we are working rapidly to cover the price increases, it has impacted margins significantly. To give you a perspective of the magnitude, our margin for full year '22 on an inflation adjusted basis will be approximately 300 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%. In terms of marching cadence throughout '22, we expect the first half to be down year over year with expansion coming in the second half. While sales are expected to be strong in the first quarter, year-over-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin performance will be the most challenged of the year down over 300 basis points versus our reported first quarter 2021 margin with each quarter after that concluding. Much of this will be driven by price to total inflation, where we expect to turn positive starting the third quarter. As I conclude, I want to highlight our four key areas of focus for '22 and provide further color into our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to building on our strong '21 sales momentum. Our 6% to 9% targeted '22 currency neutral sales growth anticipates that we will continue to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. We believe that our exceptional R&D pipeline and scaled global commercial teams including targeted '22 investments will allow us to continue to deliver superior customer solutions and support strong growth. In addition, as I mentioned previously, we are making substantial investments to increase capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio and enhancing supply chain efficiencies. Lastly, we'll be sharpening our focus on our revenue synergy opportunities as we are behind our original planned pace, as much of last year was focused on addressing near term supply chain issues. That said, we are confident that the breadth and depth of our platform will allow us to build meaningful revenue synergies over time. Second, as previously outlined, we are intently focused on broad based pricing actions to offset inflation. And importantly, as the macro environment involves, we are prepared to quickly execute additional pricing actions throughout the year as needed. To enhance our ability to react more quickly to the dynamic environment over the last several months, we have undertaken a comprehensive end to end review of our procurement processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams for each one of our businesses. Our focus has been to compress the time between inflation signals and customer pricing actions, ensuring we optimize product segment and customer specific pricing actions and closely monitor the level and pace of pricing utilization. Going forward, we are focused on further enhancing our procurement processes and pricing programs. Third, we are determined to accelerate our synergy realization and more broadly our productivity efforts in 2022. For your reference, included in our '22 guidance, we are targeting approximately $200 million of cost reductions from synergies, yield enhancements and reformulations, logistic efficiencies and other operational improvements. Net of wage inflationary pressures and targeted investments to help drive top line growth. we are targeting net cost efficiencies of approximately a $100 million for the year. While we feel this is good progress, we also recognize that there is more work to do. Consequently, in addition to the end to end review of procurement, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of our global manufacturing and logistics platform, constructing a plan to accelerate the scope and scale of our global shared service capabilities and developing a detailed technology and digital integrated roadmap all with the goal of driving meaningful efficiencies, while also ensuring we provide superior customer solutions and service. Fourth, we are actively working to accelerate our non-core divestitures. As we have discussed, we are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business, which will enhance the efficiency and profitability of our portfolio. We're also targeting additional portfolio optimization to further deliver our balance sheet and focus on core growth opportunities. Over the coming quarters, we will proceed with marketing a handful of nonstrategic businesses, call it three or four, where we believe that over the next 18 months, we can generate expected proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Similar to our fruit prep and Microbial Control business, these are non-strategic and the transactions will be accretive to our go-forward growth rate and margin profile. With this action plan together with our current sales momentum and strength, our leading portfolio, I am confident that IFF will deliver strong results in 2022. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Andreas. Andreas Fibig : Thank you, Glenn. IFF's transformation has been deeply personal to me, and I know that this company is stronger today than it has ever been. I am proud of the solid year we had in 2021 with significant year over year sales and profit growth, as well as steady progress towards our integration with N&B. So all my time at IFF, I've been consistently impressed by the thousands of employees who have dedicated their time and talent to make our company, the category defining leader it is today. I want to thank them for their contributions over this year and the time I have led the company and also for that passion about IFF and the commitment to our customers. The path ahead for the company and its new leadership team is clear. I'm confident that IFF enters its next chapter with the right team at best in class portfolio, innovative spirit, significant financial flexibility and a unified sense of purpose to drive long term growth and benefit our shareholders, employees, customers and communities. With that. I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator :  And we will take our first question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Gunther Zechmann : Hi. Good morning everyone. Hi, Andrea. Hi Gleen, thanks for taking my question. Can I start with two? The first one is on the top line guidance for the year. Can you just outline to us what's required to get to the higher or the lower end of the range respectively please? And the second one is you're pushing through quite a lot of price increases already ahead of some of your key peers in F&F. What's the volume elasticity that you expect or have already seen on the price increases and what you hear from your customers in that regard please? Andreas Fibig : Yeah. good morning, Gunther. Thanks for the question. Your two questions are highly related because relative to the top line, we'd say the variable that's likely to be the bigger indicator of the range is we're going to be more volume than price. If anything, frankly, we feel very good about what we've implemented from price what's coming through. If there's additional inflationary price pressures, we may in fact push additional pricing, but volume to some extent, I think is the bigger question mark for us. We had a 2% to 3% assumption relative to volumes. That's probably a point lower than historically the market from a standpoint and that will probably drive the difference in terms of the top line. To your second question, we've actually have not seen much elasticity. i.e. as you know yourself sort of amp  up on the consumer product companies have been releasing recently, those volumes generally have been sticking in the market. We have one month by the way, the month of January results, generally volumes are sort of holding  in their Q4. So we're not seeing sort of a drop yet. That being said, when we put the plan together, recognizing this is going to be a very abnormal year, given the sheer degree of pricing, we got it prudent to plan accordingly and we actually expect, and what we've seen from an awful lot of our competitors is everybody is basically implementing the same range of pricing in the market. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Yeah. Thanks and morning, everyone. Wanted to follow up sort of related to the last question, so in the '22 guidance, I guess both top line and adjusted EBITDA expectations is really strongly predicated on this pricing. So yeah how do you think about this in kind of broader, longer term strokes. If you go back years ago, competitors or ebbed and flowed in terms of the ability to take price and how quickly they took price and how much they took price. So how do you think about how your competitors react? If you go back through those earnings calls, nobody's really talking about specifics, but you just laid out specifics. So yeah how do you think about or what's embedded in what your competitors are going to do from a pricing standpoint and how quickly can you adapt if your competitors don't directly follow how much you're taking at this point and just a related point, how do we think about it beyond '22 in terms of how much pricing is given back versus what you're taking this year? Andreas Fibig : Sure. Great question, Mark. The reality is we're well into midstream on pricing actions. We signal in our third quarter call with heavy inflation on the horizon, we react as a very quickly. So we spent the latter part of the fourth quarter and then sort of every working day this year of executing broad based pricing across the entire customer base. That actually has been quite effective. So based on the read of that i.e., we've implemented most of that pricing already, which will kick in largely over the first and second quarter. It appears to be sticking. We also know from observing our competitors, as they're under similar inflationary pressures, we're all sort of seeing the same thing and they're also are passing pricing through. So we feel like we're sort of neck to neck in terms of what we're doing in the market. We are being surgical. There are certain category is that are slightly more elastic or price competitive, if you will and are being thoughtful about sort of where we price and there are other areas that typically are less of elastic, they also are passing pricing through.  So we feel like we're sort of neck-to-neck in terms of what we're doing in the market. We are being surgical. There are certain categories that are slightly more elastic or price competitive, if you will and are being thoughtful about sort of where we price. And there are other areas that typically are less of elastic for a host of, and sort of making sure that we sort of price appropriate in those segments. But we do believe that -- actually more than believe, we've seen it. A lot of our pricing is in fact now and being implemented over the coming months. And, we have not seen, as I mentioned, a big significant change in terms of volumes and the amount of customers that we've lost has been relatively small, directly related to our pricing actions. We\u2019re relative to the longer term, as we mentioned on the script, we had about $400 million of inflation last year. We anticipated about $600 million, so in all, in a billion dollars, between the two years. We implemented $200 million last and we're planning on matching the $600 million this year. So we're still $200 million short. We do fully anticipate to capture that additional $200 million as we move into 2023. And very importantly, the market continues to ebb and flow. Although we haven't seen a lot of movement on raw materials recently, there's been some ups and downs, but are prepared to react. And if they're additional inflationary pressures, we're, we're positioned to go to the market very rapidly. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mike DeStefano with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike DeStefano : Hey, good morning. Good end of the year. And Andreas has been great working with you. I guess my question is when you, you think about when the deal is put together your -- you seem to be on track to hit your top-line growth goals through 2023. If you're going to do '25 & '26 this year, it does seem like sort of a tall order to get to over $3 billion by '23. So just curious, do you think the absolute EBITDA goal in '23 is still doable or maybe it's delayed a year? And I know if you get the $200 million in pricing next year; that helps a lot. So just curious you can sort of walk us through what happens in '23 relative to the original goals for the deal? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : I think it, it is a -- it is the question in some sense, how do we think about our longer term goals? Obviously Frank joins us next week and we will be working very aggressively over the coming months to review our longer term targets. That being said, I would say two things certainly going from '25, '26 to call it 32, 33; it\u2019s a big number for next year. As you pointed out, I think we have a clear line of sight to $200 million of incremental pricing at least another a hundred million of synergy productivity. I actually would hope for more, quite frankly, but we have a hundred million left on the extent synergy side that gets us directionally to 2285 to 29 range from the standpoint. So we're getting to close the gap, but there's still a gap there. And we have work to figure that out. I think on a qualitative basis I am optimistic there's lot year because of the operating environment has been very challenging. And again, he would, would've anticipated the level of inflation and what we had to deal with on top of that, the global supply chain issues, but we do feel a combination of the strength of the platform in terms of revenue opportunities for growth. And in addition, the more I time I spend here, the more I'm convinced that there are meaningful opportunities to enhance our overall performance in terms of productivity and operating margin. So I, until Frank has arrives and we sort of go through that very detailed process, we can't provide a number. But there's a clear line to call it 2829 next year, based on pricing and productivity. And I think we have additional opportunities on top of that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thank you and best wishes Andreas. You're guiding to a 4% headwind from current seat there EBITDA in 2022 and that's more than the 2% impact on sales. This is our first time going through an FX headwind with the new portfolio. So maybe help us with how much your costs are in dollars relative to the revenues and foreign currencies. And your side of the Euro continues to be the key currency, but has the overall basket of important currencies changed with the new portfolio? Andreas Fibig : The basket has changed actually with the combination of NMB. It's actually slightly more U.S based. Then it is non-US based. Roughly around 50% of our revenues are U.S dollar denominated, about 25% are, are Euro, and then a, a range of currencies for the residual from a an earnings perspective while the Euro's 25% in revenues. It's about 20% in terms of our earnings. From a cash flow standpoint, because we have a higher cost base that European denominated. So, it is a significant portion. It's the one, that's what we focused on from a risk standpoint. As you know, the Euro dropped from circle 118 on average, last year, it's been in sort the 113, 114 range. We were planning a 113, so that's how we sort of think about the year. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was open to maybe dig in a little bit more just on the cost energy capture and the assumption that are embedded in the '20 -- in the '22 guidance. Just, we're kind of what -- and what's left to capture post '22 and guess the corollary to that, and this kind of address a little bit in some of the other conversations, but as we think about where we are exiting 2022 with some of the pricing carryover just relative to the original and be merger plan, kind of the, the margin EBITDA potential in '23? Andreas Fibig : Yeah, sure. Adam, thanks. Thanks for the question. Relative to the synergies we identified as reminder, we did $60.21 million. Our commitment was to get to $180 million this year and to ramp up to $300 million. We're actually going to be short of that. We're actually posting another $90 million this year. I would note that our total productivity basket is $200 million. So we're thinking more broadly than just synergies, frankly, a year past the deal. It's important that we just figure out how to cut costs across the enterprise, as opposed to just focus on the narrow combination areas. Now of that shortfall, if you will, this year, it's all in the procurement arena, just given what's going on global supply chain. Wasn't realistic to sort of count on the synergy impact. So 60 plus -- plus the 90 gets us basically to the 150, and as I mentioned, I'm fully confident we're going to get the residual 150 and synergies to other areas and we'll continue to focus on productivity above that. So if you think about the carry over to next year between pricing of $200 million and then another 150 that's how you get to the 28 of the 29 from sort of a carryover standpoint into '23. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan, your line now open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. You, generated $1.4 billion in cash-flow on an EBITDA base of $2.4 billion or a little less than 60%. Is that the ratio that you expect for 2022, that is your operating cash flow will be about 1.5 or do you think you can make improvements in this ratio? What -- what should be the normal ratio of operating cash flow to EBITDA? Andreas Fibig : Yeah. it's a great question. We have some more work to do to figure out sort of where we're going to be longer term relative to cash generation. We're going to be actually making slightly higher investments in two areas this year. I think net of these investments will be sort of about equal on a cash flow basis. One is we're going to be adding inventories building, I should say, inventories of about $300 million. As a reminder, when the deal was closed a year ago, we were at artificially low inventory levels, about 111 days. This historically the combined entity was in the 1 25 range. We built some of that back at the end of the year. We were, but we're still sort of short of where we need to be. The second thing is our CapEx spending will increase this year as well, relative to last year. Those increases are twofold. We ended the year less than $400 million. Some of the CapEx we were unable to implement last year that was a by-product of suppliers, basically being delayed in terms of supplying steel and other products. And in addition, just we operate in COVID environment. So the speed at which we're able to implement the load as well. So we're ramping up. We're also ramping up simply to address some capacity constraints, supply chain, which will actually achieve, help achieve higher demand levels as well as lower costs on the logistics side. So net, there is about a combination of $500 million increase between inventories and higher CapEx year-over-year, but the overall cash-flow apart from the business would be felt relatively neutral, after that's done. Longer term, as I mentioned previously, we, really have some work to do, to think about our longer term sort of goals relative to the cash generation of the enterprise. Operator : And we'll take our next question for Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. So I know you commented on there being in that residual $200 million benefit on, on pricing when we get into 2023, but I did think it was worth just referencing the fact that some of your competitors talk about it taking 18 to 24 months for inflation to be covered with pricing. So I'm just curious why that would be such a shorter timeframe for you. So that's kind of point one and point two is just, I think the N&B businesses, there are components of them. My understanding there are little bit more commodity in nature where switching costs would be low for your customers versus more and there's certainly plenty. It's very value add, and that's not true at all. But just any thoughts or the degree you have visibility on elasticity for those portions of the portfolio? I don't know how, what you know, data was like at, N&B and so on. If there's visibility into some history on that piece of business as well, that's informing your elasticity thoughts for this year? Thanks. Andreas Fibig : Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. In general, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much of volume drop off relative to our pricing action. So there are certain categories that are slightly more competitive, but in the environment where demand is still relatively high, we've been able to push through pricing. So there, there nowhere have we seen sort of great pockets of sort of softness across any of the businesses? That's point one. Point two, there is a lag, and that's why there, the $200 million will kick in late this year and roll into next year from an overlap standpoint. And there's too reason for that, that there's contractual relationships that despite actually in this environment, it's been easier to open up renegotiations to the level inflation. It takes time to renegotiate and put it in place. So just a timing element and then some of the contracts are more indices based or tied to certain indexes that certified as well. So recall we had $400 million last year, so we're, we're basically implementing all that. And then we have another $600 million to catch up. So at that billion, we will catch up $800 million of it within literally sort of five. And then we will kick into the residual into '23, which is right in that same window sort 18 months, thinking that sort of for implementation. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Butler with Deutsche bank. You line is now open. David Butler : Thank you. Good morning. Going back to the volume guidance this year, 2% or 3%, it seems a little bit low given you are gaining share. You might have some beginnings of initial revenue synergies. Is there anything limiting that line growth assumption for this year that you can point out? Thank you. Andreas Fibig : I, think we have been appropriately prudent in our planning process, given the sheer level of pricing that we have in the plan. We didn't want to sort of sort of push the envelope if you will, from a volume standpoint. As I mentioned previously, it's going to depend upon the consumer certainly in the very, very early days of the year. That seems to be holding up. But we have a lot of year ahead of us, as well. From a capacity standpoint as we've mentioned in the past, we are making very meaningful investments, a combination of CapEx, as well as inventory, to allow us to address some of the legacy issues we had last year. Those issues were principally and legacy N&B businesses that will feel better about having the capacity to meet and if it continues. But it's largely a function of just being prudent in this sort of a very, very unprecedented market from the planning standpoint. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats again. And Andreas, I guess maybe a follow up to the last question in terms of your characterization of channel inventories, if you can you know, I'm looking at two subcategories on slide 9 ingredients and fine fragrance has obviously had a very, very big year. Are you assuming some sort of mean version as the year unfolds just from a demand standpoint as channel inventory comp against, pretty healthy comps from 2021. And then also, I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you break-up the sequencing go inflation in terms of what you're assuming the inflation trajectory as a year unfolds? I know you made comments on one queue. Andreas Fibig : Yeah, let me I'll answer the second question really, just to give you some perspective on margin, sort of the margin change year over year progression through the year. So that reflects sort of the combination of the inflation and the pricing, the action, interestingly, it enough because we've been in two years of COVID it's difficult to look at any of the businesses on a given quarter and it's better to look on a two year or normalized basis. And when you, that actually the range relative to the currency neutral results of our businesses actually tightened up quite a bit. And they come very close together. So as it relates to this year from our planning standpoint, we don't have big differences planned per se, across our different business units. There much more tighter distribution in volume in part because we have a two to 3% volume in general. And in part, because we think we're opinion more normalized environment, and some of the capacity issues are also being effectively addressed. So we don't expect to have a, a wide range of impact. A wide range of differences between the businesses as relates to volumes from a pro on the pricing actions and the inflation and how we're offsetting that we do expect that the first half principally the first quarter will be the most challenged. We expect that the first quarter is likely to have margin down year of year, a little over 300 basis points. We expect that that will soft into around 150ish in the second quarter. And then in the back half of the year, we'll basically be up to get to the full year. The full year guidance is sort of directionally down 80 basis points year over year from a combination. So that, basically is a reflection of how we see the, sort of the, the pricings, the pricing kicking in relative to the inflation. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. So when I look across your portfolio, pretty solid results in Nourish, Scent, et cetera. Do you kind of take a step back and look at the portfolio you know, right here right now, can you just comment on two things the first, just where you feel incrementally more positive of on the potential for revenue synergies then also just any further color on port smaller portfolio printing? Thank you so much. Andreas Fibig : Yeah. Good question. So maybe Andres going to add a little bit more on the revenue synergy, right? We feel very good about the longer term prospects on revenue synergies. We admit that we're behind, we, we basically are not on the original plan relative to the timing and for the pace of the revenue synergies. That in our view is simply a function of how we spent the last year. The last year because of the nature of supply chain issues inflation issues. We ended up dedicating resources more to the here and now from the standpoint. It's actually also allowed this for our commercial teams, our R&D teams to basically spend more time working together and a byproduct of that. We do feel like there's a very strong pipeline of opportunities going forward. So I very -- you will see basically the majority of the opportunities within our no division because by the nature of the products and the customer, it just goes very nicely together. If you just take all the plant based protein products where basically can, can offer almost a total solution on in many, many cases, even a total solution to our customers, so that that's one example. The other example is, and we had just one of the big customer meetings on, on the American cleaning Institute, Congress, this this month's where you see that the enzyme business for household care products and the fragrance business are going hand in hand. So these are certainly the biggest opportunities for us going forward and then something which we should not underestimate is that we have opportunities on the R&D side as well. And I give you just one very concrete example. Everybody is looking now for these the capsules for you put the fragrance into detergent and to produce a green capsule. And now with our enhanced capabilities, we have many more programs running to come up with really good solutions. They're already in generation two and three, and that is a synergy by themselves as, as well on the R&D area, which probably takes a little bit more time. And then Glenn, you should comment on the portfolio. Glenn Richter : Yeah, a great question on portfolio, as I mentioned in my comments, and I think we've done a very, very good job of being thoughtful about non-core businesses. Non-Core those that basically are sort of diluted for our top line and bottom line, and just simply strategically don't have a great fit. As you know, we have sold through prep. We will be closing the second quarter on microbial controls. That's basically $1.4 billion gross. We have three or four other businesses that are being teed up. We will be going to market in the coming months quarters. We fully anticipate to have them executed. I need transactions close in the cash in within 18 months. We think that range is $1.5 billion to 1.7 billion relative to the three to four entities and very importantly, our goal is to use those proceeds to get us to the three times or lower laborer issues. So that actually been working very well; we had a dedicated set of teams to do nothing, but sort of focus on that to get that done markets have been good in relative to interest in, in certain properties. So we're very encouraged by that. Operator : And we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Andreas Fibig for any additional or closing remarks. Andreas Fibig : Yeah. Thank you very much for the participation and, and the good questions and taking preparation. That's my last IFF meeting here. Thank you for all the good and constructive work and have a good day. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful time -- wonderful day.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.  Participants will be announced by their name and Company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2022 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the Company's performance particularly with regard to our outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2022. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2022 and in our press release, all of which are on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday. Please note that we will be using comparable results for the first quarter defined as three months of legacy IFF results, January through March and three months of legacy N&B results in both the 2021 and 2022 periods, these results also exclude the impact of divestitures and acquisitions. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be speaking with you all and excited to share perspectives from my first 90 days as CEO of IFF. During today's call, I will discuss my initial thoughts since joining IFF and highlight our key operating priorities and commitments as a company for the full-year 2022. As I've spent the last 90 days meeting with IFF colleagues and key customers around the world, asking questions, listening and evaluating our business, it has become even more clear to me that IFF has built a very strong foundation with incredible opportunities ahead. Our business has built the robust diversified portfolio and driven team needed to continue leading our industry while delivering sustainable profitable growth. Simply put, I am thrilled to lead and work along such a passion team of more than 24,000 employees with a shared commitment to strengthening customer partnerships and driving differentiated innovations. Together, we will focus every day on the operational rigor and executional excellence required to deliver even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Before moving forward, I first must acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy facing the Ukrainian people since Russia's invasion began. As we have previously stated, IFF unequivocally stands with the people of Ukraine. Our top priority remains the safety of our team members and their families in Ukraine. And like many other global companies, we are working closely with local governments to offer assistance where possible. Aligned with our core values several weeks to ago, we limited production and supply of ingredients in into Russia to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine. Our plan at this time is to continue to supply to the best of our ability in accordance with sanctions, logistics availability and other key factors. Now I would like to begin by sharing some initial learnings and insights from my first 90 days with IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our first quarter 2022 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full-year 2022. After that, we will open the call for Q&A. Starting on Slide 6, I'd like to reflect on what I've seen and heard from our global colleagues, customers, investors, suppliers, and members of our Board. As I noted in my introduction, IFF is incredibly well positioned from a portfolio perspective with an exceptional depth and breadth of product offerings and an unrivaled R&D platform that uniquely positions IFF to win with our customers. Our business is poised to benefit from sustained long-term tailwinds for profitable growth as we have demonstrated leadership in the most in demand consumer categories. We are the largest player in our industry with unmatched global scale, a strong innovation pipeline and a highly diverse and balanced business mix across categories, regions and customers to create significant value. Collectively, these are attractive characteristics and a strong foundation to build upon moving forward. Equally important, however, are the clear opportunities to improve our operating practices and ensure that we are achieving our financial commitments. This is one of my top priorities going forward, as I believe that consistent and consecutive delivery of course, within our control is critical to build trust and credibility as IFF\u2019s CEO. Specifically, we are working to cultivate a culture across our entire platform that motivates our teams and ensures accountability across the business. We are continuing to enhance our operational execution with a renewed focus on instilling greater rigor and excellence, aligning our compensation metrics to keep to KPIs that are measurable and strongly correlated to value creation. Please note that we are committed to investing in capacity, digital, R&D and commercial to capture incremental growth and productivity opportunities to ensure we deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. With all our initiatives, we are closely focused on consistently delivering on our short and long-term financial commitments and creating enhanced value for all stakeholders. Moving to Slide 7, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the process underpinning our efforts to accelerate value creation across IFF. Our success starts with enhancing our corporate culture to ensure that IFF efforts worldwide are aligned with our vision of strategic excellence. It starts with establishing a renewed focus on winning while outlining the benefits for our team around the world. To guide our efforts, we are developing a deeper understanding of the sources and drivers of value across the business to help prioritize our investment of energy and resources moving forward. By understanding the facts, our extended leadership team will have the ability to make better business decisions, including investment allocations, which we expect will lead to greater financial returns. With that understanding, we will have better visibility into our strategic roadmap, essentially setting our profitable growth agenda for both the near and long-term as we dedicate strategic investments from the highest value opportunities. Underpinning everything we do will be a commitment to operational rigor and a culture of executional excellence across our platform. Our results in the first quarter are beginning to reflect this commitment to operating discipline, which will remain a top priority for our leadership team going forward. We plan on going into more depth on our strategy and financial outlook moving forward at an Investor event that we are planning on having in the second half of 2022. More details to come on that in due course. Turning now to Slide 8, I would like to start with a foundational look at our portfolio. Since my joining IFF in early February, our executive management team have begun a whole diagnostic of our strategies and business model to ensure we were operating to the best of our ability. As part of this process, we have thoroughly examined our business relative to the drivers of our current and future levels of profitability. To ensure we capture the full cost of doing business, we have gone beyond traditional operating costs to account for invested capital, such as CapEx, inventory and fixed assets. Through this return on invested capital loans, we have incorporated all costs to create a more robust fact base across our entire business portfolio to make better resource decisions. Based on the preliminary assessment, here's a snapshot of our sub businesses. As you can see, we have a significant amount of high return businesses, but also like most businesses, we identified opportunities where we can improve our performance. In high performing areas of the portfolio, we will reinvest with conviction to fuel strong profitable growth. We will also explore all avenues to more efficiently manage resources in our medium return business with a goal of maximizing our performance. And in areas of our portfolio where returns are not meeting our expectations for a below best-in-class benchmarks, we intend to either optimize our capital decisions to improve returns or evaluate appropriate opportunities to de-prioritize or exit the business. As we move forward, we are fully committed to maximizing our portfolio to deliver the most attractive returns in value creation opportunities. In fact, for 2022, we have adjusted our long-term incentive plan, replacing our net debt ratio with return on invested capital as a performance metrics to increase focus on capital efficiency. Now, before I dive into our first quarter results, I want to reemphasize that I am committed to the four key operating priorities we outlined earlier this year. Building upon the strong sales momentum, we established in 2021, we are first aiming to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. To achieve this, we are making significant investments to increase capacity, improving supply chain bottlenecks and driving greater revenue synergy opportunities. On revenue synergy, specifically, it is all about expanded revenue growth opportunities, and we feel good about the longer term prospects and the power of the portfolio. To highlight an example, we recently were awarded access in vanilla, a large opportunity with the global customer by leveraging heritage N&B's global technical know-how in ice cream, in heritage IFF's Vanilla sustainability program. IFF offered a combination of technical expertise and sustainability that competitors do not have. The result was not only strong potential revenue and flavors, but also incremental value creation for total IFF, including protein, emulsifiers and LBG. I am pleased to see in my early days the traction we are making and excited to dig in with the business to unlock more growth opportunities ahead. Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to provide an overview of our solid performance for the first quarter. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of today's environment, we achieved good sales profit and growth across our business. In the first quarter, IFF delivered $3.2 billion in sales, representing 31% growth or 13% growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. While inflation in global supply chain restrictions continue to impact our profitability margin, we achieved 9% growth in our comparable currency neutral EBITDA. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.69 for the first quarter. As I mentioned, we are evaluating and implementing specific initiatives to ensure we continue to navigate the future headwinds during the remainder of 2022 and beyond. As a result of increased working capital requirements, higher CapEx and seasonality, our free cash flow results were negatively impacted in the first quarter. Looking ahead, I can assure you this will be a significant focus area for the remainder of the year, and we expect strong improvements in the back half of the year. In terms of deleveraging the balance sheet, we remain on plan as our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. We also delivered meaningful synergies and productivity gains for more than $30 million in the quarter, including operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies. As mentioned, we continue to prioritize portfolio optimization and are making strong progress on the divestiture of the microbial control business. It should be noted that the anticipated closing of our microbial control business is now expected to happen on July 1 versus June 1, previously to provide more time to complete the separation work streams and minimize disruptions and risk to the microbial control business upon close. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our first quarter financials. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Frank. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Let's start on Slide 11 with sales performance of each of IFF's core businesses. Together, Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions achieved $3.2 billion in sales revenue in Q1, representing comparable currency neutral sales growth of 13%. Of note, all our sub-businesses posted year-over-year comparable currency neutral growth in the first quarter. Nourish delivered the most substantial growth with significant broad-based strengths in our flavors, ingredients and food design businesses. Health & Biosciences similarly achieved strong sales growth having managed headwinds in the Health business. The Scent division carried a strong momentum from last year through the first quarter with strong results in fine fragrance, consumer fragrance and ingredients. Lastly, Pharma Solutions also achieved currency neutral sales growth driven by the division's continued strength in its industrial business and resume demand for pharma. In terms of sales growth contribution, pricing increased approximately 8% and volume grew approximately 5%. Turning to Slide 12, let's walk through our profitability in the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA totaled $702 million, representing 9% comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth versus the first quarter of 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 21.8% and on an inflation adjusted basis, would have been approximately 175 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%. Margin did come in better than we expected in the first quarter through the stronger than anticipated volume growth, better cost management as well as the fact that a significant amount of our higher inflationary cost remains in inventories and did not impact the P&L to the degree originally anticipated. However, this is largely timing-related and will change as we progress throughout the year. Including our results is a charge of approximately $20 million related to expected credit loss on receivables from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. While the macroeconomic environment remains incredibly dynamic with continuing inflationary pressures at the moment, we are pleased with the actions taken by our teams to manage through these challenges. We took a very proactive approach and quickly instituted broad-based pricing actions across our portfolio in response to these pressures. Consequently, the actions we have taken have resulted in a full dollar cost recovery of total inflation costs in the first quarter. Unfortunately, since our February earnings call, we have seen additional increases in raw material, logistics and energy costs and are diligently working with our customers on incremental pricing actions. One important note to call out is that we are seeing the strong cost increases flowing to inventory, which due to our inventory days means that the higher cost will eventually impact the P&L as we progress through the balance of the year. Now on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the underlying dynamics and first quarter performance of each of our business segments. In the first quarter, Nourish's strong comparable currency neutral sales growth of 16% was led by double-digit growth in food designs and ingredients. The segment's comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth was also strong at 14%, primarily driven by the division's pricing actions, volume growth and productivity gains. In Health & Biosciences, double-digit growth in health, microbial control and grain processing and high single-digit growth in animal nutrition and cultures in food enzymes show comparable currency neutral sales growth of 10% for the first quarter. Similar to Nourish, the segment's comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% was led by pricing, volume growth and productivity that helped offset mixed challenges. In Scent, fine fragrance continued the strong rebound with double-digit growth and cosmetic active and fragrance ingredients continue to perform above expectations. As for consumer fragrance, the business experienced modest growth in the first quarter. Overall percent on 6% comparable currency neutral sales growth, comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 2% as inflationary pressures outpaced pricing for the quarter. As a reminder, in Scent, there is a delay in pricing recovery about 18 months before you fully recover inflation via price increases. Finally, in Pharma Solutions, we saw double-digit growth in both pharma and industrial to deliver 10% comparable currency neutral sales growth for the quarter. Volume growth and productivity gains help drive 10% comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Now on Slide 14, I would like to address our cash flow and leverage positions. In the first quarter, increased working capital requirements in part due to seasonality and in part due to increased values of inventory and accounts receivable driven by inflation as well as higher capital expenditures negatively impacted our cash flow results for the quarter. In the first quarter, CapEx totaled $132 million, representing approximately 4.1% sales. As a reminder, we anticipate our 2022 CapEx to be approximately 5% of sales due to 2021 CapEx carryover and increased investments in capacity expansion and key technologies, which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs. From a leverage perspective, we are on plan and are continuing to make progress toward achieving our deleveraging target. Q1 ended net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. Gross debt for the quarter totaled $11.7 billion and we finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalence of $662 million. Despite the global financial pressures, we remain on track to keep our deleveraging target of 3x or lower by year three post-close, which will be supported by our food preparation divesture, sale of our microbial control business and other non-core business divestitures. Slide 15 provides our revised business outlook for 2022. We are adjusting our expected full-year 2022 revenue up to $12.6 billion to $13 billion from $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion. This reflects the effects of additional anticipated pricing actions not incorporated in our original guidance, primarily due to the additional inflationary pressures. This revision also reflects the expected completion of our microbial controls divestiture on July 1, one month later than originally planned, and the acquisition of Health Wright Products completed in April. In addition, our outlook takes into account a weaker euro to dollar currency outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as we continue to target full cost recovery of additional inflationary pressures via price increases. On a comparable currency neutral basis, this translates into sales growth of approximately 9% to 12% versus 6% to 9% previously for the full-year and comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of approximately 4% to 8%, which is unchanged. It should be noted that while we have increased our sales expectations for the full-year due to incremental pricing, we have reduced our volume expectations given a more challenging environment, including loss revenues as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, continued global supply chain issues and anticipated softer consumer demand as a result of higher energy prices and general inflation negatively impacting consumer spending. One data point is that in early Q2, we have already seen volume soften and for the full-year, we are now targeting low single-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing contributions. Also, based on current market foreign exchange rates, we expect that foreign exchange will negatively impact sales in 2022 by approximately 4 percentage points versus 2 percentage points previously and adjusted operating EBITDA grew by approximately 5 percentage points versus 4% previously. These changes now reflect current market exchange rates, particularly the euro, where we are assuming that it remains at 106 to the dollar for the balance of the year or a blended full-year rate of approximately 108 to the dollar. We are also confirming our 2022 CapEx spend will be approximately 5% of sales. In terms of the second quarter, we continue to believe that sales growth will be driven by price increases with volumes contributing much less they did in the first quarter. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we expect to be in the range of $640 million to $650 million pressured by unfavorable impacts of currency as well as higher inflationary costs flowing from inventories to the income statement. As I wrap up, I want to revisit the four key areas of focus we touched upon in February to update you on our progress. As a reminder, our four key priorities for 2022 are maintaining strong sales momentum, executing broad-based pricing actions, capturing synergy and productivity and accelerating our non-core business divestitures. Overall, we feel good about our progress across all four areas in Q1 and are confidence in our ability to deliver on these commitments this year. In terms of supporting strong sales momentum, we are increasing our capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio, enhancing our supply chain efficiencies most notably in our H&B, Pharma Solutions and Ingredients business, to ensure that we maintain our volume growth in line with or above the industry. Relative to executing broad-based pricing actions in an effort to react more quickly to today's evolving environment and better prepared for tomorrow's challenges, we have significantly enhanced our processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams to oversee each of our business units. Our focus has been centered around minimizing the amount of time lost between inflation signals and customer pricing actions to ensure that we quickly adjust  to protect profitability. With these changes, we successfully implemented our first round of pricing actions and recover the total cost of inflation in Q1 2022. Given additional known inflationary pressures and a lot of uncertainty regarding the future path of inflation, this remains our highest priority. Accelerating our productivity expense synergy efforts also remains a key priority and increasingly important in a more challenging macroeconomic environment. To this end, we are able to deliver over $30 million of operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies in the first quarter above our expectations. As a result, we expect to exceed our original $100 million full-year cost reduction target, which is net of reinvestments. This higher level of productivity is helping offset lower full-year volume expectations. As we look to accelerate our long-term productivity opportunities, we have sharpened our focus on three large areas of productivity, procurement efficiencies, notably in indirect spend; end-to-end operations efficiencies, inclusive of digital enablement, yield and mix enhancements and logistics efficiencies and expanding the scale and efficiency of IFF\u2019s global shared service platform. Importantly, we will remain prudent in protecting key topline investments, including R&D, customer sales and service and technology. We plan on providing more details of these initiatives at our Q2 earnings call. Finally, we made further headway in accelerating our non-core divestitures. We are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business by July 1. We are also targeting additional portfolio optimization in non-core business divestiture opportunities to delever our balance sheet and invest greater resources toward our higher return businesses. We are making very good progress in early non-core business marketing efforts and have already received strong interest from prospective buyers. Should these transactions go through? We anticipate that they will in aggregate be accretive to our go forward growth rate and margin profile. With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thanks, Glenn. Turning now to Slide 16. As I look back on the last three months, I am proud of the work underway to ensure that IFF\u2019s next chapter is as brightest yet. Our solid results, including consistent volume growth across our portfolio reflects IFF\u2019s critical role in the consumer goods value chain, particularly amid such a challenging operating environment. While market volatility will inevitably continue to impact our industry, we will closely monitor developments, strengthen our financial discipline and fortify our portfolio to address ongoing pressures. With the strong foundation we established in the first quarter, I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2022 financial targets, improve value creation and further cement our key operating priorities. Having begun the process of our strategic refresh, I look forward to sharing additional updates on IFF\u2019s long-term strategic vision at an Investor Day in the second half of 2022. I know many of you have questions as it relates to my perspective on IFF\u2019s long-term financial targets. Given we are going through a robust review of our value creation opportunity via our strategy refresh, I ask that you give us time to appropriately assess our long-term financial objectives. I want to thank you very much for all of your support, and I know that the best is yet to come for IFF. With that, I would like to now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gunther Zechmann : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gunther Zechmann from Bernstein. The 3 percentage point increase in organic sales growth, Frank, to 9% to 12%, that's almost unprecedented, pretty brave move. Given your tenure as a company, in what businesses do you expect to see the biggest price increases? And in what businesses do you include demand reduction as part of your guidance? And then I've got a question 1b as well, but I'll pause there. Frank Clyburn : Sure. Gunther, I\u2019ll let Glenn maybe to give some specific color on the different business segments. Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey, Gunther. Let me first sort of \u2013 by the way, good afternoon to you. I want to unpack the $300 million. So you know sort of the nature of that, and then we\u2019ll talk about sort of where it sits. So the $300 million change is a function of several items. First of all, we have some portfolio adjustments, so the acquisition of Health Wright and then one additional month of Microbial Controls, the value that's about $130 million of incremental revenue. That's completely offset with our foreign exchange update, i.e., the stronger euro or the stronger dollar relative to euro rather, basically offsets that completely from a revenue standpoint. The residual is we have incremental pricing of around $370 million, and that's all related to raw material increases, which I'll come back to. And as we mentioned on the call, we're actually bringing down volume balance of the year. For a full-year, down about a $100 million from our original plan, so a little over a half a point full-year. We actually were better in the first quarter by a point. So we're taking down the balance of the year down by a $100 million. Where we're seeing basically the impact of the price/volume, it pretty much mirrors where the cost increases are occurring. So we've had more material cost inflation in our Nourish business and other businesses. So that's why you see the higher growth rates in that business. But we are continuing to see the impact on all the businesses. So nobody sort of is exempt from the second round of this $300 million in terms of kind of overall pressure, but a bit more in Nourish than the other business because of the raw material impact. Gunther Zechmann : Great. And thanks, Glenn. And then 1b) can you provide an update where you see cost inflation for IFF this year? And as far as you can for next year, I know you don't guide for 2023 yet, but if you can share how much earnings you expect to recover next year from costs that you incurred last or this year, please? Glenn Richter : Yes. It is a great question Gunther, and also something that we're working on now where we don't really have a stats in part because there's two tough parts of the equation. One is to understand the overlap of the latest round of raw materials into next year. So there's a carry forward, but then equally are basically the pricing dynamics. So as mentioned, we're having to go back in the market because incremental pricing. So there'll be a full-year effect of that as well. I would also remind the group that last year we were still in the whole i.e. the inflation exceeded pricing in 2021 by $200 million. So we're still planned to basically go after a full capture, unfortunately, with the latest addition of inflation, it's just going to take a little bit longer into 2023 to sort of get us back to whole. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. And Frank, welcome to the industry. Congrats on your new role. I guess, my question was more so on Slide 6, where you have the opportunity section, and the third one in terms of reinvesting in capacity and R&D and so on. Can you just expand on that? And if you could just sort of assess the technological capabilities within the company? The way you see it at this point, I know it's very early in your tenure at IFF. Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Ghansham, hi. It's Frank, and thanks for the welcome, and also for the question. A couple things I want to highlight is \u2013 and you look at that slide, I do want to start with the fact that, I am very still encouraged by the opportunity that we have in IFF. The industry trends look very strong overall in the long-term around sustainability, health and wellness and naturals. Also, IFF with this highly diversified business mix across categories, regions, and customers, I think positions us very well. When you look at that slide and we talk about the opportunities, I think a couple of things I would highlight there is one is we are focused on really doing everything around our culture of executional excellence, that's going to be really important for us through our talent, instilling accountability and also our strong link to incentives for our teams. As far as reinvesting, clearly, we are going to look at that. That's going to be a part of our strategy refresh process, and we'll be spending a lot of time on that in the second half of the year when we share our overall plans. But early view would be clearly, we need to continue to build our capabilities around digital, data analytics are going to be really important. And then also we'll invest in our commercial efforts as we see opportunities for continued profitable growth. And then we're also doing a deep dive in R&D portfolio, and we'll look at the best innovation in R&D opportunities to invest behind as well. But much more to come as we head to the second half of the year. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Look forward to the Investor Day. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning, Frank. Thanks. Let me add my congratulations. You've been very vocal about taking pricing across a broad range of customers, and these are \u2013 it's not quite like gas prices, right? These are very sensitive industrial relationships where companies are intertwined. And you mentioned that in the script, how it takes time, but I wanted to ask specifically, when your customers do push back on pricing? What do they say? What are the common push backs you get? Or if somebody says no to pricing, what's the reason when that happens? And is that happening? Or are those kinds of things getting said now more often than January, as you know, some companies, maybe some of your customers are under a little bit more stress now than they were in January? Thanks. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let Glenn to add on as well. One, I think the teams have done a really good job starting off this year and working with customers to try to recoup the significant inflationary pressures we're seeing in the business. So we have, I think a strong value proposition. We have strong commercial teams that are working very closely with their customers to really understand the importance of us recouping our inflation, what we're seeing from an inflationary perspective. So I do feel we're off to a very good start. There are push backs. I think some of the push backs are in some of the smaller customers, some of our emerging market customers where price is much more sensitive. We are seeing pushback there. But all in all we feel as though, we are in a good place and will continue to work closely with our customers to navigate, which is, as we all know, unprecedented times. Glenn, anything you'd add? Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey. Thanks Jonathan for the question. I'd say, first of all, obviously we're not unique is every industry is experiencing substantial increases in inflation, and all of our competitors are out there basically taking prices up as well. And as you're well aware, as it relates to our value add from our customers supply chain, we tend to be a relatively sort of low cost high value add relative to their overall value change. And I would say, simply put, with 60% of our cost structure related to raw materials, energy and logistics, it's sort of impossible for us to absorb. Those level increases. And rather as our customers well appreciate, we are in business who really provide them superior solutions, which requires significant investment in innovation, customer service capabilities, building and maintaining a very robust global supply chain. I would remind everybody, we're adding $200 million at CapEx this year alone to build out. So that's the value we add to our customer. And as a result of that, we can't sort of, if you will speculate on material costs and our customers appreciate that. Frankly, where we sit relative to our value add, they completely appreciate what we're doing for them. And that's been reflected in the success of pricing. I will note though, there are some sectors, as we mentioned, Scent as an example, that there's a lag. So it's not every single customer is out front here in terms of the pricing, but in general, the level of productive dialogue has been very, very good with our customers. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I guess, maybe to start, Glenn, what are you assuming for volumes throughout the rest of the year? Guidance would suggest flattish, I guess, 2Q through 4Q, you alluded to April trend softening, were they positive? Curious too if you've seen competitors pricing and  is just a more IFF impact. And then Frank, I appreciate the commentary, I'm still evaluating the business. I guess the question that we get most often is the 26% EBITDA margin target most seem to think that that's just unrealistic at this point. Maybe if you could talk a bit about that, that would be helpful for folks. Thank you. Glenn Richter : Thanks, Mark. So I'll start off with our volume outlook. 5%  for the first quarter, we're actually projecting 1% for the balance of the year. So relatively flattish. I would remind everybody, we have a very strong overlap in the last three quarters. The three quarters of last year were on average around 10% in terms of currency neutral sales of which that was around 8% volume each of the quarters is a very strong one. That's why we actually planned the second half of the year more flattish versus the first half of the year. Why we've taken it down is basically taken the balance of the year down about a $100 million in revenue, that is basically split into two components. One is the direct impact on Russia and Ukraine volumes. And the second half is really a combination of supply chain and demand issues. So supply chain would include a combination of all material access as well as China, and then generally we just feel that we're seeing early signs relative to the consumer pulling back. We really don't view this as a \u2013 not being competitive on a pricing standpoint, but frankly, just what we're seeing in the consumer and it's manifested itself literally in the last couple weeks a little bit more in the home and personal care side of the business versus sort of the food and beverage or pharma side. So we're not sure, honestly, whether that's sort of an end consumer sort of permanent pullback or adjustment in inventories, but we're just, frankly, just being cautious relative to sort of what's going on in the global economy. Frank Clyburn : And hey, Mark. It\u2019s Frank. Thanks for the question. And as I mentioned in some of the early remarks, we are working through our strategy refresh process and that does include our long-term plan in detail and we're looking at our current inputs into our plan. We will need some additional time to appropriately assess our long-term financial targets. And my immediate focus, our management team's focus is delivering our 2022 objectives and the financial goals that we're outlining here this morning, as which of course, there's a lot of focus on pricing as you continue to hear productivity an important levers in working with our customers to grow our absolute sales and dollar profit as we manage through the significant inflationary period. Longer term, Mark, there's no doubt in my mind, we have a lot of value creation ahead of us in the company, and I believe our business will generate sustainable profitable growth and it will yield margin expansion over time. As far as your specific question on the 26% adjusted EBITDA target, I think it's really safe to say as we look at where we are today, and you look at how the world has changed, we're not going to be able to achieve that 26% adjusted EBITDA target in 2023. With that said, as I mentioned, I do want the time to come back and share with you in the back half of the year, our plans, and also our focus on driving really strong profitable growth for the future. Operator : We will take our next question from Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Heidi Vesterinen : Good morning. Just to clarify on pricing again. So you're looking to fully offset the dollar headwind from inflation for the full-year, I think you said. Can you, once again, explain how you hope to achieve this because it's normal industry practice for certain parts of your portfolio, like Scent to have a lag. So is there another segment of setting that lag for this full-year? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Well, we actually are lagging, Heidi. As a reminder, we're $200 million behind from last year. So we're sort of catching up from last year and capturing a large \u2013 the largest percentage this year, but there's still a lag that will be going into 2023 as well. Heidi Vesterinen : Okay. But on a full-year 2022 basis, I think you had said you're looking to fully offset, right? So you won't have a squeeze from raw materials? Frank Clyburn : Yes. Now let me be clear. We have $200 million from last year from 2021 that we didn't capture, we began to implement. So if you look at the cumulative 2021, which is really the second half of 2021 in all this year, we're still $200 million behind. Heidi Vesterinen : Okay. And then the idea is to pass that on as we go into next year. Okay. Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Heidi. Operator : We will go next to John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Roberts : Thanks. Welcome, Frank. Just one question. You've got one of the largest R&D budgets in the industry and the major drug hands are known for best in class R&D management here. But we don't get an innovation or vitality index. We don't get any stage-gate processing reported hard to know how productive R&D is or what the right level of spend is here. If you had a chance to kind of go through the processes within R&D and the Center of Excellence \u2013 and so forth, do you think there are changes that need to be made there? Frank Clyburn : Yes. Thanks John, for the question. I'll just sum it up in a couple of quick points and based on my experience, one, I have been very encouraged by some of the recent visits I've taken to our R&D centers. I just got back from Palo Alto, California, and really good innovation taking place. Some of the work we're doing in with regards to our enzymes, with regards to some of our Scent and sustainable delivery systems, flavor technology. So I'm encouraged early on of what I'm seeing. I think what I would highlight is from an R&D perspective, there's three things that come to mind. One is making sure you have the best talent, and that's a major focus for us in allowing our scientists to innovate. Number two is we have a process and model where you have very close connection with your commercial teams. So your arm in arm, your scientists and your commercial teams are really working on innovations that are going to be meaningful from a customer and consumer perspective. And that's a major focus that we're putting in place. And then number three is doing it in an efficient way and putting our capital against the biggest R&D opportunities. So early on, encouraging, this is going to be a focus for us, and this also will be a part of our second half Investor Day where we'll come back and share more about some of the exciting projects we're working on in our pipeline. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew DeYoe : Good morning, everyone. Frank, one of the criticisms we often here about IFF is the senior management churn has been pretty elevated following the N&B acquisition and that perhaps the broader leadership team is relatively inexperienced. How do you plan to address this as the new CEO when you think about the team that's around you? Frank Clyburn : So Matt, that's an important question. And what I would say is that we have to do everything that we can as a management team to really build, as I've been saying, the right culture, the right focus for the organization. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us with IFF, but we do need to deliver and we do need to focus on executional excellence. Yes, there has been some change in the management ranks. That is something that obviously we all take seriously, but our focus right now is with the team that we have in place is really to be laser focused on delivering and working on behalf of our customers to create value in the marketplace. So that's really the focus and I am excited about the passion and the energy I see from so many IFFer\u2019s around the world, I've had a chance to engage with a lot of them. And I think we're really in a good place as long as we can focus on the \u2013 through four priorities that Glenn mentioned earlier. I do feel good about our opportunity as we work through 2022 and then as we start to build the company for the future. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Sison : Hey, good morning. Welcome Frank. I guess, your background has a lot of integration. And so I'm kind of thinking when you think about the DuPont acquisition, N&B and putting the company together, it does seem like the initial outlook for 2023 or the sort of initial goals are going to \u2013 a little bit off. So when you think about how we should measure, if this will be inevitably a successful deal together, what do you think we need to look for? And I know a lot of this will probably come in your Analyst Day, second half. I'm certain, you're looking at Cleveland as a possible site, and I\u2019m joking. But what should we think about as the metric or couple of metrics that. And at the end of the day would suggest this has been a really good deal over time. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Mike, and I think you recognized as where we started, we also are in some unprecedented times from inflationary perspective. And also what's happening with regards to China and COVID lockdowns, and what's happening with the war and impossible recessionary pressure. So clearly, the world is changing significantly. Mike, the way I would say, is that we will spend time, like you said, in the second part of this year, but really look at our focus. And I keep using this phrase about driving sustainable, profitable growth. We want to have a company that's growing top-tier within our peer set. And from a topline perspective, good strong leverage throughout the company, a relentless focus on constant improving of productivity and making sure we're doing everything that we can to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. So I think that will be some of the metrics and we'll come back obviously, as we get to the second half and give you specific metrics, but that's how I would have you think about it. Glenn, I don't know if you want to add\u2026 Glenn Richter : Hey, Mike. I would just add. By the way, I lived in Cleveland, I'm not sure I'm allowed to come back though. But really at the end of the day, we are trying to deliver a superior outcome for our shareholders. And the way to do that as Frank had mentioned is to make sure we outpace the topline versus the industry. So having superior topline growth and secondarily superior return on invested capital, the way we view doing that is actually driving significant productivity, which we believe there is, and allowing that to basically reinvest back and help accelerate the topline and to continue to actually drive some of that to the bottom line while we're optimizing our portfolio. So to Frank's point, that will be sort of the major agenda when we get together later in the year, maybe in Cleveland. Frank Clyburn : Yes. And Mike, just one last one, and I did mention that ROIC is now a part of our metrics as a team. So that's something that we've incorporated. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Lisa De Neve : Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I have two. First one is, can you talk a little bit on how the growth has been evolving in the first quarter through the different regions and how you expect volume growth to develop over the coming quarters or through the year? So the plus and minuses would be very helpful. And secondly, can you share a little bit what you're seeing in your innovation pipeline, in what segments are you seeing stronger levels of innovation. And also, do you see sort of any levels of reformulation activity? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Good morning, Lisa. So relative to the first quarter and balance of the year relative to region, our strongest areas have been the developed markets. So combination of Europe and North America, laggards has really been actually Greater Asia has slower growth in the first quarter. We expect, as we look at the balance of the year, we need to have a little bit challenges in Greater Asia, particularly China, as we mentioned, likely also to see a slowdown \u2013 meaningful slowdown in Europe, given the \u2013 what's happening from the economy standpoint, but are still sort of fairly optimistic on combination of North America and LATAM as well. Frank Clyburn : Yes. And just real quickly, we're doing a lot of R&D work in Health and Biosciences area with regards to our enzymes and focusing on probiotics and also, laundry dish programs with global key accounts. We have work in some of our plant-based protein and dairy alternatives, couple of other quick ones to highlight in the scent area, some of the renewable and biodegradable fragrance ingredients were also really focusing, in nourish around a lot of our flavor technologies. And I highlighted one of the big wins that we had with vanilla recently with one of our customers. So we'll spend a lot more time here on the pipeline and portfolio, as I mentioned, coming up in the second half of the year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning, and Frank, congratulations as well on the new role. Frank, building off your early view of the company, do you think IFF does a good job capturing the full value of this products with the customers? And secondarily, what do you think the IFF does better than competitors and where do you think it is lacking versus competitors? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Very good questions. I think when you say, what do we do better, then I'll start there. I do think our global scale, the diversity of our and breadth of our portfolio and how we engage with our customers. I think we are leading in many categories and in many areas, and that's something that we will continue to leverage. And it also allows for us to work quickly with customers to co-create solutions with them. So that to me is a big strength of ours. What does some of the competitors do? There are competitors that are focused in certain areas that I do think have done a nice job from a pricing perspective or have in certain categories a little bit better margin construct than we do. And that's really why we're staring into our portfolio to make sure that we put our resources against the best opportunities and where we see those opportunities we're going to invest and then where we see opportunities to improve, we'll focus there. And then in some areas we will pull back investment or possibly even divest if we need to. So those are going to be some things that we're going to be looking at to make sure that we continue to build the strength around our portfolio, but those were some initial thoughts on how I think we are lining up with our customers and then how we compare to some of our competitors. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was curious that you touched earlier on pricing and how quickly you move during the first quarter? And Glenn, in your comments, you more or less referred to the press release that IFF put out discussing its kind of new approach to pricing. I mean, from where I said it feels like that's the first moment of the company now with this much greater scale, really taking on the role of industry leader. And I was curious what, if anything, you've seen in the competitive landscape, how others are now approaching pricing, if the industry as a whole is moving faster. I know it's been a short period of time, but it's an interesting question in the sense of IFF role again as industry leader? Thanks to this newfound scale. Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. Thanks for the question. We actually, as you recall, in the fourth quarter, signaled pretty quickly given we saw this large tsunami of inflation and went out very quickly, in the fourth quarter of the first round that press release was really in advance of the second round. And all our competitors are seeing exactly the same, inflationary pressures as well. So I think, that was intended really to help our teams relative to the customer dialogue, sort of understand the dynamics and the impact on the business. Hence the purpose of the press releases, I did mention all our competitors as you're well aware are basically in the market doing the same thing and are passing along prices and time as well. We just moved fast even we saw in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned on the call, we really also invested in, I'll say in infrastructure around the organization to make sure we're more closely monitoring what's happening in the market and just moving much, much, much quicker because I think we are concerned that this \u2013 even the second round may be the second of others. So we just want to be prepared to do that. And that answer was the purpose of that, that press release. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Originally, when you bought the DuPont business, the idea was to take out $300 million in costs and to spend about $335 million to do it. And to date, I think IFF has spent $32 million, so it seems that the original cost reduction program is moving more slowly. Is that fair? That is why aren't the charge is larger? And secondly, on Slide 8, where you lay out your return on invested capital distribution. It looks like about a third of the company has unsatisfactory returns. What conclusion do you draw from that? Does that mean that you really need to overhaul the structure of the company dramatically or do you draw a different conclusion from that? Glenn Richter : Yes. Let me \u2013 maybe I'll take the second one and come back to the first one. Your conclusion is correct in terms of the third \u2013 hardly one third of our business from a capital utilization standpoint needs to improve. And there are two major levers. So not surprisingly as it relates to some of our non-core divestiture work by the fall within that basket, if you will. So continue to optimize the portfolio as one lever. The second is really thinking about ultimately a combination of capital investment in those businesses and in addition, how we think about optimizing the profitability. So as part of the Frank's comments about the refresh strategy, we are thinking about the portfolio in that way. And by the way, that's also in the spirit of taking some of those dollars and moving them up to the far left of that chart and accelerating the growth dynamics of the higher return segments as well. Relative to our cost savings, as a reminder, we get roughly $300 million targeted for synergies, about half of those were procurement. So it's not surprising that you would have little to no integration-related expenses for those. Those pieces honestly are, as we've mentioned in the past, we are the farthest behind simply because of this environment. It's harder to materialize. The other half of the 150, we're sort of midway through in terms of capture. To your broader point about how we think about restructuring opportunities, we've moved beyond a discussion of just synergies, deal-related synergies was too narrow and we really are focusing more broadly on productivity. As I mentioned, there are three large buckets operations, procurement and then shared services. The first two of those are likely to have relatively low one-time costs because they're really optimizing operations, digital throughput, some fixed cost reduction, indirect material purchases. The latter being shared service probably will have some one-time restructuring charges as we build out our current infrastructure and continue to add capabilities into that network. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead. Joshua Spector : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a couple follow-ups on the price rise dynamics. So just curious now what's your length of visibility on the raw material front? So how far ahead are you seeing today? And as you look at your pricing guide for the year, I guess, are you pricing your second round increase is that to capture the visibility that you see now? Or are you pricing ahead of that and does your guide imply a low double-digit price exit rate for the year at this point? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. Generally, we're looking out to the third or fourth quarter for the raw materials. Energy is more problematic as well as logistics that tends to sort of \u2013 it's really kind of here and now if you will, in terms of kind of what's happening in the marketplace, we've done best estimates based on sort of where the markets are trading relative to energy as well as logistics costs. But generally the raw materials are sort of about six months out. But some of them have been \u2013 a lot of them have been locked in, some of them not. So we are continuing \u2013 by the way, we're continuing to monitor every single week. We sort of have an update on how we're feeling about the market in general over the last sort of month, six weeks, there's been some ebbing and flowing so slightly higher in energy, some relief in raw materials, but it hasn't materially been different than that 350-ish number that I provided you to earlier. So relative to sort of the carryover for next year, we still have to sort of work that through. As I mentioned, it's a combination of, what the tail of this year's annualized raw materials and then very importantly, we got to figure out as well as the tail of the pricing actions in the next year as well? Operator : And we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you. Frank, now that you've had just a couple weeks to evaluate the portfolio, you just name kind of the two to three sub businesses that you're the most excited about. I mean, in your remarks, you've mentioned, probiotics and proteins, just coming from your background, what's getting you the most excited on a go-forward basis? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Sure. I'll be quick because I know, we've got a couple more that we\u2019re waiting on as well, but just to give you an example, enzymes, I think are areas that I'm excited about. And we're going to deploy resources to drive growth and really mix improvement there over time. There's also, I think some really solid areas such as fabric care, we think there's opportunities to improve our cash flow there. And then, we will continue to look at some of the underperforming areas as well. And I think this is something and Glenn highlighted on our four priorities, which is why we have made the decision to exit for instance, our Microbial Control business and we've announced that divestitures. So those are some examples and like I said, we'll spend much more time opening up and sharing a lot more as we get to the back half of the year. Operator : And we will go next to Andrew Keches with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Keches : Yes. Hi, good morning. Glenn, perhaps a question for you. If you take a step back and look at the balance sheet where a little more than a year into the N&B transaction and leverages essentially where it was at closing. And I think I heard you said you're dropping the balance sheet metric from executive compensation. So I guess I just want to understand your confidence and the ability to hit that 3.0x mark by the beginning of 2024, how critical are these divestitures that you're talking about? And is it right to think that maybe the scope for divestitures can expand particularly as we lap that two year IRS anniversary for N&B? Glenn Richter : Yes. So just a clarification, the reason we dropped the balance sheet metric is because we launched the new three-year plan. So to some extent, this is the window beyond sort of our deleverage. So I am very, very confident that we will hit three less. We will be closing on the Microbial Controls business at the end of this quarter, that's going to be net proceeds of $1.1 billion. As I mentioned in the past, we have three to four additional deals that will cumulatively add $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of gross. They're proceeding nicely, by the way, despite the sort of volatility in the market, they are attractive property strategically. That alone will basically get us to the goal independent of cash flow. To the last point of your question, we're going to continue obviously to take a look at the portfolio, that's part of the strategy refresh, which will probably afford additional opportunities to continue to approving the portfolio, but nothing to announce at this point and nor do we need that to accomplish that goal. So thanks for the question. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn for any closing remarks. Frank Clyburn : So thank you to all for joining our call. I really appreciate your interests and the time we spent this morning discussing our first quarter results. And hopefully you could hear from myself, Glenn and on behalf of all of IFF, we're really encouraged and excited about the future. And we look forward to sharing more about our plans as we head to the second half of this year and also want to reiterate just how focused we are on a company, making sure we're executing and working with our customers to deliver important solutions for consumers around the world. So thank you and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call.  Yesterday afternoon, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live, and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we're making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the second half and full year 2022. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release, both of which can be found on our website.  Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.  With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Franklin Clyburn : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our first half results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous progress we have made over the last 3 months. Under a challenging operating environment, our global teams continued to display their steadfast commitment to our customers and passion for innovative discoveries as IFF delivered profitable growth. Since joining IFF, I have consistently been impressed by the caliber of the work, innovation and expertise our people deliver as well as the creative culture that underpins our success.  I once again thank our teams around the world for their hard work. I will begin today's call with an update on our strategy refresh process and value creation opportunities we are focusing on for the near and long term, as well as IFF's recent accomplishments as we execute on our operational priorities. This includes delivering $70 million of cost savings in the first half of the year, taking swift and aggressive pricing action to cover inflation, exiting our Microbial Control business and ensuring that we have the right talent in the right roles. I will then turn the call over to Glenn to provide a detailed look at our second quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2022. We will then open the call up for questions.  Beginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our efforts to refresh our long-term strategic plan. While we are pleased that IFF holds strong positions across many of our business segments today, we are committed to evaluating and fine-tuning both our strategy and execution to best position the business for long-term profitable growth. I am pleased to share that we are making meaningful progress in moving quickly to map out an exciting and ambitious path forward.  In Q2, we continued to advance our enterprise-wide review of our business and portfolio to ensure we are well equipped to successfully navigate current and future market conditions while capturing long-term value. Our goal for this comprehensive evaluation is to further develop the refined operating plan to generate sustainable sales growth by ensuring lasting competitive differentiation through innovation, product superiority and provide a clear road map where we can execute our priorities to create significant value to all of our stakeholders.  Already, we have successfully completed the foundational phases of the plan. We have identified meaningful opportunities to capture additional profitable growth in attractive end markets, geographies and cross-platform synergies, while also identifying internal opportunities in near-term external pressures that must be navigated to achieve this. Now, we are working to finalize refreshed operating plans that we will align our operating model, talent and incentives as well as finalize our long-term financial targets and capital allocation strategy that prioritizes sustainable long-term growth. In addition, we are strengthening our culture, one that embodies collaboration and accountability to ensure strong execution of our commitments.  We will continue to move rapidly and with urgency over the coming months to finalize our refreshed strategy, and look forward to sharing more on this with you at our Capital Markets Day to be held Wednesday, December 7 in New York City.  Moving to Slide 7, I'd like to give a brief snapshot on where we are focusing as we advance our strategic refresh. There are 5 core areas of focus. First, we are prioritizing a more thoughtful and data-driven approach to our resource allocation strategy. Investment is essential to our future growth, but it is critical that our spending decisions optimize returns and reflect the unique roles that each of our businesses serve in our broader portfolio. I will explain this in more details in a moment. Similarly, we are also making strategic decisions to support our research and development efforts. By focusing on the highest return projects and identifying ways we can leverage our cross-platform offerings we will be even better positioned to accelerate top line growth and extend our industry leadership in key categories. Shortly, we will introduce an enhanced productivity program designed to help us improve profitability and unlock additional opportunities to finance our growth initiatives.  At the same time, we continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure that our offerings closely align to the markets in which we operate, the evolving expectations of our customers and with our long-term objectives. We successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business, and we will continue to assess the portfolio as we explore additional non-core divestitures to reduce debt and improve our capital structure.  Lastly, we are reviewing our operating model to ensure that our structure, talent and incentives to maximize our unmatched portfolio and go-to-market strategy with our customers. Attracting and supporting the industry's best talent and aligning incentives is critical to drive continued collaboration and accountability across the organization. I am focused on making sure we have the right talent to execute our strategic plan, and I'm pleased that we recently announced Deb Borg, who will join us as our Chief Human Resource and Diversity and Inclusion Officer on August 29, 2022. With her deep experience connecting HR, culture, employee engagement and business as well as our change management expertise, she has the right skill set for IFF and our people as we strengthen our execution-driven culture. She brings an extensive track record of building world-class talent and helping the business execute and drive value for all stakeholders. Our success with these initiatives will be supported by our ongoing work to modernize our foundation on data and technology capabilities as we strengthen our internal operations to help ensure best-in-class execution.  On Slide 8, I would like to share a bit more about the deliberate choices we are making, specifically how a more strategic and disciplined approach to resource allocation will create exciting opportunities for profitable growth. Across the board, we are focused on driving margin improvements, but to do so effectively, we're pursuing differential management strategy across key areas.  Last quarter, I shared an ROIC chart, which was a first glimpse into the lens that we are viewing the company through. To move forward with this plan, we have developed a comprehensive playbook that segments our business into 3 distinct archetypes with unique strategic imperatives. When we look at our portfolio, we would consider whether to invest to grow, maximize to drive efficiencies or optimize to rapidly improve performance. Using this model, we remain intensely focused on achieving above-market growth, strengthening our competitive global position, increasing our return on invested capital and analyzing the most valuable use of our existing assets. For example, in a category like Flavors, we see meaningful opportunities to drive above-market revenue growth, primarily through reinvesting in innovation and commercial initiatives. We are prioritizing above-market revenue expansion in this category as opposed to margin improvement alone as we're focusing on large, profitable and faster-growing subcategories like Beverages or Dairy to drive strong value creation. Here, it is more about reinvesting margin upside to ensure we are bringing the best innovation to our customers to drive dollar profit growth.  On the other hand, in a market like Animal Nutrition, we are focused on maintaining the consistent growth we've delivered, with an emphasis on driving further productivity. By identifying certain segments in which to reinvest while strategically reducing R&D expenses in others, we will focus on margin improvement and create opportunities to invest in the highest value offerings. We are taking a stronger approach within our optimized businesses, for example, our pectin business, a popular clean-label natural stabilizer, to quickly drive near-term earnings through pricing and cost initiatives while maintaining our market competitiveness and reallocating upside to invest to growth categories like Flavors. I will also say, for those optimized businesses where we do not have a strong improvement plan, we will accelerate divestitures and exit the category, with work already well underway.  I am excited about this initiative and the progress we are seeing already. Make no mistake, we are running IFF quite differently in bringing enhanced rigor to our operations across every business and function. Earlier this year, we spent time reviewing our key priorities, including pricing and portfolio optimization. Moving to Slide 9. I would now like to focus on the multi-year productivity and reinvestment program I mentioned earlier, which I believe is key to achieving our long-term growth expectations and our profitability goals. Since joining IFF, I have spent time analyzing our cost profile and believe, as an organization, we have a significant opportunity to optimize our cost structure. I am fully committed to unlocking this value and have asked the team to accelerate our efforts to ensure we are well positioned to execute as we move into the second half of the year.  For more details, I would like to ask Glenn to comment. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Frank, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Accelerating our productivity and expense synergy efforts represents one of our top priorities, and is increasingly important in a more challenging economic environment in order to maximize financial performance. To this end, we want to provide additional transparency to our multi-year productivity program and the expected results.  First of all, let me describe the scope of our efforts. Overall, we have established 4 productivity efforts that cover approximately 85% of IFF's total cost structure, focused primarily on operations and overhead expenses. The 4 teams include supply chain, which includes our procurement and global logistics operations. Opportunities include driving additional efficiencies in direct and indirect material spending through enhanced procurement strategies and demand management, particularly for indirect spend and reduced logistics costs driven by improved global S&OP processes.  The second team is focused on end-to-end manufacturing operations and includes a broad-based set of initiatives, including accelerating our digital manufacturing efforts, driving yield improvements, system-wide best practices and energy savings programs.  The third initiative is our economic profit team that is focused on leveraging improved technology and disciplined processes to optimize product mix, rationalize SKUs and enhance make versus buy decisions.  And our fourth team is focused on building out our global shared service platform in with technology, to drive increased centralization and process standardization to drive efficiencies across our administrative and business support functions. In total, the combined programs are targeting a preliminary net annualized P&L impact of $250 million to $300 million that we expect to be achieved between 2023 and 2025.  Two important notes. First, this $250 million to $300 million annual impact is net of reinvestments that are targeted to strengthen our innovation pipeline, expand our commercial efforts across key products, customers and regions, deepen our technology and digital capabilities and strengthen our talent. Secondly, the net savings will be slightly more skewed to 2024 and 2025. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in December. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank. Franklin Clyburn : Thank you, Glenn. As I said, we will provide more specifics on this program at our Investor Day in December, but wanted to share an early indication with you as we committed to provide more details on this topic during our Q1 earnings call. More importantly, at our Investor Day, we will also provide you with a clear and more detailed road map for growth, including our incremental revenue opportunities from our combination with N&B. We remain confident that we have significant opportunities ahead, confirmed by our initial commercial wins and positive customer feedback as well as our competitors following our lead. I know that realization of these benefits have been slower than expected due to external factors, including COVID, supply chain disruption, customer bandwidth, pricing initiatives and constrained capacity. However, since joining, I have launched a focused initiative to reinforce our emphasis and address existing gaps.  Specifically, we are developing a set of prioritized opportunities, each with clear financial impact, owner and time line to provide confidence in our ability to deliver. This will be a significant focus for me going forward as I'm committed to delivering the value proposition of our combined portfolio and will be personally involved, dedicating significant time and engagement with the business to drive performance.  I am pleased to say that we continue to see steady wins across our portfolio. Recently, we co-collaborated with a leading alternative protein producer to improve commercial and technical collaboration, essentially upstreaming the incorporation of Heritage IFF flavors into Heritage N&B Protein-Based, exceeding our customers' expectation for plant-based burgers. This resulted in IFF being awarded as a core supplier, one of three, increasing our market share and enjoying a long-term relationship. In addition, we are seeing the value of integrated solutions between our Nourish and H&B divisions.  The Dairy category is showing very good collaboration opportunities, thanks in large part to early technical support and a better, together approach with customers. In this win, we were a step ahead of the competition due to early engagement with a dairy customer during culture development phase and showing the best flavor collaboration. These are just 2 examples, but strong proof points that we are moving in the right direction and delivering a better value proposition to our customers.  Now turning to Slide 10, I'd like to provide an overview of our performance for the first half of the year. Our strong first half results are once again a testament to the strength of our portfolio and the dedication of our talented global teams who have continued to go above and beyond in a complex market. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of the last 6 months, sales grew by a strong 18% or 12% on a currency-neutral basis to $6.5 billion. Comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 8% to $1.4 billion. I am proud to report that we increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 3%, the 13th consecutive year of increased payouts to our shareholders, which underscores our belief in our business and IFF's strong future cash flow generation. We also continue to work on deleveraging objectives, where we remain committed to our deleverage target of reducing net debt to EBITDA to less than 3x 36 months post the transaction, which is February 1, 2024. At the same time, we prudently and proactively amended the covenants on our existing credit agreements given the market volatility and uncertainty. Glenn will discuss in more detail.  As I mentioned a bit earlier, we also completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and continuing to evaluate additional divestiture opportunities for our non-core assets as we move ahead based on our category management approach I described earlier. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our second quarter financials. Glenn Richter : Thanks again, Frank. Turning first to our consolidated second quarter results. IFF generated more than $3 billion in sales, representing 11% year-over-year increase on comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Nourish and Pharma solutions. In terms of our growth contribution, pricing represented the majority, with volumes up modestly. Our focus coming into 2022 was to fully recover inflation through pricing actions, and for the full year, we are on track to recover approximately $1 billion in cost inflation. We are doing so in a very thoughtful and strategic manner, over on lower margin and capacity-constrained businesses.  While foreign exchange rates have had an adverse impact on our sales and EBITDA in the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis or 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis driven by productivity gains and pricing actions we implemented in the quarter. We also achieved solid year-over-year earnings per share growth of 3%, excluding amortization.  Before moving on, I wanted to share that during the second quarter of '22, we took an impairment charge of $120 million within certain entities in Russia due to a number of factors, including reduced business focus as we have restricted our operations to essential consumer products that include food, hygiene and medicine, supply chain issues, reduced product demand and exchange rate volatility, all as the result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It was determined that such declines in operating performance were not expected to reverse in the near future, and future expected growth is expected to be limited given the operating conditions in Russia. This non-cash impairment charge was allocated pro rata to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment within the asset group in the amount of approximately $92 million and $28 million, respectively.  Moving now to Slide 12, I'll provide a brief overview of the underlying performance across our business segments. As I mentioned, sales growth across each of our business segments, including Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scents and Pharma Solutions contribute to IFF's year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 11%.  Nourish was once again our largest growth driver, with a significant broad-based growth across our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Scent had another strong quarter, with currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits led by Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients. Health & Biosciences delivered mid-single-digit growth due to consistent performance in Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes and Animal Nutrition, as well as Microbial Control prior to the official divestiture completed in July. Both Home & Personal Care and Grain Processing were negative in the second quarter as each business had very strong double-digit comparison in the prior year period.  Lastly, we are pleased by Pharma Solutions continued rebound, having achieved double-digit growth driven by continued strength in our Industrial and Pharma businesses.  Turning to Slide 13, I'd like to provide a review of our profitability for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $700 million, exceeding our expectations and representing 7% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral growth driven by the pricing actions and productivity gains that I mentioned earlier. Our comparable adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 21.3%, and on an inflation-adjusted basis would have been approximately 220 basis higher or approximately 23.5%, if we normalize for the impact of pricing contribution to sales. This compares to an EBITDA margin of 22% in Q2 of 2021.  As a result of our strategic pricing actions, we have fully recovered total inflation cost to date, and we are optimistic that we will achieve full dollar cost recovery for the full fiscal year. As we continue navigating this uncertain market, we will continue to closely monitor raw materials and logistics costs in the quarters ahead and take appropriate action to offset additional inflationary pressures and maintain profitability. On Slide 14 is an overview of our second quarter performance by business segment. Nourish, which delivered year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 15% and 18% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, saw strong demand, particularly in Food Design and Flavors. In Health and Biosciences, high single-digit increases in Health and Cultures & Food Enzymes, and mid-single-digit growth in Animal Nutrition drove 4% comparable currency neutral sales growth for the division. While we implemented strategic pricing actions and saw notable productivity gains similar to Nourish this quarter, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix led to 2% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.  In Scent, Fine Fragrances continue to lead the way with double-digit growth, followed by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. Collectively, Scent achieved year-over-year comparable currency neutral sales growth of 9%, though inflationary pressures outpaced our strategic pricing actions, which led to a 17% decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our teams are continuing to work with our customers to address these ongoing inflationary pressures, and we fully anticipate to recover all inflationary costs over time.  Lastly, Pharma Solutions was one of our strongest performers this quarter, achieving 10% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth and an exceptional 25% increase in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and high single-digit growth in Pharma. The division's profitability was further supported by pricing actions and productivity gains.  Turning to Slide 15, I would like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the first half results. In our first 6 months, our free cash flow position was impacted by higher inventory values. This was a result of a combination of continued inflationary pressures and rebuilding inventories to support customer service levels. million in the first half, representing approximately 3.6% of sales, as we continue to make necessary investments in our business. In addition, IFF delivered $402 million in dividends to our shareholders.  From a leverage perspective, we remain well positioned as we advance our strategic refresh. We finished the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $569 million while gross debt for the quarter totaled $12.15 billion. Note that we received the $1.3 billion gross proceeds from the sale of our Microbial Control business in July. At the end of Q2, we maintained a 4.4x net debt credit adjusted EBITDA ratio.  In addition, just last week, we proactively amended our existing term loan credit agreement and revolving credit agreement in order to ensure we maintain adequate flexibility to navigate near-term market uncertainties. The associated amendment fee was approximately $800,000. The amended agreements delayed certain step-downs from maximum permitted leverage ratio of 4.5:1, stepping down to 3.5:1 over time, with the first step down now occurring at the end of the third quarter 2023 versus the end of the fourth quarter 2022 previously. Trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.644 billion.  As Frank mentioned, on August 3, our Board of Directors authorized a 3% or $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.81 per share of the company's common stock. The quarterly dividend is payable on October 5, 2022 to shareholders of record as of September 23. Including this authorization, we increased our quarterly dividend payment for the 13th consecutive year. Let's now turn to our consolidated outlook on Slide 16. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we remain on track to deliver our commitments and are reconfirming full year guidance projected sales of $12.6 billion to $13 billion and currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 12%. While we are reconfirming our outlook, we also are increasingly cautious on the overall market environment outlook as we navigate continued foreign exchange fluctuations, ongoing inflation and potentially recessionary pressures. We expect to achieve our sales targets through pricing actions as we press ahead toward full dollar cost recovery.  We expect foreign exchange pressures to impact sales by approximately 5 percentage points compared to our previously forecasted 4 percentage points. We are also reconfirming adjusted operating EBITDA to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which equates to currency-neutral operating EBITDA growth of 4% to 8%. Please note that we expect foreign exchange to impact that growth by approximately 6 percentage points versus 5 percentage points previously.  As always, we remain laser focused on mitigating the many macroeconomic challenges with an emphasis on controlling what we can control during these uncertain times, notably focusing on pricing execution and productivity.  In terms of the third quarter, we expect sales growth to be strong driven by pricing actions, with sales coming in modestly above $3 billion and impacted by incremental foreign exchange headwinds, some seasonality of our business and the divestiture of Microbial Control. The sale of Microbial Control will impact Q3 revenues by approximately $110 million. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $600 million to $610 million.  Before passing the call back to Frank, I want to revisit the 4 core business objectives we outlined at the beginning of the year. Overall, we are executing well against our operational priorities so far this year. Relative to maintaining strong sales momentum, we achieved 12% year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth for the first half of '22 and are targeting currency-neutral growth of 9% to 12% for the full year.  In terms of executing our broad-based pricing actions, we've fully recovered the total cost of inflation, and we remain on track to achieve a full dollar cost recovery for the full year '22. Importantly, we are closely monitoring inflationary trends in the broader market environment to ensure we are well equipped to stay ahead and, where necessary, quickly respond to future challenges.  On the productivity front, we continue to make tremendous progress towards our productivity savings goals for the full year. In the first half of the year, we delivered over $70 million operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies, well above our expectations. We are well on track to exceed our $100 million full year savings target.  Finally, relative to accelerating non-core divestitures, we successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and are continuing to assess our portfolio to identify additional portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities in this uncertain market. These divestitures will help us delever our balance sheet and enable us to reinvest in our highest performing businesses.  With that, I'll pass the call back over to Frank. Franklin Clyburn : Thanks, Glenn. Before I wrap up today's call, I want to say I am proud of the efforts of our global teams as we continue to execute amid challenging market conditions. We've achieved strong performance in the first half of 2022 and increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I am confident in our ability to achieve our full year financial targets as we continue executing against our operational priorities and control what we can control.  At the same time, we are committed to advancing our strategic transformation efforts, deploying innovation, refining our portfolio and strengthening our culture to deliver strong value creation for all of our stakeholders.  Moving through the second half of the year, we will be intensely and urgently focused on protecting and growing our business, identifying new strategic value creation opportunities, and communicating our refreshed operating model across the business and the market to position IFF for long-term success. I look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Capital Markets Day in early December.  I'd now like to open the call for any questions. Thank you. Operator : . And we will take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about the productivity program and how you're thinking about balancing margin versus volume growth especially given, I think, what you said, Glenn, of modest volume growth in this period, sort of how do you think about that going forward?  And how do we think about net savings as it relates to long-term targets, including implied margin expansion? I think the math would get you something north of 200 basis points in implied margins. How do we think about that longer term? Franklin Clyburn : Mark, this is Frank. A couple of comments. I'll start with first, the productivity program that we've announced, we see that as really important not only near-term, Mark, but really building a continuing productivity mindset. We want that build into the company.  We also want to be able to use that to be able to invest in our growth opportunities. What we're trying to achieve, Mark, is really sustainable, profitable growth, and to start to really get leverage throughout the P&L. We think that's going to be really important for us from a profile perspective. This is why we've also done the ROIC work, Mark, on our portfolio, and we'll be able to share with you in December some of the specific targets from a financial perspective. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas Exane. Heidi Vesterinen : So if we look at your Q2 currency-neutral growth, I understand this is mainly price. While we see that most of your peers had strong volumes this quarter, why do you think you weren't able to grow volumes? And perhaps you could comment on the exit rate in Q2 in terms of volumes and momentum into Q3, please? And then somewhat linked to that, what was the reason for not upgrading your full year guidance after such a strong H1 in terms of EBITDA? Glenn Richter : Heidi, this is Glenn. Thanks for the questions. Relative to sort of volume comparatives, I would sort of maybe answer it 3 ways. One is, as you're well aware, the comparatives are difficult given the apples to oranges sometimes comparisons of the business. But I would say that if you really kind of strip our business down and look at sort of the first half results, most of our core businesses actually are doing quite well. So Flavors, Scents are both mid-single digit in terms of volume growth. Core business units within H&B, Health is up high single digit. Cultures, Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition, mid-single digits. Pharma is up low single digits.  So the difference is, as we've discussed throughout the year, we're being very thoughtful regarding a balance between volume and profitability. So we've been very strategic and thoughtful relative to margin enhancement actions and focusing on those businesses that have both capacity constraints and/or are lower-margin businesses, so that's the difference. We're very specifically trying to focus on making sure we deliver good outcomes for our shareholders as well as our customers from performance.  And then lastly, I would note that this is very consistent with what we signaled. We've said very early in the year, we were planning basically the balance of the year to be relatively flattish to 1 point, and this is very consistent with the strategy and how we're implementing it.  Relative to kind of guidance, the reality is the pace in which sort of inflationary pressures flow through raw materials into our cost of goods, it does vary by business. So there's a little bit of a lag here in terms of how that's hitting quarter-to-quarter. That explains some of the overperformance in the quarter, third quarter relative to kind of the full year outlook. And consequently, because of that lag and just generally a perspective on cautionary outlook given the macro environment, we're being sort of realistic in terms of how we guide, and consequently, we're sticking to the same guidance.  So hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Frank, Glenn, and Mike. Can you talk about the volume contribution within Nourish that you expect in Q3? And how much revenue synergies and integrated solutions are included in that place?  And then secondly, what is your updated inflation forecast for the year, and any insight that you can share into 2023, please? Franklin Clyburn : Gunther, it's Frank. I'll get started. So first, with regards to revenue synergies, and as Glenn mentioned, we did see really good performance, especially within Flavors, within Nourish, and we're excited about the significant opportunity we believe we have there.  We also highlighted on the call some examples, Gunther, that we are really encouraged by some of the wins that we're seeing where we're utilizing our legacy N&B expertise, as well as legacy IFF expertise for vanilla flavor is an important win there. We highlighted an important win with regards to plant-based burgers. We're seeing good cross-selling opportunities. So overall, we're starting to see revenue synergies and we're hearing good positive feedback from our customers.  With that said, Gunther, there's work to be done, and I highlighted that on the prepared remarks. This is something that's going to be a significant area of focus for myself personally as well as the executive team. We're going to be leaning into how we bring our broader platform portfolio technology to our customers. So this is something we'll share a lot more about in our December Capital Markets Day.  Glenn, I don't know if you want to maybe touch on the inflation? Glenn Richter : Sure. Yes. Definitely Gunther. Relative to 2022, it's still choppy, but in general, no change to our outlook relative to the impact of inflation. Generally, energy has been slightly better. Logistics has been slightly better. Raw materials have been slightly worse in pockets. But generally, things are sort of stable.  I would also note that just the nature of the time it takes raw materials to go through inventory and show up in the P&L, any additional impact for the balance of the year is likely to be muted to 0 and really hit 2023. We are taking a very deep look at '23. We've run through a preliminary scenario, we're doing an update in the coming weeks here as we plan for 2023. And our perspective at this point is we do anticipate another, I'll say, meaningful round of cost increase from inflation. That's going to be concentrated in our view more on raw materials. So there's a number of areas including soy, oils, obviously, certain commodity groups such as agricultural grains and those sort of things, we're seeing pretty significant inflation. Energy is choppy, but likely to also be some increase modestly in energy prices and logistics as well. We're likely to see some sort of modest increase as well. So kind of overall, we are expecting probably '23 not to the same degree as '22, but we are expecting additional inflationary pressures for next year. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice quarter and outlook. In terms of free cash flow performance for 2Q, any more color maybe by segment? What's sort of driving that consumption? And then I think you were hoping to do about $1 billion in positive free cash flow in '22. Can you make up some of this in the second half of the year? Glenn Richter : Yes. So good question, Mike. The sole impact is -- well, there's seasonality, as you know. So typically, in the first half of the year, first quarter, there's a build on working capital, namely inventories. Secondarily, there's the year-end of compensation that basically gets paid out, et cetera. We are running actually worse on cash flow than anticipated to the tune of about $200 million. That is 100% attributable to higher inventory levels that is principally related to basically higher costs.  So as you may recall, when we entered the year, we had our kind of Wave 1 inflation subsequent very early in the year. We identified another significant round of inflation coming through. That is rolling into inventory. So as a byproduct of that, we had guided to the full year that we'd be relatively flat to prior year from a free cash flow standpoint of about $1 billion-ish. We're sort of targeting to be probably about $200 million less than that at this point in time.  That being said, we are implementing a series of very important initiatives largely against the legacy N&B businesses. In terms of putting in new S&OP processes and enhancements, we're hopeful that those will drive some efficiencies, i.e., be able to bring some inventory levels. But I'd say best guess at this point is probably 800-ish versus the original $1 billion. Operator : And we'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess I wanted to come back to the inflation and cost question. I appreciate there's a business, but help us just balance, think about the price cost balance in the second half specifically? I think you entered the year having been behind on price cost from '21, and hoping you'd be catching up to that into '23. Is there still -- do you still see -- or still have line of sight to recapturing kind of that price-cost imbalance on a cumulative basis in '23?  And I guess, along those lines, can you talk about the actions you're taking to try to shorten some of the price lags in some of the businesses, and probably see it a little bit more in the Scent segment this quarter? But how -- what can we do to maybe compress that -- the length of those inventories in cost cycles? Glenn Richter : Adam, thanks for the question. I'd say a couple of answers. One is just relative to this year, I'll say we're slightly ahead, i.e. price versus cost, back to the how things roll through inventory slightly behind the second half of the year. That's part of the reason for the -- how one thinks about the balance of the year implied guidance versus kind of the first half of the year. So that's a piece of it. We -- normally, 18 months would be the full lag from inflation to capture. You can see that it's sort of manifesting itself differently by business. Scent is the one that's the furthest behind from a timing, given the nature of the relatively large customers and generally are indices tag to the contracts from the standpoint. And we would fully expect that to continue to be the case.  The only question mark here is how one thinks about '23. So as I just mentioned, my prior answer to Mike is that we probably are going to see another round of inflation come through. So from that standpoint, it may be 18 months from the first round, but we may have a continued set of rounds of inflation we need to catch up, which would suggest probably late '23 or even '24, if that's the case.  But to your last part of your question, obviously, we've all been in a very unprecedented environment relative to pricing, and that's required us to sort of rethink traditional contracts. And the way we've been rethinking them is, to some extent, just having realistic discussions with our customers on these -- level of inflation and having to share the burden. And then in addition, just rethinking contracts in terms of the frequency, so as opposed to annual, semi-annual or other type of sort of more open agreements relative to changes in the marketplace. So that's been a bigger factor of relative to the contracts we put in place, and I suspect it will prevail in the future as well as we think about '23. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John Roberts : Glenn. I think you earlier quantified it's 3 or 4 divestments for $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in expected proceeds. Is that still the right ballpark target as you look at the portfolio?  And then to your comments on inflation and higher working capital. So the way to think about how much is just oil prices working their way down the supply chain, and it's just taking time to get to you versus structural, European gas constraints in China, rotating lockdowns and logistics stuff? Can you separate oil prices or commodity prices versus the structural issues you're facing? Glenn Richter : Yes. Good question, John. So relative to our outlook for divestitures, we still think the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion gross proceeds, 3 to 4 transactions completed by the end of next year is in the right ballpark. The market, as you're well aware, has slowed down, so the level of M&A activity is substantially less with the ball in the credit markets that has made it more difficult, particularly for private equity investors.  However, the size of our transactions, you can just do the simple math, aren't that large. They tend to be sort of nice strategic fits for other businesses. So from an initial dialogue standpoint, the interest level seems very good. So we think that things may be a little slower from a process standpoint, but we're still fairly confident that we will hit our target.  Relative to sort of broader global supplies or how one thinks about inventory over the longer cycle, about half of our growth, of our dollar growth of inventories is related to inflation this year, and about half is related to higher inventory levels. Those higher inventory levels, if you recall, would basically improve our customer service levels because we had low inventories, again, the legacy N&B businesses. I will say, though, I'm increasingly confident that through the implementation of improved S&OP processes across a number of our businesses, that will allow us actually to reduce some of those higher inventories.  The third thing you mentioned is really the global supply chain. Clearly, we, like everybody, have an extended supply chain, i.e., there's more products sitting on the water for longer times. There's more inventory buffer stock in our system, et cetera, that basically accommodate for the volatility of the market. We're actually thinking about what that means longer term in terms of working capital. And I suspect by the end of this year, we'll be able to sort of come back and provide some visibility on that. But I do think at the end of the day, that will be a meaningful improvement opportunity not just for ourselves, but for everyone as the supply chain gets back to order. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Frank and Glenn, where are you seeing initial signs of demand weakness, either by geography or by business? And second, if we were to go into a deeper downturn, what levers can, would you pull to offset that downturn? Franklin Clyburn : David, it's Frank. Thanks for the question. A couple of thoughts. From the demand weakness perspective, the geography that we are seeing is probably no surprises. Really China, we had the lockdowns, and we did see an impact clearly in the second quarter. And just to recall, David, China is our second largest market, so that's been somewhat of a challenge for us.  And then if you think about our portfolio, on the positive side, as Glenn mentioned, we did see good growth in Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes, Flavors, Fine and Consumer Fragrance as well, so that's the positive. If you think about the resiliency of our portfolio, we feel overall cautiously optimistic. One would anticipate as pressures continue to , Fine Fragrances may be somewhat of a challenge.  As we think about the additional levers, and this is what we're really staring into. But if you listen to some of our prepared remarks, clearly, productivity is going to be continuously important for us, and that's something that we are spending a lot of time on as a team and thinking about levers there. Glenn has already spoken about our pricing and our working with customers to really do everything we can to recoup the inflation that we're seeing. And then the other lever we have is really staying close to our customers, our global key account teams, our customer insight teams, really trying to be as quick and agile as possible. Working with our customers to make sure we have good connection with them to understand kind of what we're seeing in the marketplace. So those are all levers that we are focused on, but it's also why we feel good on our recommitment of our guidance. Both the top line at 9% to 12% growth range, and then also our EBITDA range of 48%. So that's why we feel comfortable and confident in reconfirming our guidance today. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I just wanted to first up, follow up on the last question as it relates to new product development. Have you seen any signs of slowing as major customers sort of worry about consumer elasticity on a global basis?  And then on Slide 16, Frank, we talked about preparing for more uncertain market conditions, including a recession. How do you think the portfolio is positioned as we potentially go into some level of macroeconomic slowdown? And I'm just asking in context of your leverage profile occurred. Franklin Clyburn : Yes. So on the resiliency, as I mentioned, we feel overall cautiously optimistic on the portfolio. Clearly, there's a lot of moving pieces right now. But if you think about Food and Beverage, you think about Health, you think about what we are seeing resiliency from our Pharma business, so we feel overall that the portfolio going into possibly some challenging times is really well positioned overall. And I've kind of highlighted that Fine Fragrances may be an area that we start to see some pullback from a demand perspective.  As far as the innovation question in our portfolio, there are some customers that are going to really focus on our core offerings, that they're going to maybe not think about new offerings at this point in time. However, we still are seeing very strong signals of customers wanting to innovate, co-develop and work with us, and we're really excited about our pipeline and portfolio. And my belief is that's still going to be critically important for the future. It's something that we'll spend time in December really sharing with you why we're excited about our pipeline portfolio, but that's going to be really key for us.  So yes, you'll see some customers focus in the near term maybe on core offerings. However, as we look out, we're still seeing signals from customers that are working with us on innovation. It's going to be really important to the future. Glenn Richter : Yes. And if I could maybe just add to that relative to the leverage question, Ghansham, is that as Frank indicated, as you're well aware, this business is highly resilient through cycles. So you may be down a couple percent, you may have some temporary transition quarter or 2 as customers sort of destock inventories, but in general, you don't see massive swings in terms of volume.  Secondarily, very importantly, we do believe that sort of the pricing resiliency and being able to continue to sustain passing inflation through, which is helpful. Third, productivity, as we've mentioned, is sort of a major driver here to sort of offset some of the potential demand drop in the marketplace. And then in general, a slowdown probably helps other elements of working capital, such as inventory is more stable as well, and maybe even slower CapEx investments. So not only from a P&L standpoint, but from a cash flow, very resilient to sort of managing the cycle, particularly with the success in pricing and the focus on productivity. Operator : We'll take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS. Joshua Spector : I just wanted to follow up on Nourish, and particularly in the quarter, segment margins were much higher than our expectations, I believe, higher than your expectations. You talked about the visibility of raw materials flowing through your system. So I'm curious really what went better in the quarter, and why can't something like that occur in the next couple of quarters? What's different versus what happened this quarter? Glenn Richter : Yes, good question, Josh. It really is related to the sort of the matching of the build in inventories relative to the flow-throughs of sales. And as mentioned, we've sort of built inventories. And at this point, we think we're going to be fairly -- i.e., the raw materials have come through. Raw materials are generally sort of static from a cost standpoint. So we do expect them to sort of run through the next quarter or so, and we wouldn't expect to have this, I'll say, artificial pickup from a timing standpoint. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : We've hit on price cost, we've hit on productivity. When we look out -- obviously, there's some uncertainty in the second half of the year. But when we look out into '23, '24, and Frank, now that you've had some time to look at your 4 primary businesses, can you talk about just any potential mix enrichment, specifically in H&B, and anything else that could really help us try to compartmentalize your longer-term margin opportunities across segments? Just any quick thoughts? Franklin Clyburn : Yes, Chris, just -- I mean, we'll spend some time in December around the portfolio, in particular. This is why we have really looked at our business through the ROIC lens that we've spoken about. And you can see the 3 categories that we highlighted, Invest to Grow and then also maintaining our business, and then some that we actually have to really improve or exit.  We're excited that we have significant opportunities within the Invest to Grow area. And I've highlighted Flavors, we've highlighted Health, our Food & Culture Enzyme businesses. So there is, we think, significant profitable opportunities for very good growth, big categories. The categories are growing, very strong end markets. So we're excited about that, Chris. And then also, we will continue to take a very disciplined approach overall to areas where we do not think we are the best owners. And Glenn highlighted our divestiture strategy, we'll continue to do that as well. So all in all, we feel good about the portfolio. And like I said, we'll impact a lot more of that when we get to December. Operator : And we'll go next to Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : The margin compression in Scent was weaker from the first to the second quarter, that is weaker sequentially. That seems to be the one business where you've not had the same profit resiliency. Why is that? And for Glenn, your deferred tax line in your funds flow was an outflow of $178 million. And for the full year last year, it was an outflow of $236 million. What's going on with your taxes so that you have this cash outflow? Glenn Richter : Jeff, you want me to answer the first question or second question? Franklin Clyburn : You can go. Glenn Richter : Okay. Sorry. Okay. So your first question was relative to the Scent trend and -- Jeffrey Zekauskas : Market performance. Glenn Richter : The reality is that -- 2 things. One, there were some one-time expenses in the second quarter relative to Scents. Secondarily, as we mentioned, that there's been 2 rounds of inflation. So as we talked, it's a little more of a lag in that business from a standpoint. So if you think about the 2 rounds of impact that's basically coming through and there's a bit of delay.  And relative to taxes, there's lots of -- every year, Jeffrey, there's lots of ebbs and flows, depending on what's happening across various parts of the globe in terms of our tax positions and settlements. So everything is actually trending fine versus sort of our expectations at this point in time. There's nothing sort of abnormal from a year-over-year standpoint. But I do appreciate the question. Operator : And we take our... Glenn Richter : We can go to the next one. Operator : Okay. We'll take the final question from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : If I were to look at the top line kind of just on a rough cut basis, what percent of your sales or businesses fall into the invest category versus maximize versus optimized? Franklin Clyburn : And thanks for that question. And that's something that at this time, we're not prepared to share the different cuts percentage-wise. What I would share is that we do have really good opportunities in the Invest to Grow category. And as I mentioned, we'll clearly unpack that a little bit more as we get into December and Investor Day, and really share the excitement we have around the portfolio as well as the opportunities. But right now, we're not prepared to share the specific percentages, okay? Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn for any closing remarks. Franklin Clyburn : So I would like to just thank everyone for joining the call, and also thank all of our IFF colleagues once again around the world. We feel very proud of our first half business performance and results, and we know that the teams around the world continue to work with our customers to bring innovation and to help our customers to be successful in the marketplace.  And we look forward to seeing at our third quarter call as well as, once again, our Capital Markets Day on December 7, and hope everyone has a good rest of the morning. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Mike and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. On today's call, I will begin by providing an update on the strong progress we continue to make in reviewing and implementing our refreshed operating strategy. We are focused as ever on enhancing our operational plan and are making great progress towards completing the strategic refresh process and sharing this with you on December 7th at our Investor Day. I will then share our year-to-date performance and then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our third quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Once complete, we will then open the call up for any questions. Before we move ahead, I do want to take a moment, as I always do to thank our dedicated colleagues around the world. It continues to be an unpredictable year and our colleagues continue to work tirelessly to deliver for our customers. Our global IFF team members are truly committed to servicing our customers and I continue to be so inspired by our team's determination and ingenuity. Now beginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update regarding our progress to complete our strategic refresh and begin putting this enhanced plan into action. We are now working diligently to operationalize our new divisional strategies and begin executing these focused, integrated and value-additive strategies with our customers and in the marketplace. This next chapter in our company's transformation is intended to ensure we are going to market as the most effective and innovative IFF we can be to extend our position as a trusted partner to our customers and maximize value for them, employees and shareholders both in the near and long-term. Let me review what we focused on and what we've accomplished through this comprehensive enterprise-wide review process. This review of our portfolio and our business is designed to ensure we are able to defend and extend our industry leadership in key markets, geographies and grow our business with key accounts and new customers. This has included evaluating our portfolio through a return on invested capital lens, identifying portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities. This discipline will enable us to reduce debt and reinvest in our high-performing businesses as well as identify additional growth opportunities in attractive end markets and geographies that will allow us to foster long-term growth even amid ongoing external headwinds. It has been an important endeavor, not only to help us streamline the business but also ensure that we are focusing on only the highest value opportunities and maximizing our return profile across the entire business. We are in the process of refining our operating model and organizational structure to ensure better commercial engagement enhance One IFF's company culture, strengthen talent in key roles and realign incentives to ensure accountability and ownership. We are also finalizing our financial aspirations for full year 2023 as well as what we believe the business should deliver longer term under more normalized conditions, and the capital allocation strategies necessary to achieve them all while prioritizing accelerated growth of our high-performing businesses. With this collective foundational planning, I am confident that IFF will fully capitalize on our clear portfolio advantage and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day on December 7. Moving to slide 7. I'd like to provide highlights of IFF's performance year-to-date. Despite a volatile market environment over the last nine months, IFF has continued to execute on our operational priorities to achieve strong top and bottom line results. Year-to-date we have delivered $9.6 billion in sales, which translates to 11% comparable currency-neutral growth and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 6% to $2 billion. Through the first nine months, we continued to take strategic pricing actions as necessary to offset inflationary pressures and as a result have fully recovered total inflation cost to-date. Turning to productivity by focusing on efficiency in our manufacturing processes and optimizing our supply chain and procurement, we captured over $125 million in extremely valuable operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies through the first nine months of 2022. Accelerating productivity represents one of our top priorities and is increasingly important given the more challenging economic environment heading into the fourth quarter and full year 2023. To this end, we are accelerating and expanding our efforts beyond our existing supply chain end-to-end manufacturing economic profit and global shared services platform initiatives we outlined on our second quarter conference call. We are now looking at our total cost structure to ensure we are optimized around go-forward strategic priorities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness. These initiatives will be critical to support our growth strategy, all while positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. To support our continuous improvement efforts within operations, I am pleased to welcome Ralf Finzel to our executive team as Executive Vice President and Global Operations Officer. He joined us from Honeywell International Performance Materials & Technologies business group where he most recently served as Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain. Ralf brings decades of leadership experience and his focus on operational excellence, sustainable continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction ensures he will be a key contributor to IFF's success moving forward as he will be accountable to deliver on our net productivity goals. In addition, I am pleased to announce that we've hired a new Chief Procurement Officer, Alex Turolla who will be responsible for leading all of IFF's procurement efforts globally with the goal to move from procurement to strategic sourcing. Alex who joins from Mondel\u0113z International where he served most recently as Senior Vice President, Sourcing Global Direct Materials, managing $11 billion globally, brings significant experience in end-to-end supply chain operations and procurement. We also continue to progress against our portfolio optimization efforts now having successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business at the beginning of the third quarter. The proceeds were used to reduce our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9 times from 4.4 times at the end of the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we continue to assess the profitability and potential of each of our businesses and explore additional non-core divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to improve our capital structure and achieve our deleveraging target. Now, I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide a deeper dive into our third quarter as well as an overview of the performance of each of our businesses. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Frank and welcome everyone. Starting on slide eight, I would like to provide an overview of our third quarter performance. In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing 10% year-over-year growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Pharma Solutions divisions. Pricing was a strong contributor to growth and as expected, volumes were down marginally in the quarter. It should be noted that on a two-year average basis, which factors our strong 8% year ago comparison, volume growth is running at about 4%. And while we have seen strong volume growth across most parts of our Pharma and Scent businesses in the third quarter, Nourish and H&B volumes were challenged. To provide some more color, nearly two-thirds of our volume decline in the quarter came in Protein Solutions, which is part of the Nourish business, where we have seen customer destocking to address higher inventory levels in response to sluggish end consumer demand. In H&B, our held volumes were also challenged in the third quarter, a direct result from weakening market demand in the US and Europe reflected in public market data. Gross margin was negatively affected by the significant inflationary pressures we faced across our markets. Yet through strategic pricing and productivity gains, IFF delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We also delivered solid adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of $1.36. The strong dollar continued to be a headwind to our business. In the third quarter, we saw an approximately 7% impact on sales, an 8% adverse impact on EBITDA due to foreign exchange. Before moving on, I want to share that we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.25 billion for the third quarter related to our Health & Biosciences business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to increases in interest rates and lower business projections due to adverse macroeconomic impacts on volume, continued cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange rate variations. Now moving to slide 9, I will provide a brief overview of the performance across our business segments. In the third quarter, we achieved year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 10% driven by broad-based sales growth across all of our business segments and nearly all of our sub-business units. Nourish had another strong quarter with double-digit growth and particularly encouraging performance from Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design. Health & Biosciences also saw strong single-digit growth despite pressure in our Grain Processing business. Scent again saw continued currency-neutral sales growth in the high single-digits, thanks to our Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients businesses. Pharma Solutions rebound continues with an impressive 28% increase in sales driven by continued strength in both industrial and pharma. Turning to slide 10 and looking at our profitability for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $612 million. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year due to the disciplined pricing actions to fully recover total inflation. We also achieved meaningful productivity gains and operational efficiencies from our productivity program, which have helped offset volume headwinds. As discussed last quarter, while we are clearly seeing signs of raw material inflation easing, we will continue taking appropriate targeted actions to offset inflation to maintain profitability. Now on slide 11, I'd like to discuss the underlying dynamics impacting the third quarter performance of each of our business segments. Nourish delivered another strong top-line quarter. Nourish's 10% year-over-year sales growth on a currency-neutral basis was driven by double-digit growth in Food Design and Ingredients, and sustained growth in our Flavors business.  Health & Biosciences also maintain strong performance delivering 3% in comparable currency-neutral sales growth driven by mid single-digit growth in our Culture & Food Enzymes, Health, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition offerings. However, for each of these segments we saw 4% and 1% year-over-year decreases, respectively in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA as our price increases and productivity gains we discussed earlier were offset by lower volumes. Our Scent division once again delivered a strong performance with 9% currency-neutral sales growth this quarter, driven by mid-teen growth in Fine Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and high single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. The division also saw 3% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to volume growth, our price increases and productivity gains. Pharma Solutions contributed very strong performance, with 28% growth in currency-neutral sales, led by strong double-digit growth in pharma and industrial. Similar to Scent, Pharma Solutions also benefited from strong volume, our pricing actions and the productivity gains we achieved in the quarter leading to an impressive 76% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Turning now to Slide 12, I would like to cover our cash flow and leverage position. Through the first nine months, we generated $189 million in cash from operations, with CapEx finishing at $344 million or approximately 3.6% of sales. The net result is that our free cash flow through nine months was a negative $155 million. Our free cash flow has been significantly impacted by much higher inventories due to a combination of inflation, strategic increases and improved customer service levels and to slowing volumes. In addition, included in our free cash flow numbers are one-time deal and integration-related costs. As a result, we are implementing a series of initiatives to improve our cash flow with an intense focus on managing inventories down. Much of this will be driven by leveraging new S&OP processes and tools in concert with specific targets for each business unit, which we believe will improve our inventory efficiency across all parts of the business while continuing to maintain high service levels to our customers. In addition, we will be taking targeted actions to reduce CapEx spend and improve other working capital metrics to further improve our cash position. Importantly, we continue to make progress towards achieving our deleveraging target. As Frank mentioned earlier, we improved our net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9 times from 4.4 times, which was supported by proceeds from our recent Microbial Control divestiture. We finished the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $538 million, while gross debt for the quarter totaled $10.8 billion. Turning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 13, I want to provide some update on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our business and broader industry continues to face challenging operational conditions with persistent foreign exchange, inflationary and other economic pressures. These challenges have only increased since last quarter. We are certainly encouraged by the consistent sales growth achieved across each of our businesses this quarter, especially in this environment. However, we are adjusting our sales expectations for Q4, as we expect volume to further decelerate due to lower end-market demand and we expect foreign exchange to remain a significant headwind. These factors will also present challenges to adjusted operating EBITDA. In light of these factors, we are adjusting our full year guidance and now expect full year sales between $12.4 billion and $12.5 billion and comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 10%. We are reconfirming our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, though we anticipate results to be at the bottom end of this range as we maintain strong cost discipline and accelerate productivity to offset persistent headwinds and softer volumes. Looking into 2023, the current macroeconomic environment makes us cautious. And as a result, we anticipate that we will be in a low-volume growth environment, particularly in the first half of next year. In addition, while we see raw material inflation easing, we do anticipate some year-over-year increases in raw materials and continued volatile energy markets, which will require additional pricing actions. As a result, we will continue to examine and refine our resource allocation to focus on strong cost discipline and accelerating our productivity across our business. We will also continue to implement pricing actions surgically, to support our profitability ensure our business remains resilient. And while it's still early in our planning process, we are targeting strong comparable currency-neutral sales growth in 2023, to be driven more predominantly by price with more modest EBITDA growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis, as we reinvest in the business to accelerate sales momentum and drive long-term profitable growth. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, as we roll forward current spot rates. We will spend more time on 2023 at our Investor Day, in a few weeks. I'll now turn it back to Frank, for closing comments. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Glenn. I am tremendously proud of the work our teams at IFF have accomplished in the last quarter, as we remain laser-focused on developing innovative solutions and exceeding the expectations of our customers around the world. As you can see from our outlook, though we are moving into Q4 with caution, I am confident as we have demonstrated time and again and our global team's ability, to navigate even the most complex environments. As Glenn said, we are closely monitoring shifts in the market to effectively address any emerging challenge. We remain intensely focused on controlling the controllable, through the year-end and we continue to work with our customers to surgically implement pricing actions, meet or accelerate our productivity and portfolio optimization objectives, continue to delever our balance sheet and focus on driving profitable growth. As you know, we have made significant progress this year to strengthen our business and become more efficient. By leveraging our strong foundation and being laser-focused on our growth initiatives, I am confident in IFF's ability to be resilient and drive long-term value creation regardless of the market environment. Before I open the call up to questions, I would like to share official details about our upcoming Investor Day, which will be held on Wednesday, December 7 in New York City. We are excited to host this event and share more about the opportunities ahead for IFF including how we will capitalize on our leadership position, innovate for our customers, generate strong productivity and grow our business for the future. We hope you will all join us, and we look forward to seeing you there for what promises to be an engaging interactive and informative experience. Registration links for the in-person live event, have been sent out, but if you have not received one or have questions, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations department. This will also be webcasted broadly for those that cannot travel to New York City. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, Frank. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess a question on cash flow, which year-to-date has been more challenged. I think, Glenn, previously there's been a target of $800 million or so of free cash flow this year. Can you provide an update on what that might ultimately shake out to be? And just more broadly, what's the plan on improving the cash conversion as we go into 2023 and beyond? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey, good morning, Adam. Thanks very much for the question. Clearly, it has been more challenging than expected this year and that's principally been driven by our inventory balances. So, maybe, if I can actually even start back in the first of the year, you cited the $800 million. We began the year at $1 billion target. And since that, it's been a combination of incremental pricing/inflation that was outside of plan. That's costing us about $125 million. And in addition, there's another $200 million of additional inventories we expect to be at year-end. By the way, that's a reduction of about $100 million from where we are. We ended the third quarter with inventories up $600 million from the start of the year. That was a large -- about $200 million of that is basically based on raw material inflation. About $400 million is basically based on, as Frank had mentioned, building inventories for service levels. But importantly, basically demand has slowed down and we've ended up with higher inventory. So, again, that's about $200 million delta from our original target. We are fully confident, we're going to get that $200 million back. We expect to get that back targeted in the first half of next year and even targeting more. On top of that our business has slowed down and there's been some differences in terms of our tax payments, really a timing element for us. That's collectively about $150 million. So those adjustments get us to sort of north of $500 million. So its $1 billion, minus $200 million higher volume-related inventories about another $125 million related to inflation, about $150 million slightly softer earnings than previous outlook and in addition some timing on tax. So that's a little over $500 million. I would note as we mentioned in our script, within our free cash flow that reported, its a GAAP basis in terms of free cash flow, so take it directly from our cash flow statement. That includes deal-related and integration costs. That's very material for us this year, given the sale of our Microbial Control business. So all the transaction-related costs, number of items for the standup at set were basically paid for as part of the deal and some integration-related costs. So there's about $225 million this year, that's sort of in -- it will be netted against that $525 million. So on it's a reported basis, if you will. That's more than $300 million. But frankly the $200 million is really a charge against operating cash flow when it's really related to sales of businesses. It's a little bit of an apples and oranges. So I'd sort of point to maybe $500 million as the true sort of operating cash flow this year. Of the gaps this year, clearly, $200 million inventory will get back. I'd say taxes clearly timing of another $100 million. That gets us to north of a little bit $800 million. And over time, we would expect the incremental raw materials that are sitting in our inventory this year, we'd expect to get that back over time. And again, that's over $250 million from the start of the year. So over time, we expect that to reverse as well. So hopefully, that was helpful. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Samuelson. The next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark, your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Yeah. Thanks and morning, everyone. I guess just to start I wanted to follow-up on the last question. So thinking about free cash flow more broadly, you wrote down the H&B business. I assume that implies incremental investment for that. So the question maybe sort of broadly is, how do you fund that? Obviously, you just talked about free cash flow improvement kind of over the next 12, 18 months with other sort of underlying drivers. But can you comment on what a reasonable rate of free cash flow productivity for the business would look like kind of 2024 and beyond? Certainly, in the context of some of your competitors having targets out there, are those reasonable levels? And then second question is just on volumes. You're implying the volumes will be down mid single-digits in the fourth quarter. Which categories are driving that? And then how do you think about those trends through at least the first half of 2023 I would guess are challenged before comparisons get easier? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Hey, Mark, it's Glenn. Good morning. Relative to our longer-term objectives on cash flow, we're going to hold that to our Capital Markets Day. So we're less than a month away from that. We'll have a chance to actually discuss more specifically our longer-term targets. And then I'll turn it over to Frank to talk about some of the flow trends. Frank Clyburn : Hey, Mark, good morning. A couple of things that I wanted to highlight. You are correct. We are in the fourth quarter assuming volumes do decelerate versus the Q3 number that we just posted. And it's really two factors and I'll give you where the areas that are a focus for us right now what we're seeing. I'll start with our health business under the Health & Biosciences division, Mark. In health and I signaled this I think even earlier in the quarter, we are seeing both end-market demand slow as consumers are making choices between probiotics dietary supplements. So we are seeing some slowing end-market use in health and we are also seeing destocking in that business in particular in North America. And we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter as also well in Europe. So that's what we're seeing in our health businesses. And we went through the quarter, Mark. We did see July down. We saw August come back. September was down. And as we now started to see in October, we're seeing a similar trend of the deceleration I mentioned in that business. In Ingredients under Nourish and we highlighted this on our prepared remarks, Mark, we are also seeing more inventory destocking is the primary aspect of what we're assuming will continue as we go into the fourth quarter. We also within the Ingredients business did make some trade-offs from a pricing perspective. We had some of our Protein Solutions business that was capacity-constrained, where we did increase price made some volume trade-offs to preserve some margin, but it's primarily destocking. So that is the main reason and we're also assuming in that business that will continue in the fourth quarter. As we go into '23, we're expecting at least in the first half moderate volume growth. We'll explain a lot more of what we're anticipating for '23 as we get to Capital Markets Day, Mark, but that's what hopefully gives you some color on what we're seeing in the business. The other thing, I would highlight though and I think it's an important reminder for us that, if you do take a step back over the two-year time period and we mentioned this through Q3, we are growing our volumes 4%. And we are still seeing good growth in particular in Scent and Pharma that we highlighted as well. So, the isolation that I highlighted is really primarily in those two areas, which is where we're anticipating seeing the deceleration continues as mentioned. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John, your line is now open. John Roberts : Great. Thank you. The goodwill write-downs seem to only affect Health & Bioscience, but I assume the higher discount rate would have affected goodwill on the other segments as well. So, the difference must be in the longer-term assumptions for Health & Bioscience relative to the macro assumptions for the other segments. Could you discuss a little bit why the longer-term macro assumptions for Health & Bioscience appear to be worsening relative to the other segments? Glenn Richter : Yes, John, thanks for the question. Actually it's more related to the amount of goodwill and intangibles that are allocated to the business. So let me -- just by way of background as I'm sure you're well aware, we prior to the end of the quarter had about $25 million of goodwill and intangibles on our books. They were assigned to each of the four divisions. They're directly related to the acquisitions. And by definition, the majority of that is from the N&B acquisition. So that allocation is concentrated in H&B Pharma and somewhat Nourish, but Nourish obviously has legacy IFF business as well. H&B and Pharma do not, right? So, if you will, it's a heavy sort of burden in terms of the goodwill intangibles against those two businesses. For context about 45% prior to the write-down of goodwill and intangibles was sitting on the books of H&B. So that's point one. Point two is, you're required to do an annual test or if there's an event that suggests there may be an impairment have to do it within the year. The event largely is attributable to the interest rate environment. So the way you basically run the calculation is you basically do a discounted cash flow for each of the businesses, you do forward projections. The forward projections on the H&B business were brought down. Those were in part because of exchange rates. So, all the businesses actually have lower earnings because we have to use the current exchange rates. Part of it is slightly lower operating performance, but exchange rates played a meaningful role. But the most significant variable is the discount rate. As everyone's well aware, the interest rates are going up rapidly. So the discount rate we were required to use for the cash flow was materially higher than a year ago and that's what resulted in the $2.25 billion. We do note in our disclosures that we have about 10% cushion on Pharma. As you would expect that will be the second business that would be under scrutiny, just given the amount of goodwill intangibles sign to the business. It is less significant on a relative basis for Scent and Nourish, because you have the legacy IFF businesses, that don't carry the goodwill and the other intangible impact as much. So it's really -- to some extent, I'd say it's a minor reflection on the outlook of the business and more reflective of the interest rate environment and what we're experiencing from the exchange rate. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther, your line is now open. Gunther Zechmann : Thank you. Good morning, Frank, Glenn and Mike. Now your Q4 guidance also from what you just said on volumes implies around 10% pricing. That's pretty similar to Q3. We know that peers reported pricing getting harder in a weakening demand environment, which is what you're flagging as well and new price rounds getting even tougher. So how do you see this develop into 2023 then? What are your expectations for the raw material cost into next year as well? And also how much of the lower volumes that you indicated, do you think are due to stronger price increases that you pushed through as opposed to consumer demand down-trading or destocking please? Glenn Richter : Good afternoon, Gunther. I'll actually start by talking about the inflationary environment. I think then Frank will probably pick it up to talk about pricing dynamics relative to volume. First of all, we are clearly seeing a deceleration environment relative to raw materials in the marketplace. So that's happening in certain commodities going forward. But let me kind of step back and talk about our overall outlook for 2023 in terms of three components. One logistics is actually looking very favorable flat to maybe slightly down. We are encouraged by an ease up of the supply chain, which is helping not only in terms of cost for freight, but in addition just making sure that we're able to deliver on time to our customers. So that's a plus. Energy is incredibly volatile as everybody knows. And it's very difficult to call that. What we have been doing with our customers as many have been doing is implementing direct surcharges or variable pricing that's tied to energy prices. So that will ebb and flow depending upon the market dynamic. And again, that's fairly consistent with what's happening with many players. That tends to be as you're well aware more concentrated in the European market globally in terms of the impact. And then as it relates to raws, we are seeing -- we're still seeing inflationary pressure. I would basically put that in three buckets where there are certain commodity groups that are impacted by the energy environment and/or supply chain so synthetics; chemicals as an example; pulp as an example. Secondarily, we're clearly seeing some roll-off on contractual pricing we had or hedging this year. So that's actually impacting. And while there are certain price commodity categories that are beginning to decline year-over-year, they represent some modest increases for us, such as soybean, palm oil, et cetera. And related to that, we are expecting next year's raw inflation to be about half of what we had this year, so call it, high single digits in terms of the impact. You are correct in pricing environment continues to tighten up. By definition with a slowdown in consumer, everyone's trying to be a little bit more thoughtful in terms of commodity prices would be passed through. We are about to go to market for 2023 pricing. We have spent a lot of energy being very surgical relative to what makes sense or customer in terms of pricing tied directly to what we're seeing in the marketplace. So we are -- again, it will be a much lower number versus what we have, but we are expecting another round of 2023 pricing actions to offset the residual raw materials. Frank Clyburn : And Gunther, this is Frank. With regards to the second part of your question about the lower volumes and strong price increases, we do not see it broadly, Gunther, that our pricing actions have impacted volume. In fact if you look at what's happening in the market, many of our peers are also increasing pricing. So we do not see that as an impact. In fact, we've also reached out to many of our customers and we've been doing this in concert obviously with them. And they have clearly signaled that we have not seen any share losses per se, Gunther because of our pricing actions. The one area that I did highlight is where we made a conscious trade-off was within our Ingredients business where we were capacity-constrained. We did increase price and made some volume trade-offs to preserve margins. So that is the one area that I would highlight. The other thing is with regards to what is the driver, primarily as mentioned, it is destocking for our business is what we're seeing Gunther. And that is -- the main driver is our customers are looking at year-end their inventory levels and wanting to obviously manage their working capital appropriately. So, that's really the driver. The last thing I will say though, with all of that, one of the things and we'll spend more time on the Capital Markets Day is we are looking at ways to really continue to build our commercial execution. How do we work with our customers to really bring the full portfolio of IFF forward increasing our market share with our key customers, regional customers and global customers as well as new customer acquisition? And I'll be spending some more time here at Capital Markets Day really talking about our plans in that area to focus on our aspirations for growth, Gunther. So, much more to come. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Zechmann. Our next question today is from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. Heidi, your line is now open. Heidi Vesterinen : Morning. So, I have another question on your outlook please. We noticed that your peers aren't calling out a volume decline or any major destocking in Q4, although I do appreciate that many of them reported much earlier than you have. Have market trends weakened significantly in recent weeks, or is your cautious outlook driven more by IFF-specific factors? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Heidi, it's Frank. And as I highlighted, as we went through the quarter and in particular in September, Heidi, we did start to really see the destocking that I mentioned. And also, we are seeing that in the month of October. So, as we look at now for our forecast for this fourth quarter, we're obviously taking those most recent data points into consideration. And that is why we feel as though appropriately so we have guided to the top line sales that we've mentioned in our prepared remarks. The one thing I do want to take a step back though Heidi and do highlight though is we still are confident that for the full year growing the business, 9% to 10%, if you were excluding exchange, we feel as though is a very good overall performance. Like I said clearly, the fourth quarter is where we're seeing some challenges, and this is primarily due to our customers wanting to manage the inventory. And we think it's the prudent approach to take based on what we're seeing in the last couple of months end of Q3 and then as I mentioned in October. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David, your line is open. Anthony Mercandetti : Good morning. This is Anthony Mercandetti on for David. You touched on it a bit throughout the call, but I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate on how much more destocking you're expecting into 2023 will be a headwind in Q4. And then maybe what particular end markets and regions you expect the destocking to be more pronounced in regards to maybe the first half of 2023? Glenn Richter : Hey, Anthony this is Glenn. Thanks for joining us. I'd say it's really difficult for us to predict. We do track very closely end-consumer demand. So what information we get from largely the scanner data; secondarily, obviously, in very extensive dialogues with our customers in terms of what they're doing. And as a byproduct, we do believe that destocking in addition to declining the end-consumer demand are the key contributors to what we're seeing. And of note as Frank had mentioned, we see it most pronounced in a couple of categories : one in protein solutions; second, in probiotics. And as you follow the end market and look at what some of the major CPG firms are reporting, they're double-digit drops in terms of the end market. And particularly as you think about probiotics, which had a big, big booms related to COVID and the value of these things it's understandable why we would see the decline. So point one is we believe that this is destocking end consumer. Point two relative to how long this will run, we really don't know. A number of our customers have communicated to us that they believe by year-end, they will have their inventories in place. That, of course, assumes they have a good crystal ball relative to where the consumer is going. Others have indicated that they believe that this may extend into the first and second quarter of next year. So we'll be providing more perspective at our Investor Day relative to our outlook on 2023, but we do -- we will ultimately be factoring potentially further destocking and slow down the consumer as we think about the outlook for our financial performance for next year. So appreciate the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Mike, your line is open. Mike Sison : Hi guys, nice quarter. Frank, when you think about the portfolio now, and it does seem like folks think we're heading into a downturn in 2023, how do you think each of those segments should perform if the recession unfolds? And maybe give us a little bit of color what you've learned on those businesses as we head into 2023. Frank Clyburn : Yeah. So thanks Mike for the question. A couple of things. As I look at the total portfolio, one would say that overall we feel as though -- and going into a recession, we are very resilient when you look at our portfolio overall. If I start with Nourish, Mike clearly if you think about ingredients in the end markets of food and beverage, we should be very resilient there. Our Flavors segment is a resilient business and then also Food Design. So if you were to exclude some of the near-term challenges that we're talking about from an inventory destocking perspective, we think that our nearest division would be overall very resilient in recessionary times. If I look at the Scent business what is really interesting Mike is that the one area that we have thought would be more of a challenge in a recession would be Fine Fragrance. However, we are seeing really good growth in our Fine Fragrance business this year and our Scent business overall has continued to hang in there very well with overall good strong volume growth. As I look at Health & Biosciences, clearly, we think that holds up very well, also Mike. In particular, if you think about Cultures & Food Enzymes or Home & Personal Care business within Health & Biosciences, we think is a really good business and holds up during a recession. Obviously we've highlighted on this call, the challenges we're seeing in that health segment in the probiotic marketplace, but overall fairly resistant. And then clearly we see pharma as being very resilient in a recessionary period of time. With all of that said, as you mentioned, we do see some challenging headwinds on the horizon. That's something that we are obviously spending time as a team. We'll share much more on our 2023 outlook. But think of the overall business we feel very resilient across our different businesses Mark -- or Mike I should say, and it's something we will clearly spend a lot of time here at Capital Markets Day unpacking even more for you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Sison. The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham, your line is now open. Matt Krueger : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. So I was hoping that we could touch on some of your own internal initiatives here. So what are some of the internal offsets across the business that can counter the tougher macroeconomic backdrop as we cycle into 2023 and into the back half of this year? And what are some of the primary concerns when entering a downturn for the business? Are you already taking actions to offset this? And if so what might those be? Frank Clyburn : Hi. This is Frank. I'll start. And we've highlighted our significant focus this year on our productivity initiatives which have primarily been in our operations group where we focused on our supply chain. We're focusing on really looking at economic profit as a key driver of our choices and decisions in our manufacturing operations group or logistics costs. So I would first start, that we have made really good progress in improved productivity. And I think Glenn highlighted that in his prepared remarks. With that said, as you go into an additional -- or a downturn one of the things that we are now looking at is our total cost base for IFF. So we are looking at ways to think about accelerating productivity beyond our manufacturing operations focus that you've heard us talk about and we highlighted on our second call. That's something that we are going to share much more Capital Markets Day. We do think there are ways to reduce our cost base and accelerate productivity, while also preserving two things. One our investment in innovation and two really also making sure we're continuing to focus on working with our customers to drive growth. So more to come at Capital Markets Day, but we do think we will be able to accelerate productivity as we head into 2023. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Mr. Spector, your line is open. Josh Spector : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you'd discuss the margins in Scent in the quarter. You previously talked about that segment taking much longer to catch-up on price/cost. I believe, prior calls you talked about maybe later next year. I mean, it appears you made a pretty big step-change improvement this quarter. So what happened in third quarter? And does that change any of your expectations for the forward few quarters from here? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Hey, Josh. Good morning. Yeah. We're very pleased by the progress that our Scent business is making. Two things are exhibited in the third quarter trend versus the first half of the year. One is, we are beginning to sort of normalize for price versus inflation. So there was another round of pricing year to sort of catch-up for what's been happening with raw materials. That has been implemented. So it's been extremely helpful relative to the gross margin performance, and we expect that to normalize into the first half of next year. But then secondarily, the team has also undertaken actions to continue to manage their costs very tightly. So you'll notice that their RSNA expenses, also showed improvement from the first half to the third quarter as well. So the team is smartly and on a paced manner implemented pricing maintaining volumes quite well and on top of that taking additional productivity actions to make sure they manage the bottom line, and had a nice currency-neutral year-over-year growth as a result of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Mr. Parkinson, your line is now open. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thanks so much. You kind of hit on a few of these just tangentially your other remarks. I just want to circle back to it. Despite the 3Q result it being solid, it still appears the cost backdrop is still challenging. I understand you want to save a lot for your Analyst Day, but just can you currently just highlight what you're seeing in raws transportation and logistics, and then just also general operating costs just how we should be considering those at least on a preliminary basis entering 2023? Thank you so much. Glenn Richter : Hey, Chris, yeah, relative to logistics costs year-over-year pretty flattish to slightly down. So we've actually seen nice improvement in the global supply chain. As I mentioned previously, raws we still have pressure about half of what we've seen this year. So think about it as sort of high single digit on our total raw material cost. And that's a function of contracts rolling off. It's also a function of certain categories those driven by energy prices continue to see escalation in areas that are being affected by continued war in Ukraine and other global supply chain issues. So call it half of the rate of this year, still meaningful for us to basically go capture. And as a byproduct of that, not only do we need to be smart on our next round of pricing actions, but everything Frank had mentioned around managing our cost structure as a way to sort of offset those pressures as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan, your line is now open. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. I think, I've got a pretty good handle on how your customers \u2013 primary customers are dealing with trade-down among consumers. But specifically, to your business other than -- you mentioned taking pricing in some cases prioritizing pricing over volume presumably to protect margins is what you meant. How do your customers trade down within your portfolio, sort of not innovating or going to a competitor? Are there signs of trade-down? And how is that different in the legacy DuPont businesses, the businesses that are newer to IFF? Because I felt we had a pretty good handle, on how all that worked before 2021. Thank you. Glenn Richter : Well, let me attempt to answer it in a couple of dimensions, Jonathan. Obviously, with the consumer under pressure from inflation, there is a visible movement from branded to private label. So that's happening both in Europe and the US, although more pronounced in Europe. We play across the customers that play in both spaces. So we serve both markets. In general, not all cases, but in general our margins are fairly consistent between branded and private label from the standpoint. So from that standpoint, while the consumer is moving across branded to private label generally, we hold up well relative to the shift of our business. The customer also will look at formulations and how do they think about saving money through reformulations, it's very constant. It actually happens in all environments, but it's more pronounced in this type of environment. So we work very closely with them in terms of helping them, reformulate products basically to take cost out and deliver the same solution for the consumer. The third thing, I would say relative to the behavior of consumer is and this is clearly happening in the marketplace is, while the consumer may still actually stay within branded oftentimes they will reduce dosage. So think about that as sort of less home and personal care products usage, or less fabric softener as an example. So that is another factor that's happening that affects our business, as well as the customers' business. But it may in essence, also result in sort of lower volumes in the marketplace as well. So, hopefully, that's helpful. Frank Clyburn : Yes. The only thing I would add, Jonathan, I think it's important though that we do still continue to see our customers seeing, how important innovation is for the future. So as we engage with them and as Glenn mentioned, some of what we're seeing, some down-trading near-term, et cetera. But the fact is, we are still seeing very high engagement from our customers wanting to work with us, with regards to our pipeline new projects innovation, which we think is going to be very important for the future for us and going forward. So that's something that I just wanted to also make sure that is reinforced. We're not seeing a pullback of customers not wanting to innovate for their future growth. And that's something that we're focused on really helping them to deliver on. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Feeney. Our last question today comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew, your line is now open. Matthew DeYoe : Yes. Excuse me. So I wanted to ask a question on Nourish. Basically -- like basically every $1 you gain in revenue you lost $1 on EBITDA. And that's a fairly sharp downshift in decremental margins from 3Q and maybe a little at odds with the price offsetting raw commentary. So what happened there? And how does that, kind of, set-up for margin progression into 4Q? Glenn Richter : Yes. Matt, one underlying factor relative to the quarter is how we're trying to correct manufacturing volumes to offset the decline in demand in order to address our cash flow and inventory problems. So as a result of that the production volumes in the third quarter for Nourish were dropped even more so than demand. So there's an absorption issue relative to that's hitting the business. So that does affect sort of the marginal flow-through of the dollar if you will. Also quarter-to-quarter there was some inflationary pressures like energy and some other things that were, sort of, not outside of the period per se in terms of kind of the effects. So it's a little bit hard to, sort of, normalize one quarter to another as being, sort of, an apples-to-apples. But the reduction in volumes in order to get our inventories down is a factor that's hitting our business collectively in Q3 and also in Q2. And it's more pronounced in Nourish and H&B we've seen a more pronounced volume decline. So that's a factor in that calculus you cited. Matthew DeYoe : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions waiting at this time. So it's my pleasure to turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn, for closing remarks. Frank Clyburn : So thank you everyone for joining our call. Hopefully, you can see and hear despite some of the near-term challenges, we are extremely excited about the future in front of us with IFF. We look forward to December 7 in our Investor Day in the next couple of weeks where we'll really spend time sharing with you our growth our aspiration from an innovation perspective, how we'll continue to drive productivity to be able to reinvest in the business and why I'm very excited about the future of IFF going forward. So look forward to seeing many of you in New York City on the 7th, and thank you for joining our call. Operator : That concludes the IFF third quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode into the formal Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : [Audio Dip] Frank Clyburn : Good morning to everybody. I want to start today's call by recognizing our teams in the incredible work they've done throughout 2022 to bolster IFF's industry leadership and also to continue delivering innovative solutions for our customers amid the challenging operating environment. As part of our Investor Day in December, we unveiled the next phase of our strategic transformation including our strategic priorities and a refreshed operating model that will better position IFF to drive long-term profitable growth and capitalize on the market opportunities ahead of us. The plan seeks to maximize our competitive advantage and ensure that we are operating as an even more innovative, efficient and disciplined company. As we delivered solid 2022 result and 2023 is in full swing, I\u2019m pleased to share that we are advancing key elements of this plan and excited to update you on today's call. It is a true privilege to work along such talented and dedicated colleagues. Across our global platform, it is clear that our teams are committed to IFF's continued transformation as we delivered unmatched innovation, service and quality in the solutions that meet the needs of our customers, both today and tomorrow. Now on Slide 6, I'd like to reiterate the financial and strategic initiatives central to the strategic refresh that we were discussing during our Investor Day last December. Following an extensive assessment with our key stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders and key partners, we've identified several top priorities that will guide IFF's next chapter. First, we're focused on jump-starting even stronger growth across the business. There's no question that our robust portfolio provides a clear strategic advantage by doubling down on customer excellence and making strategic investments in the opportunities that will reap the greatest returns for our business will be better positioned to drive sustained profitable growth. We have many of the pieces in place to support future growth, a highly diversified offering, serving attractive end markets, global talent and a world-class R&D organization. Our long-term success requires a more disciplined approach to ensure that growth does not come at the cost of profitability. We must deliver on this objective, and we are laser-focused on doing so, particularly amid the macroeconomic pressures we are facing today, it is essential that we target enhanced cost and productivity initiatives. In 2022, we implemented several productivity and cost reduction efforts that have proven effective towards offsetting market challenges. Ultimately, our goal is to realize net annual savings of approximately $350 million to $400 million between 2023 and 2025, including the additional $100 million in run rate savings we announced at our Investor Day to support this reinvestment and increased profitability. Moving forward, we will be disciplined to focus on the areas of our business that will best support our profitable growth, investing in R&D to get projects to market more efficiently, enhancing end-to-end productivity to drive improved costs and processes and further improving our supply chain to be more efficient. An essential component of our value creation plan is our work to simplify our operating model to closely align with our three core end markets : food and beverage, home and personal care and health and become One IFF. This new model will be critical to achieve the goals I just outlined as we enhance our ability to grow profitably through a more customer-centric and market-backed approach. As a result of these efforts, we are building a stronger financial profile for IFF and are targeting sales growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% to 10% on a comparable currency-neutral basis over 2024, 2025 and 2026. We also remain committed to deleveraging our balance sheet below the 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA objective for 2024. Underpinning these efforts will be an intense focus on enhancing our ESG leadership and accelerating our efforts to contribute to a more sustainable world through our operations and initiatives. We will also continue efforts to optimize our portfolio, ensuring we have the offering needed to support future growth while pursuing noncore divestitures like our recent announced sale of our Savory Solutions business to improve our capital structure. Doing so, will allow IFF to reinvest in the high growth areas of our business while ensuring we are operating most efficiently as an organization. Lastly, we continue to take steps to evolve our Board in line with best-in-class governance standards, with plans to reduce the size of our board from 14 to a target of no more than 10 IFF directors and one icon capital designee director by the 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting. With this initiative, we are also focused on the composition of the Board and prioritizing the inclusion of senior executives with the most relevant skills, leadership experience and business expertise needed to support IFF's long-term vision. As you may have seen, we have some additional board changes since our Investor Day where we announced Mark Costa is joining us. I would like to welcome Dawn Willoughby and Gary Hu to our Board as well. I also want to take the opportunity to thank several Board members that have recently come off the board or has been announced and will do so at the annual meeting. We are grateful for the years of tremendous contribution and for all of their hard work and service to IFF. Thank you to Dale Morrison, Michael Ducker, Ilene Gordon and Kare Schultz. In addition, I would like to congratulate Roger Ferguson on his upcoming appointment to the Chair of the Board and look forward to continuing to work together. Moving to Slide 7. I would like to spend a moment highlighting our new strategic framework. This recently introduced framework will be guided by three key pillars : be the premier partner, build our future and become one IFF. Our recently introduced strategic framework is designed to support our mission to do what matters most and drive sustained profitable growth. With our refreshed approach, we have zeroed in on customer excellence, incremental cost reductions, consistent execution and disciplined investments to advance the opportunities with greatest potential returns. This strategy deeply embeds ESG+ priorities across our entire enterprise, strengthening IFF's commitment to positively impact our environmental footprint in the communities in which we operate. With this refreshed strategic framework, we are better positioned to meet evolving customer expectations. We're aligning even more powerfully with our customers while fulfilling our purpose of applying science and creativity for a better world. Now on Slide 8, there are eight key areas that underpin our strategy to advance our growth agenda and pursue cost reduction and enhance our operating plan. Our growth strategy will rely on improvements to our supply chain, enhanced commercial execution, geographic expansion and advantages from harnessing our innovation advantage. As I mentioned, our focus on driving greater productivity and efficiency are equally important to our sustained success. And finally, introducing our end market-driven operating model, strengthening our talent pipeline and culture and improving our digital capabilities will complement our ongoing growth and productivity initiatives to support our long-term strategy. Together, these focus areas will enable us to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders and pursue profitable growth in 2023 and beyond while staying nimble through macroeconomic conditions. Moving to Slide 9. I'd like to review IFF's performance for the full year in which we delivered solid top and bottom line performance despite a very volatile market environment. These results and the progress we've made toward our key operational priorities demonstrate the strength of our global teams, the demand for our offerings and the effectiveness of our productivity initiatives. In 2022, we delivered $12.4 billion in sales, a 9% growth over the previous year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA was approximately $2.5 billion, which equated to comparable currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we were challenged by inflationary pressures over the year, our pricing actions and productivity initiatives helped us to offset and address these challenges over the course of the year. All-in, IFF recovered more than $1 billion in revenue through strategic price increases in 2022. This allowed us to fully offset our raw material, energy and logistics inflation seen throughout the year. We also continue to execute on our productivity agenda where our focus on greater efficiency and the optimization of our supply chain to reduce cost delivering nearly $150 million in productivity benefits in 2022. Aligned with our portfolio optimization initiative, we also successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business and announced the sale of our Savory Solutions business. Together, these transactions will contribute more than $2 billion in gross proceeds to strengthen our capital structure. We will continue to examine our business and explore additional noncore divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to further reduce our debt and direct focus to our core parts of the business. At year-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.1x. While we made progress against our deleveraging target, this will be a priority for us moving forward as we prioritize cash flow generation in 2023. Now on Slide 10, I\u2019m pleased to share that IFF delivered $12.4 billion in revenue for the full year, representing 9% growth in year-over-year currency-neutral sales. Our Nourish business was a major growth driver, though we saw growth across our four divisions in nearly all of our submarkets. I will cover this in a bit more detail in a minute. As expected, foreign currency impacted our results through the year given the significant volatility across the global markets in which we operate. Looking at our overall profitability in 2022 on Slide 11, despite the combination of inflation and global supply challenges, pressuring our profitability margin, IFF delivered 4% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. As I mentioned earlier, the strategic pricing actions taken throughout the year were essential in managing the significant inflation we face. The productivity initiatives we undertaken in 2022 more than offset volume weakness as we deliver nearly $150 million in operational efficiencies, which drove our full year profitability in the challenging operating environment. Moving forward, we'll continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and take the steps in the areas which we can control to ensure we deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our stakeholders. On Slide 12, now our strong performance across business segments showcased the resilience of our portfolio and the underlying dynamics contributing to our overall top line growth. For the full year, Nourish achieved currency-neutral sales growth of 11% compared to the previous year, with $6.8 billion in overall net sales. This was led by double-digit growth in food designs and ingredients as pricing actions and productivity initiatives led to a 5% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. Although, impacted by lower volumes, price increases in Health and Bioscience enabled the business to deliver 4% currency-neutral sales growth in 2022, primarily driven by strong performance across all segments, particularly in culture and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Scent also delivered strong 8% currency neutral growth with total net sales totaling $2.3 billion, led by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and strong single-digit increase in Ingredients and Consumer segments. Pharma Solutions achieved 15% currency-neutral growth driven by demand in our pharma business and mid-single-digit growth in industrial. Due to volume growth and successful results from our pricing and productivity initiatives, Pharma Solutions enhanced profitability and achieved an impressive 25% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. Before turning it over to Glenn, I want to provide a comment around fourth quarter performance. While we anticipated a challenging quarter, the combination of volume deterioration throughout the quarter accelerated in December, as well as its impact on our P&L and negative manufacturing absorption and higher inventories led to a shortfall relative to our expectations. Much of this can be attributed to customer destocking and also softening consumer demand, consistent with what many of our customers have already reported. Nevertheless, as an organization, we need to be better at driving volume growth with our customers, an imperative part of our go-forward strategy. In addition, we will enhance our demand management efforts, process and tools as it relates to inventory management to ensure we are maximizing cash flow generation. I am confident that the addition of new leadership, particularly in Nourish division when our new leaders named and in operations with the recent addition of Ralf Finzel. I have no doubt that through greater commercial execution and more defined processes, we have a lot of opportunity ahead to maximize value creation for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Glenn to provide you an update on fourth quarter results and an overview of business level performance. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Frank. Greetings, everyone. Let me add my apologies for the technical issue. You should have seen we're both sweating. So I'll start off by just reiterating, as Frank mentioned, the financial and operational initiatives we implemented during the year, they have proven valuable in helping buffer the broader economic headwinds. But at the same time, we recognize, while we've taken some important steps, we have not fully delivered against our financial objectives. We recognize we have more room for improvement to realize our goals and create a more profitable organization, and I assure you we continue to be intently focused on this going forward. Looking at fourth quarter results, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales revenue. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales were up 4% for the quarter with growth achieved across nearly all divisions. Our adjusted operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $441 million, and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 5%. As it was significantly impacted by lower volumes more than anticipated, which led to meaningful impact from negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. Because of this, we saw a year-over-year decline of approximately 200 basis points to our adjusted operating EBITDA margin. Despite being partially offset by lower effective tax rate, our Q4 EPS ex amortization was 12% lower due to lower adjusted operating profit. Currency headwinds also present a significant challenge in the quarter with a 7 point adverse impact on sales and an 11 point adverse impact on adjusted operating EBITDA versus the prior year. Encouraging recent trends within the currencies have been promising. Clearly, a difficult market environment has weighed on our performance in the fourth quarter. However, I am confident in the steps that IFF is taking as part of our strategic refresh to create a stronger, more resilient business moving forward. Urgency is key and controlling what we can control is our focus : enhancing sales execution disciplines, continuing to price surgically to offset ongoing inflationary pressures, accelerating and importantly, expanding our productivity efforts and more aggressively managing cash flow. On Slide 14, I want to provide more color on our sales performance in the quarter. In a very difficult operating environment, including strong currency headwinds, we realized 4% comparable currency-neutral sales growth. For the quarter, we saw growth in Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Health and Bioscience, which overlaps strong double-digit growth from prior year, experienced a revenue decline. Factoring the strong year ago comparison, H&B is up 5% on a two-year average in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll go into more detail on the following slides. In the fourth quarter, we also saw a more pronounced slowdown in terms of volumes than we initially expected, down high-single-digits for the quarter, due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. We estimate that about 75% of the drop in volume in Q4 is related to destocking, with the balance coming from softer consumer demand. Turning to Slide 15. The fourth quarter market challenges also significantly affected our margins. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA decreased by 5%, impacted by volume declines, including negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption and currency pressures. However, pricing actions allowed us to recover the total cost of inflation. Additionally, we delivered notable productivity gains and operational efficiencies, which helped offset some of the volume pressures we faced in the market. Now let\u2019s take a look at segment performance on Slide 16. Overall, we saw top line growth across most of our segments in the quarter. Nourish\u2019s solid comparable currency-neutral sales growth of roughly 4% year-over-year was driven by continued growth in Food Design & Ingredients. Health & Bioscience, which saw a 3% decrease in comparable currency-neutral sales delivered solid performance in Animal Nutrition and Cultures and Food Enzymes despite declines in health and grain processing. Both Nourish and Health & Bioscience saves profitability pressures with 11% decline in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA across both due to lower volumes. Our Scent division performed particularly well in the quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year sales growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis that was supported by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and mid-single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. We were also encouraged by since 25% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to a combination of favorable product mix, to catch up in pricing to raw material costs and productivity gains. Our Pharma Solutions segment again delivered excellent performance in the quarter, totaling $221 million in sales, a 15% increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in our core pharma business. However, like Nourish and H&B, price increases and productivity were more than offset by lower volumes and higher energy costs. Moving to Slide 17. I would like to provide some additional commentary on our free cash flow dynamics in the year and the progress towards our deleveraging targets. For the full year 2022, cash flow from operations totaled $345 million, while 2022 CapEx was $504 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. Our free cash flow for the full year was candidly disappointing at a negative $159 million. Our free cash flow included about $300 million of costs related to integration and transaction-related items. As we discussed in last quarter\u2019s call, our free cash flow for the year has been significantly impacted by growth in working capital, predominantly by higher inventories caused by inflation, demand slowdown and destocking by our customers. Our priority, as Frank mentioned in 2023 is to take significant actions to improve net working capital with a major focus on inventories to drive cash flow. Accordingly, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain teams, including systems and process enhancements to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. And while we understand that this will result in negative manufacturing absorption, adversely impacting the P&L in the short-term, we are prioritizing improved working capital to maximize cash flow results. To keep you with our commitment to return value to our shareholders, we also paid out $810 million in dividends in 2022. As I mentioned during our Investor Day, we are committed to continuing to grow the dividend and will balance dividend growth as we consider reinstituting our share repurchase program once we get debt below 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA. In terms of leverage, we remain focused on efforts to reduce our debt and finish 2022 at 4.1x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $535 million, including $52 million of assets currently in assets held for sale, while gross debt for the year totaled $11 billion. As part of our strategic priorities, we remain committed to achieving our deleveraging target of 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA by 2024, including through deploying proceeds from completed divestitures. Importantly, as Frank mentioned, we will be exploring further opportunities to streamline our portfolio while dedicating resources to our highest growth businesses. Turning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 18. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $12.5 billion and adjusted operating EBITDA to be approximately $2.34 billion, representing comparable currency-neutral sales growth of approximately 6% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA flat versus prior year. We expect year-over-year foreign exchange to have no impact to sales growth and have a modest or approximately 1% negative impact to operating EBITDA growth. Let\u2019s move to Slide 19. Given the number of moving parts affecting our 2023 outlook, we thought it would be helpful to unpack each of the components impacting year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted portfolio, which includes the Health Wright Products acquisition, the 2022 sale of the Microbial Control business and the anticipated close of our Savory Solutions divestiture in May of this year, comparable 2022 EBITDA starts at $2.37 billion. As previously mentioned, we expect full year pricing to fully offset inflation with a net zero EBITDA impact in the year. In our plan, we\u2019ve assumed volume will be flat with high-single-digit negative volumes in Q1, modestly down in Q2 and volume growth in the second half. In addition, we are anticipating mix to be slightly unfavorable for the year as we expect some of our higher margin categories will experience volume pressure, particularly in the first half of 2023. In order to rebalance our inventories and with driving cash flow generation as an imperative for us this year, we anticipate negative manufacturing absorption will impact us significantly. Specifically, we expect that our actions to reduce inventory will adversely impact our adjusted EBITDA growth by several percentage points expressed in year-over-year growth terms. We anticipate that this will yield a strong improvement in inventories and be a core driver to our targeted 2023 adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding costs related to restructuring and deal-related items. In terms of cost savings, we plan to drive significant productivity by accelerating our previous launch programs, which focus on end-to-end operations improvements, supply chain efficiencies, procurement and demand management, we are also undertaking additional actions to cut costs across the organization and reduce our overall spend where possible, including in our D&A line. We anticipate that these additional actions to deliver an annualized run rate savings of $100 million. We will also be reinvesting some of our productivity to drive our top line through strategic growth initiatives, specifically in R&D, our commercial teams and technology as we begin executing our long-term strategy. Finally, we expect currency to have a modest year-over-year negative impact on EBITDA growth of approximately 1%. As mentioned in terms of the cadence throughout the year, we are anticipating the first half to be more challenging, particularly the first quarter, with a back half improvement. In particular, we expect first quarter comparable performance to be impacted by more challenging volume conditions offset by pricing benefits. For the quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $470 million to $490 million. As I conclude on the next slide, I want to highlight our four key areas of focus for 2023 and provide further perspectives relative to our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to accelerating sales growth as we move through 2023. While we do expect volumes to be under pressure from the items I discussed earlier, we are sharpening our sales execution discipline and continue to be more surgical with our pricing actions with the goal of progressively improving throughout the year. The build-out of the commercial excellence team, targeted growth investments and increasing our focus on revenue synergies will allow us to capture new wins. Second, as previously outlined, we are focused on enhancing our customer service levels and supply chain efficiencies. With this in mind, we will be setting more granular customer service and related inventory goals by business utilizing our ROIC framework to guide those goals. Supporting these efforts, we will be rolling out our redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Third, as mentioned, we are determined to accelerate our synergy and productivity efforts this year as well. For your reference, included in our 2023 guidance, we are targeting more than $200 million of gross cost reductions from productivity and restructuring benefits. Fourth, and very importantly, we\u2019re intently focused on maximizing our cash flow and accelerating deleverage of our balance sheet. We are being extremely aggressive in managing our working capital through a heightened focus and improved processes and systems, and we are also actively working to complete our additional non-core divestitures and evaluating additional portfolio opportunities. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Glenn. Before I open the call for questions, I want to take a moment to reflect on what has continued to make IFF a strong, resilient organization and a category defined leader in our industry. I joined IFF almost a year ago and in an important moment in the company\u2019s transformation and while our global business sought to navigate an incredibly complex operating environment. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, what attracted me to IFF was its enterprise-wide purpose to apply science and creativity for a better world. Since then, I have seen this purpose serve as a guiding light as we have continued to build out our teams, expanded in new markets and strengthen our innovation portfolio and pipeline together. In 2022, we have executed tough pricing actions, rolled out new productivity initiatives and found successful ways to optimize and streamline our portfolio. So we\u2019re investing in areas that will generate growth, enhance our profits and reduce our debt. Most significantly, we have unveiled our refreshed growth strategy and our focus on carrying out those initiatives to ensure we are delivering for our customers while also creating strong returns and sustained profitable growth into the future. Our teams here at IFF have rallied to meet the challenges in front of us, and I\u2019m confident in our future heading into 2023 and beyond, especially based on the excellent reception from all of our stakeholders following the announcement of our strategic refresh in December. Although, we entered 2023 with a cautiously optimistic outlook, I am confident that we have the strategy and the people to address any challenge and deliver long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. IFF continues to play an essential role in the daily lives of so many people around the world, and I\u2019m energized by the unique opportunity in front of us. IFF has built an incredible foundation as a trusted partner with world-class talent, a robust R&D pipeline, broad portfolio, and I\u2019m confident that our refreshed strategic framework and new operating model will allow IFF to increase our customer centricity, more closely align with today\u2019s marketplace and deliver most efficiently for our customers around the world. With that, I would like to now open the call up for questions. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. You may proceed. Heidi Vesterinen : Good morning, everyone. So the first question, why should we believe your full year guidance if you\u2019re having to downgrade guidance by such a magnitude in a space of two months? And then I have a separate question on portfolio moves, if I can squeeze another. Are there now more options for you now that it\u2019s been two years since the DuPont merger? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Heidi, it\u2019s Frank, and thanks for the question, and it\u2019s really an important one. One, we did provide in our Capital Markets Day a preliminary view into 2023. With that said, I think we all feel that we own some of which you\u2019ve mentioned maybe the change. And let me unpack what has happened and especially in Q4. As we went through Q4, Heidi, we had assumed that we would have mid-single-digit volume decline. And as you saw now our full quarter four results, we ended up having growth of 4% overall, but we saw high-single-digit volume decline. We saw that change really accelerate the decline in the month of December, in particular, Heidi. I had spoken about what we were seeing in the Health North America Probiotic business, also parts of our Nourish business, Ingredients and Protein Solutions. And in fact, in the month of December, we did see many of those businesses have double-digit volume decline primarily due to destocking. There is some end market demand impact as well. So when we saw the volume changes in particular that came through in December as well as the impact that it had on our manufacturing cost and absorption, we felt as though we had to really take a look into 2023, obviously, as we\u2019re coming out now to guide. As I look at the trends in January, they are continuing to be very similar, Heidi, to what we saw in December. So when we think of the first quarter, especially against our first quarter comparison where we grew last year 5%, we have made the assumption that this is going to be a challenging first quarter, similar trends as what we have seen in Q4. And then as we get into the first half of the year, we also continue to see challenges from inflation and other pressures. We do see growth in the back half of the year. But when we look at it overall, we see the year having pretty much flattish volume year-over-year, Heidi, but we also feel good about our 6% overall sales growth. When we look at the entirety of the P&L, we also feel it\u2019s really important as you heard from Glenn to focus on cash flow. So one of the things that we\u2019re going to be doing is focusing on reducing our inventory to improve cash flow that is going to have a several percentage point impact on our EBITDA profit growth. We think that\u2019s the right thing to do. And then also as we continue to look at the volume dynamics, we clearly are going to continue to focus on everything we can to control our cost. We have announced accelerating our productivity program, and you heard that from Glenn, and we talked about that at Capital Markets Day. In addition to that, we are instituting a much stronger S&OP process that\u2019s going to be co-led with Ralf Finzel, our new Head of Operations. We have a new Head of Procurement that\u2019s come in, and Glenn\u2019s going to help to co-lead that team, and that team is going to meet on a weekly basis. Also, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our customers by improving our key account management activity and also continuing to invest in R&D to make sure that we have the innovation needed as things improve as we get in particular towards the back half of the year and as we head into 2024. So we feel confident in the guidance, Heidi, we think it\u2019s prudent and we felt as though it was the right thing to do based on what we saw the trends in the fourth quarter, in particular in the month of December. Your second question, I\u2019m sorry, real quick. Yes, Heidi. The Reverse Morris Trust now in February is \u2013 allows us to look at the entire portfolio that work is underway, Heidi, and we will, as we discussed on Capital Markets Day, continue to look at the entire portfolio to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing for our shareholders as well as making strategic decisions to benefit our customers and to drive profitable growth. Heidi Vesterinen : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. You may proceed. Gunther Zechmann : Hi. Good morning. I\u2019ve got one for Glenn please, if I can. Glenn, could you help us reconcile what the difference is between the $600 million of the adjusted free cash that you disclosed? And we actually ended up, which is essentially flat. And then going on from that, can you talk us through the drivers for improvement in 2023? How confident are you? And I\u2019m thinking about the $1.5 billion free cash that you outlined at the CMD in December last year, please? Glenn Richter : Yes. Thanks, Gunther. So first of all, to reconcile for 2022, our GAAP free cash flow was negative $160 million. We had approximately $300 million of deal-related integration restructure. So on a like-for-like adjusted basis, that\u2019s roughly $150 million positive versus the $600 million. So the $450 million difference we had communicated last year \u2013 the largest by far is working capital. We were $300 million higher on working capital for the year. The inventory of that driven by higher inventories, the total increase in working capital was nearly $1.1 billion for the full year. So it was a significant drain on our cash flow. We also \u2013 the earnings were shorter than we had anticipated, and there were some miscellaneous items, but the largest by far is working capital, which then goes to your question regarding 2023. The big swing for 2023 is largely going to be driven by the working capital area of focus where it was a use of $1 billion plus last year. We expect it to be neutral to slightly positive. The biggest focus there is obviously within the inventories, which is the biggest component of our working capital, and that decision to focus on generating $1 billion plus of adjusted free cash flow will put some pressure on the P&L. So we\u2019re taking a hit for some negative absorption and fixed costs because volumes actually will be lower than sales. So we actually can have a decline of year-over-year production volumes, negative absorption. But basically, that is the big driver. Cash interest, cash taxes, CapEx largely will be flattish year-over-year, but the biggest difference by far is the focus on our working capital and namely inventories. Gunther Zechmann : Got it. If I could just follow up a quick one. How much of the inventory reduction would be driven by lower pricing from raw materials? And how much room left to participate? Glenn Richter : Yes. Good question. We\u2019re anticipating $350 million to $400 million of reduction from volume and about $150 million increase in price. So think about that as basically, I\u2019ll call it roughly $200 million-ish of reduction of absolute inventory, which is $150 million increase in price and about a $300 million increase \u2013 or decrease or so driven by volumes. Gunther Zechmann : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Glenn Richter : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Mike, your line is now open. Mike Sison : Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Glenn Richter : We can. Frank Clyburn : Yes, Mike. Mike Sison : Yes. Sorry about that. Given recent commentary from consumer products companies, your peers, any insight into your performance in North America and China, both look notably weak relative to some of these comments. Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes, Mike, I\u2019ll take this one. It\u2019s Frank. For China, for the quarter, we did see sales down approximately 4%, Mike. So you\u2019re absolutely right. It was another tough quarter in China as we continue to manage overall the lockdowns and then the reopenings and then some of the COVID impacts that we\u2019re seeing throughout China. So China is still, for us, is a cautious, I would say, market. And as you are well aware, that is our second largest market. So that\u2019s something that we are really continuing to work with our teams there. If you look at North America, you see a little bit of a tail of a couple of different stories. Mike, for the full year, we did grow 5% in North America, but we did see an impact in Q4 of 4% decline versus prior year. And that really speaks to what we saw overall of the impact it\u2019s had in particular in Nourish, which was down approximately 4%. And then also, we saw the significant reduction in North America in the Health Probiotic business that I\u2019ve mentioned, and that actually had H&B down in North America as well. So those are the two, I would say, dynamics in both China and in North America and in particular, North America, I would say more to destocking as we saw a big hit as we\u2019ve been discussing here in Q4. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. You may proceed. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just thinking about raw material inflation specifically, I guess, first, what\u2019s your assumption on the percent increase for this year? And I guess if I look at fourth quarter and how you\u2019re talking about first quarter, your top line is kind of the same. So your pricing is better. Fourth quarter, you saw some positive price cost dynamics. I guess why aren\u2019t we seeing that in 2023? And what are the things we need to watch for in terms of better or worse inflation? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. Josh, good question. So let me unpack the roughly 6% inflation expectation for this year. That\u2019s about 70% raws and zero logistics and the residual 30% energy. Energy, by the way, is highly volatile. So that generally is moving more favorable than when we put the plan together, although an awful lot of our energy pricing is now through surcharges. So we\u2019re sort of hedged one way or the other relative to that. So I\u2019ll focus on the 70%. The other thing I would note that remember the first quarter will be impacted by the inventories from last year. So sort of what hits relative to our cost structure is really already baked into sort of what\u2019s sitting in the plants to some extent. We are expecting actually fairly ratable i.e. price equals costs pretty much quarter-to-quarter relatively neutral. So we\u2019re not expecting any sort of big upside or downside. And part of that\u2019s the pacing of the inventories as well. I would say that we are seeing some early signs of deflation on the raw side. However, there are certain commodities that actually have seen more increases, but I would say that you could maybe be a little cautiously optimistic that we probably have seen the peak of inflation in raws and the back half of the year may be experiencing maybe some deflation, which will be favorable for the business. In general, our pricing is pretty much locked in for the year. Most of our pricing is beginning of the year or contractually based on indices that are tracked. So I think the pricing dynamic, the pricing risk is not as significant relative to what\u2019s locked in. Of course, if there\u2019s a rapid level of deflation in the second half of the year, we would adopt relative to our customer dialogues and pricing actions against that. But I would say I\u2019d have a slight lean towards a little more optimism in terms of the price/cost dynamic this year versus last year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. You may proceed. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Given that it\u2019s clear that consumer is exhibiting greater elasticity, just given the extent of price increases, a lot of your CPG customers have been instituting. Frank, just based on your direct conversations with customers, do you sense that there will be a change in their price or volume strategy as we push further into 2023? And just your sense as to how the elasticity dynamic varies globally? Frank Clyburn : Yes. Ghansham, thanks for the question. We do anticipate just as you think about what we saw in Q4 to continue as I mentioned, in Q1. The elasticity question is a really important one. I would say that most of what we are seeing and in discussions with customers, you\u2019re seeing some trade down with regards to quantities. You are seeing some trade down to private label, but it\u2019s not significant. I mean it\u2019s in different parts of the world. I think you\u2019re seeing more price elasticity honestly, in some of the Asian markets, where clearly, you\u2019re seeing some trade-offs there. But overall, we\u2019re not seeing significant trade-offs at this time. With that said, many of our customers are expecting, and I think you\u2019ve seen some of them announce that it\u2019s going to be likely a continued challenging first half of the year from a volume perspective. They are continuing to increase prices and I think that\u2019s going to continue as well for the foreseeable future. So that\u2019s at least at this point in time, how I kind of see the elasticity question. We\u2019re seeing some in Europe, one last geography I would mention, but nothing significant to really point to in other geographies. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. You may proceed. John Roberts : This is probably for Glenn, so I\u2019ll just ask them together. Frank, I assume you\u2019re still interim head of Nourish. Can we get an update on that process? And did less new wins or a slowdown in new products contribute to the lower volume in Nourish? And then, Glenn, I have in my notes that there were two other small divestments expected to be announced by the end of this quarter, I think, totaling about $300 million in gross proceeds. Is that still the case? And you didn\u2019t provide EPS guidance. So could you talk about how EPS dilution or accretion could play out as the deals close through the year? Frank Clyburn : John, it\u2019s Frank. I\u2019ll get started. So one, no, we do not think that the volume declines are specific to any transition in Nourish. I think they\u2019re much more market-driven as we\u2019ve been discussing around destocking. And in fact, in our Flavors business, which is one of our most important businesses. I think we\u2019ve honing very well versus competition. As far as the process, I am working very urgently, John, to get that position filled and my hope is to be able to announce something very shortly on who will be leading theirs going forward. Glenn? Glenn Richter : Thanks. Good morning, John. So just a reminder, a year ago, we had talked about four transactions in total with a probability of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in gross proceeds. We announced the largest of those transactions in Savory Solutions, which will be over $900 million of gross proceeds in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ve mentioned we have two other sort of in the near window. We do believe one of them circa $200 million more likely than that. It\u2019s not final will be announced within the quarter. The other two deals, which are relatively small, we are putting on hold. The reason is we are, at this point, actually taking a more comprehensive review of our portfolio and want to focus on sort of what makes sense sort of longer term relative to the overall portfolio. So our efforts are really against the larger portfolio opportunities at this point versus the residual. But I do anticipate between the Savory Solutions and the latest probably $1.1 billion-ish or more of gross proceeds. Relative to full year EPS ex amor, it\u2019s likely to be down circa 15% that\u2019s really driven by the dynamics of the first quarter versus prior year. For the balance of the year, it will be flat to modestly up for the last three quarters of the year. Thanks, John. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. David Begleiter : Frank, with the change in the 2023 guidance relative to the IR Day, does this change your expectations the 2024 to 2026 period in terms of 4% to 6% sales growth and 8% to 10% EBITDA growth. And just on the productivity program, I know you\u2019re looking to accelerate it. Any plans potentially to expand it as well? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes, David, thanks for the question. So the answer is we\u2019re still sticking with what we talked about at Capital Markets Day, the 4% to 6% top line growth, 8% to 10% EBITDA growth over the 2024 to 2026 time frame. If you take actually a two-year look back, David, which I did \u2013 our business grew approximately volume about 3%. So if you recall, we're in a market that is 2% to 3% in more normal conditions, which obviously, we're all looking forward to those coming back. But we still believe that profile that we put forward at this point in time is achievable for Capital Markets Day. And we are accelerating productivity, as we've mentioned, we are bringing forward cost reductions this year. Nothing else additional to announce at this point in time. But obviously, myself, the management team, especially during some of the challenging macro environment we talked about, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive additional productivity as we go forward, but nothing additional than what we've already shared. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. You may proceed. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to follow up on an earlier question and ask a related question. So it just seems from the outside perhaps that this business could be too big an unwieldly to run effectively and efficiently. What would you have to see and by when would you consider a more larger scale divestiture \u2013 divestitures to essentially shrink and deemphasize some of the acquisitions, which have been made. And related to that, recent volume trends have been pretty consistently below peers last year, year before, et cetera. So what is that attributable, and when should investors expect IFF to at least grow in line with the peer group? And how do we measure that? Frank Clyburn : Yes, I'll get started, Mark. I think the volume question is a fair one, but let me look at the portfolio from a couple of different lenses. In our Scent business, we feel as though our volumes are very comparable to peers and the competitors. In fact, there are some instances, I think where we're even gaining share in parts of the Scent business, and we saw very strong volume growth in Fine Fragrance as an example. In Health and Biosciences, Mark, we clearly see good performance in food and culture enzymes. We feel as though we're very competitive in home and personal care. What you're really seeing is the dynamic and the impact on that business is really within health. And we've talked a lot about the shift and change in market demand as well as destocking, but we think overall, our H&B business is very important for the future, but there are some clear volume challenges in that one segment with good growth in other parts of that business. If you come to Nourish, in Nourish we are very competitive. If you look on a two-year basis, Mark, because you have to take into account, we had a very strong volume growth in 2021. But two-year basis, Flavors is growing approximately 5%. So we feel as though we're in very good position within that business. I think the question really volume-wise is within the ingredients business, and we've spoken about. We were capacity constrained in some of those businesses, which impacted some of our volume opportunities. And then we were very aggressive on pricing and made some trade-offs to preserve margin in that business, and we did probably see some share loss within the Ingredient segment, in particular Protein Solutions. So I think overall, Mark, to your broader question, we feel as though the portfolio is the right one. We hear from our customers and in fact, many of our team was down at ACI, just this \u2013 or last week a lot of excitement about the innovation, a lot of excitement about our portfolio. But the proof will be we've got to execute against it, like I mentioned at Capital Markets Day, and that is our focus. We are going to continue to obviously, as Glenn mentioned, we'll get the entirety of the portfolio to make sure that it works strategically and also achieves our other objectives of driving profitable growth. But we feel as though the portfolio overall is the right one. And now we're focused on executing as we've been discussing. Glenn Richter : And Mark, I'd add a couple of other items to the Frank's point is, lots of benefits across the portfolio. A lot of our work is on aligning and integrating and maximizing the portfolio. So aligning against three divisions, customer-backed, making sure that we have all the sales and operating teams focusing on the revenue synergies across the how systems work relative to advancing that is important. And then on the simplification of the portfolio, Microbial Controls exit, Savory Solutions. These are businesses that add a lot of complexity. Savory as an example, is a business that has 16,000 customers, 8 different businesses for the ERPs. And to Frank's point, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and what they may be less core to the overall portfolio as we go forward to continue to simplify as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Adam Samuelson : Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to \u2013 Frank, you referenced in an earlier response kind of 2024 kind of still thinking growth could get back in that high single-digit range. I just want to maybe unpack that a little bit in the context of 2023, where it would seem like one of the bigger deltas obviously, volume is not growing, but there's a pretty significant cost under absorption issue as you worked on inventories and presumably, that's weighted in the P&L in the first half of the year. If you're going to 2024, and we presume that there's some growth in the underlying market and your working capital inventories are in a better position, why would we not have faster growth in 2024 on an earnings basis if we're lapping pretty significant under-absorption charges this year. Frank Clyburn : Yes. And I'll just start. I think I will hold any additional comments on 2024. I think you're right. It's a short-term impact that will be on the P&L, as you've mentioned, as we work down our inventories and have additional absorption, I think we need to really focus right now on 2023. Like I said, we have a guidance that's out there for 2024 to 2026 and in that 8% to 10% range. I think at this point in time, I'd like to hold it there for now and let us work through 2023 and come back to you, okay? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. You may proceed. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning and thank you. So it seems like over the past decade, IFF enjoyed this ability to price and have good visibility regardless of the cost cycle. And it just seems lately \u2013 and when there were problems that was internal, it was getting the disciplines in place and awareness in place. You look at some of these more recently acquired businesses, it just feels like maybe they were always less sustainable margins and more volatility in terms of just they're more opaque, particularly some of the businesses that saw the volume variances this quarter. So how would you comment on that? And is this kind of volatility in both margins and volume maybe more of a new normal? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes, this is Glenn, Jonathan. Relative to the first part of your question, clearly, in the last now 18 months, we have significantly improved the discipline, awareness and processes relative to pricing from tools and cross-training to best practices, to much, much surgical application by customer geography, et cetera. And I think that is here to stay in terms of optimizing the business going forward. Not all segments and regions are created equal. Some have greater ability to price than others and some geographies such as Greater Asia, in general, are more competitive, particularly in this environment. So we're being very, very thoughtful. In general, I would say that the N&B portfolio is about equivalency to the F&F portfolio relative to pricing capabilities or ability to pass through pricing, some of the ingredients portfolio are a little more difficult just given slightly more commoditized nature of this businesses. But I do not think there's really a significant difference in what we've seen from an execution standpoint between the legacy IFF and the legacy DuPont businesses and would again iterate that we've done a lot to actually tremendously sort of advance our capabilities to basically be much, much smarter and surgical in our pricing capabilities. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. You may proceed. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. Just going back to the portfolio optimization comment a couple of questions ago, you had a very helpful slide in your Analyst Day, I think Slide 12 of Frank's presentation about optimizing some of the underperformers. You mentioned Protein Solutions. I would love to get a little bit more color there on how you see that progressing throughout the year and what's embedded in your assumptions and then perhaps multipliers as well. And then on the positives, any update on Food Design ex Savory? Thank you so much. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Thanks for the question. And as we go in \u2013 as we were communicating on that framework, and remember, it is a framework. What sits in that 20% is really we're going to look at it from two different lenses. One, and you mentioned Protein Solutions and you have some of your specialty proteins, your value proteins that are going into meat alternative products. We're going to continue to look at that business right now. We see it as an important part of our overall offering that we bring to customers because that's oftentimes an entry point in the customers for driving some of our flavor opportunity and other opportunities in the portfolio. With that said, from an ROIC lens, we'll continue to look at it and look at ways to improve the profile of that business. Food designs ex Savory, we see also as an important part of the portfolio going forward. This is all like I said, aligned around our whole Nourish offerings. And if you think about where we're going to really shift to more of an end market focus, in particular around food and beverage, we think that business can really help us to bring a lot of integrated solutions and opportunities to customers going forward. So that's how I would answer it. And we are, though, continuing to stare our portfolio in its entirety through that ROIC lens to make sure we're making the right portfolio choices and putting our resources against the winners that you see on that slide as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. I think during 2022, when you thought about raw materials and price, what you thought is that raw materials were worse than price in 2021 by $200 million, you'd be roughly even in 2023 \u2013 in 2022. And then in 2023, you would be $200 million to the good in the price raw material balance. And now you think that you'll be about flat with inflation. So what happened? That is why did you think you'd make $200 million, but you didn't \u2013 what happened to, I assume, price conditions? And second, what are the cash restructuring outlays \u2013 outflows that you expect in 2023? Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey, thanks, Jeff. Good morning. Good question. So you already harken back a year ago, which seems like a decade ago, we originally had $600 million of inflation, pricing/inflation embedded. What happened is two additional rounds of inflation. So we had another $400 million last year, and we have circa $600 million-ish plus in this year. So there's a lag effect. So we're sort of kind of just running through the cycle from a kind of a timing standpoint and standpoint. We haven't sort of talked about sort of how this flows through the 2024, but I think it's reasonable to assume either a combination of stabilization and some deflation in the environment. On the back end, we will pick it up. So I think that's still a very reasonable assumption over the time horizon. The horizons just extended because there's been more sort of systemic inflation over the last few years than we anticipated at that point in time. Relative, we have \u2013 as Frank had mentioned, we have an incremental cost productivity program of $100 million targeted. We expect to get probably circa $70 million of that to hit the P&L this year. We're estimating around $70 million-ish to $75 million of onetime expenses associated with that restructuring. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. You may proceed. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. We covered a lot. So I guess I have a couple of questions still. But I guess, primarily, when we think about 2023, I think, Frank, Glenn, the three of us have discussed it being a transition year, and there's a lot of things that you laid out on kind of what you want the business to look like as you hit 2024. But now you're talking about not just the curtailing production, but also accelerating cost savings going after G&A and so on. So to what degree do you think \u2013 should we worry about you being able to manage through the cash flow situation kind of shoring up working capital and making these short-term changes you need to make, but still being able to fully execute and get to where you need to be so that this can be the transition year that you discussed it being? Frank Clyburn : Yes, Lauren, I'll \u2013 good start. Thanks for that question. I think \u2013 it's a really great question, an important one. What we've done on is we're really focused on really prioritizing our activities across the company and the management team. First priority, Lauren, is clearly doing everything we can to make sure that we do have the right investments in the innovation that we deliver, in R&D and also making sure we can accelerate our sales performance, and we are spending a lot of time with our commercial teams, working on ensuring good capability build and making sure that we are ready to enhance our pipeline as well as our win rate going forward. So that's priority one, Lauren, and that's a big focus for us. On the cash flow and inventory work, I think we're in a good position. We brought in a new team. Glenn is going to be very intimately involved with our new Head of Operations and our business leaders. We are going to build that into our incentive system, cash conversion this year, Lauren, and we feel as though there is a very good path forward to deliver the short-term because we have to improve our cash flow, and we have to reduce our inventory, and we have a laser focus on making that happen. And I feel like we've got the right team and we're putting in place the right processes to execute against that. That's pretty much number two. And then number three, we are working towards, as you mentioned, getting the organization aligned to more of an end market back view. We are starting that work. We'll have more to communicate here as we go throughout the year. But I feel good by the end of this year, that alignment will be in place and we have the right people, right teams align with our customers. Just one anecdote. Many of our customers that I've spoken to as well as that we've engaged with really like the way we're thinking about operating and aligning IFF to how they're organized. So we think that is something we will focus on. So while there are a lot of activities, think of it three laser-focused priorities the team are aligning behind, Lauren, to execute to your point, to make sure that we can deliver on the future profitable growth agenda that we have, okay. So thank you. Operator : Thank you. Frank Clyburn : With that, I want first \u2013 I want to \u2013 yes. Just a couple of last comments, I want to first, thank everyone for joining. Our apologies again on our start. We appreciate everyone hanging in with us. We know this went a little bit longer because of that and we look forward to seeing you here and speaking to you very soon. Thank you, everybody. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. DeVeau, you may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a minute to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thanks, Mike. And hello, everyone. We delivered first quarter 2023 results in line or ahead of our expectations amidst a challenging operating environment. Our team successfully navigated soft end market demand and customer inventory destocking as they executed on our priorities to deliver on our financial commitments. We are proud of the results and want to thank the entire IFF team for their contribution. However, year-on-year comparisons in a number of areas showed the backdrop in which we are operating remains challenging as I acknowledged on our last call. As you will see from our quarterly financials, we have made solid progress on our objectives of reducing costs to improve efficiency, recovering inflation and materially reducing our inventories while improving our service levels to our customers. The key challenge remains volume growth and our management team remains keenly focused on accelerating profitable sales growth moving forward. Before I get into our first quarter performance, I do want to share an update on our search for our Nourish President. Over the past several months, we have engaged with various leaders about the opportunity to run our largest division. At this time, our search continues as we are looking to attract a well-regarded leader with a strong track record of success that can drive performance in this division. I am pleased with the slate of candidates that we have and look forward to welcoming a new leader in due course. We will provide further updates going forward as we progress the process. Starting on slide 6, I'd like to begin with a high level look at our performance in the quarter before handing it over to Glenn to discuss our financials and full year outlook in more detail. In quarter one, IFF generated $3 billion in sales, which reflects 1% comparable currency neutral growth, led by increases in Scent and Pharma Solutions. As we expected, volumes in the first quarter, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2022, remained under pressure, down high single digits due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. It should be noted that we are also comparing to our strongest year ago comparison, where our volume grew mid- single digits in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating EBITDA finished at $503 million in the first quarter of 2023 and largely was impacted by the lower volumes as well as our proactive effort to rebalance inventories to drive cash flow generation. As we shared earlier this year, we are executing our inventory reduction program making strong progress in the first quarter, as expected while it was cash flow positive, it did lead to a significant headwind in terms of profitability as our fixed costs were absorbed over reduced manufacturing volumes, which represented approximately a 15 percentage point year-over-year impact. At the same time, we were successfully recovering our total inflation through increased pricing actions in the first quarter and executed on our internal productivity initiatives that continue to deliver strong cost and operational efficiencies. From a leverage perspective, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 4.6x. As we disclosed earlier in the quarter, we have proactively renegotiated our debt covenants to ensure IFF's continued resilience as we navigate today's complex global macroeconomic environment. These amended agreements will provide us with maximum flexibility as we grow our business and continue to optimize our portfolio to achieve our target profile. To this end, we continue to deliver on our portfolio optimization commitments. Our Savory Solutions divestiture is now on track to close at the end of May. In February, we also announced the sale of our Flavor Specialty Ingredients business to UK based private firm Exponent for $220 million in cash proceeds, which will be used for debt repayment. We expect that this transaction will close by the end of the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. Moving forward, portfolio divestitures remain a central part of our strategy, and we are evaluating several opportunities to further strengthen our capital structure as we drive towards our targeted leverage profile. Turning to slide 7, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our sales performance in the quarter. As I mentioned, we delivered more than $3 billion in sales in the first quarter, which represents comparable currency neutral sales growth of 1%. Our revenue growth in the first quarter was led by continued strength in our Scent business and steady performance in Pharma Solutions. In a moment, Glenn will take you through the underlying factors driving the performance across our business segments. But first, it's important I provide high level context on what we are seeing in the environment. Scent once again delivered a strong performance, both fine fragrance and consumer fragrance grew double digits. Our Pharma Solutions segment also delivered solid growth, driven once again by a strong performance in core form. Nourish was flat this quarter as our ingredients business continued to be pressured by macroeconomic factors and destocking, which offset growth in Flavors and Food Design. While certain businesses within our Health and Biosciences segment were also challenged this quarter. Cultures and Food Enzymes and Home and Personal Care were two strong performers in H&B that we expect will continue to gain share throughout the year. Taking a step back and reflecting on our performance, there are essentially a handful of categories that have disproportionately impact our volume performance, specifically with our Nourish segment, our Ingredients division, which represents approximately 25% of total company sales and includes Protein Solutions, Emulsifiers and Sweeteners, core texturants, cellulosics and food protection, drove about 60% of our total volume decline in the quarter. As we outlined at our December Investor Day, we are working to improve our performance and have largely addressed our capacity issues and have improved our service levels in these businesses. We are now working on modifying our pricing strategies, enhancing our commercial coverage and simplifying our internal processes, all to grow our project pipeline and deliver more robust growth going forward. And while this will take time and attention, we are doing so with a sense of urgency to ensure that when current market challenges like destocking subside, we are well positioned to capture market share. Looking at our profitability for this quarter on slide 8, first quarter adjusted operating EBITDA total $503 million, down 19% on a year-over-year comparable currency neutral basis as expected. As I shared on our last call, lower volumes related to consumer demand softness and significant customer inventory destocking. Plus unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program meaningfully impacted our profitability despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. We were successful in generating approximately $60 million of gross productivity gains in the first quarter. However, this strong benefit was offset by higher manufacturing related costs, such as lower yields, slower obsolete inventory, and higher manufacturing inflation. If we look at our profitability performance, absence of the unfavorable manufacturing absorption, comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined approximately 4%. Looking ahead, we remain intensely focus on controlling our controllables, including identifying additional opportunities to further optimize our operations and strengthen our balance sheet. While we certainly have work to do to fully execute on our refreshed strategic plan, we have taken significant action to ensure our business maintains its flexibility and resilience needed to deliver in any macroeconomic environment. While we do believe 2023 will continue to be impacted by many of these factors, and depending on an improving volume environment the back after the year, we continue to believe we can deliver our long -\u2060term adjusted operating EBITDA growth target of 8% to 10% on a comparable, currency neutral basis over the \u201824 to \u201826 time period. I'll now turn it over to Glenn to provide more context around our divisional performance, cash flow, and financial outlook going forward. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Frank, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Turning now to slide 9, let me review our first quarter performance across each of our four business segments. In Nourish, sales were flat on a comparable currency neutral basis with growth in Food Design and Flavors, all set by continued volume declines in ingredients. As Frank shared, Nourish ingredients, which includes protein solutions, emulsifiers and sweeteners, core texturants and cellulosics and food protection had the most pronounced volume declines in the quarter representing approximately 60% of our total company volume decline. Despite our pricing actions and productivity initiatives in the quarter, within our Nourish segment, the lower volumes and the unfavorable manufacturing absorption due to our inventory reduction program that I mentioned earlier, more than offset those efforts, contributing to a 27% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA at $208 million. Those same pressures impacted Health and Biosciences this quarter, with a 3% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral sales and a 19% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, despite price increases and strong productivity gains. While we saw solid growth in Cultures and Food Enzymes and Home and Personal care, lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption also pressured our performance. As Frank mentioned earlier, our Scent division continues to perform quite well, delivering an 8% increase in comparable currency \u2060neutral sales and a 1% increase in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, driven by double \u2060digit growth in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance. Scent\u2019s growth this quarter was driven by higher volumes, pricing, and productivity gains, as the division has remained resilient. Lastly, I'm pleased to share the Pharma Solution has delivered a 4% increase in comparable currency neutral sales, led by continued growth in core pharma. That said, like Nourish and Health and Biosciences, the segment was also impacted by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption, leading to a 6% decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Overall for the quarter, sales and EBITDA were slightly ahead of our expectations, with pricing on track, modestly better volumes, and favorable productivity. Now on slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the quarter. Cash flow from operations grew $127 million this quarter, which is an improvement versus the negative $4 million we reported in a year ago period. One bright spot in the quarter was approximately a $200 million decrease in inventory versus our year end 2022. As I discussed on our fourth quarter call, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain, genes, including system process enhancements, to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. While this is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-\u2060term impact that will be recovered over time. Looking ahead, while the majority of our efforts to reduce inventories for 2023 are behind us, we do have near-\u2060term headwind in Q2, albeit to a lesser degree than Q1, as we continue to correct our over inventory position and maximize cash flow. I also want to note that accounts payable on the quarter was adversely impacted as a result of season payment patterns, and by our inventory reduction program, whereby we slowed the purchase of raw materials, which had a direct impact on our AP. We expect this will improve over the course of the year as we achieve our target inventory level. CapEx spending for the quarter was $175 million, or approximately 5.8% of sales. This was elevated due to project timing and we expect to moderate through the balance of the year. We continue to believe that we will be around $500 million in CapEx for full year 2023. Our cash flow for the first quarter was negative $48 million. This is consistent with the seasonality of cash flows for our business. Included in our free cash flow is about $100 million of costs, primarily related to integration and transaction related costs. In terms of leverage, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $594 million which includes $4 million in assets currently held for sale. While net debt totaled $10.7 billion, our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.3 billion, and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.6x for the quarter as we mentioned earlier. While our leverage position is slightly higher than in the past few quarters, we were proactive in renegotiating our debt covenants in the first quarter. To ensure that we have appropriate capital flexibility as we execute on our strategic priorities in what may continue to be a challenging market. Importantly, we continue to actively evaluate the portfolio with consideration for further divestitures that provide additional financial flexibility and debt pay down without impacting our long term aspirations. Turning to slide 11 for our consolidated outlook for the fiscal year 2023. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we continue to believe our volume performance will improve, yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. In our discussion with customers, the majority have signaled that their destocking efforts are ending, as they believe the consumer will remain resilient in the second half. Nevertheless, we have yet to see a broad based volume improvement across our business, but we remain steadfast in our focus to control what we can control to protect profitability, maximize cash flow, and drive portfolio optimization. For the full year, we now expect sales to be approximately $12.3 billion versus $12.5 billion previously. This change is largely related to energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments. In addition, we have a modest increase in unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. As we noted on our February earnings call, about 30% of our original 6% pricing guidance was related to energy inflation, much of which is pass-through via surcharges with energy prices having moderated significantly. We are maintaining our expectation of flat comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth and continue to believe adjusted operating EBITDA will be approximately $2.34 billion. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales and comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth which we now expect will adversely impact us 1% and 3% respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have and we expect will continue to significantly devalue over the course of 2023. On a comparable currency neutral basis, all the above noted items translate into approximately 5% versus is approximately 6% previously. The sole driver once again is the energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments as we continue to believe volumes will be flat for the full year. In terms of calendarization, we believe volume will sequentially improve each quarter with a growth rebound expected in the second half of the year as the market challenges are expected to subside and our year ago comparisons are more favorable. To provide additional context, first quarter volume performance was modestly better than we anticipated, with the second quarter modestly lower. The net result is that on a first half basis we are broadly in line with our expectation, which we believe will be offset by a favorable second half. On a two year average basis, we expect first half volumes to be approximately negative 2%, reflective of destocking, and second half volumes to be up plus 2%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect sales to be approximately $3 billion to $3.1 billion, with volume performance down mid-single digits and adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $540 million to $590 million. We remain intensely focused on improving our inventory levels and driving cost savings through productivity and restructuring initiatives to ensure we generate strong cash flow for the full year. As a result, we continue to target 2023 adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding cost related integration, restructuring and geo related items. Turning to slide 12, we recognize that we continue to face a challenging environment, including reduced visibility on consumer and customer demand outlook and the path of inflation. However, we remain intently focused on what we can control with the goal of continuing to strengthen IFF's operating foundation and execution performance. As we've discussed, there are a few top operational priorities that will enable IFF to not only manage these complexities, but also to drive long-term profitable growth. Our highest long-term priority is accelerating top line growth. To achieve this goal, we are making key strategic investments in key areas of our business and continue to be more surgical in our pricing actions to ensure we recover inflationary pressures while supporting volume growth. We have also made great progress in enhancing our customer service and supply chain agility to reduce bottlenecks and increase efficiency. In the first quarter, we maintained strong service levels while also reducing our inventories, improving approximately $200 million from December \u201922 in conjunction with this, we will be rolling out a redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Enhancing productivity also remains essential as part of our transformation. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter we successfully achieved approximately $60 million of productivity benefits and began seeing initial results from our restructuring program. I expect this benefit will rapidly increase over the balance of the year. And be a strong contributor to our EBITDA performance this year. Last, we remain laser focused on improving our cash flows and delivering our long-term deleveraging target. We expect to continue to make improvements in net working capital through the balance of 2023 and into next year. We are in parallel executing against our portfolio optimization efforts, continuing to divest noncore business, In Q2 and Q3, we expect to complete the sale of our Savory Solutions and Flavored Specialty Ingredients businesses with proceeds used to pay down debt. Going forward, this is a central part of our strategy and we continue to evaluate additional portfolio optimization opportunities to strengthen our capital structure. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Glenn. Moving to slide 13, I would like to summarize our current position. In line first quarter results and reiterate where we are headed for the remainder of 2023. Over the years, IFF has remained resilient amid a variety of market conditions while successfully transforming the business to meet evolving customer needs. The same is true today as we focus on controlling what we can control and executing on the operational priorities outlined in our strategic refresh in order to achieve our financial vision and drive sustainable, profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders. We continue to believe our volume will improve, yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. As Glenn mentioned earlier, a majority of our customers have signaled that they expect destocking efforts will end and believe the consumer will remain resilient in the second half. We will continue to take action to stay nimble. Strengthen our financial and operational foundation and maintain our resilience as we continue to be diligently focused on delivering our operational and financial objectives. Moving forward, we remain committed to bringing strong products and innovation to our customers as we meet or exceed their service expectations. Financially, we are focused on improving our working capital positioned by rapidly reducing inventory levels to increase cash flow generation and we will continue to execute on our growth focused strategy by enhancing productivity, driving operational efficiencies and prioritizing our highest return businesses, all while maintaining capital discipline. We have started the year in line with our objectives and are confident in our ability to continue to execute going forward. Once again, I want to thank our teams for their tireless work to innovate and bring to market the essential products and solutions that shape so many of our daily experiences. And I have no doubt that we are well on track to build a more efficient, agile and customer centric organization poised to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in any market environment. With that, I would like to now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. Heidi Vesterinen : Good morning. So I wondered if you could please talk more about the cadence of volume and margin performance to the quarters to get your guidance, please, and specifically on volume. So you reported Q1 volumes down high single digits, which I think is what you had guided for originally, but then in your speech, you said that it was better than expected. And then you're now saying, I think Q2 is looking somewhat worse than expected, and I think your guidance used to be down low single digits. So can you clarify what the guidance for Q2, please? Perhaps if you can also comment by segment and then same for margins through the year, please. Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Hi, Heidi. It's Frank. A couple of things. So in Q1, we had guided to your point high single digits volume decline, and we actually performed a little bit better than what we had assumed in that original guidance, sales were up 1%, as you know, on a currency neutral basis. So a little bit of ahead in Q1. Q2 is slight down from what we had assumed originally. However, when we take a step back, Heidi, think about the first half of the year, mid-single digit volume decline, which is pretty much right on what we had expected at the beginning of the year. So really what you're seeing is a phasing and shift for the first half of the year, mid-single digit decline in volume. And we'll talk a little bit more about some of the different areas here in just a bit. The second half of the year, what we are anticipating and assuming is obviously against a much easier comp as we get to the back half of the year. We are making the assumption that we will have mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year, which then, when you look at the full year, has our volume being flat year-over-year. So let me unpack a little bit about some of the key assumptions as we get into the back half of the year and even into the second quarter. First, destocking, we are assuming that ends pretty much in Q2. So if you think about destocking, Heidi, we saw this really come to fruition in Q4, the volumes were down high single digits of Q4 of \u201822. We continue to see destocking in Q1 and some destocking is continuing in Q2. But we think destocking at the end as we head into the second half of the year. This is really important for our protein solutions business and health business that were significantly impacted by destocking. Second, the assumption is that consumer trends do remain resilient. There's some uncertainty in that but if we look at what we have heard from our customers and as we're working with them and bringing innovative solutions. In Home and Personal Care, we saw good growth in the first quarter. We anticipate that will continue, dish detergent, a lot of innovative projects that we're working on and we see good progress and acceleration as we go into the second half of the year. We think food and beverage will still remain resilient. Obviously, our flavors business is really important there grew in Q1 and we anticipate we will see accelerated sequential performance as we go throughout this year and in the back half. We also are focused on improving our ingredients business. We've discussed that really a focus on putting some additional resources behind ingredients. Our customer service has improved significantly. We have the capacity to serve customers. So that's something that we are also assuming as we go forward and in our ingredients business. And then we're seeing resilience in consumer and fine fragrance, and we anticipate that to continue. And then also pharma continues to be resilient as well. So when we take a step back from a volume perspective, Heidi, think of first half down mid-single digit volume, second half up mid-single digit volume, and then ultimately volume flat for the full year. The third thing that we are seeing that we believe will accelerate in the back half of the year and improve sequentially is geographical volume growth in the back half. For instance, China, this quarter, Heidi was up 2% in sales. Asia Pacific, or I should say Greater Asia, was up 1%. As we talk to our teams in Asia and in China, while the opening is still slow in parts of China, we are seeing improved signals from customers. And that gives us confidence as we get into the back half of the year that you will see geographical improvement. And then we've also noted that North America has been challenged for us over the last couple of quarters. We anticipate sequentially that will improve as we get to the back half of the year. So that's the assumptions from a volume perspective, a lot of like we said, there's some uncertainty, but we're believing that those three assumptions and drivers are what gives us the assumption at this point in time to hold our volume flat for the year. In addition to that, as you look at the back half of the year, there's a couple of other things I will highlight. On the call, we spoke about the fact that absorption in the first quarter was a headwind for us. It will be a headwind in Q2 to a lesser degree, obviously, as you get to the back half of the year, that will go positive and help us. And then in addition to that, if you recall, we highlighted that we have our cost reduction program. Full year, we highlighted a cost reduction program of $100 million. We highlighted a run rate of $70 million to $75 million for the year. And if you look at the back half, that is where you'll see the majority of that benefit in the second half of this year as we execute on our cost and people reduction program. So when we take all those things into account, Heidi, that is why we feel as though holding our EBITDA guidance to the $2.34 billion that Glenn highlighted was the appropriate assumption at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about guidance and then some of the troubled areas within the business. So in your opinion, are you being more conservative or optimistic than you were previously? It seems like underlying assumptions, maybe from a consumer dynamic, has changed to be more positive within the underlying guidance. I'm curious if you could comment on that. And then for the more challenged portions of the portfolio, things like the legacy and [inaudible] and ingredients. In terms of what you highlighted, what proactive steps are you taking to offset what seems like perhaps more permanent and structural volumetric share loss? Meaning like improving service levels doesn't seem like it could be enough to change the trajectory of the business, but perhaps I'm wrong. So sort of curious how you're thinking about what you can do to improve those pieces of the business which have been dragging performance and losing share. Thanks. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Mark, it\u2019s Frank, a couple of things. One is with regards to the businesses that were challenged, and some of these as we have highlighted clearly were due to what we see more destocking and end market demand and not necessarily share loss. But I will also acknowledge there has been share loss in other parts of our business. So for instance in health, Mark, you highlighted, we have discussed that the probiotic market in North America several times. In that business in particular, we have been really focused on our resources into that marketplace. That is really the down in volume has been driven much more by destocking and end market softness. But with that said, we have a strong focus with our health team. There's a lot of reviews with our commercial team, and we are starting to see sequential improvement in that business, Mark, as we go forward. In our Ingredients business, as I just highlighted, there's a couple of things that we are put in place. One, our customer service levels were not where they needed to be. We highlighted that during our Investor Day. They have improved significantly, Mark. So that is a big, I would say, plus for us, and we're getting good positive feedback from customers. So customer service levels in the on time performance range of 90% to 95% is really important, and we're there. Second, we now have the capacity that we need to supply customers. We had run into capacity challenges in the past, so we now have the supply that we need. Third, we are putting targeted resources in specific markets that are going to be focused on commercial customers around ingredients. So additional resources Mark, to your point are also a part of what we are doing. And then, four, what has been encouraging, we had gotten away from really good pipeline development with our customers in that space. And I can tell you this is going to take some time, but we are seeing good projects now come to fruition, and we are seeing pipeline progress in nourish and in ingredients since specifically. So those are the areas of focus. The team is spending a lot of time really looking at how we can accelerate our sales performance in those areas. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Hi, thank you. Hi, Frank. Hi, Glenn. Can you please provide your insights into the cash flow progression, the cadence throughout the year and the $1 billion free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow target? And also within that, could you just discuss and outline what you've embedded in terms of working capital improvement, please? Glenn Richter : Good afternoon, Gunther. Thanks for the question. I think the summarized version is we're actually tracking quite well against our objectives. And I'll sort of unpack, as you know, the two big contributors relative to our adjusted free cash flow combination of achieving our earnings guidance and then secondarily all the work on working capital. We had a very good quarter relative to our expectations around working capital. As a reminder, our full year objectives for working capital are consisted of a $200 million point on point, yearend reduction in inventory and then $100 million increase between payables and receivables for a net $100 million reduction in net working capital. The biggest driver of that, obviously, is inventory at that $200 million, that $200 million reduction is actually a $350 million volume reduction with $160 million of basically price escalation, i.e. raw material cost increases coming through. In the first quarter, focusing on inventory, we actually were over $200 million down inclusive of around $80 million of price escalation. So the volume component in the first quarter was $280 million against our full year objective of $350 million. So we're trending quite well. We will probably actually get to the full sort of, our initial level of inventory reduction by the end of the second quarter at this point in time. Payables and receivables, they're a little lumpy seasonally. We're feeling very good about achieving those objectives at the end of the year. So overall we feel very good, particularly relative to the working capital improvements. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John Roberts : Thank you. How do you explain what appears to be underlying consumer strength in fragrances versus the underlying consumer weakness in food, ingredients? Or maybe the question should be how did the channels get so overstocked in food, ingredients and not so overstocked in fragrance consumer products? And are there significant divergences in the current point of sale volumes between packaged food and fragrance products? Frank Clyburn : Yes. Hi, John. This is Frank. What we have seen in consumer fragrances, in particular, we saw a very strong Q1. In fact, we also saw a very strong Q1 in fine fragrances as well. So we feel really good about what we're seeing. I think consumer fragrances, it was a lot of, I would say pent-up demand. I think you are seeing clearly some positive trends on what we have been working with our customers, in particular, bringing new innovation to consumer fragrances. We've worked with lot of the large consumer packaged goods companies over the last several years and I think this is where we really have brought strong innovation in our consumer business. So we feel really good about that. There clearly was an inventory build significantly in ingredients as we've highlighted. You could see it as you go through the first part of \u201822 and then you look all the way back to \u201821. I think that what took place in those businesses in particular, uncertainty around supply chains and companies wanting to make sure that they had the supply necessary as you went through a lot of volatility in the supply chains, which is what caused the build. And obviously now what we're seeing is some of the destocking from those efforts in those businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. Lucas Beaumont : Yes. Good morning. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Josh. So just wanted to focus on the production cost under absorption. Could you please tell us sort of what was the actual size of the impact there in 1Q? Look like maybe $150 million or so in the EBITDA bridge. And then looking at 2Q in the second half, how much residual impact are you assuming in each period as the year progresses? And finally, if we get a scenario where volumes kind of disappoint to the downside, would that get larger? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey. Thanks for the question. This is Glenn. Within the first quarter, the negative absorption impact was $100 million, which translates actually into 330 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin. That represented a year-over-year volume decline of about 20%. So think about our annual fixed cost base for our manufacturing base of about $2 billion. Every one point on an annualized basis is basically worth about $20 million. So hence why we're able to reduce our inventory so significantly, we took production down significantly, so I'll say a onetime event of $100 million. We are expecting, as I mentioned, to continue to make progress on reducing inventories and expecting to have mid-single digit down volume in the second quarter. That translates into another $50 million of negative absorption. We are anticipating actually positive absorption in the second half of the year as Frank mentioned. We're expecting mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. So production volumes being up year-over-year. Again, the context of the risk associated or opportunity associated with declines or increases in manufacturing, one point on a full year basis is equal to $20 million of negative absorption. So if you think about two points in the second half, that would be the equivalency of that $20 million. We have discussed in the past. We will have to continue to consider that if we continue to see volume softer than our expectations, what will be the balance of continuing to manage cash flow and keep our inventories in the right place for production efficiency purposes versus basically the earnings profile. So they're clearly in a softer environment than anticipated. There is some risk of further negative absorption in the second half of the year. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Yes, just judging by some of the comments from your major customers out of this earnings season, it clearly looks like the global consumer is a little bit weaker. Just curious, given inflation has peaked and just your more recent conversations with your customers, do you get a sense as to whether some of the promotional activity that your customers typically resort to during periods of weakness, are they starting to contemplate that? Just trying to get a sense as to the risk profile as we cycle through the rest of the year because you will be passed these talking, but we still have a weaker consumer. Thanks. Frank Clyburn : Yes, hi. This is Frank. I think as we talk to our customers, at least the big consumer good companies, I would say they're probably cautiously optimistic on the resiliency of the consumer. They are stepping up in certain categories, promotional activities and efforts. We have clearly seen a lot of, I would say good focus from them on innovation and looking for new projects as they continue to focus on building out their future offerings to consumers. I also think that what is taking place is if you look at from our lens and it goes back to what I was highlighting, we do anticipate that sequential improvement will continue from a volume perspective. So just to reiterate a couple of points in particular in the areas that are really key for us, the sequential lift going from first half down mid-single digits to positive mid-single digits in the second half. We do continue to see working with our customers very clear opportunities for that sequential step up, especially against a softer back comparison quarter in the back half. So we believe that our consumer companies that we're working closely with are the ones that are highlighting differentiation and innovation has been key. And that's something that we will continue to focus and work on as a company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Keches with Barclays. Andrew Keches : Yes, hi. Good morning. Glenn, I was hoping to get a little more context for your deleveraging plans over the next well, this year and next. So you came into this year a little over 4x on the net basis that figure has gone up, again as expected, you do have those divestitures announced which will help you get leverage back down, it looks like to about where you came into the year, but I think it still looks like we're going to end the year around flat in 2023 from a leverage standpoint. So I guess that leaves you with a lot of wood to chop next year to get down to that 3.0x target. So I guess the question is do you expect to get there organically or at this point do you actually need those additional portfolio actions to drive the accelerated deleveraging and actually get you there next year? And then related to that, it's not lost to me that your dividend is really absorbing all your cash flow at this point. So to the extent that conditions do deteriorate from here or you can't optimize the portfolio further, are you open to considering a dividend reduction or cut at some point to preserve the investment grade status? Glenn Richter : Hey Andrew, this is Glenn, thanks for the question. Agree relative to wood chopping, that's why I have a hatchet with me today. But relative to your assumption for this year, you're correct. We were a little over 4x at the beginning of the year. We will be receiving net proceeds after tax distributions transaction over $750 million, combination of this quarter and next quarter related to the sales saving solutions and FSI which will all go to debt pay down relative to getting to the 3x times or less by the end of next year. We are fully committed to that. That will be achieved through a combination of three elements. One, we continue to have opportunity to improve our working capital position. We expect to continue to make progress next year from this year. Secondarily, we do expect the earnings trajectory will improve significantly next year. Part of it is overlapping some significant items, such as $100 million of negative absorption and then getting the top line going with our productivity program. So that's the second thing either denominator improving, but that all being said, divestitures clearly play a role in getting to that less than 3x. We have been very active reviewing the portfolio. We are proceeding on multiple fronts. We are fully confident that we have an attractive set of assets that actually aren't ideal fits for our portfolio. We are past the two year anniversary of the Reverse Morris Trust considerations as of February this year of note, and we are proceeding quite well on that path. So I'd say our confidence remains high and commitment remains high to get to less than 3x. And regarding cutting the dividend, that is not on the table at all. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. You adjusted your revenue guidance a little bit. You're citing some energy and raw movements. Just can you remind us of just how much of your portfolio passes through? And just as a corollary of that, can you also just give us a real quick update on price cost movements, yes, for the balance of \u201823 and just what portion of your portfolio you believe will reign resilient in terms of pricing? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey, Chris. It's Glenn again. Relative to energy, as a reminder, in our original guidance, at the beginning of the year, we had 6% gross pricing in the P&L. 30% of that, or a little less than two points, was associated with energy. About 75% of our energy prices are either directly via index or indirectly via aligned surcharge attached to energy pass-through to customers, and they are generally reviewed on a quarterly basis. We expect that as we mentioned, we're taking a point out of that just because there's been a very significant decline in energy prices globally. We believe that that will be relatively net neutral this year, in part not only because the pass-through, but secondary timing. The majority of our energy prices actually sit in inventory because they're part of production cost. So with 140 days of inventory, they sort of match by the end of the year. There should be some overlap as we roll into next year, but for this year, we're assuming that the energy net is sort of neutral from a P&L standpoint. In general, we are seeing positive deflationary trends not only in energy, but in logistics as well as in certain raw materials. So that is favorable relative to the portfolio, as we mentioned in the past, we believe that is a potential upside. It would be either late this year because generally the rolls obviously run through inventories, but could be meaningful next year. And relative to our portfolio, we would say that roughly 60 to two thirds of our portfolio have some degree of resiliency, i.e. less commoditized, more uniqueness relative to characteristic. But I would caution we're in the early days of deflation. So I think it's a little early to declare sort of significant margin capture relative to improvements in raw material and other costs as well. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you guys commented on pricing, particularly in Nourish as a revisiting of pricing strategy. So I was just kind of curious if we could talk a little bit more about that kind of where you think there are areas to adjust what you kind of meant by that. And then a corollary would be just a discussion on Nourish margins over time. Kind of been in that like, 12% range over the past two quarters. And I was just curious how you're thinking about Nourish profitability, perhaps looking further out and also, again, notice adjustment in pricing strategy. Thanks. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Hey, Lauren, it's Frank. On the pricing strategy, we are working with customers to balance price volume opportunities. So clearly this is not across the board, but very surgical, Lauren, in our practices, in particular, in certain geographies and I would highlight in great areas of China and certain markets where there is more price sensitivity. We are looking at price volume, but not across the board. So very surgical approach to pricing. Margins will improve, Lauren, over this year and over time. Remember that Nourish based on the first quarter, a lot of the manufacturing absorption impacted the Nourish division in Q1. There'll be some impact, as we've highlighted in Q2. And then things will improve in the back half for Nourish and for the company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : Good morning, everyone. Frank, can you talk a little bit about the enzymes business? I know it's a big consumer of energy and footprint is pretty European based. So the gas price in Europe, with that coming off a lot, is that an area where energy will be given back in price? Do you think you can hold on to it there? And I guess, given all the volatility on the cost center, where are margins now for enzymes versus maybe where they were in 2021? And where do you think they may be by the end of the year? Frank Clyburn : Yes, I'll have to take a look back in \u201821. But let me give you the enzyme business and take a step back. One, we think this is a really important business for us, and we're seeing great innovation in our enzyme business. As I highlighted, we saw really good growth in home and personal care. We continue to see really good growth from our food and cultural enzymes. And we're seeing encouraging now trends as destocking improves in our probiotic business. Grain processing, animal nutrition is still somewhat challenged, but we are working very diligently on those businesses. From a margin perspective, I'll take a, look, remember that as we look at 2021, our overall margins were obviously, I think, better in \u201821. We did see obviously decline based off of what has happened from inflation. So clearly that has impacted us in 2022. Manufacturing absorption also impacted us as we hit the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. But over time, we're really confident in the margin progression and improvement in the health and biosciences business as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Silica Cook with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. There's like $52 million in severance charges you recorded this quarter. Is that roughly like 500 people that are supposed to leave? And can you tell how many have left so far and how many are to leave? And I have a follow up on volumes. If you volumes split out mid-single digits for the quarter, does that mean that we're down high single digits in nutrition and in health and bio? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Hey Sopha, this is Glenn. We are expecting charges of roughly $75 million full year for the cost reduction program. That will be an annualized impact of about $100 million. We expect kind of around $72 million to hit the P&L this year. For obvious reasons, I'm not going to describe sort of the pace at which exits in the organization are happening from the standpoint. So that covers that. Can you remind me the second question again? Unidentified Analyst : I was wondering whether your volume headwinds were like in the high single digits -- were down . I was wondering whether volumes were in high single digits in both nourish and, in your healthcare, and bio segment. Glenn Richter : Yes. As we had mention, the softish part of our business from a volume standpoint was in Nourish. But more specifically that really was in the ingredients portfolio, which is roughly $3 billion of Nourish on an annualized basis. So that's where it was concentrated for flavors and food designs generally were fine. Thank you. There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn for closing remarks. Frank Clyburn : Thank you everyone and appreciate the time today for our first quarter earnings call. And we look forward to future updates and continuing our transformation. And our overall path to a very strong, profitable, growth profile company and helping consumers around the world. Look forward to speaking to you soon. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Thank you for attending today's IFF Second Quarter Conference Call. My name is Megan, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to Michael DeVeau. Michael, please go ahead. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you have. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining today for an important discussion on our business performance and the critical actions underway to create an even stronger IFF. As you are aware, recent results from across our industry and many of our largest customers has clearly demonstrated that macroeconomic headwinds continue largely unabated. This environment has challenged financial performance of IFF and our peers in the first half of 2023 and has resulted in a more cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. However, despite this tough environment, it is also important that we highlight the significant progress we are making on transforming and strengthening IFF's business. Consequently, today, we will share promising early results from the strategic transformation initiatives we have been discussing with you as well as some additional actions we are taking, summarize our performance for the second quarter 2023 and outline the additional steps we are taking to drive shareholder value creation at IFF's. Then we will be happy to take any questions you have at the end. With that in mind, on Slide 6, I'll begin with a quick summary of the key takeaways for the second quarter, which I will unpack further here in the next few slides, including the actions we are taking to progress our strategic transformation. First, amid the current operating environment facing the industry, including temporary destocking, IFF's is performing broadly in line with peers, excluding Functional Ingredients. Second, consistent with our invest, maximize and optimize framework that we introduced in our 2022 Investor Day, we continue to broaden our portfolio optimization efforts including through strategic noncore divestitures. Third, we've outlined as clear operational improvement plan to drive improvement within our Functional Ingredients business. And lastly, our work behind the scenes to strengthen our organization is paying off as we are making strong progress in terms of our strategic initiatives to ensure IFF is well positioned for long-term success as market conditions begin to improve. Let me now unpack each of these a bit further. Turning to Slide 7. Amid the current operating environment, Q2 results were mixed as comparable currency neutral sales growth for the second quarter was down 4%. Strong results in Scent and Pharma Solutions were more than offset by softness in H&B and Nourish, particularly Functional Ingredients. From a profitability perspective, our adjusted operating EBITDA was in line with our guidance range, excluding a onetime inventory write-down due to unprecedented cost fluctuations for one ingredient Locust Bean Kernel. Our focus on cash flow generation has yielded solid results, improving sequentially and versus the prior year period as we successfully executed on our inventory reduction program. Now as we look to the balance of the year, the pace of industry recovery that we expected is not materializing according to our original expectation. Consumer demand remains soft and temporary customer destocking trends are continuing. As a result, we have adjusted our expectations for the full year 2023 lowering sales to $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, entirely driven by lower volumes. For the full year, we expect volumes to now be down mid to high single digits versus roughly flat previously. Our adjusted operating EBITDA range is now $1.85 billion to $2 billion as favorable net price to inflation and enhanced productivity are more than offset by lower volume, higher manufacturing absorption costs related to our inventory reduction program and the impact of the write-down of LBK inventory. Approximately 75% of IFF's business, including Sent, Pharma Solutions, H&B, Flavors and Food Design are performing broadly in line with industry peers. The one area where we have significant opportunity to accelerate is the Functional Ingredients business, where we are aggressively implementing an operational improvement plan. I will share more in a moment. On Slide 8, looking at our business more broadly, we're continuing to accelerate our portfolio optimization initiatives to maximize returns and deleverage our balance sheet according to plan. We are investing behind to maximize our high-return businesses while optimizing other businesses, including through additional divestitures across all three categories and best maximize and optimize within our strategic framework. We've made significant progress on this front with the recently completed sales of our Microbial Control Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients businesses. We are continuing that momentum as we launch a sale process for Lucas Meyer Cosmetics aligned with our best owner mindset. This is consistent with our mindset of ensuring each of our businesses as the resources and ownership most conducive to long-term success and maximum returns. For LMC specifically, it is a fantastic business, and I have no doubt that it will continue to prosper under new ownership. And for IFF, it would allow us to reduce outstanding debt, while continuing to invest in our most core and accretive businesses. We have also hired JPMorgan to explore additional divestiture actions within the portfolio as a pathway to accelerate, deleverage and unlock further value creation for our shareholders. We are reviewing all options consistent with our strategic framework, and we will only pursue opportunities that are value accretive for our shareholders. A key part of our approach is that we will not look to divest assets at depressed multiples, especially those that are impacted by temporary destocking trends. Instead, we believe there is more value creation from improving these businesses before divesting. On Slide 9, I wanted to put this in today's presentation to show the dynamics we are seeing across the portfolio. As you can foresee from the slide, the vast majority of our portfolio from 2021 through the first half of 2023 has performed near or at expectations volumetrically, on a quarterly average basis, even amongst this unprecedented macro environment over the past 2 years. Also, when comparing with our peers, we believe these businesses are largely performing in line with them based on our business mix. The main business has been Functional Ingredients with quarterly average volumes down approximately 6% and during that same time frame. The message is similar if we analyze our volume performance on a first half 2023 basis as volumes for Functional Ingredients is down approximately 20% and versus a mid-single-digit decline for the rest of the business. Based on this, and as I mentioned on the first quarter call, we have been taking immediate action to improve Functional Ingredients performance while continuing to invest in our high-return businesses and make up the bulk of IFF by revenue, Scent, H&B, Pharma and the other categories within our Nourish division. On Slide 10, I would like to focus on Functional Ingredients in particular. Digging deeper into Functional Ingredients in what has happened, overall market declines in alternative protein consumption including demand decline for plant-based products, persistent supply chain challenges given the macro backdrop since the pandemic and more aggressive inventory management by customers have collectively contributed to pressure Functional Ingredients. Looking forward, while food demand volumes are beginning to stabilize and service challenges across the entire supply chain have improved, we do expect customer destocking to persist through the second half of the year based on what we are hearing from our customers. This destocking, while temporary in nature, will continue to pressure our Functional Ingredients volume as we move through the second half. Now moving to Slide 11. Our plan includes several near-term actions to improve performance in Functional Ingredients. First and foremost, there are clear opportunities to enhance our go-to-market approach with several key customers and accelerate our pipeline to win more opportunities. Since the early part of the year, we have hired over 50 new commercial professionals entirely focused on Functional Ingredients to pursue incremental market opportunities. We are already seeing early signs of improvement with a strong and growing pipeline. The second opportunity is strengthening our operating model. We will be disciplined in our approach from a productivity and operational excellence perspective, delivering 2% to 4% of annual productivity and also, as we think strategically about how to allocate capital to this business to deliver strong ROIC growth. We have also made the decision to report Functional Ingredients to provide increased transparency on performance and ensure increased management accountability with well-defined KPIs. Lastly, we are working to significantly reshape the Functional Ingredients portfolio for success. This means increasing the competitive edge of our successful core product lines while modifying or discontinuing those that have proven not to be additive to the portfolio. The net result of this operational improvement plan, supported by our new leader in Nourish and Function Ingredients, will allow us to grow sales in line with the market and deliver a mid-teen adjusted operated EBITDA margin over the next 3 years. We expect that to this plan, plus the elimination of more transitory challenges such as the LBK inventory write-down and negative absorption, we will see a meaningful improvement in 2024. Moving to Slide 12. I would like to now focus on the significant progress we are making against our strategic plan as we seek to be the premier partner, build our future and become one IFF. Despite the current macro environment, we see our industry in, our teams around the world are putting in the work to ensure we are setting ourselves up to capitalize as economic conditions begin to normalize. Our commercial excellence initiatives are yielding strong results. We have greatly improved customer service performance, identified more than $250 million in new growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond and are expanding the sales pipeline up more than 50% year-over-year across all divisions. We are building our future and extending our leadership in R&D with 15 new technology launches year-to-date and an expected revenue contribution exceeding $100 million. At the same time, our focused productivity initiatives yielded approximately $140 million in savings through the first half of the year. We are optimizing our portfolio to focus on our highest growth, highest margin businesses through selected divestitures, which will complement our efficiency objectives as we meet our deleveraging targets. Lastly, we're making exciting progress in building a more unified IFF. We are finalizing our transition to our new customer line operating model, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. We've also continued to enhance our culture and deepen our bench of world-class talent. In June, we appointed Yuvraj Arora, an experienced CPG executive who previously led U.S. categories for Kellogg as President of our Nourish division. With our leadership team and incentive structure now in place, the organization is poised for sustainable, profitable growth and expansion. Now on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the strong improvements we have made in terms of our pipeline opportunity. Our scientific and technological expertise remains a key differentiator in the competitive market. We win by introducing new and unique capabilities to meet our customers' evolving needs. We're seeing the benefits of our refocused R&D and commercial excellence initiatives, including a more than 50% increase in opportunities so far in 2023 and versus the same 2022 period. This increase is giving us continued optimism in the future potential of IFF. In Nourish, increased opportunities across regions and categories, has led to a greater than 60% pipeline inflow versus last year. Our recent notable win included Xylitol, which is a sweetener used in bars, cereals and other confectionery goods. In sense, our compounds pipeline opportunity continues to be healthy and strong. Included in this was a significant win for our Boost Powder Detergent, a 100% active powder laundry detergent that is effective and safe to use unwatchable fabrics. In Health and Biosciences, greater capacity is driving a robust pipeline in our Cultures and Food Enzymes and our Health & Grain Processing units. Included within this is a notable win in North America probiotics, a dietary supplement that supports gut health. And in Pharma Solutions, the pipeline has doubled while the team has delivered key wins in METHOCEL, a plant-based, more dissoluble, functional ingredient that supports dietary sublet manufacturing in a high-growth category. Collectively, our team's creativity and efficiency in bringing innovative solutions to market provides confidence in our ability to strengthen our long-term leadership as the preferred partner for CPGs worldwide. Moving to Slide 14. Our management team is aligned on key objectives essential to IFF's success as market conditions normalize, turning IFF into a leader in high-value innovative solutions. Through the second half of this year and beyond, we are focused on accelerating growth and maximizing shareholder value, expanding our margin, enhancing our return on capital and improving our leverage ratios. We believe we have a strong, achievable plan in place to ensure we are well positioned to rebound growth and profitability and continuing executing on our broader strategic transformation in 2024 and beyond. I will now turn it over to Glenn to discuss our second quarter performance and financial position entering the second half of 2023. Glenn Richter : Thanks, Frank. Turning to Slide 15. In Q2, IFF generated $2.9 billion in sales with comparable currency neutral sales declined 4% as strong performance in Scent and Pharma was offset by softness in Nourish and Health and Biosciences. Our pricing continues to remain strong in the second quarter as it was up high single digits. However, volume in the quarter declined low double digits about twice the decline anticipated in the quarter. To provide some more color on volumes, Sent and Pharma were largely in line with expectations, while H&B underperformed in large part due to softer volume performance in health. The majority of our underperformance of our overall volume decline in the quarter, approximately 60% was attributable to Functional Ingredients. Excluding the impact of Functional Ingredients, IFF volume would have only been down mid-single digits. Adjusted operating EBITDA was $510 million, down 18% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis, largely driven by unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption of approximately $55 million and a $44 million write-down of inventory related to unprecedented cost fluctuations for Locust Bean Kernel. As Frank mentioned earlier, excluding this onetime LDK write-down, our adjusted operating EBITDA would have been $554 million, within our previously communicated guidance range of $540 to $590 million. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.86 in the quarter, impacted by lower profitability. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 16. Excluding the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program and the inventory write-down of LBK comparable adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis versus the previous year. We continue to benefit from strong pricing and productivity gains. However, as you can see from the slide, the biggest driver impacting profitability in the quarter was the decline in volumes. This volume decline is most pronounced in our Nourish business, driven by Functional Ingredients. As noted, volumes across our Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses met expectations and H&D was modestly behind. Turning now to Slide 17. I'll provide a look at our second quarter performance by business segment. As we've noted, continued weakness in functional ingredients impacted Nourish performance overall, with strong results in Flavors and Food Design and in line with peers. Pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and the LBK inventory write-down. Turning to Health & Biosciences, strong results from certain segments, including Cultures and Food Enzymes, Grain processing and Home and Personal Care, were offset by volume decline in health, driven primarily by the continued soft market conditions across the probiotics and broader dietary supplements markets. From a profitability perspective, pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volume and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Scent continued to remain resilient, performing strongly this quarter, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance, and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance with solid contributions from both volume and price. This, coupled with strong productivity, led to growth and margin expansion across the division. These initiatives also drove strong growth in Pharma Solutions, which saw a 16% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA on a comparable currency-neutral basis, led by solid performance in our core Pharma business, and ongoing pricing and productivity gains. Turning to Slide 18. Cash flow from operations totaled $375 million this quarter, as a result of our very focused efforts to drive strong working capital improvements and right-size our inventories. We are ahead of target, having achieved approximately $320 million inventory reduction year-to-date, after normalizing for LBK write-down. I would like to reiterate that while this inventory reduction program is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-term impact that we will be recovering over time. CapEx for the first half was $290 million or approximately 4.9% of sales. Given this, our free cash flow position for the quarter has improved sequentially from last quarter and was $85 million in Q2. Included in our free cash flow is about $160 million of cost primarily related to integration and transaction-related costs. We also distributed $413 million of dividends to our shareholders. In Q2, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $641 million, additionally, net debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.6 billion with net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.5 times. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Improving our leverage profile and ensuring IFF continues to meet its deleverage commitments remains a top priority and I am pleased with the strong working capital improvements made to date. With the initiatives in play, including our portfolio optimization efforts, IFF is on a path to delever according to our plan through the rest of 2023 and into 2024. As we mentioned, we remain laser-focused on achieving our target leverage profile to improve cash flow and the portfolio actions and other strategic initiatives we discussed today. Moving to Slide 19. Like many in our sector, we continue to navigate this unprecedented market environment. Consequently, we now expect many of the challenges that we faced through the first half of the year to continue through the second half of the year, including customer destocking and related consumer demand visibility constraints. And as a result, we have revised our second half outlook. Importantly, we remain intently focused on the levers that we can control, including accelerating sales growth, delivering positive price inflation margin, delivering on our identified productivity initiatives while also seeking additional efficiency opportunities and driving continued improvement in cash flow. Ultimately, these actions will strengthen the platform and better position IFF who when the environment improves. On Slide 20 is our updated financial guidance. We are now expecting net sales to be in a range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, while our new guidance reflects softer revenue expectations across all businesses, our lower expectations and Functional Ingredients accounts for the majority of the revenue change. For the full year 2023, we are expecting Functional Ingredients volumes to be down double digits. However, the rest of the business to be down low single digits amid continued and temporary customer destocking. For the second half of 2023, we expect sales to be between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, with comparable volumes flat to down high single digits. At the midpoint, of our volume guidance range, our 2-year average volume is down 4%, which is consistent with what we delivered in the first half. Also, please remember that included in our first half '23 results are approximately $300 million in sales and approximately $30 million EBITDA related to our Savory Solutions and FSI divestitures. With these transactions closed at the beginning of June and August, respectively, our second half '23 financials will be lower by these amounts. For full year '23, adjusted operating EBITDA we now expect to be between $1.85 billion and $2 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance. This is driven by three factors, our reduced volume expectations, $80 million more of higher absorption costs and the $44 million LBK inventory write-down. We are now expecting our full year inventory reduction to be approximately $425 million, and as a result, the absorption related to our inventory reduction will be approximately $180 million impact to profitability for the full year. To reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward. We remain committed to driving working capital improvements through our inventory reduction program as we navigate this near-term complexity. And finally, and very importantly, in light of this environment, we are maintaining strong cost discipline to drive enhanced productivity across the organization in order to protect profitability. For our full year expectations for interest expense, we now expect it to be around $425 million mainly due to higher interest forecast on short-term debt and factory programs and a higher balance of short-term debt due to lower earnings. And we also expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 21% or no change. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth which we now expect will adversely impact us by 2% and 6%, respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have moved against us in the first half of '23, where FX was a 3-point headwind to sales and a 7-point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA and we expect that many of these currencies will continue to significantly to value in the second half of '23. Now I'll turn back to Frank for closing remarks. Frank Clyburn : Thanks, Glenn. Our incredible teams around the world continue to deliver pioneering discoveries and strengthen our customer relationships ensuring that IFF is the innovative engine behind the most critical and beloved consumer products. These efforts are reflected in the solid results across the majority of our businesses despite the current environment, which gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver industry-leading growth and profitability in the years ahead. Our strategic plan is showing very encouraging early results. We are investing in opportunities for growth, innovation and enhanced productivity, and we are taking decisive actions to manage through the volatile market conditions, refocusing functional ingredients with an operational improvement plan to strengthen operations and execution and progressing our deleveraging efforts through ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, including the launch of our cosmetic ingredients process. Amid even this challenging market environment, we are making great progress transforming IFF into the leader in high-value innovative solutions and the partner for our customers. The actions we are taking today and through the remainder of 2023 will create a stronger IFF capable of delivering significant value for shareholders and all of our stakeholders. With that, I will open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess just to the question that we're getting a lot from investors is as we look at the - the updated EBITDA guidance for the year, it does appear that you're going to be moving above your covenant threshold in the back half. And so Glenn, you talked about being kind of continuing to commit to deleveraging. Can you just comment on what that path looks like over the balance of the year? And in that context, how should we think about the dividend? And then what is the updated expectation for free cash flow for 2023. I don't think I heard an updated guidance number there? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Yes. Adam, thanks very much, good morning. And great questions to start off here. Let me start off by reassuring everybody, I am quite confident that we will not trip our covenants and the reason I am is because there are multiple levers that we can pull, and I'll get to your question about cash flow, but we've made very strong progress on working capital and other improvements in cash flow this year. In addition, we are well downstream on divestitures from a portfolio standpoint as well. And I would also remind you that there's a credit-adjusted definition of EBITDA, which is different than the adjusted EBITDA number. So obviously, there are a number of add-backs relative to that calculation. So point one, very confident we will not have an issue with our covenant. Point number two is currently a change in our dividend is not on the table. And then point number three, relative to our cash flow forecast for this year on a free cash flow basis reported we're expecting to be about $100 million lower than our original guide. As a reminder, we had a $600 million free cash flow for this year. We're forecasting $475 million. As a reminder, within that $475 million, there are 450 million Reg G charges. So on an adjusted basis, we expect to be over $900 million. That compares to the $1 billion we started off, that $450 million, by the way, includes $250 million of transaction related. So it's taxes, it's M&A, separation fees for the microbial control FSI and say solutions of the residual, $75 million is related to the final integration activities with DuPont this year, and there's another $100 million plus that are largely related to the restructure that we performed this year. So - so again, on an adjusted basis, we expect our free cash flow to be around $900 million versus the original $1 billion. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I guess how does the operating backdrop in 2023 change how you're thinking about the financial commitments through 2026, I think you outlined at the Investor Day back in December. Maybe you can touch on the internal offsets you're pulling to count or the lower volume baseline. And I'm just asking because at this point, your dividend outlay is unsustainable relative to your rebased EBITDA starting point as Adam pointed out. Frank Clyburn : Hi. Yes, this is Frank, and I'll take that one. And good morning, everyone. A couple of things that I want to highlight. First and foremost, if you look at what's taking place through '23. Clearly, we are seeing temporary destocking, as we mentioned, and we have been pulling a number of levers to manage the business. First, you can see really good progress with productivity. As Glenn highlighted, we've been really improving our net working capital and also making sure that we're doing everything to control our cost to manage the '23 year as it unfolds. We are on track. As you recall, we highlighted that we're going to have a cost reduction takeout of about $100 million. That is on track as well. More importantly, though, I am very excited about the opportunity that we have as we come out of temporary destocking. And as we move into '24 and as you could see, as we discussed with our customers, we're very well positioned based on the pipeline increase that we just highlighted, also based on the commercial efforts that we're putting forward. We've improved our customer service significantly, which gives me a lot of confidence as I look at the outlook, to your question over the next several years. So we're managing for the near-term temporary destocking, but we are clearly preparing for a good, strong growth in '24. We still remain committed to our long-term guidance that we put out of 4% to 6% top line sales growth and 8% to 10% EBITDA that we can't communicated during Capital Markets Day. Glenn Richter : Yes. And if I could just tag on to the end of that regarding your comment regarding the unsustainability of the dividend, I just will piggyback on my response to Adam's question, again, on an adjusted basis, $900 million of free cash flow and in addition, as we've called out, there's over $200 million of onetime items between LBK write-off and then the negative absorption. So we are confident as we exit this year, we're going to be in a much, much better trajectory, particularly as the environment improves. So I'm not sure the assertion on sustainability is correct. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and good morning, everybody. I guess the first question is just what gives you confidence in the back half outlook? I think you talked, Glenn, about the volume assumptions essentially being the same on a 2-year basis, 2H versus 1H - you've cut numbers now, not necessarily your fault, partly industry stuff, now three times since the Investor Day. So what gives you confidence, what should investors take that would give you - give them any confidence that you can hit the numbers that you laid out there? And then helpful on the divestiture commentary. Curious how integrated the businesses are today such that more divestitures aren't disruptive that they don't create significant fixed cost deleverage and having to staff up and absorb costs? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes. So I'll take the question. Thanks, It's really important. We've talked to a number of our customers. With regards to the temporary destocking, and we do believe that it is very prudent for us right now to derisk the plan based on the back half of the year, and we do think we've done that. And in derisking the plan, we also believe that we set the floor. So we're very confident and what you are now seeing is our new guidance going forward. Important to note though, while we are navigating '23, we are also continuing to prepare, as we just discussed, as we move into '24 as we see destocking subside and as we see volumes improve. Glenn, I don't know if you want to Glenn Richter : I would add. It's a very, very legitimate question, Mark, is a, we feel we're being very prudent relative to the range in terms of what the guide is here. Secondarily, we have July in our belt at this point, and it's negative 4% volume August is trending a little bit lower than that, but very, very consistent with what we think the quarter is unfolding. So a combination of bringing down to a 2-year consistent with the first half, a couple more months largely closed gives us a pretty good sense that we're going to be in a good place. And obviously, we wanted to make sure we were prudent relative to the construction of this outlook. Your question on M&A is a good one, and there's no simple answer. Some businesses are more integrated than others. It is clearly a consideration relative to our portfolio strategy. The good news is we have acquired substantial experience over the last 3 years now through a combination of the sale of the microbial control business, Savory Solution and Atlas as well as other ones we're working on. So we've got a pretty good track record in sort of being able to navigate through that. But it is an important consideration as we think about which parts of the portfolio we trim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Gunther Zechmann : Good morning, Frank. Good morning, Glenn. I know you don't guide for next year yet, but what do you think are the main moving parts if we want to build the bridge for 2024 considering your comparables. You talked about you're excited about the pipeline growth, destocking to subside. What are some of the potential negatives as well that we should take into account? So refineries for 2024, please? Glenn Richter : Sure. Maybe I'll begin Gunther and Frank can add on. As we think about '24, one is, as we mentioned, we do believe that the environment will be improving. So we think we're now going to be entering an environment where destocking will be complete consumer pullback will be largely stabilized at a point. So that's point one. Point two, as we mentioned, there are a number of items to normalize from this year. So the $180 million associated with absorption which we have consciously tackled, by the way, that has delivered a $500 million reduction in inventory full year from a standpoint. So it's a very, very significant achievement we're accomplishing. It's also the LDK write-off, obviously, 44. So there are onetime items - from a volume standpoint, as Frank had mentioned, we feel that 75% of our business, i.e., everything except Functional Ingredients is performing well in line with our competitive peers. So we'd expect them to continue to trend well in an improving market. And the other 25%, we have been underway for a number of months on remediation and expect that business to pick up next year. And lastly, I would say that the other areas that we can control, i.e., productivity, working capital and cash flow efficiency and portfolio are well on track. So we feel like - those should continue as we move into '24. But obviously, as we close the year, we'll have a more detailed update on next year. Frank Clyburn : Yes. And I would add, Gunther, and I highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've been spending a lot of time with our key customers. I can tell you that I've had discussions with many of with those CEOs with those companies and Chief Technology Officers. And what we highlighted is the 15 new R&D launches this year, the strong platforms that we have and as Glenn mentioned, if you look at our business performance in Scent, if you look at Pharma, if you look at Health & Biosciences overall, we're in really good shape, and the businesses are performing well in a challenging environment and backdrop. And even within Nourish, one of the things I wanted to highlight after is that our Flavors business, our system ingredients business as we help customers solve some of their challenges is in good shape as well and benchmarks extremely well versus our peers. And now we have a plan that we will be getting after improving our functional ingredients and that's something that we'll continue to monitor very closely. We have a new team that's been put in place to really improve that business. And as volumes start to normalize, as you head into next year, we feel really good that you'll start to see improvement in that business, which gives us a lot of confidence for '24. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open. Josh Spector : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking for taking my questions So I was wondering if you could provide some more detail kind of walking through your second quarter EBITDA to your second half run rate. So I mean, as you mentioned earlier, you exclude the inventory write-down you did about 550. Your guide at the midpoint is maybe $450 million a quarter. I guess the inventory adjustment isn't changing. It's maybe getting a little bit better price cost, you had some benefits from volumes you're guiding similar. I guess I'm not sure what's driving that magnitude of decline. So more color there would be helpful. Thank you. Glenn Richter : Sure. Good morning, Josh. So let me actually - let me just do first half to second half because honestly, the first quarter is very similar to the second quarter. So the first half on a reported basis was $1.2 0 billion [ph] of EBITDA adjusted EBITDA. And then the midpoint of the guide is 9.05 for the second half. As you pointed out, you need to adjust the first half for a combination of the absorption, $150 million LBK write-off, adding another 44, you've got to reduce for divestitures, which come out of the second half, you should take out 30 and then you have foreign exchange differential of $20 million to $30 million, so that gets you roughly to $1.150 billion. And then obviously, for the second half, you have some absorption of 30. So that gets you to 9.35. So it's a 1.150 first half normalized versus a 935 million. So it's roughly $200 million delta between them. So can break it down into basically two components. About $50 million is related to lower GP from seasonal volumes, particularly the fourth quarter, it's our lowest quarter. So on an apples-to-apples basis, there's $100-plus million of differential. The other is a little bit productivity timing, but it's largely a net price realization versus cost higher in the first half than the second half. And as you noted or as we've noted, we have a 7% pricing in the first half. It's circa 3% in the second half. So while we continue to see some progress on reduction of input costs, there was a better achievement in the first half versus the second half. So hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Nicola Tang : Thanks. Hi, everyone, I wanted to take a closer look at Functional Ingredients. I was wondering if you could give more color on which product groups or perhaps switch end markets in Functional Ingredients actually drove that volume weakness in Q2? And could you elaborate a bit more on the cautious outlook for the second half as well? Also, at your Investor Day last year, you highlighted your plan to optimize or exit underperforming divisions, so with today's new efficiency plan in Functional Ingredients, does this mean that you've ruled out exiting this division? Or could it still be a potential divestment candidate? Thanks. Frank Clyburn : Yes. Nicola, this is Frank. I'll take both. On the first question, we are looking at all options. However, as we've communicated, we will not pursue any options that aren't accretive to our shareholders. And we think right now, in particular, within Functional Ingredients, we are focused on the improvement plan that we outlined, and we do see really good early progress starting to emerge within that business. As far as the first part of your question, if we look at Functional Ingredients, underneath that, I'll use the example of protein solutions with Soft, Nicole of this quarter primarily due to destocking and these are isolated soy proteins that go into nutritional bars and beverages. I've had a chance to meet with a couple of the customers and the positive news is we're very well position within those end markets. The destocking has been the impact primarily for isolated soy proteins going into those beverages and bars. So that's an example, Nicole, of what we've seen, and that's been the impact we've seen across Functional Ingredients primarily destocking. There has been some customer softness in some of the meat alternative products that are within Functional Ingredients as well. But hopefully, that helps give us a little bit more color of what we're seeing. And then as we come out of destocking, as I mentioned, we do anticipate things to start to normalize as we get into '24. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thank you. What's the threshold for deciding when to take a write-down in raw material inventory. You've had spikes in citral, vanilla, other ingredients in the past, I don't recall this kind of a write-down before. And then I think your earlier comments on price raws were year-over-year. Could you give us a sense of sequential and whether or not LDK is kind of affecting the sequential number significantly? Frank Clyburn : Yes. Good question, John. And good morning to you. Materiality and ultimately, the measure is do we expect to be selling it below cost. I would say LBK is a very unique case. You cited some others. But as it relates to the volatility over the last 2 years to give you some sense, prices have dropped from \u20ac35 per kilo to 8 in less than 12 months. So that was a clear case that we needed to basically recognize the current value of the inventory that's an anomaly. At least in my short history of 2 years, we've never seen anything like that in terms of kind of the sheer level of volatility, such a short period of time. I would also note that the inventories were slightly higher, which actually made it a bigger - slightly bigger write-off simply because we were making sure that we had enough supply for security purposes. Relative to the raws trends, they're continuing to progress downward, but I'll say, at a more modest rate than we saw in the second half of last year and then entering into this year. As you know, many of the factors impacting prices such as energy prices is one big input have decreased, but they've stabilized as well. So we're seeing a little bit more improvement. I would note that the other two big input costs for us are logistics and energy, energy has come down dramatically this year. It's largely pretty stable at this point globally. And then logistics as well has been a very, very big improvement over the year, and that has largely stabilized and actually we see some continued downward progression in terms of prices as well. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Harris Fein : Hi, good morning. This is Harris Fein on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. So can you talk a little bit more about the visibility that you have into where consumer sell-through is trending versus any differences you're seeing in destocking at your customer level? Do you think that your customers are still holding above normal inventories? Or do you think that this is a situation where maybe they're drawing down normal inventories into an area well below normal because maybe there's more supply chain comfort. And I guess based on all that, how are you thinking about the potential for destocking to maybe weak into 2024 at this point? Thanks. Frank Clyburn : Yeah, hi. This is Frank. Thanks for the question. We do work very closely with, in particular, our large global key accounts and then also our large regional accounts. And I do think supply chains have improved, so they are willing to adjust some of their inventories. What we are hearing from them is mixed. Some customers are saying that destocking will start to come to an end as we kind of go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Some are saying that it really is depending on end market consumer demand and are thinking more that the destocking persists through the rest of this year and starts to improve as we get into 2024. So what we have done is, as we mentioned, in our approach is to really be prudent in the approach and to derisk our plan. However, we are very much focused on working with them to prepare for once temporary destocking is over to improve, obviously, our performance. And I can tell you that when we look at - as I mentioned, our pipeline win rate and some of the commercial activities we have underway, we feel really good and well positioned. But your question on visibility is one that we are working with them on. But clearly, we are making sure we're doing everything we can prepare for as we head towards the end of this year and into next year. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I really appreciate the transparency on the Functional Ingredients deep dive. What percentage of the Functional Ingredients business would you characterize as a commodity, low-margin business? And are any of these businesses separable now? Or is the bias more towards optimization and the prioritization of investment? Frank Clyburn : Yes, I'll start and then, Glenn, I'll let you add. If you look at Functional Ingredients, what's underneath that is protein solutions, which is about a third or it's approximately - in functional ingredients. We have multipliers and sweeteners. We have core tax trends, cellulosis and food protection and systems are kind of within functional ingredients. We feel good with regards to our specialty protein. So we think there's good differentiation there. And that represents about half of protein solutions, and there are some more value proteins in there that I would say are a little bit more in a competitive landscape. Emulsifiers I would say, are probably in the category of much more competitive to answer your question, and it's something that we're looking at in particular, some of the emulsifiers that are within that category within that business and also some of the core text rents, we feel as though are some are differentiated, but there are some core texturants that are probably more challenged competitively. So we're staring at our portfolio. We feel good overall. We're going to put where we have core differentiation, our efforts to behind that core, and that's a part of the functional ingredients plan. In areas here are some of the ingredients that are more commoditized or where we don't bring a differentiated benefit. That's where we're going to look to really optimize or possibly even discontinue in those ingredients. So we have a well thought out plan as we move forward and feel good about the new team that we have in place. Glenn Richter : Yes. I would just add two other comments is these are somewhat more commoditized than the rest of our portfolio. But to bring up Frank's point, our portfolio is very much focused on high value add. So you think about our cellulosics business, you think about Xylitol, you sort of think about our soy isolates, really as it relates to specialty proteins, et cetera, alginate, et cetera. We really are focusing a part of our strategy of maximizing the value-add opportunities in our portfolio and have been super turbocharging our customer pipeline activity to focus on those categories. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Sison : Hey. Good morning, guys. Frank, The DuPont transaction was designed to help you generate better organic growth longer term. And it seems like functional ingredients has been more of a challenge there. So when you think about the potential value of the deal, is there any left? Or can you give us some thoughts of can this - can any of their businesses really help improve your organic growth? And then longer term, how do you think you rebuild the EBITDA from '23 to what level do you think is possible? Frank Clyburn : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. I think that if you look at the transaction, we still feel very confident about the value creation opportunities for IFF going forward. We are, as we highlighted and is primarily due to destocking, and we have a clear plan to address some of the challenges in Functional Ingredients. If you look at our Health & Biosciences business, tremendous capabilities. The business is performing well. Pharma is also performing extremely well. So we still feel very good about the future value creation opportunity, as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Lisa De Neve : Good morning, Frank and Glenn. And thank you so much for taking my questions. I have two main questions. So following your intention to explore potential incremental divestitures I mean what is the current market interest to actually engage with M&A at this point of the cycle? And how difficult is for potential buyers to potentially obtain financing in this volatile and higher interest rate environment. And how should we think about the time line for potential divestments? That's my first question. And then the second question I have is like from your top management level, how is your visibility across the different business units? How quickly do you see when certain units are deteriorating, whether it's market driven or any other reason? And how quickly do you address some underperformance in some segments. And maybe on that note as well, what will change in Nourish, there is now there is a new head driving that segment? Thank you. Glenn Richter : I'll start, Lisa, I think technically at six questions, but let's unpack them. So on the M&A front, there are both PE firms, but more importantly, strategics out there that would have a high level of interest relative to our portfolio, relative to the former of the credit markets have stabilized. So there's tons of PE money out there being put to work and the credit market is actually in a pretty good place. But more importantly, on the strategic side, there is a very broad appetite relative to partnerships, various assets in the portfolio. As you know, most of the peers in this space actually have very good balance sheets. There's value to consolidation in this space, et cetera. So we feel very good about the robustness relative to the opportunities out there. We will be smart in terms of how we do that. It's got to make sense for us strategically in terms of what's in the portfolio - in the portfolio and it needs to be smart from a value creation for our shareholder. As we mentioned earlier, we're not interested in divesting assets cheaply. We'd rather actually maintain them, fix them, grow them from that standpoint before we did that. So I think that was your first set of questions. Frank, do you want to take that? Frank Clyburn : Yes. I think you had a question about visibility into the business, and we do have a window where we are looking at a couple of weeks, obviously, we can look at our orders, and we obviously do a lot of work with regards to engaging with our customers. So - and we moved pretty quickly. I said we move very quickly, I should say, with regards to how we adjust our business. And the example is, I think you're seeing us very rapidly focus on productivity, focus on cash flow. We've moved very rapidly with regards to improvement in net working capital. We signaled early on that we were seeing some softness in destocking and end market demand and ingredients, and we quickly put in place 50 commercial resources to address that. So we're moving very rapidly to address any challenges that we have. And then to your last question, Naresh [ph] President is on board, fully aligned and helped to develop the plan you're seeing around Functional Ingredients as well as helping us to focus on driving Flavors and Systems as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. End of the call, but I'll just keep this kind of high level and strategic. I was curious as you think about some of the things that are in this Functional Ingredients portfolio, including, importantly, the things that are maybe less differentiated and then, therefore, less attractive to continue to be in. But what's the role of those things in the dream - the dream of integrated solutions. Because my understanding is that part of the delivering full service to customers is having that full portfolio and that was sort of part of the argument for being a one-stop shop. But now it feels like the financial return profile or managing this collection of businesses that are varying degrees of more or less attractive on a stand-alone basis? Is making that bigger like industrial logic more challenged. So maybe a little bit long to the end of the call, but I was just curious on how you'd react to that. Frank Clyburn : Yes, Lauren, I would say that when I look at Functional Ingredients, I'll give you an example, where we bring significant differentiating value is within our systems business where we're bringing in combining multiple ingredients. And for example, emulsifiers are used in over 50% of our systems applications and what we're bringing for customers. So we still believe that there is integrated solution opportunities as we work across all of Nourish. What we're highlighting is due to destocking, we need a very quick rapid improvement plan based on the need to improve the financial profile of Functional Ingredients. But we still do see that the integration with in particular, with regards to emulsifiers as well as some of our protein solutions is still bringing a lot of benefit and advantages to customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mr. DeYoe, your line is now open. Michael DeVeau : Maybe operator, we'll go to the next one. Operator : Absolutely. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Laurence Alexander : Just very quickly, how much of an EBITDA drag do you have from the working capital reductions that you've done this year? And secondly, for the target for Functional Ingredients to sort of match the market. Do you see yet a path for functional greens to get above-market growth in, say, 5, 7 years? Or is matching the market kind of sort of the best fix? Frank Clyburn : Yes. So the answer to the first question is $180 million is related to bringing inventory out of the system. So as I mentioned, there's $500 million of volume related on we have a little bit of raw materials price escalation. So the balance sheet will show a net $400 million and change improvement that way, that's significantly above what we were planning at the beginning of the year, we're sort of making more progress. So the cost of doing that is basically the negative absorption on the P&L from a standpoint for this year. But obviously, it's sort of one and done. And at least for the interim period, honestly, we haven't thought about 5 to 7 years is getting to market and generally, these categories were sort of low single-digit growth is the right target to be in part because we want to be reasonable in part. We also want to optimize the return on these assets because they typically have a lower ROIC more capital intensive. So it's not growth, the sale growth, that's really sort of optimizing the returns. But thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Silke Kueck : Hi. I also have a question along those lines. So if there's $180 million income statement on penalty for reducing the inventories and improving the cash flows, is there a benefit in 2024 if the inventories don't get rebuilt, like I understand you've done about the same cost, but you feel like an actual benefit unless you rebuild inventories? Frank Clyburn : You don't need to rebuild them. You just need to may be flat. So as a reference point, our total production will be down around 15% this year. As we mentioned, we expect sales volumes to be down 6. So there's - that 9% incremental is basically to eat through that $0.5 billion of inventory still getting there. So assuming you - that's one and done, then you get the pickup of the 180 next year because obviously, production is at zero at that point going forward. So as you - if you rebuild inventories over time as you grow the business, that actually creates a positive absorption going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Keches with Barclays. Your line is now open. Andrew Keches : Thanks, I appreciate the question. Glenn, if I could ask a time line for that three times net leverage target changed. I heard you reiterate I didn't hear the time line though. And do you still expect to get there by the end of 2024 with asset sales I think even with Lucas Meyer and [indiscernible] sort of in, it still seems like you'd have additional work cut out for you? Frank Clyburn : Yeah, yeah... Andrew Keches : And then related to that, Yes, related. I appreciate that - so your messaging deleveraging is still a priority. But at the end of the day, the agencies have you very close to high yield at this point, and that dividend is still effectively two times what your cash flow is. So is maintaining IG rating a significant importance to you? And yes, that's intentional emphasis on maintaining? Frank Clyburn : Yes. The answer is - to the second question, we're very committed to maintaining investment grade. As you're well aware, the rating agencies are patient relative to your long-term strategy and goals. We've obviously have been in close discussions with them. They know our plans in terms of what we're doing. Again, I would submit to you that the reality is on adjusted cash flow basis we're at 900 this year with some onetime items that mainly gets you north of that, probably not the best place to be relative to an $800 million dividend, and we get that, but normal growth trajectory gets you into a much better place from that. On the deleverage, i.e., the activities and the target, we are still committed to heading three times by the end of next year. We have been at work for quite a few months on M&A. And that's - we've been mentioning portfolio revisit since the end of last year. So there are a number of activities underway from that standpoint. And so we do feel that we have enough, if you will, irons in the fire beyond Lucas Meyer to basically accomplish our goals. Frank Clyburn : Great. Thank you, Glenn. And as we come to a close today, a couple of key points I would like to just reiterate. And first, I want to make sure that we reemphasize that the majority of our business is doing well and is very resilient as we manage through temporary destocking. Second, we are taking action very rapidly to improve our business trajectory and our capital structure. We've implemented a functional ingredients operational improvement plan, and we look forward to sharing more with you of the progress. We're driving divestitures, as you've heard, such as the announced sale of LMC as well as additional opportunities that we're looking at to delever, and we're executing on our strategic priorities with strong improvements in commercial and operational excellence, as you heard today. We do remain confident in our value creation potential, given the relative strength of our pipeline and we highlighted just within the first half of this year, over a 50% increase versus prior year and is the transitory nature of destocking ends, that's going to really position us well as we head into 2024, as the environment normalizes. Frank Clyburn : And then lastly, I wanted to really reiterate, IFF is a great business. We're in a great industry, and we have significant opportunities to create value for our stakeholders and we want to thank each and everyone of you for joining our call today. Operator : That concludes the IFF second quarter conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of our performance in the third quarter and an update on our strong execution to position IFF for long-term success. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results by business and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. We will then open the call for questions. Moving to Slide 6. Our third quarter story is one of sequential improvement. As we've discussed, improving volumes has been a top priority, and we are pleased with the sequential volume improvements that we have achieved across the majority of our business. On a total company basis, while our volume in the third quarter was down mid-single digits, it was a marked improvement from our Q2 lows where we saw a double-digit decline. Similarly, our enhanced productivity initiatives as well as favorable price to inflation led to strong adjusted operating EBITDA results. Sequentially, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin finished at 17.9%, which is a 50 basis point improvement versus the second quarter of 2023. And our focus on ongoing working capital improvements drove strong free cash flow generation. In particular, the continued execution of our inventory reduction program has resulted in more than a $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of 2022. This was the largest driver of our free cash flow, which improved $320 million versus the second quarter of '23. The net result is that we delivered higher than our expectations on both the top and bottom line. At the same time, our commercial excellence initiatives in our R&D platform continue to drive improvements in our sales pipeline. In addition, in Functional Ingredients, as discussed on our second quarter call, we are implementing a targeted operational improvement plan to improve sales execution, strengthen our operating model and reshape the portfolio. As we shared previously, we expect this plan for Functional Ingredients will translate into low single-digit comparable currency-neutral sales growth in line with the market and a mid-teen adjusted operating EBITDA margin over the next 3 years with a strong improvement in 2024. And while this will take time, we are seeing improvements in our volume performance, where we finished the quarter down mid-teens versus low 20% declines in Q2 of 2023. With this momentum, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver within our previously announced full year '23 sales guidance range and we are now targeting the mid- to high end of our full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range. As Glenn will highlight, we are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization and improvements across several parts of our business. Lastly, we've made important progress against our portfolio optimization initiatives as we are rapidly addressing our capital structure. Most notably, aligned with our best owner mindset, we announced an agreement to sell Lucas Meyer Cosmetics to specialty chemical company, Clariant, for $810 million, which is equivalent to a high teens multiple based on our projections. We expect to complete the transaction in the early part of the first quarter of 2024, and all proceeds will support our deleveraging priorities. Moving forward, we continue to pursue strategic noncore divestitures that will drive further deleverage and enable us to further prioritize our fastest-growing margin-accretive businesses and deliver long-term value for shareholders. Moving to Slide 7. In the third quarter, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales, representing a 3% decline on the comparable currency-neutral basis. A strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences was more than offset by softness in Nourish and Pharma Solutions. As I mentioned, volumes improved sequentially across nearly all businesses with particularly strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences. Excluding Functional Ingredients, which continues to disproportionately impact our results, overall volume declined low to single digits in the third quarter. Adjusted operating EBITDA for the quarter was $506 million, down 10% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Our favorable net price to inflation as well as enhanced productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes due primarily to temporary customer destocking and unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.89, primarily impacted by lower profitability. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide more detail on profitability and our performance by business segment. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Frank, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 8. As Frank mentioned, we delivered higher-than-expected EBITDA of $506 million in the third quarter. While we continue to benefit from favorable price to inflation and productivity gains, as you can see from the slide, ongoing volume pressures impacted our profitability in the quarter. While we are encouraged by the sequential volume improvement, we have seen across most of our portfolio, it remained the primary pressure in Q3. If we look at our profitability performance, absent the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory improvement program, adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 6% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Note that our negative absorption in the quarter was less than expected as our inventory reduction program for the year has run its course and volumes have improved. We have done a good job at driving working capital improvement through our inventory reduction program, driving more than $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of '22. As a result, at this time, we are now expecting approximately a $165 million impact from negative absorption to profitability for the full year, down from $180 million. This could also flex further as the fourth quarter unfolds. To reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward. Turning to Slide 9. I'll provide a closer look at our Q3 performance by business segment. In Nourish, sales declined 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven mainly by the continued weakness in Functional Ingredients. While Functional Ingredients remained a main driver of weakness in Nourish in the third quarter, we did see sequential improvement and expect this to continue as we move into the fourth quarter. Good growth in our Flavors business and the positive impact of IFF's ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives were more than offset by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Together, this led to a 26% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Health & Bioscience continued to deliver strong results in Q3, led by meaningful growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Grain Processing, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition leading to comparable currency-neutral growth of 2% year-over-year. Price increases and productivity gains led to a 12% year-over-year increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent was once again our strongest performer, delivering 7% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, Scent also saw strong 19% growth in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA with profitability driven by favorable net pricing and productivity gains. Pharma Solutions growth rate was pressured this quarter, in large part due to a very strong prior year comparison with a 28% 2022 sales growth comparison and a 76% '22 adjusted operating EBITDA comparison. Price increases and productivity gains for this business were more than offset by lower volumes and comparable currency neutral sales declined 9% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 34% in the quarter. Now on Slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $795 million, a significant increase, reflecting a strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx year-to-date was $390 million or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our inventory reduction program and working capital improvements have also greatly contributed to IFF's improved free cash flow performance, which totaled $405 million, a significant increase of $320 million from the second quarter. Year-to-date, we also distributed $619 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $652 million, which includes $23 million in assets held for sale. Additionally, gross debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.3 billion, with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.6x. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion. We are making good progress on working down our debt levels. And as Frank mentioned earlier, portfolio optimization remains a near-term priority as we work to reduce our leverage position and ensure our resources are focused on the businesses that will carry our success into the future. The sale of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, which is expected to close in the early part of the first quarter 2024 will further support our strength in capital structure as we pay down debt in line with our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA targets. Now on Slide 11, I would like to focus on our consolidated outlook for the rest of the year. First, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, which reflects the improved momentum we are seeing across the majority of our business and accounts for the macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange impact, which we expect will persist through the end of the year. On the bottom line, we are now expecting to deliver full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA at the mid to high end of our previously announced guidance of $1.85 billion to $2 billion, driven primarily by favorable price to inflation and improved productivity. We also now expect full year interest expense to be slightly higher at approximately $450 million. Our projected effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, the same estimate we provided last quarter. Finally, as we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an improving trend in the majority of our businesses as we navigate the macroeconomic challenges impacting our industry. We are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization improvements across several parts of our business. As we near the end of the year, I know many of you have questions on 2024. While the macroeconomic environment remains volatile with low visibility, we are optimistic heading into the new year. We have several known one-off items that we have high level of confidence will be tailwinds, including significant negative absorption related to our successful inventory reduction program and onetime Locust Bean Kernel inventory write-down. Also, we will continue to execute on our cost and productivity initiatives and have a carryover benefit from this year's restructuring program. These, of course, will be partially offset by a reset of our annual incentive compensation program where we have reduced payments in 2023 related to our performance versus target. In the end, improved volume performance will be critical to our success, and we believe that destocking will largely be done as we exit the year and we also believe we will benefit from acceleration of our strategic transformation initiatives. We will provide our 2024 guidance with our fourth quarter results, which we expect to be towards the end of February. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing remarks. Frank Clyburn : Thank you, Glenn. Let me start by saying that I am tremendously proud of what our teams have accomplished in the last quarter to advance our focused strategic initiatives and build a stronger, more resilient IFF. Our improved performance, productivity gains and reaffirmed financial guidance reflect the hard work of our global teams that continue to support our long-term vision. We executed against our strategic priorities in Q3, and we'll continue to take action in Q4 to build a stronger IFF, better positioned to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver value for shareholders. Finally, looking at our business more broadly, we will continue to pursue portfolio optimization initiatives to strengthen our capital structure. As we've discussed previously, we are laser-focused on investing in our highest-return businesses while positioning our less margin-accretive businesses for success, either through new ownership or through focused improvement plans, such as those we're pursuing for Functional Ingredients. Our goal, as we move through the end of 2023 and beyond is to ensure that each of our businesses has the resources and where appropriate, the ownership most conducive to accelerating our growth, expanding our margins and maximizing our long-term returns as we continue to innovate for customers worldwide. With that, I will now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther Zechmann : Frank, my question to you. Could you please talk about the development in the Functional Ingredients part of the business? It looks like a V-shaped recovery, but any color you could give around the moving parts within that business on the top line and the ramp-up, what you mentioned around the fixed cost measures that you're taking would be great. Frank Clyburn : Gunther, it\u2019s Frank. A couple of things. One, with regards to Functional Ingredients, the business clearly across all of ingredients is stabilizing, Gunther, and we saw good sequential improvement when I look at Q2 to Q3, in particular, in 3 of the biggest business lines, core texturants, some multipliers, sweeteners and protein solutions, good sequential improvement. So that\u2019s a very positive sign for us. And obviously, those products are going into some of our key dairy and bakery end market categories. As far as the Functional Ingredient plan overall, we\u2019re focused in 3 areas : one, enhance our go-to-market approach; two, drive operational efficiencies; and three, really reshaping the product portfolio. And since we\u2019ve announced we\u2019ve added targeted commercial professionals to pursue incremental opportunities with our customers, we\u2019ve also reviewed our organization and we\u2019re in the process of adjusting our operating model, Gunther, to drive greater efficiencies throughout. And at the same time, we have completed a full review of our product lines, and we\u2019re in the process of investing behind our strongest products as well as rationalizing those that are underperforming. Team is urgently acting to drive better performance across Functional Ingredients. And the net result of this Gunther will be \u2013 we\u2019re very confident we can grow sales in line with the market and deliver a mid-teen adjusted operating EBITDA margin over the next 3 years. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Mike Sison : Nice quarter. Frank, deleveraging is an important part of your thesis going forward. And can you maybe provide an update on your divestiture process? I think there's press out there that Pharma potentially is up for sale and how that fits in your strategy? Glenn Richter : Mike, it's Glenn. Why don't I attempt to start it, and then Frank can sort of add into it. So just we have been very transparent for many, many quarters that continue to enhance the portfolio, i.e., refine it is the key enabler of getting to our future leverage goals. We were pleased to announce in the quarter the sale of Lucas Meyers Cosmetics for $810 million gross proceeds. That should net about $730 million net. All of that will be used for divestitures. And the company went for a circa 18 multiple based on this year's forecast earnings. So we're pleased by that. We have a number of other additional portfolio actions underway. We have not publicly mentioned Pharma, but as you noted, it's in the press from that standpoint. We are confident that these actions will get us to where we need to, which is a 3x or less leverage ratio. Relative to your question around Pharma. Pharma is a very good business. It's a sticky business. It's in a very healthy sector in terms of the Pharma business. But candidly, it has relatively limited overlap in terms of end customers. For the rest of IFF, there are limited revenue or other synergies across the complex with Pharma. And to answer your question regarding how Pharma fits into our overall framework. As a reminder, Pharma was sort of in the middle of the pack in terms of ROIC. It has a relatively high-return business, which is the excipients, all that 75% and then has a lower return, more industrial business on that. So I think that -- I don't know, Frank, do you want to add anything else to that? Frank Clyburn : No, I think we can go. Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Nicola Tang : Actually, Frank and Glenn, you both commented that volume performance improved sequentially through Q3, and you pointed to signs of green shoots. So I was wondering if you could give more color either by division or by specific end markets in terms of where you're seeing that improvement? And what's your latest assessment of customer inventory levels overall, do you think that destocking is now behind us? Glenn Richter : Thanks for the question. It was interesting to see literally essentially every single sub-business within Nourish, H&B and Scent had a sequential improvement in volumes from Q2 to Q3. So it was very broad-based in terms of the performance improvements we saw. I\u2019d say, in general, the HPC categories were stronger from an absolute volume standpoint than the food and bev, which is not surprising given what\u2019s happening from a consumer demand standpoint. Pharma was the one exception. Pharma actually had volumes down. I would note, though, they had an incredibly strong third quarter of last year. They had a plus 12% in terms of volumes. So there\u2019s a bit of an overlap. We had converted a system in Q2 of last year. So there was a bit of a backlog of orders, which were cleared up in Q3. So a little bit of a normalization from the standpoint. Relative to your question on destocking, it\u2019s very difficult to say per se. However, our feedback from our business is, we would say that the majority of the customers at this point are either done or expected to be winding down by the end of the fourth quarter. I think the one segment that\u2019s a little bit of a lagger is Pharma. The Pharma business in terms of the customers started destocking a little bit later. It has a meaningful distributor component of the business as well and also the industrial side. And I think that\u2019s also been reflected very clearly in the competitive side for the Pharma business as well. So knock on wood, things are sort of moving very broad based across the entire business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. John Roberts : Scent benefited from favorable price versus raws. Was that both sequential and year-over-year? Are you getting more price sequentially? And how are you thinking about 2024? Glenn Richter : John, this is Glenn again. By the way, welcome to your new home. So relative to Scents, sequentially, it\u2019s relatively neutral, Q2 to Q3 in terms of the net price versus cost, although it is less moving, less price and more cost. So we\u2019re now seeing the effects of the deflation basically moving through more so. And year-over-year, slightly higher in the third quarter versus the second quarter. As a reminder, in our core markets being the consumer and Fine Fragrance, our final pricing actions were implemented at the beginning of this year. So really what we\u2019re now beginning to do \u2013 and there was some implementation in the second quarter of last year, so we\u2019re now sort of fully overlapped last year from a neutrality standpoint, and what we\u2019ll be seeing more is the cost reduction. One important asterisk, we have a percent of our business, as you know, that\u2019s basically sells ingredients. About 50% of the production is used for our own products and 50% sold. There\u2019s a commodity component such as turpentine as an example, Galaxolide, which is somewhat commoditized. So the pricing dynamic is a little bit more on a downward cycle given those categories. But in general, the net price cost is generally very stable in the Scent business. So thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : So I guess I'm curious about how you think about your volume performance relative to peers as it appears that they're still outgrowing you all. I suppose somewhat related maybe to the last question, but bigger picture, it looks like pricing was a much smaller contributor sequentially. Does that factor into how you think about volumes? And then just lastly, tied together, when do you think your sales can go back to the long-term algorithm? Frank Clyburn : Mark, it\u2019s Frank. Let me take that one. And a couple of things that I really wanted to highlight on this question. So first, we spent a lot of time, obviously, with our teams throughout the quarter and at the end of the quarter, looking at our competitive dynamics and how we are positioned. And to highlight, maybe if you could give me a minute just to walk through some of our key business lines. So Flavors, for instance, Mark, we actually grew the business this quarter. And feel very good about our performance, in particular, in North America and Greater Asia and a very well positioned against our competitive set. Health & Biosciences, you actually saw growth versus prior year, Mark, which was very encouraging. And in fact, you saw growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition. Home & Personal Care was a good growth quarter for us. Grain Processing, good growth from a sales perspective as well. And then if I look at our Scent business, our Scent business actually grew above market, Mark. Consumer Fragrance above market. So clearly growing market share there. And then also our Fine Fragrance business had good performance. So I feel really good about this Scent performance versus prior year. And then also as we\u2019ve already highlighted across just about all of our business lines, good sequential improvement. So when I look at our overall business, I feel really good about the sequential improvement. The one area that we do have disproportionate volume declines versus our competitors as we\u2019ve highlighted is Functional Ingredients. If you were to exclude Functional Ingredients, Mark, our volume would be down low single digits. So we feel as though we\u2019re well within our peer set there. And like I said, we feel very good about the majority of our business and how we\u2019re performing. And then the other one that we have highlighted, Mark, was with regards to Pharma. But Pharma, as we\u2019ve mentioned, had a very strong competitive quarter last year. So that\u2019s more of a competitive issue for us in this quarter compared to last quarter of last year. But all in all, Mark, we feel as though the overall business is sequentially improving and is in a really good position as we head into 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Frank, on Pharma Solutions, can you comment on the sequential margin decline? Was it more mix or more costs? And what does this mean for you, do you think for margins in Q4 and next year for Pharma? Frank Clyburn : Yes, David. So Pharma, as we mentioned, the comparison versus prior year, as we highlighted, was a 28% growth. Last year with a lot of shipment catch-up as we implemented in some SAP shipments that went into Q3 of \u201822. And then EBITDA growth last year was 76%. So that was the comparator versus last year. And obviously, you can see that we\u2019re down 9% on the top line this year because of that comparator. If you look sequentially, Mark, you do see some choppiness, as Glenn highlighted earlier. There are some distributors that are starting to rightsize inventory in this business. That is something that we see more of a destocking as we ended kind of Q3. And as we go into Q4, we anticipate that the inventory destocking will continue. With that said, we think it\u2019s temporary in nature. I have no concerns about the overall outlook for the Pharma business, very sticky business. Our core Pharma position is \u2013 what should I say, our core Pharma business is well positioned with our customers. So destocking by our distributors, rightsizing inventory, temporary in nature, and we feel good about the growth potential performance as we go into \u201824 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So Glenn, in your prepared remarks and hoping you could just maybe elaborate a little bit around some of the high-level puts and takes as they stand today for 2024 EBITDA versus 2023. Obviously, there's the absence of the inventory absorption charges, the inventory write-off in the second quarter. You've got headwinds on incentive comp, and if you can quantify that? It doesn't sound like there's a lot -- at this point, should we be thinking about a lot of price cost tailwinds? You're going to have the divestiture kind of impact. But can you help us think about productivity kind of savings that we should be kind of thinking about going into 2024 on a year-over-year basis? And then from there, is the major swing really just volumes and the operating leverage associated with that? Or is there anything else that you would highlight? Glenn Richter : Thank you, Adam. So let me kind of break that down into 2 components. One, just normalizing, I\u2019ll say, the onetime items from this year into next year and then talk a little bit about 2024. In terms of normalizing this year, first thing you do is you have to take out $75 million of EBITDA related to divestitures. So that\u2019s roughly 6 months of Savory Solutions and then FSI, or Fragrance Specialty Ingredients business. And then basically a full year directionally for LMC, that\u2019s about $75 million in earnings. In addition, you have to add back the impact of absorption which goes away. That absorption is related to the inventory reduction. So as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve taken out nearly $600 million of volume-related inventory this year. That\u2019s about $165 million benefit. On top of that, the LBK write-off in the second quarter was $44 million. And then lastly, in terms of sort of add normal items, I would add about $25 million of additional benefit associated with the annualization of our headcount reduction program this year. Offsetting that, as you mentioned, is roughly $70 million-ish of basically truing up our incentive plans back to 100% given this is a challenging year, they\u2019ll pay out at a lower percentage. So those are the normalized items I would take the sort of baseline the 2023 results. Candidly, relative to \u201824, we are \u2013 we\u2019ll be prepared to have a very fulsome discussion at the February call. We\u2019re in mid-planning process right now. We\u2019re working with all the businesses in terms of their plans from volume, net price, procurement on deflation, productivity programs, et cetera. So it\u2019s a little early to talk about those components at this point, but we promise you, we\u2019ll have a very detailed discussion in February. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Patrick Cunningham : Just a follow-up on positive absorption or just absorption coming off next year. What percentage of the portfolio is build-to-order versus build-to-stock? And are there any specific businesses where that split is skewed towards one or the other? Glenn Richter : Yes. And I wouldn't say that those that are built-to-order don't have absorption impact because they do. But to answer your question, we're roughly 55% build-to-stock, 45% build-to-order in terms of the overall portfolio. So the build-to-stock is more the legacy DuPont or N&B portfolio versus a legacy FNF for the build-to-order. So as a result, that Nourish is split, probably slightly more build-to-stock and build-to-order, but a combination of the Ingredients business, the food systems and then the -- obviously, the Flavors business, the H&B and Pharma businesses are largely build-to-stock and the Scent business is largely build-to-order. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was curious if you guys could talk a little bit about pricing. Pricing in the quarter came through a bit stronger, I think, than we had anticipated. And so just curious about that because I didn't think that there was any incremental pricing going through. So maybe it was just sort of stickiness, but would love some detail on that. Glenn Richter : Yes. It\u2019s more related to deflation than price per se. Pricing \u2013 actually, all of our pricing was implemented earlier this year. We really have not been implementing any more pricing actions this year. So it\u2019s really been the favorability associated with deflation that enhance our earnings versus expectations. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : So I was just wondering if you could give an update on free cash flow. What your expectations are for this year now? And just given you scaled back your inventory, I guess your manufacturing headwind from inventory adjustments, does that mean you're done? Or is there more opportunistic inventory reduction to do to shore up free cash flow further? Glenn Richter : So the second part \u2013 Josh, this is Glenn. So the second part of your question, we are largely done with the inventory reductions. We\u2019re basically going to be largely flatlined for the balance of the year. Relative to our free cash flow estimates for the year, they are unchanged versus our previous quarter. We will be, call it, circa $450 million on reported free cash flow for the year. I will note, once again, that includes about $440 million-ish of Reg G items. So we\u2019re right around $900 million of adjusted free cash flow for the year. Just as a reminder of those Reg G items, they\u2019re broken down into about a little over half of them, call it, about $240 million are literally associated with our divestitures. A big portion of those are taxes, not surprisingly. We also have another roughly $80 million of the final integration costs. Those are associated with systems conversion and legal entity changes from DuPont. Those will be completed this year. And then there\u2019s about $75 million-ish related to restructure. That\u2019s from the implementation of this year, and then, call it, $50 million-ish sort of all other related expenses. So that\u2019s sort of a breakdown of the Reg G items. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Can you update how much of your business ex Pharma is in the fix or shift category? And how much it needs to improve in aggregate or on average for you to be happy with it? I mean like not just like a minimum threshold, but what your like 3- to 5-year target might be? Glenn Richter : When you reference fix or shift, I'm assuming you're talking about the Ingredients business, so is that correct? Laurence Alexander : Most of it, but I guess I'm fishing for if you have anything else that you're now putting in that category? Glenn Richter : That's largely -- it's 90% of it. And as we mentioned, that business is of our total businesses about 20% to 25% of the total portfolio. And Frank outlined on the call previously, the major initiatives. It will take some time to fully implement those initiatives. So we are seeing some progression improvement in the business. But we're ways away from sort of getting back to sort of the full historical level of both earnings profile and growth. Our target is to go from largely a high single-digit EBITDA margin level to mid-teens and to basically get the business basically growing in line with the industry which historically has been sort of on a volume basis, 1% to 2% a year. Frank Clyburn : And this is Frank. What I would add is on that 20% Glenn mentions and a number of those have \u2013 assets have been disposed and we continue down the path of optimizing our portfolio as we\u2019ve highlighted. And then within Functional Ingredients, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we are making good progress, as I highlighted earlier, and that\u2019s really where the majority of the improvement area needs to be. But I don\u2019t want to lose also sight of the 80% or so of the businesses we\u2019ve been highlighting today that has seen good sequential improvement in a number of businesses that actually grew versus prior year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Silke Kueck : Is there a $70 million SG&A benefit this year from the compensation changes? And did most of that occur in the third quarter? And secondly, if there's a $160 million headwind from unfavorable manufacturing absorption, which is 150 basis points headwind to gross margin. Do you expect as a base case, your gross margin to be up by 150 basis points next year? And do you need volume growth in order to achieve that? Glenn Richter : I think to the second question, you should definitely normalize the absorption as a starting point. The ultimate margin dynamics for next year, which we\u2019ll discuss in more detail in February, will be a combination of mix, volume growth and ultimately, any additional sort of price inflationary pressures. So it\u2019s a complex. I don\u2019t think you can just straight line the improvement. I think you can reset the baseline, but then you have to sort of think through all the variables of what\u2019s driving the gross margin rate for next year. So we\u2019ll park that, come back to that in February. The $70 million that we've referenced really are the savings from headcount reductions we've implemented this year. So as a reminder, there was a program that where we\u2019ve targeted $100 million of annualized cost reduction, so roughly $70 million, $75 million of that this year and then about $25 million will be the annualized impact. It\u2019s all been implemented. So it\u2019s all done. So it\u2019s really just a timing element of that. And then lastly, there\u2019s always some choppiness quarter-to-quarter because of accruals around variable incentives. So depending on up or down, things can get trued up and can be a little bit choppy. So that does affect the quarter-to-quarter RSA as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : Yes. I wanted to ask if you can remind us a little bit your exposure to some of the key soybean -- sorry, well, to the soybean price as well as to key oil seeds, vegetable oils? And whether the recent -- previously decline in some of these edible oils can be a meaningful contributor to '24 EBITDA? Glenn Richter : I would say 2 things. We have a very, very large basket of raws. So there\u2019s lots of things moving in either direction. In general, the cost trends or deflation trends are working in our favor. So that\u2019s a general statement. Relative to soy, we do actually lock in over time. We typically hedge out for a period. So we don\u2019t necessarily always capture either the immediate upside or downside, but over the longer arc, obviously, as those prices decline, we capture it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Keches with Barclays. Andrew Keches : Congrats on the quarter. Just to confirm, in the past, you've mentioned the 3.0x net debt-to-EBITDA as a level you plan to hit in 2024. So I guess just based on where you are in the asset sale discussions, do you still have confidence and visibility into achieving that level next year? Or is there some risk that, that gets extended? I know the covenant horizon was pushed out about a year to early '26. So any help on the time line would be great. Glenn Richter : We are -- great question, Andrew. We're very confident that relative to our current M&A activity in the market, it will allow us to accomplish our goal of 3x or less. And it should be -- we should be able to accomplish it by the end of next year. This is always a -- there's always, I'll say, a timing element relative to closing transactions given the separation, legal entity changes, those sort of things. But barring sort of a normal path, we should be in good shape by the end of next year. Operator : That will conclude the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Frank for closing remarks. Frank Clyburn : So first, I want to start by thanking all of our IFF FERC colleagues around the world and all of the tremendous work that they are focused on to really help our customers and to continue to innovate. Our vision as a company is truly to be the innovative leader in essential solutions, and we\u2019re very proud of the progress that we\u2019re making through this quarter. And I also want to thank everyone for joining our call. We look forward to our fourth quarter update and full year guidance for \u201824 update in February, and I wish everyone well, and thanks for joining our call. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",

Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to get all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth Quarter and full year 2023 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the results can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release both of which can be found on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik. Erik Fyrwald : Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today. I would like to begin by sharing some initial perspectives since joining IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a look at the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full year 2024. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A. Now I officially joined IFF on February 6th, and I have been impressed by the world-class teams globally and the strong innovation across our company. I spent the last few weeks visiting our operations and teams in some of our U.S. and overseas businesses. I spent that time listening to our teams, meeting many of our customers, and assessing the current status of our businesses. IFF has a proud history as a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions and a great platform from which-to-build and expand our partnerships with customers across the value chain to help them create leading consumer products. I believe in our purpose to help create a better world through science and creativity applied to sustainably meet customer and consumer needs. The opportunity we have ahead of us is very big, and that is why I joined IFF. We have solid businesses and will take the actions needed to unleash our full potential to start to deliver profitable market share gains by bringing great innovation to win with our customers. A perfect example of this is in our scent business, where we have been outperforming competition, something we must do also across our other businesses. IFF also has other high-quality businesses such as flavors and health and biosciences where we will leverage our innovation to deliver higher growth rates with very attractive profitability. And in some of our challenge businesses, such as functional ingredients, with focus and attention, we can significantly improve performance. In both instances, we will do so by putting the business first, eliminating unnecessary processes and overhead, driving empowerment and strong leadership. And by doing so, IFF will be a more innovative and customer-centric organization that will be effective and efficient. We also must be better executors, focus the IFF team away from distractions to continuously grow market share across all our businesses, put more of our investments into our high-return businesses and transformative R&D initiatives and our IT infrastructure, and achieve our capital structure targets by reducing outstanding debt. And when we do this, over time, I see strong upside and value creation for all IFF's stakeholders. Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through the achievements and factors that marked IFF's progress through the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Now, throughout the past year, IFF FERC [ph] have continued to take important steps to strengthen our financial and operational foundation and position this company to deliver value for the near, mid, and long-term. Our performance in the fourth quarter demonstrates progress. While reported sales were down, comparable currency-neutral sales increased 1% and comparable currency-neutral EBITDA grew 17% with an adjusted margin expansion of 260 basis points. We've also seen notable improvements in volume trends across the majority of our business segments in the second half of the year, enabling us to perform within previously stated guidance ranges for full year 2023 sales and adjusted operating EBITDA. Now, with this progress and the improving performance through the second half of 2023, we exited the year on solid footing, and we are optimistic about our ability to build on this momentum and are targeting getting back to year-on-year growth for the full year 2024 while strengthening for 2025 and beyond. Now, as I said earlier, we are committed to reducing our level of debt. We have therefore announced an update to our dividend policy to reduce the quarterly dividend by approximately 50% to $0.40 per share. This is not a decision the board and management have taken lightly, as we know the dividend is important to shareholders. However, it will enable us to reduce debt faster, strengthening our capital structure, which will create additional long-term value. This will also give the company greater financial flexibility, which will, when required, give us the ability to make more high-return growth investments. I'll now turn it over to Glenn. Glenn? Glenn Richter : Thank you, Erik, and hello, everyone. Moving to slide seven, as Erik mentioned, the board and management have taken this opportunity to accelerate the improvement of our capital structure as we work towards our deleveraging target of three times net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, we reduced our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. We believe this dividend change provides a dividend yield that is consistent with industry peers and is aligned with IFF's long-term cash flow generation and target payouts. The dividend remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, and we expect this new base to grow alongside our profit over time. IFF remains committed to providing competitive returns to our shareholders and firmly believes these actions set us up for more durable value creation in the long-term. Now, on slide eight, as Erik mentioned, our performance for the fourth quarter reflects the operational and strategic initiatives that our team has implemented over the last several months to deliver strong results amid an uncertain operating environment. Despite some continued challenges in the market, volume trends continue to improve sequentially, with increases in nearly all businesses resulting in growth for total IFF. IFF generated $2.7 billion in sales, representing a 1% increase in comparable currency-neutral sales. This improvement reflected strong growth in our scent business with continued volume pressure in Nourish and Pharma, both impacted by de-stocking. Volumes continue to improve sequentially from down mid-single digits in Q3 to down low single digits in Q4, and if excluding the impact of functional ingredients, volumes for the fourth quarter would have increased low single digits. Adjusted operating EBITDA total $461 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We also realized a year-over-year increase of approximately 260 basis points to our comparable currency-neutral-adjusted operating EBITDA margin. This growth in EBITDA was supported by both internal steps IFF has taken, including continued gains and efficiencies from our productivity initiatives and favorable net pricing. Before moving on, I wanted to share that we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter related to our nourish business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to lower business projections due to volume declines, mainly in functional ingredients, continued cost inflation, and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Now moving to slide nine, taking a closer look at our profitability performance for the fourth quarter, we delivered $461 million, which equates to a robust comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 17%. I'm happy to report that in Q4, IFF realized strong productivity gains and in conjunction with favorable net price to inflation, helped us overcome ongoing volume pressures to deliver against our objectives. Importantly, IFF has remained focused on executing upon our productivity program to improve our operational effectiveness and efficiency. In 2023, we continued to launch additional steps as part of these programs while also making strategic investments in key growth areas. Now on slide 10, I'll provide a closer look at our performance by business segment during the quarter. In nourish, sales declined 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis as strong growth in flavors was offset by continued softness in functional ingredients. While functional ingredients remained the main driver of weakness for nourish in the quarter, it is worth noting that we again saw meaningful sequential improvement. In terms of profitability, the positive impact from our ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives drove improvements and led to a 3% increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Health & Biosciences continues to show robust top and bottom line growth. Price increases, volume growth and productivity gains led to growth across most H&B business segments led by double-digit growth in health. Overall, H&B delivered a comparable currency-neutral sales increase of 5% year-over-year and a 35% year-over-year increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our scent segment continued to deliver a very strong performance in Q4, including 11% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales, driven by double-digit growth in consumer fragrance, as well as mid-single-digit growth in Fine fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, scent also saw significant growth in adjusted operating EBITDA, increasing 34% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by favorable net pricing, volume, and productivity gains. While Pharma Solutions experienced significant pricing and productivity gains, these improvements were offset by lower volume, driven primarily by continued de-stocking trends, as well as strong year-ago comparison. This led to comparable currency-neutral sales declining 10% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declining 13% in the quarter. Turning to slide 11, I'll discuss our progress in improving our cash flow and leveraged positions. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $1.44 billion, a significant increase from the previous year, reflecting the strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx of the year was $503 million, or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our progress on working capital improvement, led by an intense focus on right-sizing our inventories, helped enhance our free cash flow position, which saw a sequential increase of over $500 million, totaling $936 million for the full year and ahead of expectations. Included in our free cash flow is about $430 million of costs, primarily related to integration and transaction-related items. We also delivered $826 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $729 million, including $26 million in assets held for sale in Q4. Additionally, we realized a $200 million sequential reduction in gross debt, which totaled approximately $10.1 billion for the quarter, with a net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA a 4.5 times, our trailing 12-month credit-adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion. With the announced sale of our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics business, which we still expect to close in the first quarter of 2024, the right-sizing of our quarterly dividend and additional portfolio actions we are planning to make, we are taking decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet and achieve our leveraged targets. On slide 12, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Due to a combination of improvements across our business and in the broader market toward the tail end of 2023, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. For the full year 2024, we expect sales in the range of $10.8 billion to $11.1 billion. This reflects our prudent approach to volume expectations and the impact of modest negative pricing in 2024, which is largely isolated to more price-competitive categories such as functional ingredients and fragrance ingredients, given lower input costs and competitive dynamics. We expect overall pricing to decline approximately 2.5% in 2024, following a 10% increase in 2022 and a 6% increase in 2023. Strategically, we believe this will position us to be more cost-competitive in the market and allow us to regain market share in select businesses. In terms of volume, the visibility to the degree and pace of the recovery remains a bit fluid and has been explicitly incorporated in our 0% to 3% range. The most significant variable impacting this range will be the pace of recovery in functional ingredients. However, this is a marked improvement from 2023, where we finished down mid-single digits and '22 we were down low single digits, as we believe our industry will return to more normalized growth rates. On the bottom line, we expect to deliver full year '24 adjusted operating EBITDA between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our guidance assumes not just improved volumes from 2023, but also solid profitability and a margin expansion across our segments. We are hyper-focused on continuing to execute our productivity initiatives to help mitigate expected inflation, primary labor costs, and incentive compensation reset, while continuing to reinvest in the higher-return businesses. It's also worth noting, we have some benefit of one-time items such as the negative impact in 2023 from the inventory reduction program and the previously announced write-down of inventory related to Locust Bean Kernel or LBK that will not repeat in 2024. In particular, there was an approximately $130 million impact from the negative absorption in 2023 related to our inventory reduction program and some volume declines, which is down from an estimated $165 million we provided in the third quarter. A portion of this will be offset by higher annual incentive compensation expense as we reset our payout to target levels in 2024. While there's still work to do, efforts to bolster our financial profile and portfolio are providing effective, and while its hard to predict the timing and details of the market recovering and its impact on our results, we see opportunity for improvement in 2024 with all divisions targeting better volumes, with improvements in profitability and margin expansion across all four divisions. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million to $500 million. Throughout 2024, we will be relentlessly focused on our efforts to optimize our portfolio, improve financial performance, and reach our deleveraging targets. I'm confident that the actions taken in 2023 and our outlook for improving performance in 2024 will position IFF to capture significant value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Erik for closing remarks. Erik Fyrwald : Thank you, Glenn. I'm truly excited to be joining IFF during this transformative time for the company. I have long admired IFF as the category-defining leader in the industry, and it's an honor to be able to work alongside our talented global teams to help us navigate and even thrive at a critical moment for our company and our industry. Through robust efforts from our teams worldwide and shared commitment to putting the customer at the center of all we do, IFF will continue strengthening our commercial execution and become a more nimble and efficient organization. Our global teams made progress towards ensuring we can meet the evolving needs of our customers and deliver industry-competitive returns, and we will accelerate the progress going forward. While 2023 was a challenging year, our financial results in the fourth quarter highlight an improving trend. Based on this performance and some improving market conditions, we are expecting a return to volume growth this year, which should enable EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our updated dividend policy and the additional divestitures we continue to work on reflects our commitment to improve our capital structure. While the global economic landscape is uncertain, IFF will be focused on strengthening our execution, and as I said, we have work to do to improve our businesses and achieve our vision, but I am confident we are well-positioned to build on our progress and create sustainable value for all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond. I'd like to thank our teams and partners for welcoming me to IFF and look forward to seeing what we'll achieve in 2024. With that, I'd like to now open the call for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, guys. Good morning. And Erik, first off, congrats on your new role. Erik Fyrwald : Thank you. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess my question is on your fiscal year '24 EBITDA guidance, and I'm hoping that you can sort of bridge on a year-over-year basis the differential between '24 and '23. And also, Glenn, highlight what changed relative to the variances you highlighted from your three-queue conference call back in November, apart from just the fixed-cost absorption you cited. And if you could also just give us a sense as to what the embedded volumes are by segment as it relates to the low-single-digit volume guidance for '24? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Sure. Yes, good morning, Ghansham. Easily done and a frequently asked question. So if you'll indulge me, I'll start with last year's results at 1980. There are two adjustments to get that to a normalized basis. One is the divestitures, which you're aware of. It's a half a year of savory solutions in FSI, and the LMC will be closed at the end of the quarter, so it's roughly three-quarters of LMC. That's roughly $78 million of normalized impact. And the other factor, which is the same, basically, we had discussed before, we also have included our updated view of foreign exchange, that's $50 million reduction. I'm not sure that was previously discussed from a standpoint. So that gets to a like-for-like base of $18.50. Our volume mix impact for this year is forecasted to be $170 million positive. That is inclusive of the $130 million of positive overlap on absorption. As we noted on our call, that actually came down as the fourth quarter volumes were higher from a production standpoint, so that was slightly different than we had guided. Our net price for the year is basically is zero. That is inclusive of the $44 million of LBK, so that's netted in that number. We can certainly talk more about the pricing dynamics this year. Then we have about a $35 million reset for AIP, so that's a negative, but that's better than we thought. We thought that would be in the 70 range from the standpoint. So I think all of the one-timers being absorption slightly lower, the negative reset on AIP is slightly lower, FX is new, and then the deals basically were all known. The last items are sort of wage, inflation, that's about $120 million, and the productivity is about $150 million in the P&L, so that's sort of consistent with our three-year view. So that adds up to the midpoint of our range of $2 billion. And then relative to the volume question, I think it's very simple to think about our view of this year. The functional ingredients, which is circa less than 25% of the business, we are projecting that to be relatively flattish for the year. All the other businesses actually have growth directly in the 2% to 3% range on a full year basis, a little bit more slower in the beginning of the year and ramping up in the latter, but that's why we mentioned. As we think about that range of guidance, it's functional ingredients is the area that probably gives us the most pause and we've been the most cautious, and that sort of is the difference between the high end of the 3% versus the 0% range. So hopefully that answers the question. Operator : Thank you. Glenn Richter : Next question. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open. Josh Spector : Hi. Good morning. Glenn Richter : Hi, Josh. Josh Spector : Hey. So I just wanted to -- hey, so I wanted to ask on the dividend. So I think it's been pretty clear that it's been a pretty big use of cash for a couple of years now. So, really the question is, why was now the right time versus when you looked at that probably a year ago or maybe two years ago? And what does that mean as it relates to the divestment strategy or timing? Has anything changed as you think about what's next? Erik Fyrwald : So this is Erik. First of all, I wasn't here a year ago, obviously, but I did arrive on February 6th, looked at our entire situation, talked to Glenn and his team, talked to the board, and made the decision to go ahead and cut the dividend now. I think it's a wise move in terms of our overall balance sheet efforts to get our balance sheet in great shape, and it doesn't impact the divestment timing or strategy. We continue to work on our portfolio optimization, but obviously we're focused even more on working on strengthening the businesses, increasing our earnings and cash flow. Operator : Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : Next question. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Alliance Bernstein. Your line is now open. Gunther Zechmann : Hi, and Erik, welcome back to the public market as well. Erik, what are your priorities for this year? I appreciate you've only been in the role for a few weeks, but for this year maybe also beyond when I think about the portfolio and the balance sheet, please. And in addition, how do you think about IFF's midterm targets? And lastly, Glenn, what is your free cash flow guidance for 2024, please? Erik Fyrwald : Thank you, Gunther, and glad to be back in the public market. My priorities for 2024, I should say, our priorities for 2024 are to continue the portfolio optimization work and have that be part of improving our balance sheet. But again, more importantly, we're going to strengthen each business. We're going to make sure that each business is clear on how they can strengthen their customer focus to profitably grow market share, strengthen the R&D and innovation in each business so that we better delight customers with our innovation so that we bring innovation that they value, that we can grow our market share with them. And then thirdly, we're going to keep driving productivity and strengthen productivity in each business unit and then also corporately. We want a very effective and efficient back office. What will reduce the amount of engagement we've had with consultants, advisors, and others that have caused us to be too internally focused. We're going to get back to focus on winning with the businesses by better serving our customers than our competition. In terms of how I'm thinking about the midterm targets, it's too early for me to comment, but I'll look at them with the team here and we'll do it by business and then we'll roll it up for the company and we'll get back to you in the not too distant future on that, but on the last one, Glenn? Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey, good morning, Gunther. Our projected free cash flow for this year is $500 million. I would note that that's inclusive and an expectation of $100 million of taxes for the sale of LMC and carryover for savory and then another $100 million for other restructure one-time items. So there's 200 of Reg G, but net of the 200, we're at $500 million for your free cash flow. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. And Erik, congratulations on your role. Erik, two things. Erik Fyrwald : Thanks David. David Begleiter : First, can you comment on pressure ports that a sales process for pharma solutions is underway? And secondly, in addition, it's 2.5% reduction in pricing you're forecasting in '24. All the pricing you expect to give up versus the roughly 19% pricing you've achieved over the last three years on a cumulative basis? Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : I'll take the first one, and, Glenn, you can have the second piece, because I'm not that familiar with the details at this point, but I'm getting into it. But in terms of any portfolio optimization, we're not going to comment on rumors. All I can tell you is we continue to work on portfolio optimization, and we will not sell a business at a price that doesn't make sense, but we're looking at what does make sense for IFF and for our employees and any business that we might consider divesting. So with that, Glenn? Glenn Richter : Yes, thanks. Good morning once again, David. As you point out, we've got three years of very significant pricing to reflective of the inflation environment of 18%, 19% cumulatively. 2.5% is all we're anticipating. That actually reflects sort of overall price decline. So as I mentioned, that price is sort of zero in our P&L. It is highly concentrated in the functional ingredients and the scent ingredient space. And we've been extremely surgical in terms of where we needed to give it back. And at this point, we're pretty much locked in to most of our pricing for the year at this point. So that actually feels like a pretty safe number relative to the plan. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Lisa De Neve : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So the question I have is two-fold. I mean, how is IFF positioned versus peers? I mean, does it expect to go in line with the market, in line with its direct peers, or believe that it's actually better positioned and this year, but also maybe more structurally? And next to that, how should we really think about delivery of the functional ingredients optimization and efficiency program for this year? And I have a small follow-up on the pricing. So on the negative pricing in fragrance ingredients, have your customers come back for pricing here? And are your peers offering the same price reductions or comparable price reductions? Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : Thank you, Lisa. And I'll take the first part of that question. I've looked very hard at the data over the last five years, and clearly we have underperformed, as all of you know. We have pockets of strength, scent as an example I mentioned in the opening comments, but we have some businesses that are challenged, like food ingredients. What I can tell you is we're going to have each business be very clear on what is their strategy to win. How are they going to delight their customer set and make sure that we profitably grow our market share? How are we going to make sure that we have our innovation targeted and needs the customer's value? And how are we going to make sure we're driving productivity? So each of the business end-to-end, how do we drive the businesses? And as you know, we've got strong businesses in great markets, like our flavors and our fragrances or scent business, terrific businesses that should be able to fully compete with margins and growth rates with Givaudan and others. We've got a strong business unit in Health & Biosciences in great markets, and we should be able to fully compete with margins and growth against Novonesis. In our challenged businesses, we've got very good markets in food ingredients and protein solutions, and we should be able to be fully competitive with Kerry and other food ingredient players. And we've got a very good business and very good markets with pharmaceutical ingredients, and we need to be fully competitive with our ingredients set there, Ashland and others. So, we have not performed as a company, across the company in the last five years like we should. In the next five years, we'll get back on track. Glenn Richter : Hey, Lisa, this is Glenn. Let me address your second question regarding functional ingredients. So from past conversations, 2021-'22, we had a number of missteps on our part that caused this business to step backwards. Since that, we've been working on basically four major items. One, getting service levels up to the right standard. I'm happy to say for the last year plus, service levels have been at 95% plus across all the business and across the entire globe. Secondly and perhaps most importantly, is getting volume back on track, which is combination of our sales execution pipeline. As we mentioned, that has dramatically picked up over the last year in getting our pricing right in the market, we just talked about that. We've been very smart this year thinking about market-by-market, product-by-product, what makes sense to be competitive, to win and retain business. We feel much better about that. The third item has really been around sort of our general go-to-market strategy, and as Erik has mentioned, be much more focused across the ingredients team, making sure that they own the results. Lastly, it's cost. So we have been really focusing on all of the costs, but largely the 85% that sits in cost of goods. So it's skew rationalization, raw material consolidation, manufacturing footprint consolidation, taking out fixed costs, et cetera, and we're making very good progress. We are seeing successive improvements in volume quarter-to-quarter. Q2 last year was a low watermark. We're actually moving into sort of flattish as we start this year, and we're also continuing to see good expansion in margin. So we have a lot of work to do, as Erik mentioned, but we're beginning to see some progress in terms of what we've been doing. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Nicola Tang : Hi, everyone. I just wanted to pick up on a few topics that were just asked by Lisa. On this pricing side, I was wondering if you could give a bit more detail on this expected price declines in functional ingredients and in fragrance ingredients, and whether you could expand on your comment on competitive dynamics in these markets. And then, in addition, on the volume side, I was wondering why you don't expect more in terms of year-on-year volume improvement bearing in mind, I mean, I guess the headwind of de-stocking and inflation that are clearly in the base in 2023? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Thanks. Two very good questions. So on the pricing of our 2.5%, 80% of our downward pricing is concentrated in functional ingredients and the scent ingredients business. Those areas, by definition, are more commoditized, and in addition, those areas have seen some more meaningful deflation in terms of commodities. So it's natural. As I mentioned previously, we were doing a very good job of making sure we're competitive in the market by product, by region, and we feel good that that 2.5% sort of is reflective of the environment. The second question regarding why are we not more optimistic? Honestly, we're just cautious. We're very cautious and prudent given the environment. The last year was extremely bumpy. We do believe that de-stocking for most of our business is largely behind us, and we're seeing positive signs, but we need a couple of quarters of positive momentum, I think, and stabilization before we can move from cautious to optimistic. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is now open. John Roberts : And welcome back, Erik, two-part or if I could. Is the functional ingredients business significantly different today than when you were at DuPont? It sounds like you think it's just more of a cyclical problem that can be addressed through productivity, but do you think there are structural changes you need to make there? And then, your predecessor was targeting going from four segments to three segments. Have you gone back to the whiteboard to start over on those plans, or was that nearing completion and there's just some fine-tuning left to complete it? Erik Fyrwald : Thanks, John. And let me start with the first one. The makeup of our functional ingredients business is better than what it was when I had responsibility for that as part of agriculture and nutrition back at DuPont a number of years ago. So I believe our potential is significantly higher than it was then. I think that it's in a very good market. I think we've underperformed. And I think we've underperformed because we've been too internally focused. We've had lots of consultants. We've had lots of advisors talking about helping us to figure out what to do around synergies. And what I can tell you is, I've been in these businesses for many, many years, these types of businesses. The goal was not synergy. Synergy is a tool. The goal is to have a very clear strategy for our functional ingredients business. How are we going to profitably grow our market share with customers by delighting the customers with our solutions approach, with our innovation, and then do that in a productive way with our assets and our functions, very productive. We have the potential to significantly improve the performance of this business. I've spent time with our business leaders. I think they're headed in the right direction and we're going to further accelerate the progress and make sure that we profitably grow our food ingredients business and fully compete with our competitors, the leading competitors in food ingredients, because we have so much value to bring customers. If we do it right, when we do it right, we'll have a very good business. And then, in terms of the organization structure, no decisions today, but what I will tell you is I'm a big fan of business units that have end-to-end accountability and responsibility to drive all the levers of the P&L, making sure that everything we do is to delight customers, profitably grow our market share, but do it in a way that's efficient and effective so each business unit can win. And I find when business units are winning, all of a sudden synergies become clearer and become more powerful and easier to access. So we're going to ensure that our businesses are on the right track and that our synergies are additive to further strengthen each of our businesses. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good morning. Erik, welcome back. Glenn, two questions from my side, please. Your Health & Bio segment margin was the best in more than three years. Can you just maybe rank order the drivers of the improvement there? And more importantly is the 30% plus level sustainable into 2024. And then secondly, what are your input cost trends and the outlook that you're baking into your guidance for this year? Glenn Richter : Yes, so I think for the H&B had a very good year and that was a result of a progressive improvement in volumes. As we noted, the health business, one of our largest segments, actually had a very good fourth quarter. Secondarily, productivity, so we've driven a lot of productivity across the business. And third, really net price. So there's been -- to your second question, a decline in input cost in that business as well. So that got us to the 30% range for the business. I did note on the call that we are anticipating H&B like all four of our businesses that demonstrate both EBITDA growth and margin expansion this year. So we expect that to be the case for H&B. In general, our input costs, as I mentioned, are anticipated to be down this year. Energy is flattish at this point, logistics are down, and we're seeing some raw materials deflation. As a reminder, it takes about four months for a purchase to run through the balance sheet. So that's a positive momentum. That's a net zero, as I mentioned, for the overall enterprise for the year. So thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. If end markets do not cooperate, can you provide more granularity on how you can de-lever in 2024 and 2025 in terms of reviewing business lines, Brexit, productivity relative to comp and so forth? And Erik, given your initial impressions on IFF operating culture and discussion around productive solutions, can you speak more to the mindset around productivity and R&D? Is it more about operational fixes, or do you see structural or philosophical issues around how the firm has targeted ROIC margins or profit growth? Glenn Richter : Yes, thanks. This is Glenn. I'll answer the first part of your question. In general, we're pretty cautious on our outlook on volume. So we're, as I mentioned, flattish to three. So we haven't expected a giant recovery this year in our base case. So that's kind of a starting point. In the absence of that materializing, we have been very good at delivering productivity, as Erik mentioned in his opening comments. We are accelerating both ongoing efforts, and we have additional efforts underway to take costs out that aren't reflected in the plan. So that would be my second comment. Relative to the de-leverage, so that gives you some sense on the earnings profile and offsets if there's additional softness in the external market. The de-leverage will largely be accomplished through divestitures. As Erik mentioned, we are on path. We feel very good in terms of our activities underway, and we do think we'll accomplish our targeted divestitures, which will be the biggest driver of achieving our de-leveraged goal. Erik Fyrwald : Now, on your second question, Laurence, my initial impressions of IFF's capabilities are we've got really great people. We've got really great capabilities in each of our businesses, and we have just under-performed. But there are pockets of examples where we are performing tremendously well that give me so much confidence that we can make this happen across the company. I spent time with the leadership of arguably the largest consumer products company in the world, where we have a very strong relationship, very much innovation-driven, their innovation people to make sure that the best consumer products are being developed. And we were meeting both with our scent teams and their fragrance team, and with our Health & Biosciences team and their consumer products teams. And it was the best relationship, the best dynamic that I've ever experienced in my 42 years of customer interactions. And then I had another interaction with the top management of a leading beauty care company in Europe. And same thing, our people were working hand in glove with their people to create great, great consumer products that consumers love. So we can do it. We do it. We just need to do it more across the company. And I'm really excited by helping our teams, stop being so internally focused, get more focused by business unit on winning with customers, and then collaborate where it makes sense to enhance across our portfolio, to bring even more to customers so that the customers win more and we win more. Now in terms of productivity, as Glenn mentioned, their pocket's there where we're doing very well, but there's more we can do on productivity. Ralf Finzel and his production team are really driving tremendous productivity in our operations, and it's still early phase, but they're ramping that up very nicely. We've already had efforts in back office productivity for our corporate functions. That's going okay, but we're going to accelerate that. You'll see more shared service centers and more activity with IT systems to make sure that we're effective serving the businesses and very efficient. So I love what I see. There's so much excellence here, but we've got to get it across the company, and we will. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. Just a question on the Q1 guide. So, it's about 487 [ph] 488 [ph] at midpoint in a seasonally weak quarter. And you noted some nice volume ramping productivity throughout the year. So even annualizing that is above the low end of the guide. So can you help us understand if that guide is just conservative? And then just a small follow-up, when do you expect to see the end of de-stocking within your Pharma Solutions business? Glenn Richter : Yes, I'll start with the second. Generally, we've seen de-stocking basically, I'll say it's done everywhere with exception of pharma largely, and it's the second half of the year. Pharma just started late as an industry part of the de-stocking for logical reasons given the margin structure, but we do anticipate the second half of this year to be done with pharma. The Q1 we think is a very reasonable guide, 475 to 500. We have started off the year generally pretty good on the volume side, but we just want to be cautious as we sort of go through the quarter. Generally, the volume slightly lower than the average for the year, so that's a little bit of the impact there, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions on cash flow and investment. One, just wants to clarify on the deleveraging targets. It had previously been three times by the end of calendar '24. Are you no longer committing to that timeline? Second, the last slide of the deck references high return growth investment. Can you provide any more clarity on what those are, size, and timing of those? Then finally, Glenn, I think you said earlier a question, the $500 million free cash flow guidance for the year. Can you bridge $2 billion of EBITDA to $500 million free cash flow, but even acknowledging some deal-related charges, cash flow would be down year-on-year, and I just want to make sure I understand the context and implications of that? Erik Fyrwald : Thank you, Adam. I'll start, and then Glenn can add on. First of all, I fully am aligned with and agree with a target of three times net leverage debt as a target to get to. I think the year end '24, I'd like to see us get there by the end of '24, but we're not going to do something stupid that destroys significant value to get there in '24, but I can tell you we're going to make very good progress at least towards that goal in '24. In terms of high return growth investments alluded to, I'll just reinforce that flavors and fragrances, we call it scent, and health & biosciences are strong business units in great markets. I've been in many chemistry and biological markets. These are great markets, and we're going to invest in them to win. Glenn Richter : Yes. So hey, good morning, Adam. So let me take you through the cash flow reconciliation. It's a good question. And I'll start from the top with EBITDA. So the midpoint of our guide is $2 billion. We are forecasting $345 million of interest expense. Cash taxes are roughly $450. That includes the Reg G or transaction related. I'll back them out later. We have networking capital, slightly a negative. We're being a little cautious in terms of the overall full year. Part is just the growth of the business. And then there's miscellaneous, sort of others, about $100 million of other items to get an operating cash flow of $1.50 billion-ish. As we mentioned, we have a CapEx target up this year. We're trying to invest in our growth business of about $540 for the year. That gets us to a free cash flow, including Reg G of $500 million. I would note, as I mentioned, there's $200 million of Reg G items, $100 million of that's transaction, largely taxes, a little bit of other deal costs, but largely taxes. And then there's $100 million of other miscellaneous Reg G items as well. So that gets you to, if you back those out on adjusted free cash flow around $700 million for the year. The other note I'd say, Adam, the biggest shift year-over-year is networking capital. We had an improvement last year of $500 million. We're being sort of conservative and flattish to slightly down this year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Hey, Erik, welcome back. I'm sure you've seen several chemical businesses go awry over the years for a lot of different reasons. What's your sort of playbook in terms of turning around a business and clearly functional ingredients has been a sore spot here? Anything in particular you're going to sort of work on to get that business back? And then, just a quick follow-up on pharma, Glenn, since Erik's only been here a couple weeks. But where do you think margins can get back to for that business? The last two quarters have been pretty light relative to its historical past. Erik Fyrwald : Well, thanks, Mike. And I'll start with the functional ingredients question. First of all, I like the functional ingredients business. It is a very good business with lots of opportunity to bring value to customers. And by having multiple elements of the solution set, you can bring value in terms of helping customers achieve their goals and what food products they want to have to delight customers, delight consumers. So I think what we really have to do here is, and the team is working on this, is make sure that we're clear on what is our strategy, how are we going to create value in this business, how are we going to make sure that we're focused on the right consumers, excuse me, the right customers in the right way, profitably growing our market share, and how do we make sure that our assets are very competitive, that our costs are very competitive, that we're driving productivity so that we can be competitive with our product portfolio both in terms of the value we bring and the costs to deliver that value. And then we're spending money on innovation. We've got lots of great innovation. Make sure that innovation is tied to real customer needs that they're willing to pay for that can be part of the solution set. And I think that we've taken our eye off the ball, as I said before, too much internal focus, listening to too many consultants going all different directions. We get clear what we're trying to do, what the goals are, and execute well against those goals. This business will significantly improve in 2024 and beyond. Glenn Richter : Yes, good morning, Mike. Good to hear your voice. Regarding pharma, as you know, this business quarter-to-quarter can be a little lumpy based on demand. And fourth quarter is typically a lower volume quarter. The margins are always compressed seasonally for the fourth quarter, so it's difficult to look at that. We are very optimistic on the strength of this business and the go-forward plan. We do expect the business to be in approximately the mid-20s from an EBITDA margin this year from a standpoint. And there's tons of other initiatives to continue to drive up the margin further. So I think what you're seeing is a function de-stocking, idle mills, seasonality over the last couple of quarters, but just not reflective of the fundamentals of the business. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks and good morning, everybody. I guess lots of questions, but I'll try to keep it narrow here. So today's IFF was created to provide a suite of products to customers. At least that was the initial idea in merging the legacy IFF into the DuPont business. I guess, Erik, how do you think about that as an effective go-to-market strategy? The corollary to it, we hear a lot from investors that this is arguably a better business, pre-even cruder on, is there a scenario where you can divest nearly all of those assets of the acquired businesses? How integrated are they? Is that possible? And sort of, just holistically thoughts on kind of all of that together, and then just one follow-up to you, Glenn, the flat expected plus three volumes, considering how easy the comparisons are, would still suggest that two years is strongly negative. How do you think about that from a competitiveness standpoint, meaning it would suggest that you're still losing share? And I guess, it's not across all of the businesses equally, but it's still a pretty stark difference relative to your closest peers? Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : Okay. Thank you. I'll start by saying that I believe that the historical IFF plus the DuPont nutrition and biosciences business are stronger together than they were separately. The potential, the opportunity is greater than it was separately. So I believe in that combination very strongly. Now, as I said before, we haven't executed it well, and I've seen this happen before. When I got to Syngenta almost eight years ago, the seeds in the crop protection businesses had been mushed together, and the focus was on synergies versus having a great crop protection business and a great seeds business. We made clear that we were going to have those two businesses as business units, end-to-end business units. And as soon as we did that, we found out that we had been losing share, losing margin versus the competition. We started regaining that, and by the way, when the business units were clearing what they were trying to do, the synergies grew a lot because there were synergies. I see the same thing here at IFF as we're really good at flavors, at fragrances or scents, at health & biosciences, at food ingredients, those businesses, when they're performing well the synergies will increase, not decrease. The ability to help each other, the different businesses to help each other, to help customers more together will increase, but we've got to get the businesses performing extremely well by themselves and not have synergy of the goal, have synergy of tools. When we do that, I can assure you that the combination will be very strong. Glenn Richter : Hey, good morning, Mark. Hey, thanks for the question. You're right, if you look at a three-year stack, we would still be negative over the three-year average by about 1%, 1.5% over, including if you hit the 3% this year. But I would note, as we said in the past, I think you have to sort of think about the performance of the business between 75% and 25%. 75% of the business, our core scent business is forming very well. Flavors has pockets of strength, H&B, both enzymes, probiotics, culture's business are doing well, pharma overall is doing well. It's really the other 25, which is functional ingredients we've talked about, that actually has been a drag on the overall results of the business. So if you separate that, I think you clearly have a very different view in terms of that three-year stack, and the 75% is nicely positive, and I would submit it's in line with competition. For the most part, we have opportunities, as Erik said, to perform better, but it's focused on that 25%. I also will note once again, as we're trying to be realistic, there's prospects that the markets improve more significantly. Certainly the start of the year knock on wood is pretty encouraging, but it's too early to call anything above that range until we see a consistency month-by-month in terms of volumes coming back. So, I appreciate the question. Erik Fyrwald : The only thing I would add is that even in the 75%, there is significant improvement opportunity, and we've got businesses that are looking at that, and we're going to work with those businesses to support them, both for the businesses to win more and for the corporate cost overheads to be lower and more effective at supporting the businesses. So there is great opportunity, of course, in food ingredients to turn it around, but even the rest of the company to significantly improve performance, and we're going to do it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Salvator Tiano : Yes, thank you very much. I want to ask a couple of questions on the -- I guess, strategy shifts to grow that you mentioned a little bit more, a few more details. And essentially, as you're trying to reposition the business and gain market share that's becoming the clear focus. What would that mean for R&D spending, SG&A spending, and CapEx in the next few years, not necessarily 2024, but that's almost three or four-year basis? And you made a comment about the 2024 price, that's 2.5% negative, in part being because of competitive pressures, but also because it will allow you to gain some market share. So how are you thinking in this new strategy about the tradeoff between price and volume? Erik Fyrwald : I'll start, and I think our R&D spend is significant today. I think if you look at what we spend, it's very competitive versus the industry leaders, other industry leaders, but I do think we can focus it better, connect it better to the business units and to customers, and ensure that the R&D efforts are fully aligned with the highest value needs that our customers have. So I think we can get more out of the R&D spend that we have, and where there are areas that we need to spend more R&D, particularly in health &biosciences and flavors and fragrances, we will spend more on R&D. On capital expenditures, I feel similarly that the level of capital expenditures are reasonable, but we have to look at where we're spending it and make sure that it's optimized and we're spending the capital in places that have significant returns, have very good returns, and strengthen the businesses where we need to win. Glenn Richter : And I would just add to that, as we mentioned, we're going to be up about 8% year-over-year in CapEx, and at core operational CapEx, which is really supporting growth in our core products is up 10%. So we're in the right range from a CapEx, around 5% of sales in terms of what we need to maintain and grow the business. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, so I would like to hand the call back to the team for concluding remarks. Erik Fyrwald : Great. Well, thank you for joining the call this morning. Again, I just want to finish by saying that I'm thrilled to be at IFF. We've got a tremendous team at IFF. We've got great capabilities. We haven't performed to our potential in the past, but I can tell you we're all completely committed to making sure that we unleash the full potential of our businesses and drive the right kind of synergies that enhance each of the businesses, and make customers very pleased, delighted with what we bring in our innovation. And by doing that, possibly grow our market share and through their productivity efforts, make sure we do that with leading margins. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael Deveau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President, CFO and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik. Jon Erik Fyrwald : Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today, we'll focus on our financial results, our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance, where we now see us trending toward the upper end. Now before moving forward, I want to acknowledge Glenn, who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after 3 successful years with the company. During his tenure, Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We've benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long-term profitable market share growth. He has also been very helpful to me already as I've come on to the IFF team. Now with this announcement, we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The Board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition. Now turning to Slide 6. We are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from Scent, Nourish and Health & Biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses. At the same time, we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure, address our deleveraging goal of 3x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high-growth areas of our business. With our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. It's still early in the year and there's a lot more work to be done, but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth. Turning to Slide 7. Let me take a step back for a moment and share what I've learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. Now I've spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers. And I'm grateful for the productive discussions. And what I found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities. But we're not yet realizing our full potential. With a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team, we are getting back to basics, and I'm optimistic about what we will do from here. First, we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long-term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals. I think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long-term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves, including cosmetics and Pharma Solutions, to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction. We also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model, which is now business-led, supported by lean functions. This includes the appointment of Ana Paula Mendon\u00e7a, who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF, as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Herriott to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our Health & Biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our Flavors and Functional Ingredients units within our Nourish division. With this operating model change, we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions, including R&D, operations, finance and HR, to go directly into our business unit presidents, so they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers. Now to make this work, we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value, provides a framework for standardized processes, responsibilities and metrics and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance, so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years. We are also introducing an operating philosophy based on four main pillars : number one, customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two, innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations customers value and do this faster; number three, operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety, quality, continuous improvement and competitive cost structures; and four, people, people who are engaged across the organization. We expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers, and by doing so, deliver strong financial performance over time. And while it's still early, I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world. With that, I'll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn? Glenn Richter : Thank you, Erik, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Erik mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year, and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond. In the first quarter, IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single-digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses, including Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish. Pricing was modestly positive, inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets, in particular the Argentine peso, where we, like the industry, have indexed pricing to U.S. and/or euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes. Absent of this benefit, pricing would have been negative in the quarter, largely in line with our plan. We delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis, led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result, margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Turning now to Slide 9. I'll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In Nourish, sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in Flavors with improvements in both volume and price. And we saw very strong growth in our Flavors business across nearly all markets. Functional Ingredients volume was up low single digits, the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, comparable currency-neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions. In terms of profitability, productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both Flavors and Functional Ingredients. Our Health & Biosciences segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio, led by double-digit sales growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing and mid-single-digit growth in Home & Personal Care, drove a 6% increase in comparable currency-neutral sales. Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent delivered another excellent quarter, including 16% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and mid-single-digit growth in Fine Fragrances. The segment also excel in terms of profitability, primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements, which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis. Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives, these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends, which began late last year. It's worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market-related and the other is due to Pharma Solutions' initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships, reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins. Also, as mentioned, we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette. Now on Slide 10, I'd like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $99 million this quarter while CapEx was $118 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter, normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder, Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. Our free cash flow position totaled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year-ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $764 million, including $32 million in assets held for sale. IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4x at quarter end. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results. With the announced Pharma Solutions transaction, we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x following the transaction close, which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and, as Erik mentioned, now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced 0% to 3% with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio. We also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter, and therefore, raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024 versus previous expectation that pricing would decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes, we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected on our sales growth, which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution. On the bottom line, for 2024, we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year, volume trends are encouraging, and consequently, we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion, driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million. I'll now turn it back to Erik for closing remarks. Jon Erik Fyrwald : Thank you, Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call, my first 90 days on Team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams, and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum. And it's an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time, and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. Yet we still have a lot of work to do. As the market continues to be very competitive, we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and, in turn, helps them and us drive sustainable profitable growth. And with a solid start to the year, I'm excited to see what we can accomplish going forward. And with that, I'd like to now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Matthew Hettwer : This is Matthew Hettwer on for Kevin. It's nice to see a strong start to the year. Erik, could you give us some additional context and detail regarding how you've seen the individual businesses react to your new operating philosophy through the first 90 days? Jon Erik Fyrwald : Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. As you probably know, I've been on a listening tour or a discussion tour since right after the January 11 announcement of the change of my joining IFF. And it's been really great to hear from our employees all around the world and our customers all around the world. And what I've discerned from that is that we've had multiple companies coming together with different operating models, different philosophies. And there was significant uncertainty about the organization structure and how we were going to do things. And what we've done is the executive leadership team has come together very nicely, and I'm very proud of the team, and we've been able to together clarify the structure and operational model that we have going forward and the four pillars that we're focused on to drive our performance. We've had town halls all around the world, both live and by video. We've touched all our employees. We've spent special time with our leadership. And I think we've gotten really clear on how we're moving the company forward. And what I love about it is I feel the engagement of our people around the world. I feel their energy growing. I think there's great acceptance and enthusiasm for the empowered business unit model, for the focus on customers that the job of all of us is to support our teams to win with customers and help us profitably grow our market share and then also drive our innovation that, at the core, we're an innovation company, and we need to make sure that we have leading innovation that we're bringing to our customers, and it's innovation that customers value. And then finally, that we also have healthy productivity, productivity that helps us strengthen the company and invest more in growth and in innovation and doing that with smart productivity, things like reducing consultants, reducing layers, driving functional shared service centers, where it makes sense, using technology, information technology. So my feeling is that there's great capabilities, great people in this company. And the executive leadership team is coming together to try and do all we can to unleash that full potential of our people all around the world. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Ming Tang : Firstly, Erik, you talked there about sort of the change in operating model. Can you talk a little bit about portfolio? And following the announcement to divest Pharma Solutions, do you intend to pursue any further divestments? Or is that it for now? And then if I could squeeze in another one for Glenn on cash flow, are you still confident in your free cash flow target of $500 million for the year or $700 million on an adjusted basis? And is there potentially upside, given the upward revision, was it the high end, that you see in terms of the EBITDA guidance? And could you explain what drove the increase in trade receivables in the quarter? Jon Erik Fyrwald : Okay. I'll start and then hand it over to Glenn. And thanks for the question, Nicola -- or questions. So on the portfolio, first of all, the Pharma Solutions business will be with us for another year. And we see a lot of opportunity to further strengthen the performance of Pharma Solutions over the next year and then beyond that with Roquette. But then we have the other four business units that we're going to really focus on driving forward, of course, with Nourish, both the Flavors and the Functional Ingredients. We have the Scent business and we have the Health & Biosciences business. All our focus now is on supporting those businesses to perform well, to drive profitable market share growth, to drive healthy productivity, to make sure that we're bringing leading innovation and deliver the best performance we can in the second quarter, full year 2024, but do it in ways that strengthen us for '25 and beyond. We're also going through a strategy review process for each of the businesses. And we'll take a look at what it takes to win in each of those businesses in the coming years and what we have to do investment-wise and making sure that each of the businesses has the right portfolio to win going forward. So you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters and years. But right now, our focus is all on making sure we've got the right strategy, the right capabilities in each business, the right collaboration, culture across businesses and are winning with customers by bringing leading innovation. Glenn? Glenn Richter : Thanks, Erik. Thanks for the question, Nicola. We're actually trending more favorable in terms of our full year outlook for free cash flow and adjusted as well. As mentioned, a combination of earnings momentum -- actually, working capital is actually performing better than planned, and we expect actually some improvement and then just some timing on taxes. We're probably going to be closer to $600 million versus the $500 million. I would note that, that also includes higher Reg G costs related to pharma. So we gave you a $200 million number in Feb that did not include pharma for obvious reasons. The heavy lifting, as Erik mentioned, is the balance of this year separating systems, legal entities, et cetera. That's roughly about $100 million. So on an adjusted basis, $900 million on a free cash flow reported basis, directionally, $600 million. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Joshua Spector : I wanted to ask on your expectations of volume cadence. I mean, clearly, very strong first quarter, so congrats on that. But I think some of the comps on a year-over-year basis actually get a bit easier. So is there something you'd call out that you would say is a headwind we should consider? Or would you characterize your view as just conservatism? Jon Erik Fyrwald : Thanks, Josh. And let me start and then Glenn can give you more details. But as I see it, still fairly new coming into the company, clearly, CPG company volumes are still soft in the U.S. and the EU. And so we can't expect a whole lot of market tailwind growth. I do think we've seen the end of most of the destocking outside of Pharma Solutions. And Glenn alluded to the Pharma Solutions destocking, both a market destocking and our change in channel strategy. But bottom line is we can expect a lot of growth from the marketplace, although there are some emerging markets that we're going after that are seeing very attractive volume growth. But overall, our focus has to be growth through bringing leading innovation and winning business with customers. And I've heard a lot already about commercial projects that we're winning. But we're also going to increase the focus and understanding the projects that we didn't win. Why didn't we win them? What does it take for us to be even more successful with our customers and win even more projects and bring that leading innovation so that customers are growing their market share profitably and we're growing with them? Glenn? Glenn Richter : Thanks, Erik. Again, Josh, I think, as Erik mentioned, until we see a strengthening in the consumer environment, which has yet to appear, and until we have a few more months underneath our belts, it's sort of hard for us to be sort of incredibly optimistic on the second half. As a reference point, the first half volumes of circa 4% to 5% and the second half, basically 1% to 2%. As a reminder, the first half of last year, because of the aggressive destocking, was down 9% and the second half, down 5%. So a little bit of it is the lapping as well as we sort of think about providing guidance. But I think the end market, as Erik said, we need to see greater strength there before we're sort of more confident in higher volume growth in the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Really nice start to the year. When I think about the first quarter EBITDA run rate and EBITDA margins, really good improvement of 20%. Guidance would sort of imply that the levels fall sequentially. So any sort of one-time positives during the first quarter that wouldn't reoccur? And just curious if demand and volume levels remain here, why wouldn't EBITDA margin stay sort of in this 20% range for the rest of the year? And congrats on retirement, Glenn. Glenn Richter : Thank you, Mike. So good question. So 20% for Q1, sort of the implied balance of the year is around 18.5%. That 150 basis points of change, half of that is related to volume and mix, inclusive of LMC. So LMC, you take out about $12 million per quarter and about $25 million of revenue. So it's relatively high margin. So everything normalized, that gets you from the 20% down to basically 19% in a quarter. The residual 75 basis points really is a little bit more net price-to-cost realization in Q1 versus the forecast and then just some timing of expenses. But to answer your direct question, if volumes were to maintain, then we should be somewhere in the 19%, probably 19%-plus range, for the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Unknown Analyst : This is [ Eric Zhang ] on for Patrick. What are your expectations for price/cost for the full year? The price guide seems to be a bit -- seems to be a small net positive if you net out FX. Are there any areas where you're getting structural pricing? Or is this just less giveback than you expected? Glenn Richter : Yes, Eric, you're right. I mean, the full year, we're expecting a small net positive, as I mentioned, little more biased towards Q1 than the balance of the year. Our pricing actions, which were largely givebacks this year, were highly focused in the Functional Ingredients space. We are tracking well against the expectations that we set for the year. We do believe that the improved performance in the business is in part related to these pricing actions on top of the other actions. And we don't see sort of any additional kind of pricing for the balance year at this point in time. And then in general, if we look at sort of the inflationary environment for the balance of the year, it's pretty stable. I think commodities are flattish to maybe a tad up. Generally, energy is trending down, particularly in Europe. And logistics is trending slightly up, particularly ocean freight, given what's happening in the Red Sea. But generally, stability and, as we mentioned, a little more positive net price in the first quarter than the balance of the year. Thank you, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Erik, does the improvement in Functional Ingredients market turn in this business? And looking forward, can the entirety of this business return to prior level of sales and earnings? Or is there some portion of business that will not due to low-cost Asian competition? Jon Erik Fyrwald : Thanks for the question, David, and glad to be back with you again after some years. Absolutely, it marks the beginning of improvement in the Functional Ingredients business and very pleased to see that after a long, tough spell. And what I would say is that we are putting more focus on the Functional Ingredients business. And I'm very pleased to see the start of what the team are working really hard to make a sustained turnaround. And in addition to better execution, which is happening, we are doing a strategy refresh and looking at all the product families and our systems approach across the Functional Ingredients business. And we are focused very much right now on delivering a strong improvement in 2024 but also what it takes to make sure that, that improvement continues into 2025, starting with the second quarter '24, then the third quarter, but the full year of this year, but doing -- making sure that we're doing the right things to strengthen for '25 and beyond. And you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters. But it is the start of a turnaround. I'm very pleased with the progress that the team is making, the actions they're taking both with customers and on productivity. And we'll see how good we can do in '24 and then we'll focus on 25, but making progress. Glenn Richter : Yes. And I would just add to that, David, as we've mentioned in the past, we've stated we didn't think we're going to get to sort of full recovery until '25. We're pleased by the start of this year. A lot of the service elements are 100% back to where they should be. Pricing actions have been effective, more innovation in the pipeline.  The last piece of the equation is on the cost side. And we're going through a very extensive review of our manufacturing and procurement operations. That probably will be implemented late this year into early next year as the final piece to get to the margin structure in terms of where we need to be. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Would love to get your perspective on volume trends by region in the first quarter and if there's anything you would call out as notable areas of outsized strength or weakness versus the portfolio as a whole up mid-single digits. And I think we could probably exclude pharma from that discussion. And again, given that first quarter performance, is there anything where the regional performance would differ materially kind of over the balance of the year? Glenn Richter : Adam, good question. Regionally, we have seen greater strength in the combination of Asia and LatAm, so more of the emerging markets from a volume standpoint and sort of across the board, generally a little softer in North America and in EMEA. That's probably not dissimilar than what others are seeing in the marketplace.  If we look by business, Scent had a phenomenal start to the year, 9%-plus volumes, Nourish and H&B in the 4% range. As we think about the balance of the year, we're not planning on Scent continuing at these very, very high levels, so some softening from these and then a little bit softer for H&B and Nourish and then pharma actually improving because they were down about 9% in Q1 and actually getting to flattish as we move into Q2 and the balance of the year. But generally, where we're seeing the regional balance, more emerging market, we're expecting that to continue at least through the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. John Roberts : Best wishes, Glenn, thanks for all your help. Erik, IFF has had more opportunities than most companies to promote from within for the CEO and CFO positions. Do you think there's anything that needs to change in the organization to develop a deeper bench, so the C-suite transitions are smoother? Or is there just a culture on the Board to look outside for C-suite positions? Jon Erik Fyrwald : Well, thanks for the question, John. And I think it's a really important one. To me, the most important thing we do as leaders is make sure that we have the right talent in the company, that we develop the right talent and we give them the opportunities through promotion to continue to advance their careers. And so I always prefer internal promotions. But sometimes external talent needs to come in to fill gaps or when we don't have the right talent inside.  But I can tell you that, like at Syngenta, I very much want to have my successor come from inside when I do retire at some point. And also, I'll just point out that the one significant executive leadership change that we've made so far was Ana Paula Mendon\u00e7a being promoted to run the Scent division as President of Scent. And if you look at her background and if you talk to the people across the company and customers, there was great enthusiasm for her promotion, and I like that. So I will continue to work with the executive leadership team and with the Board to make sure that we're developing the right talent inside the company to make sure that we promote from within wherever we can. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess, Erik, first off, on the -- as you sort of meet with customers and go on your listening tour, et cetera, how would you sort of objectively assess the moats of the residual businesses that are going to be part of IFF going forward? And then just related to that, in terms of Scent, what did drive the first quarter in terms of high performance, especially Consumer Fragrances? Was that sort of share gains? And if it was, what was that driven by? Jon Erik Fyrwald : Thanks, [ Laurence ]. It's also good to be back with you. We had some history that dates back quite a ways. The way I would say it is that in the businesses that are remaining, we've got a lot of great innovation capability and a lot of really terrific people that understand customers, have consumer insight capability. So we have the people and the capabilities, including the innovation capabilities, to be very successful.  And what I would say is -- and even talking to our people but also our customers, we haven't realized our full potential. And that's what it's about. It's the leadership team working to unleash the full potential by making things, decision-making clear, by having businesses be end-to-end, be able to drive clarity in their strategy and then clarity in their execution, but at the same time, having a collaborative culture so that we can collaborate across businesses, wherever it makes sense, to enhance our ability to bring solutions to customers or to drive healthy productivity. And so I believe that we're doing well with that, but we've got a lot more potential to unleash. And I think if you talk to people across the company, I think you'll find a lot of enthusiasm about what IFF is doing and what more we can do going forward.  Specifically on Scent, I think Scent has been a unit that has stayed focused largely on customers, that has brought a lot of innovation to customers. I've spent a lot of time with the perfumers in this company. We've got world-class perfumers. And I just am so proud to be part of this company with such great perfumers that our customers value. I've spent time with CEOs of leading CPG companies that have named our perfumers by name because they're so important to their success. And so making sure that we're bringing not only our perfumers but the whole team around the perfumers to help co-create great new fragrances and fine fragrances or great new consumer products, whether they're shampoos or detergents, laundry detergents or dishwash detergents or floor cleaners or body wash, whatever it is, the scent, I've learned, is such a critical part of the success of the consumer product.  And our great perfumers and the teams around them, bringing great scent technology and great formulations to help the customers develop leading consumer products, has really been what's driven the growth. So I expect under Ana's leadership and with the super team that she's got, I expect that continued strong performance to continue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : If I remember correctly, you had talked about $150 million productivity gains for the year. So can you talk a little bit -- can you quantify what was the benefit in Q1? What do you expect for the rest of the year? And given obviously the strong gains in the first quarter, is this number upsized for the rest of the year? Glenn Richter : Good question, Salvator. We are trending at around $200 million full year in terms of productivity and, hence, some of our commentary about guiding towards the higher range of our EBITDA guide. And that's about $50 million per quarter. So it's fairly ratable in terms of kind of the achievement. I would note, as we've said in previous calls, we have made tremendous progress with our operations and procurement leadership teams in really driving a very disciplined approach that is taking cost out, everything from SKU rationalization to literally looking plant-by-plant in terms of best practices. And behind that -- and by the way, there's plenty of additional opportunities. As I mentioned, we're taking a [ zero-based ] approach to our ingredients platform, which will provide additional opportunities. And behind that, we've really been looking at opportunities within RSA that have been focused on leveraging our global shared services, really focusing on our indirect spend, so getting every dollar out we need and then continuing to advance technology as a way to basically automate eliminate work. So that piece of it is actually picking up speed as well. So we feel very good about $200 million. And I would suggest, as we look out into the future, we're going to continue to deliver pretty strong productivity numbers. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Lisa Hortense De Neve : Congratulations on the strong first quarter. My first question, so with the announcement of the pharma division, which is expected to complete in the first half of next year, can you just share where you see potential scope for optimizing your balance sheet position and maybe where you see some debt that could be reduced or be up for redemption or that may not require any refinancing? And then I'm going to sneak in a second question. So during the presentation, you mentioned that your finance and HR departments, amongst others, are now directly feeding into your divisions. Can you shed some light on their compensation structure of the variable pay they may or may not receive and what key KPIs they have to deliver on this? Glenn Richter : Sure. Lisa, this is Glenn. So we're in the early innings of deciding sort of our liability management strategy. As you know, we will bring in circa net proceeds of $2.4 billion from pharma. Coincidentally, we have maturities cumulatively for '25 and '26 that are $2.4 billion. But we're actually taking a more holistic look, and we're actually going to be balancing the trade-off between interest cost savings, notional debt repayment, so how we think about basically bringing in some of the cheaper debt, as well as refinancing risk. So we'll think about bringing some towers down as part of that. So there'll be more to come as we get closer to finalizing the close of the deal. But we are sort of thinking about not just the immediate maturities but how to optimize the structure going forward. So with that, Erik, I'm happy to take the next question. Do you want to take the next question? Jon Erik Fyrwald : Yes. So on the functions feeding into the business units, reporting into the business units, it's clearly being done so that the business units can drive their performance. And there will be no changes to the 2024 plan because everybody is set and clear about it and we're not making changes. But effective in 2025, those functions that we're reporting corporately that will be reporting into the business units will be incentivized on the business unit performance. As a large part of their incentives, they also, of course, continue to have a corporate element to encourage overall corporate performance and collaboration across business units. And the more senior level the people are, the more their corporate component.  But clearly, what we want to drive is business unit alignment and everybody on that business team driving their business unit's performance but also collaborating to enhance their business unit's performance and the total company performance. I would also say that there will continue to be corporate functional leadership that ensure that we're doing functional best practices across the business units and that each of the functional people have great career opportunities across the company. So it will be a combination. But clearly, each business unit is going to be highly incented to drive the performance of that business with collaboration that enhances their business performance and the business performance of the other businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Two clarifications and a question. So it sounds like there was a lot of benefit in Scent volumes in the quarter. I guess, that partly explains the big EBITDA number and growth rate on a year-on-year basis. So is it fair to say that, that, specifically the Scent EBITDA growth, will normalize as we head through the year? And I guess, broader picture, same thing on the total business. And if you could maybe tell us how much you think the 1Q volume growth had to do with channel refill from the reversal of destocking and how much is really what your customers are ordering from you, that would be helpful. Glenn Richter : Yes. So your second question, Mark, hard to definitively understand kind of what's going on downstream in terms of the supply chain. However, I think in general, there was a little bit of volume that went from Q4 into Q1, but directionally probably less than 0.5 point. We were reducing prices, as you know, in certain segments. So customers decided to push some orders into Q1. But I think it's fairly de minimis. In general, the feeling is that there's not any restocking in the marketplace. There's an absence of destocking. But there's no view, I think, generally, in terms of the customers are restocking at this point in time.  In terms of your question on Scent volumes, Scent had a very strong first quarter. Note that it was stronger in consumer versus fine. So that makes that sort of mix-neutral versus the enterprise from the standpoint. And as mentioned, we just -- we're not anticipating that those high single-digit volume gains will continue through the balance of the year. So that is a piece that's basically reflected in our balance of the year guide being lower from a volume standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I had two questions. First was just on the Nourish performance in the quarter and volumes being up. Food industry volumes are still quite weak. So I was just kind of curious if you could square for us your performance outside of inventory rebuilding versus kind of what we're seeing in end market demand.  And then the second thing was, Erik, very helpful to hear kind of the update on org structure and the direction you're moving in. I was curious though, that's a little bit backwards question, the org structure that was in the process of being set up, and Glenn, you were obviously a part of that, I understand the notion that it's not -- it's been deemed not the right path forward, but there were surely merits to that plan. There were elements there that were going to bring something positive or there was an intention. So I'm just curious what, if anything, you think you could give up or forgo in not pursuing that model and if there are ways to kind of bring that into the structure org that you're going to be setting up? If that didn't make sense, I can try to clarify. Jon Erik Fyrwald : No, no, I'll start and then Glenn can add to it. First of all, in the organization structure, the idea was to have market-based organization structure. So for example, Health & Biosciences would have been split up into four different units. As we've come together as an executive leadership team and talked about it, the belief is that you gain the most by having -- making sure that your innovation, that your R&D engine is -- stays within the business and the manufacturing and the commercial so that you have that end-to-end and you're going to customers with expertise that they can connect all the way back to R&D and what we call IC&D, the innovation, creation and design capabilities that we bring, that really needs to stay within a business and be there end-to-end.  Now we have different businesses that hit the same markets. So Home & Personal Care, both our biosciences business and our Scent business have a lot in common with customers. So we'll continue to have a global key account leader for large accounts that will represent the company, but then we'll have experts from the business units coming into that account and working with that account, which is what the accounts want. They want both that overall IFF relationship, which by the way, will include the presidents of the businesses, will include me and others, but that coordinated. But they want to see the experts that really know the innovation details that can bring that innovation to them. And that's what these end-to-end business units will enable us to bring. Glenn Richter : Yes. So if I can add, the original premise, which actually predates me, Lauren, was that combining Flavors and Ingredients would represent a significant \"revenue synergy opportunity\" through cross-sell. And the axis was put on synergies as opposed to how do you optimize the individual businesses. That is being shifted the other way, where the reality is these businesses will run much, much better with a single focus either on Flavors or Ingredients.  As Erik said, there are other mechanisms to help cross-sell, particularly with the global key accounts, as a way to develop long-term plans, et cetera. But we've seen it just firsthand in terms of the more that we get our Ingredients team sort of focused on only Ingredients, it does deliver results. So I think that's the big shift from 3-plus years ago, when the view was put together.  And to your first question, very early innings, by the way, although cautiously optimistic. Our trends in terms of our Flavors business were 4-plus percent volumes and the Ingredients business were 3.5%. From what we can measure in terms of our competitive set on both sides of the house, we feel that we're at parity or gaining share based on the quarterly results. I would caution, particularly on the Ingredients business, it is early. There's a lot of remediation in that business. But it's encouraging that we're starting off relative to our peers in a good place. Jon Erik Fyrwald : And what I would just add to that is, I think Flavors, it was really a good pipeline that the commercial team was able to land. And in Ingredients, it was a combination of a strengthening pipeline but also pricing actions that led to regain some share that was lost due to overpricing increases. And now we've recovered some of that with some price givebacks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Just want to follow up on the comments about sort of the inventory dynamics downstream. If you look a little bit further out, what are you hearing from customers about either them shifting their innovation strategies and therefore having more demand pull for your product or longer term, they're needing to reset inventory levels in terms of working capital days or other metrics? And then would that be a net tailwind or headwind for you from current levels? Jon Erik Fyrwald : So in the last -- since I've joined, I think I've met with more than 20 customers, maybe 30 customers. And very consistently, what we're hearing back is that they're pivoting from being able to grow with price increases to now needing innovation and innovation being more important than ever. And that's a good part of why it's so important for us to have end-to-end business units that can bring that innovation quickly and aggressively because that's what our customers want so that they can continue to profitably grow their business. They have to have more innovation. That's what they're looking for, that's what they need and that's what we're going to deliver. So that's how they're going to grow and that's how we're going to grow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Given your revenue forecast for the second quarter, which at the midpoint is down about 5%, are your April volumes down 5%, on a sequential basis, that is? Or can you talk about what's happened sequentially? And then second, when you look at your first quarter performance versus your fourth quarter performance, your revenues were up about $200 million and your cost of goods sold was up, I don't know, maybe $30 million. Can you discuss what the dynamic is behind that, which allowed your... Glenn Richter : And Jeff, that second part of your question, was it Q4 to Q1? What was your reference point? Jeffrey Zekauskas : Yes, exactly right. Yes, because there's not much change in cost of goods sold and revenues were up a couple of hundred million. Glenn Richter : Yes, yes, yes. Well, there are a number of timing elements in the fourth quarter and sort of the mix of the business in the fourth quarter vis-\u00e0-vis Q1. Generally, the productivity and net price dynamics are very similar, so I'd say the fundamentals were. But you really have some mix dynamics and then some one-time items related to that as we think about Q4 to Q1. Yes, you referenced, I think, the decline. Decline sequentially is about $100 million from Q1 to Q2. About 1/4 of that basically is associated with the absence of LMC in the mix. The other part is just sort of the outlook in the business, a little bit of seasonality in terms of the business as well. Versus prior year, to remind you, this time last year, we had savory solutions, we had FSI. We also had LMC in the mix. So there's a pretty substantial sort of reduction in revenue on a year-over-year comparison.  Volumetrically, your question about what we're seeing in the second quarter, we're obviously well into the middle of the quarter at this point. We're anticipating a 5% to 6% all-in volume growth versus the 4% for Q1. April was an extremely good month. But last year, it was an extremely lousy month. So there's a bit of an overlap from that standpoint. But May and at least the June book at this point is trending towards that basically sort of, call it, 5%-plus in terms of the performance for the quarter. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : There are no questions registered at this time. So I will pass the call back over to Erik for concluding remarks. Jon Erik Fyrwald : Thank you all for joining today. Let me just close with two comments. First of all, Glenn did announce his pending retirement. But I just want to make sure, he's not leaving yet. There's lots more work to do. And we're enjoying him as part of the ELT, executive leadership team, to get us unleashing our full potential.  Second point is it's really great being part of Team IFF. We've got terrific people, great innovation capabilities. And we're going to do all we can to unleash our full potential and try to delight our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Michael DeVeau : Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF\u2019s second quarter 2024 conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and our press release, both of which can be found on our website. Today\u2019s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President, CFO and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to, Erik. Erik Fyrwald : Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m excited to join you all today and share the positive progress we are making in our strategic refresh and the solid performance IFF delivered in the second quarter. Also, during today\u2019s call, we will provide a brief update on the business-led strategic framework we are implementing across our organization. Now, over the last seven months, I\u2019ve had the great pleasure to travel to many of our facilities and have met with customers that together represent over a third of our sales and several 1,000 of our IFF team members. I\u2019ve been able to get great feedback on what makes IFF special and strategic and tactical moves our leadership team needs to make to strengthen our Company, to better serve customers and improve our performance. We have listened and are making the changes we need to unleash more of the potential for today and for the future. And, I\u2019m very pleased that the entire IFF team is rallying behind our resulting strategic refresh to make IFF better at bringing leading innovation to our customers. Now, beginning with Slide 6, IFF is building on last quarter\u2019s momentum and delivered another solid quarter, and I\u2019m pleased with our performance and our results through the first half of the year. Led by Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish, we delivered volume growth in the high-single digits in the second quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating EBITDA increased 22%, driven by volume growth and productivity initiatives. This is a significant improvement over last year and it is great to have IFF on a better sales growth and margin expansion track. Now looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2024. Given this outlook and our solid performance to-date this year, we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance for the full-year. Glenn, will speak more about this in a few minutes. Now, it\u2019s encouraging that the steps we have taken and continue to take to refocus IFF on bringing customers\u2019 leading innovation while driving healthy productivity are yielding encouraging results. We are making solid progress advancing the business-led refresh I\u2019ve spoken about before, but we are not satisfied and we\u2019ve got a lot more work to do. But, I\u2019ve got confidence that we are on the right track toward achieving IFF\u2019s full potential. Moving to Slide 7. As I did last quarter, I would like to give a brief update on our progress as we work across the organization to refresh our strategy and focus on a business-led operating model. IFF has had a challenging last three years. Constraints on our balance sheet led the Company to underinvest in our core businesses and focused on divestitures. The Company was not structured to effectively navigate the complex and fast moving environment, and we underperformed relative to our peers. We have now had several quarters of growth as we have taken decisive actions to get our businesses back on-track. Our strategy moving forward will be driven by four key pillars : our people, our customer focus, our position as an innovation powerhouse and our operational excellence. We will engage and empower our people to deliver customer success while we drive profitable market share growth over time. We will also continue to develop sustainable new products and applications that are aligned with our customers\u2019 needs now and in the future, all while being relentless in our commitment to safety, quality and the efficiency in our operations. We have already taken several steps toward resetting and refocusing our operating model, including the announced divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which is still on-track to close in the first half of 2025, and our pivot to an end-to-end business-led operating model that will promote greater accountability and better performance. We are also working hard to improve employee engagement and are seeing positive results. Furthermore, each of our business units are building a five year strategic plan to define and close gaps where they exist versus best-in-class companies. These plans include executing a refreshed turnaround strategy for functional ingredients and leveraging health and biosciences\u2019 biotech expertise and capabilities across our Scent and Flavors platforms to enhance innovation and product development. Also, as mentioned last quarter, we are focusing on having lean corporate functions to support our business units with speed, agility and closer collaboration. Now, as we prioritize growth investments to our highest value businesses, such as Flavors, Scent and Health & Biosciences, we have already started to increase R&D and commercial investments. At the same time, we plan to increase our CapEx investments, targeting about 6% of sales for the next several years to bolster capacity and accelerate our digital transformation, including ERP implementation. We believe these investments will generate strong returns, providing us with incremental growth and efficiency opportunities that will lead us to continue to improve how we serve our customers profitably. Lastly, we are committed to delivering significant value creation for our shareholders. And with that in mind, we are on-track to achieve our raised guidance targets for the year as we continue to drive profitable growth across each of our businesses. I\u2019ll now pass it over to Glenn, for a closer look at our quarterly results, which demonstrate the continued progress and growth we are achieving. Glenn? Glenn Richter : Thank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. As Erik noted, IFF had a strong second quarter. Revenue of just below $2.9 billion increased 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis with Scent, H&B and Nourish each growing revenue in the quarter. Volumes grew by high-single digits as our performance continued to improve sequentially across nearly every business. Our volume growth and strong gains from productivity initiatives together contributed to a 22% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA in the quarter. Our adjusted operating EBITDA margin improved by 310 basis points to 20.4% on a comparable basis, building off a strong first quarter and the first time we were over 20% since the third quarter of 2022. Turning to Slide 9. I\u2019ll dive a bit deeper into each of our segments. Nourish comparable currency neutral sales increased 4% and we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 36% on a comparable basis. This was led by a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Flavors with improvements in both volume and pricing. Functional Ingredient sales declined modestly in the quarter as high-single digit volume growth was offset by lower pricing, consistent with plan. Both Flavors and Functional Ingredients demonstrated strong year-over-year gross margin expansion. The strong profitability in Nourish was driven by volume growth and productivity improvements as well as the comparison to the one-time Locust Bean Kernel inventory write-down in the year ago period. Health & Biosciences achieved strong growth in all businesses with a noteworthy uptick in health led by a strong performance in probiotics. H&B comparable currency neutral sales increased 9%, and we delivered comparable adjusted operating EBITDA of $165 million a 14% increase from a year ago. In Scent, double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance & Fragrance Ingredients led to a strong quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Fine Fragrance also remained strong, growing mid-single digits, led by new wins and volume gains. Net sales in the quarter were $603 million up 16% on a comparable currency neutral basis, and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $137 million up 38% on a comparable basis. Lastly, Pharma Solutions returned to volume growth with revenue of $250 million. Profitability in this segment declined in-line with our plan as we managed through unfavorable mix and one-time items. Turning to Slide 10. Cash flow from operations totaled $336 million this quarter, while CapEx year-to-date was $200 million or roughly 3.5% of sales. For the year, we expect that CapEx will be approximately $575 million as we ramp up in the second half of the year. Our free cash flow position in Q2 totaled $136 million, an increase sequentially of approximately $150 million from last quarter and a significant increase from $85 million reported in the year ago period. We paid $309 million in dividends through the end of the second quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $674 million. IFF also continued to make progress towards achieving our deleveraging goals and reduced our gross debt by over $900 million from last quarter, yielding a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4x at quarter end compared with 4.4x at the end of the first quarter. This was driven by improved operational performance, including solid working capital management as well as the closure of our Cosmetic Ingredients divestiture, which occurred early in the second quarter. It\u2019s important to note that we remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x or less following the completion of the divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which we continue to expect to be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11, I\u2019d like to turn to our consolidated outlook for \u201824, where we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance ranges, given our stronger than expected financial and operational performance in the first half of the year. We are now expecting net sales to be in the range of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion reflecting our expectation that volume growth will continue across the majority of our portfolio in the back half of the year, albeit at lower growth rates than the first half. Given the recent economic indicators and mixed results by CPG companies of late, we remain cautious relative to the outlook for demand in the balance of the year. Operating under this assumption, for the full-year, we now expect to achieve a 3% to 5% volume growth, up from our previously announced range of 0% to 3%. On the bottom line, we also raised our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range to $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion up from our previously stated range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This increase reflects our strong profitability performance in the first half of the year with a consistent view of the second half from our previously communicated guidance. It should be noted that we are also factoring in a greater level of annual incentive compensation given the relative strength of our performance versus budget and incremental second half spending related to business reinvestment. Specifically, as part of our strategy refresh, the team has identified investments that will accelerate the execution of our strategy, focus in business development, R&D and innovation that will yield results in 2025 and 2026. Based on current market exchange rates, we expect that FX will be closer to a 4% adverse impact to sales growth within our 3% to 4% range given. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $520 million to $540 million. I\u2019ll now turn back to Erik, for closing remarks. Erik Fyrwald : Well, thank you, Glenn. As I shared at the top of the call, I am pleased with the team\u2019s solid performance throughout the first half of the year, especially as it represents a significant improvement over our prior year lows. We are moving on the right track because our teams around the world continue to relentlessly focus on efficiently meeting the needs of our customers, resulting in driving profitable growth. And, I\u2019m energized by the progress we\u2019ve made so far this year, yet I recognize that we have a lot more to do to achieve the full potential of this great company. Already, we are making progress to better meet our goals and by taking advantage of the market\u2019s tailwinds and increasing our investments in our high-growth businesses, we believe we will be positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over time. I want to especially thank the entire IFF team for delivering these results, including rallying behind our strategic refresh to advance our customer focused and innovation-led strategy. We want every IFFer to share the same passion and desire to help our customers differentiate and win in the marketplace. We are making much progress towards this goal. As I look ahead to the remainder of the year, we will remain steadfast in bringing new products and innovations to the market while simultaneously executing a turnaround strategy across our Functional Ingredients business, including with strong productivity initiatives. And, I\u2019m confident the actions we\u2019re taking and the near-term operational priorities we are executing will create a stronger IFF. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh, your line is now open. Josh Spector : Yes, hi, good morning, and first congrats on a really solid second quarter here. So, I wanted to ask two related pieces here. It\u2019s first really around the sequencing of EBITDA in the second half. So, the step down in 3Q versus 2Q and then your implied 4Q is a pretty material seasonal step down. So, what is driving that in your view versus the stronger 2Q? And then, related is around volumes. So, the 3% to 5% lift is clearly better than you expected, but that\u2019s largely just a reflection of, I think, 2Q flowing through. I would say volumes in the second half are up 1% to 2%. The comps maybe do get harder, but it seems like with sequentially stable, maybe moving around a little bit, that\u2019s a pretty easy bar to beat. So, what are you seeing on the volume side that we might be missing? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Hey, good morning, Josh. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll start with your second one and then we\u2019ll come back to the EBITDA question. We are expecting more modest volume growth in the second half of the year, specifically in the fourth quarter. We are forecasting about a 4% volume uplift year-over-year in Q3 and flattish in Q4. As a reminder, last year sequentially was negative 7%, negative 11%, negative 7% and negative 3%. We are somewhat sort of cautious on Q4, combination of, the overlap from last year and then secondarily, the end consumer continues to be very, very unique and the economic indicators, as you\u2019re well aware, are probably more negative now than they were a few months ago. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving sort of the volume expectations. The EBITDA first half versus second half is really a reflection of lower revenues in the second half. Big portion of that is seasonal. We expect that basically we will be about $400 million less revenue based on our guide in the second half of the year, than in the first half of the year. That is notably $300 million in the fourth quarter, which is always our seasonally our lowest. So, that really drives the vast majority of the change in the first half versus the second half. I will also add that we are investing about $20 million to $30 million incremental OpEx in the back half of the year. Given the performance this year, we want to reinvest to begin to accelerate growth for \u201825 and \u201826. So, that\u2019s another piece of the equation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Nicola, your line is now open. Nicola Tang : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. It actually feeds on quite nicely from your last answer there, Glenn. I was wondering if you could give more color on some of those incremental investments around R&D and commercial assets and capacity. Could you give a few more specific examples and how you expect that to feed through or contribute to \u201825 and \u201826? And, you gave some helpful quantification on the CapEx for the next few years in terms of this OpEx step up. Should we also extrapolate that going forward as well? Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : Right. Thanks for the question, Nicola. And, we\u2019re very excited about the increased investment in OpEx, as Glenn mentioned, $20 million to $30 million that we\u2019re putting into the Company this year to have impact in the coming years, \u201825, \u201826 and beyond. That includes, of course, R&D, and we\u2019re increasing R&D spend in both, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Flavors. And that includes, by the way, accelerating our transformation in biotech to come out with new fragrances and flavors with our biotech capabilities that will enhance our Scent and Flavors businesses. We\u2019re also increasing the R&D to find more naturals, both for Scent and for Flavors. Obviously, a great market trend towards naturals. We\u2019re leaders in that area, and we want to continue to strengthen our leadership position. Also across all three of those businesses, we\u2019re adding commercial capability. And, in our Functional Ingredients business, we\u2019re adding more technical service capability to better sell higher-value products that we have in our Functional Ingredients portfolio. On the OpEx or excuse me, on the CapEx side, we\u2019re adding capacity, especially in Health & Biosciences, but across all three of those high growth markets of businesses, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Flavors, to ensure that we always have very reliable, high-quality supply for all of our customers around the world for all those product lines. So, we\u2019re making significant investment now, and we\u2019ll continue to ramp that up in the coming years to ensure that we continue to profitably grow very aggressively those business units. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. John, your line is now open. John Roberts : Hi, congrats on the quarter. Erik, on Slide 7, this end-to-end operating model replaces the reorganization that your predecessor has started. Is the model fully in place, or can you tell us where you are? When you\u2019ll be fully in place? Erik Fyrwald : Yes. We\u2019re making a lot of really good progress, John. Thanks for the question. And, what I would say is that the clarity has been very well received by our people. And, I think that the uncertainty has been cleaned up. The business teams are getting put in place. They\u2019re very excited and very energized by the clarity of decision making, their ability to set strategy and then to execute all elements of the business from R&D, operations, commercial and all the functions to support that those gears working together to drive each of the business units. And, I can tell you that we\u2019re starting to feel the benefits of that by seeing the strategies being executed and being strengthened in terms of being able to take our innovation from R&D and get it through the creation and into commercial operations, produce it and then get it in there commercially. And, it\u2019ll take a while to fully drive the benefits, but we\u2019re starting to feel the strength and improvements in energy and ability to do that. The other thing that\u2019s really interesting here is with the focus business units having their strategy and by the way, from that comes the five year plan, which gives us more clarity on where we\u2019re investing. We\u2019re able to better differentiate between the units on where we put more of the investment and where we put less of the investment, where we need more productivity and where we need to focus that productivity to make sure that we\u2019re competitive cost wise and able to drive margins. And then also, as you get that clarity on each business unit, what they need to do to win, it also increases the ability of businesses to collaborate effectively. And so, that collaboration, the synergy is now much less driven corporately with corporate programs and lots of consultants and lots complexity and much more from the businesses where they know the customers and where that synergy, where that leverage makes sense. So, we\u2019re making good progress. And by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have all five units operating well, and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll start reporting the five business units. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham, your line is now open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Erik, I just want to go back to the strategic refresh specific to R&D. Does that entail more spending as it relates to R&D as a percentage of sales or is it more repositioning resources with an overlay of accountability? And then, also on the CapEx piece, the Company has been spending roughly $0.5 billion in CapEx post the DuPont acquisition. So, as you sort of look back, was that just maintenance CapEx basically and now you\u2019re adding growth CapEx? Is that the right sequencing to think about as you go back to your comments about 6% CapEx to sales going forward? Erik Fyrwald : Yes, thanks for the question, very important. Let me start with the CapEx. So, we now with the strategic clarity with the business units, the clarity of our strategies, we know we have to spend more on growth investments to realize our growth ambitions, but we also have some foundational investments that we need to make that we\u2019re underinvested before in basic making sure that our plants are up to standards that we need to have them operate well, reliably with high-quality. We have some ERP investments that we need to make that are kind of that are foundational. But, on top of that, we have aggressive growth targets, and we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019ve got the facilities to deliver on those growth targets. On the R&D spend, we are absolutely increasing R&D spend as a percentage of sales in our Health & Biosciences business and will increase the R&D spend in our Flavors and Scent businesses as we grow those businesses. And, I think that will be really important to ensure that we continue to strengthen those businesses and get the full benefit of their potential. On the Functional Ingredients side, it\u2019s heavily leaning towards making sure that we\u2019ve got the right cost position, that we\u2019ve got enough productivity to turn continue to turn around that business and get it on the right track and get it competitive with its competitive set. And, we\u2019re making good progress on that, by the way. And, part of that will involve consolidation of some of our manufacturing facilities, which will take some initial CapEx, but we\u2019ll have very, very high returns. And then finally, we are pushing strengthening our productivity across the Company. When we talk about empowered business units, each of the business units also has a productivity leader now that\u2019s focused on making sure that we\u2019re driving productivity within each business unit to be able to improve margins and invest more in innovation. And then, we\u2019re talking about lean corporate functions that effectively and efficiently support the business units. And, each of those corporate functions has a productivity lead to make sure that we\u2019re fully competitive on costs for our corporate functions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Kristen, your line is now open. Kristen Owen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to know if we could unpack some of the volume drivers behind each of the businesses in Q2. Just help us understand the mix between end user demand, channel restock and or some of the pricing incentives that you\u2019ve talked about? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Good morning, Kristen. Thank you for the question. What we\u2019re seeing is actually no incremental improvement in the consumer. So, I know everyone sort of tracks what\u2019s happening, but neither food and beverage, [H&B] (ph) really are showing any strengthening the market. So, our volume growth we believe is a function of two things. First of all, the lack of destocking from prior year. So, it was pretty significant as you know in the first half of the year. We do not see any restocking at this point in time. I would note that Pharma\u2019s destocking lagged a bit. And all the other businesses we think were largely done at the end of last year. Pharma, largely done at the end of this quarter, so that we see the volume of trajectory for Pharma improving going forward. We also track very closely our volume performance vis-a-vis our key competitors by segment. And, we\u2019re pleased in terms of where we are generally performing at or better across the entire Board. And, we believe it\u2019s really a function of sort of three things. One is, as Erik mentioned, the innovation focus. We\u2019ve increased our intensity relative to our innovation pipeline. Secondarily, our sales pipeline, we spent a lot of energy to rebuild our pipeline and really accelerate our ability to win new business and win back business. And then third, I would have a special call out for the Ingredients business. Ingredients business has actually come back very strongly based on the remediation efforts that we launched last year into this year. Part of that, as a reminder, is taking some of the deflation that business has experienced in reinvesting in pricing at the start of the year and that\u2019s actually played out very well. We had about 7%, 8% plus volumes in the ingredients business in the second quarter alone. So, that\u2019s how we sort of characterize. Again, we\u2019re confident in terms of what we can control, but the market continues to give us pause because we\u2019re just not seeing so lot of strength in the consumer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Patrick, your line is now open. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. Given some of the incremental increase in OpEx and CapEx, but revised guidance upward, is there any update to free cash flow guidance for the year and any items we should be monitoring there? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Hey, good morning, Patrick. Thanks for the question. We are still guiding to the full-year of $600 million. As a reminder, when we started the year, it was $500 million. We upped our guidance to $600 million the last quarter, in part to reflect we were pointing towards the higher end of our previous guidance. We are expecting earnings to be up, as we mentioned, with the higher guidance. There will be slightly higher working capital. As the businesses are growing, basically have to make sure our inventories are in the right position to continue to support it. I would note that that $600 million of free cash flow includes roughly $350 million of Reg G items. Those are largely related to transactions, taxes, implementation costs, fees, etcetera. So, adjusting for that, taking the Reg G cost out for more like [$9.50] (ph) for the year, which is very consistent with what we guided previously as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Mike, your line is now open. Mike Sison : Hey, guys. Nice quarter and outlook. In terms of Functional Ingredients, how has the new strategy driven the volume recovery? I think you had nice high-single digit recovery in 2Q. In addition, pricing is lower. Can you share a little bit of details on EBITDA margin? Is it up meaningfully? Did it improve? And then, just your thoughts on the second half for Functional Ingredients? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Hey, thanks, Mike, and good morning. Yes, relative to Functional Ingredients, not only is the topline performing well, the gross profit and our EBITDA trajectory is actually progressing very nicely against expectations. So, for the second quarter alone, on a like-for-like basis, including normalizing for the LBK write-off last year, so if you normalize for that, we were up about 250 basis points in terms of gross margin, which is consistent from the first quarter as well and consistent with where we think the full-year is going to be. As we mentioned last year, the business had dropped to high-single digit EBITDA margin. Our goal has been to get it to basically mid-teens. We are tracking well to be low teens this year. Generally, the volume recovery, the sales pipeline, the innovation recovery is performing very well. The last set of initiatives are really focused on the cost structure of our global manufacturing footprint. We\u2019ve begun to implement some of those initiatives in the second half of the year, but they\u2019re going to fully begin to kick in next year 2025. So, a lot of work to do. We\u2019ve actually put a lot of effort against that business, but we have another sort of full-year plus to sort of get the business back to where we think we are, but good progress today. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe keying off of that last question and answer, Glenn, Erik, just a little more detail on some of the more tangible steps within the Functional Ingredients business to improve the profitability and get that where it needs to be from a margin and earnings and returns perspective. I think in the prepared remarks you did kind of refresh strategic plan there. So, is that really about facility consolidation to lower manufacturing costs? Is there intention on product and business mix across some different categories? And, can you talk about kind of how you think your volume performance in 2024, which was up nicely against kind of a very challenging 2023, compares to the end markets and peers that you look at in that space? Thanks. Erik Fyrwald : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think we\u2019re making good progress on transforming the business and getting it back healthy. We have achieved some significant volume recovery ahead of the market by going back to customers that we had before and making sure that they realize that we\u2019re serious about reliable supply, about serving them well, about making sure that we\u2019re very customer-focused, and that\u2019s played out well. We\u2019ve had to make some price moves with the market as others have done as well, but that was as expected. Actually, has resulted in the combination of the productivity, aggressive productivity with some price giveback, we\u2019ve still enabled us to achieve our margin goal margin improvement goals in that business. So, we\u2019re very much on-track. But, it is a combination of focusing on customers, really getting the clarity of strategy for the functional ingredients business, which we\u2019ve been working hard on, which tells us where we focus our commercial efforts, what customers, what segments, what geographies and making sure that we\u2019re driving the volume so that our plants are operating well, plus a very aggressive approach on productivity to ensure that we\u2019ve got competitive costs and are able to have the target margins that we want for that business. It\u2019s a work in progress. We\u2019ve still got a lot of room to go. As Glenn mentioned, we\u2019ve got another year plus to get back to where we believe that business should be. But, I\u2019m very, very proud of the team and the progress that they\u2019re making. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David, your line is now open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Erik, I know you\u2019ve been working on improving performance in your health business. With return to growth in the second quarter, can you share what\u2019s driving the strong performance in probiotics? And, how sustainable is that growth? Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : Great. Thanks for the question, David. First of all, I think there\u2019s increasing emphasis on healthy, health and gut health, which is great. And, the U.S. market particularly has rebounded and is picking up nicely. And as you know, we focused a lot recently on our finished format approach, which is working very well. I would also say that we\u2019ve added significant commercial capability. Our team there has actually done a great job of bringing back some really strong sales people that left IFF in previous years and have now come back home, which is really helpful because it\u2019s great that they went out and thought that there were things were better, but now come back to IFF because they like what we\u2019re doing at IFF. And by the way, that\u2019s happening in some other areas as well. And then finally, the current performance is starting to turn and making some good progress. But, I got to tell you, we\u2019ve got a very exciting pipeline in our Health business that I think will bode well for the coming years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator, your line is now open. Salvator Tiano : Thank you very much. I want to ask about a couple of recent trends and how they are or the main part of your volumes. And firstly, a bunch of CPGs, seeing the segment sales you mentioned, are considering moving back to discounting products to get some volume. So, are you hearing about that that could give another boost in your volumes perhaps next year? And on the other hand, a lot has been said about the return of innovations and more SKUs by your customers post-COVID, which is helping now. How important has this been your 2024 results so far? And, is there any risk that this runs out of steam after your customers have a new product slate and they\u2019re done with this innovation focus? Erik Fyrwald : Thanks for the question. And, what we\u2019re seeing from CPGs is that they want to strengthen their growth and profitable growth like we all do. And, the way we\u2019re hearing most about their strategy is to drive more innovation. And, that\u2019s terrific for us because we love working with our customers to enhance innovation. And, just a couple of examples of what\u2019s happening there. Obviously, the desire for better health and our ability to reduce sugar and salt content through modulation with our flavors in a way that gets you the same taste, but significantly lower sugar or salt levels is really strong and is one of the key drivers of our Flavors business, which is doing very well. We also, in the Scent business, are working with our Fine Fragrance customers, for example, to enhance the ability to trigger emotions that the fine fragrance companies want to have. Just an example of that is Charlotte Tilbury wanted to come out with a range of products that triggers different emotions for consumers. And, we used our AI tool, our IFF ScentCube algorithm, with her and her team to develop this line of fragrances that one product brings joy, another product brings energy, another product brings relaxation, another product brings romance, a whole slate of products, innovative products. But, if you go online on TikTok and you search for Charlotte Tilbury, she talks about how exciting it was to develop these great products, which are doing extremely well together with IFF to make them happen. And, then we\u2019re seeing other innovation, which helps to drive cost productivity, such as cocoa prices are very high. We have cocoa extender capabilities in our Flavors and our biosciences businesses that are helping companies reduce significantly the amount of cocoa they use but having the same exact same taste at lower cost. And, then one other example, I think, is really exciting is that we recently, with a very large global food company, developed and they have launched a lactose-free milk in China, where our enzymes take out the lactose and turn it into fiber and so you get lactose-free milk that is lower calorie and healthier for you. And as you know, there are many, many lactose intolerant consumers in China, so a big market. So, this focus on innovation and our ability to work with our customers to bring great innovation that helps them drive their growth profitably is really paying off. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark, your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks and good morning everybody. I guess two clarifications. One, just on the outlook over balance of the year. The volume outlook to be weaker in 4Q. Is it something that you are theorizing? Is it something that you have line-of-sight on? It sounds like from your guidance that 3Q and July has gotten off to solid start. So, I guess I\u2019m curious just how you disaggregate those two pieces 3Q versus 4Q? And then, as we go into next year, are there any one-offs to consider like incentive comp? I think you had mentioned resets this year, so things to think about going into next year? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Hey, good morning, Mark. Thanks for the questions. Q4, we have very little visibility at this point in time. We have a very good view towards the third quarter book. Obviously, July is in the bank, and we have a good view to the current month and then September. So, there\u2019s not a lot of data points at this point in time to sort of give us any direction on Q4. Beyond, we are overlapping an improvement from prior year. So, we\u2019re negative 7% in Q3 of last year versus negative 3%. And again, we do think that the consumer dynamics basically suggest that end market demand will be flattish. We don\u2019t see restocking happening either. We think that the CPG firms are conservative. They\u2019re not going to restock until they see a strength in the market. So, all those factors basically just make us cautious on the fourth quarter until we begin to see the order book emerge. One off is a good question. The annual incentive plan is a very significant variable this year out of plan. Because of the very strong performance across all of our businesses, we are accruing an incremental $100 million this year of AIP. That\u2019s actually $140 million aggregate versus prior year. So, think about our guide of $2.1 million to $2.17 million that includes $100 million that will be normalized for next year as you just go into next year and get back to 100% sort of payout from standpoint. That\u2019s the most significant there really are -- there\u2019s always puts and takes and other items relative to where we are, but that\u2019s probably the most significant item by far within our P&L. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin, your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Thank you and good morning. You\u2019re making some pretty good progress on the balance sheet in the quarter and it appears as though that\u2019ll most likely continue with the EBITDA upgrade and of course the pending pharma deal. So, my question would be if we were to jump ahead Erik to a time when the balance sheet is fully repaired, so to speak, are there other things that you have in mind that you\u2019d like to do strategically if capital were not a constraint? Erik Fyrwald : Thanks for the question. And absolutely, our plans are to continue to significantly strengthen our Health & Biosciences business, our Flavors and our Scent businesses. We see a lot of opportunity with organic investments, both in R&D, commercial capability, digital capability, as well as CapEx opportunities to expand capacity and make sure that we always have enough products to sell all around the world. And then also, I foresee us returning sometime next year to really looking at bolt on acquisition opportunities and collaboration opportunities with companies that bring complementary capabilities, especially technologies that would be useful for us. So, we will we\u2019re already working on our strategies, and you\u2019ll see us get more proactive in these areas. Glenn Richter : Yes. I think it\u2019s also important to emphasize given, I\u2019ll say, our jaded history here relative to acquisitions is we feel like we have a phenomenal portfolio in place. We\u2019re going to prioritize the organic. And as Erik mentioned, the focus really is on bolt-ins, small acquisitions that provide either a complementary technology, a geographic strength, etcetera, as a way to continue to progress the business. At this point, anything large would be completely out of the question. Erik Fyrwald : Yes. And I think if you look at my experience, which the last 16 years as a CEO, we\u2019ve had a lot of positive experience with bolt on acquisitions that clearly fill a strategic gap and are integrated well, thoughtfully, carefully and done in a way that enhances the company\u2019s performance immediately, doesn\u2019t distract, doesn\u2019t take us backwards like you\u2019ve seen that\u2019s happened over the last six years here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Lisa, your line is now open. Lisa De Neve : Hi, everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. I have one follow-up and one question. So, one follow-up on the CapEx program, sorry, one more. Can you just please provide some detail on your digital investments including the ERP system? And can you please share how this will improve or impact your organization? And also whether there\u2019s any risks to execute and implementing on the CRP system in particular? And the second question I have is really how has your position with local and regional customers versus multinational customers evolved over the last couple of years? And can you share your exposure to these type of customers and how dynamic they are multinationals at the moment? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Great. So, let me take the first question first and just tell you that we are taking an ERP approach that is very step by step and very careful to minimize wasted investment and also to minimize risk of implementation. Erik Fyrwald : Just give you a couple of examples. So, the first step in our corporate ERP system development was implementing something called CFIN, our finance system, which we\u2019ve done already. It\u2019s already in place. We\u2019ve done the improvements, and it\u2019s getting better and better and enabling us to better do our closes with less people and less complexity and less corrections. The next step was just implemented in this past week called Workday for the HR systems. That\u2019s going as planned so far, going very fine. And then we\u2019ll do additional steps in the coming three years. So, we\u2019re doing it step by step to spread out the investment and spread out the manpower the focus required on it and to make sure that we do it well with minimum risk. Glenn Richter : If I could just add two comments. So, we will be converting we\u2019re currently on three incidences of SAP. We will be converting them probably over the next five years into a single pipe, if you will. We will be leveraging one of the legacy IFF pipe, if you will. That\u2019s going to be approximately $250 million over that five year period to get that done. It\u2019s very important to also add to Erik\u2019s comments is we actually have already separated one of our ERPs, we\u2019re on four a little over a year ago with a divestiture basically of our microbial control business and we want to get basically pharma out of the way before we sort of launch on the ERP conversion. So, think about this the second half of the year, once pharma is done, we\u2019ll be in a good shape. It\u2019s about $50 million a year over the next five years. Erik Fyrwald : Now on your second question, the way I would look at it, I\u2019ve just been all around the world, and I\u2019ve met with customers representing over a third, probably about 40% of our revenues with our people, and many of them top to top discussions with major global multinationals, regionals and locals, talking about what we do well, what we need to do better and how we can even more closely work together on innovation, cocreation of their product lines. And I tell you, I\u2019m very excited about the desire of customers, global multinationals, regionals, locals to work with us, to tap into our innovation and our people capability to do that is really, really strong. And so what I believe is that our history with the large multinationals, our understanding of the markets around the world of what works has enhanced our ability to better serve them as we focus more on customers, as a core part of what we do in our innovation powerhouse, but also as we increase our commercial capability, better serve them and the regionals and the globals. Glenn Richter : Excuse me, the regionals and the locals, which will enhances our ability to drive our growth rates ahead of the market. And that\u2019s a core part of our strategies for each of our business units. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren, your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, two quick questions. One was just, you guys have historically given forward quarter guidance for sales and EBITDA and you didn\u2019t for 3Q. So, I was just kind of curious, should we expect a change in that policy and approach? And then secondly, it was just on gross margins, if we could walk through the bridge to get to the 500 basis points of margin expansion beyond lapping the LBK? Like was deflation raw materials a benefit? I know you mentioned productivity gains a bunch in the release and the slides, but just how should we maybe think about gross margin progression in the back half and any detail on some of those productivity programs could be helpful too? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. Good morning, Lauren. We actually did provide outlook for Q3. So, we guided top line of $2.75 to $2.85 and then relative to EBITDA $5.20 to $5.40 for the quarter. So, that\u2019s the outlook for the quarter. Relative to progression on gross margin for the balance of the year, we had more significant upside in the first half of the year because of absorption LBK and other items. We still are forecasting a solid improvement year-over-year in terms of our gross margin for the second half of the year. And, it\u2019s going to be driven by volumes won\u2019t be quite up as much. So, that\u2019s a little bit of let\u2019s say a difference versus the first half. But, the productivity programs are continuing to deliver consistently quarter-to-quarter in the second half versus the first half. The net raw material basket is generally flattish in terms of where we are running from the first half to the second half going. So, we don\u2019t really see any significant upsides relative to that nor do we see downside at this point in time. So, hopefully that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff, your line is now open. Jeff Zekauskas : Two questions. Was there a diminishment of your volume growth in July or how were your volumes in July? How do they compare to the second quarter? And, to try Lauren\u2019s question once again, your cost of goods sold was down 9% on flat to down sales. How much were your raw materials down? I know you said that they would be flat sequentially into the second half. Glenn Richter : Sequentially, yes. So I\u2019ll answer. Our total net price in the business largely concentrated in Functional Ingredients is around 2.5% in the first half of the year versus prior. That\u2019s equivalent to basically the reduction in raw materials year-over-year. So, we basically use that to reinvest. Again, that\u2019s largely concentrated in Functional Ingredients. So, the other businesses are relatively flat year-over-year from a raw material standpoint. July started off well. I would note that we have a very good start of the quarter. However, Jeff, in the last two quarters, the pattern has been a very, very strong first month and then it diminishes second and third, generally the third month of the quarter, and this is our outlook, tends to be the softest. We believe is this is just consistent with our customers sort of managing their inventories tighter at the end of the quarter. So a good, good start in terms of July, but that\u2019s been consistent with what we\u2019ve seen as a pattern in the last couple of quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence, your line is now open. Dan Rizzo : Hi, guys. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Just one question. So I mean, can we expect any more potential divestitures? Are there certain businesses where maybe you\u2019re making them or improving them just so you can sell them because they\u2019re non-core? Erik Fyrwald : We are focused right now on the divestiture of pharmaceuticals and doing that well. We\u2019re also going through this strategy refresh for each of our other businesses. And today, our total focus is on performance and performing those well, enhancing the growth rates of our Health & Biosciences, fragrances, Scent business and Flavors businesses and turning around our Functional Ingredients business. As I mentioned before, as we separate pharmaceuticals, we\u2019ll give you an update if there\u2019s any change in our strategy. But right now, we\u2019re totally focused on performing well in 2024 and strengthening for \u201825 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. There are no questions registered at this time. So, I will pass the call back over to Erik for closing remarks. Erik Fyrwald : Just let me thank everybody for joining the call today. I\u2019m very proud of our IFF team and the improvements that we\u2019re making to deliver not only today but to strengthen our innovation and our productivity and our customer focus to not only deliver in the second half but further strengthen for \u201825, \u201826 and beyond. So, thank you for your interest in IFF, and have a great day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today\u2019s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President, CFO and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take questions that you have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik. Erik Fyrwald : Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m glad to be here with you all today to discuss our solid third quarter results. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll begin by providing an overview of our performance and the solid results across each of IFF\u2019s businesses, which gives us confidence to increase our full-year 2024 guidance. I will also provide commentary on our efforts to continue to strengthen IFF for now and the future. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed outlook at our third quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024, and we will then open up the call for questions. If you go to Slide 6, IFF delivered another quarter of solid results and significant bottom line improvement compared to a year ago. IFF achieved growth across all our business units with notable volume improvement across the entire portfolio. The combination of improved market conditions and our global team\u2019s passion and drive to serve our customers and address evolving needs across end markets was a major contributor to our performance. The actions we have taken this year to strengthen our business and capital structure as well as our push to drive productivity in today\u2019s dynamic marketplace are producing encouraging results. Importantly, we delivered high-single-digit volume growth with broad-based contributions across each of our businesses. Equally encouraging, comparable adjusted operating EBITDA grew by double-digits in the third quarter, primarily driven by volume performance and productivity gains. Considering our solid performance in the third quarter, specifically flowing through our over delivery in the quarter as well as our continued cautiously optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our full-year 2024 financial guidance. We are making solid progress against our targets and are confident we will achieve net sales between $11.3 billion $11.4 billion which is almost $100 million higher than our previous guidance range. For EBITDA, we are tightening the range and are now targeting the high-end of our previously communicated range of $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion. Lastly, I am pleased to share that we remain on track to complete the previously announced divestiture of our Pharma Solutions business in the first half of 2025, marking another significant milestone in our portfolio optimization and deleveraging journey. Now moving to Slide 7. I want to highlight a few key achievements so far this year. While we continue to operate in a challenging end-market environment, our performance over the last nine months has bolstered our position as a preferred innovation partner and growth enabler for our customers. Over the last nine months, currency neutral sales grew 7%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Scent and high-single-digit growth in Health & Biosciences. Comparable adjusted operating EBITDA has increased 19% year-to-date, fueled by our strong recovery in sales volume growth versus prior year lows and our productivity initiatives. Since announcing our new business-led operating model, operating philosophy and strategy refresh earlier this year, our focus on getting back to the basics is translating into stronger financial performance with greater end-to-end responsibility and accountability. With a reinvigorated mindset and a simplified structure, IFF is better positioned to navigate today\u2019s complex and fast moving operating environment. Now these steps also include sharpening our focus on key end markets and increasing our investments in high growth areas for the benefit of our teams and our customers. In the third quarter, we also opened a creative center in Shanghai and have started to invest in additional creative centers in Mexico City and India. Together, these innovation hubs in important markets expand our global footprint and ensure we have the regional expertise required to serve customers on a more intimate level and address their unique needs. With our people at the heart of IFF\u2019s revised strategy, I\u2019m equally excited to announce that our employee engagement has improved significantly over the last 10 months. As I\u2019ve said before, empowering and enabling our global team to do what they do best is essential to our shared success as a global organization. And earlier this month, much of our global team had the opportunity to come together and celebrate IFF\u2019s 135 year legacy and 60th anniversary of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a true honor and reminder of the incredible legacy of this great Company. I have no doubt that, that legacy of IFF will continue for the next 135 years. But for now, I\u2019ll pass it on to Glenn, for a closer look at our quarterly results. Glenn? Glenn Richter : Thank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. As Erik noted, IFF had another very solid quarter achieving revenue just north of $2.9 billion, an increase of 9% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We delivered broad-based growth across Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions, with notable volume improvements across all four business units. Our ongoing productivity initiatives also contribute to a 16% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA in the quarter. Building upon our margin strength from the prior two quarters, we also realized another successful quarter of margin expansion with our comparable adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 19.4%, improving by 180 basis points versus Q3 of 2023. Adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.04 in the quarter, increasing 17% versus the prior year period as strong profit performance and lower interest expense were mitigated by foreign exchange impacts in other expenses. Turning to Slide 9, our improved performance was broad-based this quarter. Nourish comparable currency neutral sales increased 7% and we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 18%. This was led by Flavors\u2019 third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and modest sales improvement in Functional Ingredients. In Functional Ingredients, high-single-digit volume growth was mostly offset by our pricing actions, which were very consistent with our planned price investments this year. Overall, we are very pleased with our Functional Ingredients recovery plan that has delivered three consecutive quarters of volume growth with strong expansion in margins and EBITDA. Health & Bioscience achieved double-digit improvements in all of its businesses due to strong volume growth and productivity gains. H&B\u2019s comparable currency neutral sales increased 12% and we delivered comparable adjusted operating EBITDA of $173 million a 15% increase from the year ago period. In Scent, double-digit increases in both consumer Fragrance & Fine Fragrance as well as high-single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients led to a strong quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Net sales in the quarter totaled $613 million up 10% on a comparable currency neutral basis and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $127 million up 7% on a comparable basis. Lastly, Pharma Solutions returned to growth, delivering sales of $256 million, an 8% increase on a comparable currency neutral basis, while adjusted operating EBITDA surged over 32% to $62 million on a comparable basis. This notable performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in Industrial and mid-single digit growth in Core Pharma. Once again, margin expansion was primarily driven by volume and productivity gains. Turning to Slide 10, cash flow from operations totaled $702 million year-to-date, a $366 million increase from last quarter, while CapEx year-to-date totaled $303 million or roughly 3.5% of sales. Our free cash flow position totaled $399 million year-to-date, a sequential increase from $136 million last quarter. Year-to-date, we also distributed $411 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $569 million at the end of the third quarter, including $2 million in assets held for sale. Additionally, gross debt for the quarter totaled approximately $9.1 billion with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 3.9 times, a decrease from 4.5 times at the end of 2023. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion largely in-line with last quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and into the first half of \u201825, we remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of below 3 times, following the completion of our Pharma Solutions divestiture. This sale, which again we expect to complete in the first half of \u201825, reflects our near-term focus on optimizing our portfolio and improving our leverage position to further strengthen our capital structure. On Slide 11, I\u2019d like to turn to our consolidated outlook for the full-year \u201824. Given our improved financial and operational performance in the first three quarters of the year, tempered by some caution due to continued soft-end consumer demand, we are modifying our full-year \u201824 financial guidance. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.4 billion up from our previously communicated range of $11.1 billion to 11.3 billion. We also now believe that volumes will be in the range of 5% to 6% growth versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% increase. Pricing is also now expected to be roughly flat for the full-year versus 1% growth previously as real pricing remains consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year, but FX related pricing in emerging markets is expected to be slightly less than originally expected. Our outlook for the fourth quarter remains unchanged despite our performance in Q3, given macro trends as we closely monitor food, home and personal care end-markets, order phasing due to potential customers inventory adjustments at year-end and a slightly tougher year-over-year comparison. On the bottom line, we now expect to deliver full-year \u201824 adjusted operating EBITDA near the high-end of our previously communicated range of $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion. The high-end of this range includes the upside we delivered in the third quarter and assumes continued productivity improvements, a greater level of annual incentive compensation given the relative strength of our performance versus budget, and incremental reinvestments in the business with a focus on profitable long-term growth. Lastly, based on current market foreign exchange rates, we now expect that foreign exchange will have an approximately 3% full-year adverse impact to sales growth, assuming a EURO/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.12 at the time of our forecast was developed versus the previously expected range of 3% to 4%. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Erik, for closing remarks. Erik Fyrwald : Thank you, Glenn. I am tremendously proud of what our teams have accomplished both in the last quarter and through 2024 to advance our operating philosophy, our strategic direction and our execution capabilities. Together, we are building a stronger, more resilient IFF backed by a global team whose relentless dedication to innovation and winning in the marketplace continues to energize me quarter-after-quarter. Our solid performance this year is a direct reflection of the strength of our team and the shared buy-in for our strategic vision, and I am so grateful to work alongside such talented colleagues. While I\u2019m energized by our recent performance, I am clear eyed and recognize that there is lots more work to be done. As Glenn mentioned, we remain committed to reinvesting in our businesses, particularly our highest return businesses over the long-term to ensure we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth to our shareholders. In the near-term, however, we remain laser focused on achieving our 2024 financial guidance and encouraging our global teams to unleash the full potential of IFF with our incredible customers. Thank you all for your ongoing support. I would like to now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open. Josh Spector : Hey, good morning, guys, and congrats on a solid quarter. I was wondering if you could walk sequentially to your 4Q guide versus 3Q. I guess when we look at it, it looks like a bit more than normal seasonality and even counting for conservatism, it seems a little bit lower than what we would have expected. So, what are the assumptions that you have behind that? And, is there anything you\u2019re seeing now that maybe gives you some pause on some of the trends or any incremental data you could share there? Thanks. Erik Fyrwald : Thanks for the question, Josh. Let me just say that the fourth quarter has started as we expected, which is very encouraging. But, the pattern we have seen in the last few quarters is a strong start and then a bit of deceleration through the quarter. And, we\u2019ve got limited visibility to December at this point. So, we are cautious given the potential that customers could adjust inventory at the end of the year, which has happened in the last few years. But, let me just say that we want to make sure that we continue to deliver what we say we will deliver. But, the quarter started off as expected. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Nicola Tang : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a bit about Nourish. Can you help us understand what drove the sequential decline in margins despite the strong topline performance? And again, can you provide a bit more color between Flavors & Functional Ingredients and how you\u2019re thinking about the progression into Q4 as well? Thank you. Glenn Richter : This is Glenn. Good afternoon, Nicola. I appreciate the question. Just as a reminder, typically, our high watermark for margin is Q2 for Nourish, a very positive mix as they go into the summer season here. What you see as it relates to the quarter-to-quarter progression between basically 2% and 3%, and then ultimately, from 3% to 4%, there\u2019ll be a slight contraction in margin as well. As it relates to 2% to 3%, you have sort of mix more normalizes. And then secondarily, as we\u2019ve mentioned that, we are increasing our investments in the business. So, those are beginning to basically show through relative to the margin as well. So as you look out into Q4, you should expect, because of the seasonality, i.e, lower volumes for Nourish in Q4, that we will have some degradation of 50 basis points to 90 basis points in terms of margin quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I know it\u2019s still early, but could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about 2025 at this point as it relates to some of the high-level variances such as volumes, price, maybe compensation expense and also cost savings flow through? Erik Fyrwald : Thanks Ghansham. First of all, it\u2019s too early to give you any specifics. And as you know, we normally guide in February. And right now, we\u2019re finalizing our budgeting process. But, I will make a couple of comments. First of all, as you\u2019ll recall, we will have over $100 million in incentive comp reset in 2025, which is a positive for next year. And then, let me just add that we continue to work really hard on customer focus, on driving innovation and productivity to drive our performance. And, I got to say that, nine months in, I love how our teams are stepping up and driving performance, driving execution. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is now open. John Roberts : Thanks. First just to check on, are you on track for reporting Flavors separately from Functional Ingredients next year? And then, where was the incremental volume strength in the quarter or actually in the fourth quarter as well? I guess it\u2019s the second half volume strength. And, do you think that was more driven by promotional activity by your customers and some easing in their pricing? Glenn Richter : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, John. So, relative to where we are with separation of Functional Ingredients and the Flavors business, we are on track to basically have that set up as two completely separate businesses. Actually, most of the organizational changes have been announced and implemented. We will start reporting it starting next year, which means in the first quarter. So, May of next year is when you\u2019ll see the first cut between the businesses and we plan on providing some historical context as well. Erik Fyrwald : And just to add to that, we have announced internally we didn\u2019t see a need for a press release, but internally that we have named two Presidents, a President of what we\u2019ll now call taste and a President of what we\u2019ll call Food Ingredients. Glenn Richter : Yes. And, then relative to the performance in the third quarter volumes, we actually pretty much, it was fairly broad-based, John, across all the businesses. Pharma was right on track, but the rest of the businesses generally sort of exceeded expectations. We had very strong Flavors, very strong Scent and certain businesses with H&B are very, very strong. We believe it is a combination, as you\u2019re well aware, the end consumer, there\u2019s very few signs that the consumer is getting any stronger in terms of what\u2019s going on in terms of consumption. But, we do think that we\u2019re picking up share and winning in the marketplace, and that\u2019s a function of sort of the renewed focus on innovation, commercial excellence across the businesses, and the new operating model. As Erik had mentioned, the start as it relates to Q4, we\u2019re just being a little more cautious because we had been surprised in December the last couple of years. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dan Rizzo : Good morning, everyone. This is actually Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Given the progress you\u2019ve made this year, what do you think the right margin structure and ROIC is for your portfolio longer term once the farmer is gone? Erik Fyrwald : The way I would answer that is we are focused on driving continuous improvement in both margins and ROIC, and we\u2019re tracking them very closely by business now. And, the levers that we have driving customer focus, driving innovation and productivity are all helping us gain confidence that we\u2019ll be able to continuously improve both. Also, I\u2019d just add that we are prioritizing capital allocation to our higher margin and higher return businesses, Scent, Flavors, now we\u2019re going to call it taste, and Health & Biosciences. And, we continue to have strong emphasis on driving Functional Ingredients turnaround, which we\u2019re making good progress on. So, we are focused on these two metrics, and we\u2019re doing the things to continuously improve over time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is now open. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. Is there any update to the adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year? I think last time you guided to $600 million. Should that trend higher now that we\u2019re at the higher-end of the guide, or is it mostly offset by the working capital or other items? Glenn Richter : Yes. So, two numbers I\u2019ll give you, Patrick. Good morning. One is our reported free cash flow I\u2019m sorry, our full-year free cash flow, we expect to be basically largely unchanged versus previous guide. You sort of already mentioned the reason why the earnings trajectory is higher, but we also are building more working capital, which is almost exclusively related to higher sales, so it\u2019s sitting in receivables. So net-net, we\u2019re sort of in a neutral position for the full-year, so no change in the forecast. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Kristen Owen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to double click on Functional Ingredients. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of order activity coming into the contracting period? And, if you could provide an additional update on the Functional Ingredients\u2019 turnaround? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Sure. Yes, this is Glenn. Thanks, Kristen, for the question. The reality is we don\u2019t typically have a long order book. And certainly, there\u2019s very this is essentially zero into next year. The contracting period largely is around pricing with our relationships from the standpoint. It is going extremely well. We feel that this is a byproduct of the now two year work we\u2019ve had in place to basically remediate the business. So, we are seeing very, very good progression in the business and expect it to continue into next year. And, there\u2019s nothing in the annual negotiation process that suggests that we\u2019re not in a very good place to sustain the momentum within the business. As a reminder, we have taken a tremendous amount of effort to fix our service issues starting two plus years ago. Our service levels are extremely high. Secondarily, we reinvested deflation and giving price back to basically be much, much more competitive in the marketplace. Third, we basically reenergized our sales pipeline, so work very closely with the front-lines and the innovation resources to identify how to win customers back and win new business. That has been working extremely well. And, those collective efforts have actually resulted us in having mid-single-digit volumes this year. We feel like we\u2019ve gained back about half of the lost volume at this point. And, at the same time, we\u2019ve been expanding margins very, both gross margin and ultimately EBITDA year-over-year growth very, very well. The last piece is we are in the beginning phases of a fundamental restructure of our global supply chain footprint. That means actually making sure that we have the assets in the best locations from a cost perspective and the best supply chain to support that. That will take several years, but we think that\u2019s the final step as we\u2019ve committed to in the past of moving this business back to the mid-teens range in terms of overall EBITDA margins CIRCA 12, 13 this year, but we should be able to get to 15 plus in the coming years. So, we feel very good. The team has done a phenomenal job, has been working non-stop to basically make this afternoon feel very good with the businesses. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Erik, nine months into your tenure, how would you characterize the progress you\u2019ve made on the R&D organization and the innovation pipeline? And, what could that mean for new product sales in \u201825 and even \u201826? Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : Thanks for the question, David. And, I feel very good about the progress we\u2019re making. First of all, let me start by saying that each of our BUs have developed very strong strategies with very clear priorities. And, now with R&D embedded in the BUs, we can already feel both the power and the energy created by the focus and the better connection of our R&D efforts to customer needs. And I tell you, it energizes our R&D people and it makes the whole system work better. And, just one example, our Scent team now has a very clear plan and is already taking actions to strengthen our pipeline of naturals, synthetic chemistry and biotech molecules. So, it\u2019s great to see that. What I would say on that, in terms of the impact is I think that the main impact of the new projects will be in 2026 and beyond. But, I can tell you that the energy is already helping now and will help in 2025 in terms of seeing those that pipeline strengthen and having discussions with customers and also our sales force energized by that, I think will benefit us is already benefiting us. And, I think we\u2019ll have benefits in 2025. But, the specific project benefits will really come in \u201826 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Salvator Tiano : Thank you very much. I just want to ask a little bit about the disconnect between the very strong organic growth you\u2019re reporting and the more and the slower growing end-market. So, can you bridge a little bit the degree of outperformance that you have across the board versus slower consumer demand? And specifically on sand, it\u2019s been on a roll for several quarters and that\u2019s where I think your customers are also doing well in Fine Fragrance. But, how long can this extremely strong growth last? Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey Sal, it\u2019s a good question. One, just to remind obviously everybody is that there is a bounce back effect this year from the lag of destocking. So, there\u2019s a mathematical sort of performance that the entire industry is seeing as we overlap last year. So, that\u2019s obviously explained some of the incremental growth above what is happening at the consumer level. Fine Fragrance continues to be a unique case as everyone is well aware over the last several years. Since COVID, the category has exploded. We believe that that is a function of multiple things happening at consumer level, a plethora of new brands being launched, the impact of social media, ultimately the digital channel has become a very, very meaningful channel for the growth in the business as well. And, the use of Fine Fragrance has expanded beyond sort of a special occasion as a result of that. We like everybody in the industry, have seen that hitting the Fine Fragrance space. We believe that that will continue to some degree that there still are lots of new channels and new brand opportunities and certainly regional opportunities. I would also say that we believe because we do track how we\u2019re doing in the market versus others as we are winning share. So, as Erik had mentioned, the investments we have been making relative to new geographies, adding perfumers, adding new creative centers, etcetera is the other way that basically we\u2019re winning in the business and we\u2019re very committed to continuing to do that, not only within the Scent business, but more broadly across the higher growth and higher margin businesses within IFF. So, appreciate the question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, thank you and good morning. Can you discuss your expectations for price cost dynamics in the coming quarters? And related to that, would you touch on tariff scenarios? How do you think about potential for higher tariffs? Maybe you could talk about the experience in the past and how you\u2019re planning to manage through various international trade scenarios moving forward? Glenn Richter : Yes, good morning, Kevin. Generally, our price cost dynamic is flattish. We have seen throughout this year some continued deflation, not to the degree of last year, and our early outlook for next year is things are fairly stable. We believe there are certain parts of the basket that increases, but others some level of deflation. So generally, the price environment in our view is fairly static and the price cost dynamic is fairly static as a byproduct of that. Difficult to forecast at this point in time regarding tariffs. There is obviously some history here with the first Trump administration that was more focused as it relates to food and China as one country versus broad-based. So, it depends upon what if anything ultimately happens in the arena of tariffs. So, it is something that maybe yesterday people weren\u2019t very focused on. But as of this morning, members of the team are very focused on. I would note that when there was basically escalation of tariffs in China, it\u2019s probably intuitively good for our business relative our footprint, global footprint, our ability to react. As you\u2019re well aware, there\u2019s a more competitive environment within China. So, those tariffs could actually intuitively be advantageous to our overall business broadly. But obviously, stay tuned. And, as we think about kind of next year and provide guidance in February, there\u2019ll probably be more to speak about at that point. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Sison : Hey guys, nice quarter and outlook. Just on the fourth quarter, if you\u2019re at the high-end of your outlook range, it does imply that EBITDA will be down year-over-year despite positive growth. Just want a little bit of color on that and is that more conservatism? And then, quick follow-up, when you think about \u201825, a lot of companies thus far in chemical end have noted the first half not likely better than the second half. Could you sort of talk about what you\u2019re seeing from customers? And, do you think they\u2019re feeling better about next year, about the same, any sort of green shoots of improvement there? And, just kind of wanted to leave it at that. Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. So, hey, good morning, Mike. I\u2019ll take the first part, which is the year-over-year. We were 4.60 on a reported basis last year. As a reminder, we have FX and then portfolio changes from last year as well that actually turns that into around a 4.40 like-for-like. And, as you pointed out, our guide currently we get is around 4.40 for this year as well. It\u2019s very simple, honestly. It has all to do with our incentive compensation. As you know, last year on the full-year, we were below 100%. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we are materially above 100% in excess of an incremental $100 million of variable comp. That is a nearly $40 million year-over-year impact in the quarter alone. So, that sort of normalized impact is a huge impact. The rest of the equation is basically productivity is offsetting basically some modest level of inflation in investment. But, it\u2019s really that incentive comp growth year-over-year that\u2019s the biggest piece. Erik Fyrwald : And then, Mike, to the second part of your question, we\u2019re not really seeing strong green shoot comments yet from our customer base for 2025. But, the good news is that we\u2019re taking aggressive actions to strengthen our position by getting back to basics, as we said before, heavy customer focus, heavy focus on innovation. And by the way, as customers see slowing end-markets, what they want to do is have more innovation so that they can drive growth relative to the market. And, that\u2019s when they come to us and that\u2019s a good thing. And, I\u2019ll just also say we\u2019re doing lots of customer business, lots of focus on customers and co-creation with them of leading products around the world. In the third quarter, I personally visited with other executive team members 11 countries and representing over 4 billion people and it was just great. And by the way, up till now, I\u2019ve visited about 40% of our customer base and just see how our people are in front of our customers. And, I feel a lot of energy with our teams in front of customers, whether it\u2019s our salespeople, with our perfumers or our flavorists or our biotech scientists, co-creating products. And you feel the energy, and I would love it if you guys could feel the energy. But just as an example, I was just in India and Indonesia and was super excited to not only hear about our double-digit growth across Scent, Flavors, Health & Biosciences and Food Ingredients, but met with customers that are very bullish about their growth in these high growth markets, but also about the innovation that we\u2019re bringing with these creative centers to help them grow. So tough market, but I believe that we\u2019re putting in place the right things to grow above market. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to go back to the question on end demand and maybe ask it in a bit of a different way. One is, if you could just maybe try to give some framework around how much of the sales growth is from restocking? And, then more specifically, we all can look at the big multi-national public companies volume trends and you can see it\u2019s clearly lower even if roughly half of your sales growth is attributable to destocking. So, I guess the question is, are you seeing more growth out of local and regional companies and private label relative to some of these big multi-nationals and maybe there\u2019s a bit of a shift there, reversal relative to recent years? And then, just remind us how you think about whether the customers are local, regional, private label compared to a multi-national? I recall that you\u2019re fairly agnostic. I just want to make sure that\u2019s the case. Thank you. Erik Fyrwald : I would start by saying that both are very, very important to us. And, the multi-nationals that are focused on innovation and driving superior products are wanting more of our innovation and we\u2019re doing more projects with them and that\u2019s helpful to their growth and to our growth. But also the regionals and the locals are also growing and we\u2019re, I think, strengthening our strategies and our capabilities to serve them locally. And, that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing around the world. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building more creative centers to service both the global companies but also the locals the regionals and the locals. So, we\u2019re seeing growth opportunities across, but of course, there are some geographies and there are some segments that are growing faster than others. But we\u2019re, I think, now very clear on making sure that we\u2019re able to grow in all three customer segments. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to talk about reinvestment rates because I think initially seeing the implied EBITDA for 4Q and I know you just clarified and said it\u2019s more or less all the incentive comp dynamic. There had been a thought that some of it was reinvestment ahead of next year pulling some activity forward, which is completely typical to see from companies when there\u2019s flexibility. So, wanted to talk a bit about reinvestments for next year? This year there was a lot of flexibility created in the P&L as you had the restocking dynamics and strength on topline. So, how should we think about reinvestment next year, Erik, as you\u2019ve gotten closer and closer and closer to the business and looking to build back R&D, build back capabilities and set the stage for big pipeline in \u201826? How should we think about rates of reinvestment spending in \u201825 versus what we saw in \u201824? Thanks. Glenn Richter : Yes. Lauren, I\u2019ll start and hand it over to Erik. I\u2019ll just sort of clarify the [24] (ph) impact as we communicated last time, which is the same, is $20 million in the P&L. So, it\u2019s roughly 10 and 10 in Q3 and Q4. So, that will annualize by another $20 million in the first half of next year. That\u2019s independent of any additional level, but that\u2019s our starting point. Erik Fyrwald : And then from there, we\u2019re planning on continuing to grow our topline and with that be able to invest the same percentage of sales in our innovation and other areas to drive growth. And that $20 million is going to commercial people, to technical sales, experts to increase more perfumers, more flavors, and R&D people. So, really strengthening our ability to drive innovation. At the same time, we\u2019re strengthening our ability to drive productivity and make sure that we\u2019re able to drive productivity in a way that we keep continuously improving our margins and our ROIC and be able to invest even more in innovation. So, I think it\u2019s a virtuous cycle that we drive the innovation, which gives us sales growth, which enables us to invest more in innovation. At the same time, we drive productivity to help our margins but also enable us to invest more in innovation. And, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve started to be able to do in 2024 and intend to continue to do in 2025 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. You talked about being satisfied with your volumes in October. Roughly, were they up mid-single-digits that is sort of continuing the pattern of what you experienced in the third quarter? And then secondly, in functional ingredients, you have some volume growth and you have some price degradation. In general, is the EBITDA or operating profit of Functional Ingredients growing nicely for you this year or not growing or shrinking? Can you give us an idea of how that business is performing? Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey, good morning, Jeff. So, we\u2019re mid-single-digit up in the month of October. So, same pattern we\u2019ve seen for the last few quarters. As Erik noted, it sort of drops there sort of fairly significantly with the last month of the quarter rather being pretty tough. And Functional Ingredients is sort of following that pattern. Functional Ingredients from a volume metric standpoint is going to be 5% to 6% volumes this year. They had very, very strong performance. That is largely been offset with price, so currency neutral are sort of flattish to slightly up. But to remind you, the beginning of this year, there was a lot of deflation in the underlying commodities supporting the business. We basically took those dollars to reinvest back with our customers on a very targeted basis, and it\u2019s helped us not only deliver the topline turnaround results. But to your final question, gross margins are up very nicely, fairly consistent with Flavors in terms of the year-over-year and EBITDA itself is up very strongly. So last year, the business was, I\u2019ll say, CIRCA 8%, 9% EBITDA margin. It will probably finish this year north of 12%, and it\u2019s sort of on its way to our stated objective to get to sort of mid-teens over the next two years. So, hopefully that answers the question. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Lisa De Neve : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just want to come back a little bit to the growth. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about segmental growth and growth cost efficient, but can you share how growth has been different across your regions and across the segments in that? And, maybe can you also share how your performance has been in China and maybe also in India, given a lot of your customers had very big volatility of delivery in these regions? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Yes. Good morning, Lisa. So, I\u2019ll provide some general perspectives and then turn it over to Erik. Generally, all of our businesses have performed well across the board. Pharma lagged as we expected. The destocking was a little bit more later in the cycle. Pharma is now back in the very strong positive territory in the second half of the year as expected. But, all of the businesses have actually done very well from the start of this year standpoint. China and India are two different stories. China, while there\u2019s been some improvement, still is a little bit choppy in terms of the growth trajectory given the local market. India is extremely strong. We are, as Erik mentioned in early comments, really doubling down on investments within India to really continue to capture that share in terms of kind of the growth opportunities. So I don\u2019t know, Erik -- Erik Fyrwald : I\u2019d just add that we\u2019re investing in creative centers in the growth markets, including India, very aggressively to ensure that we continue to grow strong in those markets. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Chris Parkinson : Great. Good morning. Could we just dig in a little bit more into the H&B result? Obviously, it\u2019s been pretty solid, but just the composition of kind of the sub-segments, the probiotics recovery, and anything that we should be thinking about and considering as we enter 2025? Thank you. Glenn Richter : Yes. Hey, good morning, Chris. Every single business within H&B had a very good performance within the quarter. Probiotics bounced back a lot. As you\u2019re well aware, over the last couple of years, there has been softness in the business, in part given the situation in China. It\u2019s our second largest market. It\u2019s very close to the size of North America. So, as goes China, it does whipsaw the business sort of back and forth, but the third quarter was a very, very strong quarter across the board. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back to Erik for closing remarks. Erik Fyrwald : Well, first of all, I want to thank you all for joining today. Appreciate your questions and your interest in IFF. I\u2019ve now been here for just about 10 months, and I\u2019ve got to tell you that I\u2019m more excited than ever about the prospects for our Company. I love team IFF. I love our customers. I love spending time with them. I love our innovation and really appreciate the work that our teams are doing to have delivered the first three quarters. And, I can tell you that we\u2019re all very much focused on making sure that we deliver the fourth quarter but doing it in a way that strengthens us for \u201825 to \u201826 and beyond. So, thank you very much, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
