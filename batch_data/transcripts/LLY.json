For the conference all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will turn the conference now over to your host, Mr. John Lechleiter, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead sir. John Lechleiter : Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for the second time this week, today to discuss Eli Lilly & Company's first quarter 2014 earnings. I\u2019m John Lechleiter, Chairman, President, and CEO. This quarter and going forward we're taking a slightly different approach to our quarterly calls, we are bringing more of our senior leaders into the room to participate and to answer your questions and we hope that this enhances the quality of the information we are able to provide you during these sessions. So joining me today are on the call are Derica Rice our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health and Phil Johnson and Ilissa Rassner of Lilly Investor Relations team. During this conference call as usual we anticipate making projections and forward looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Before covering our first quarter 2014 results, I\u2019d like to share some high level observations. Lilly continues to make good progress in executing the strategy we laid out nearly five years ago to navigate through this period of unprecedented loss of the revenue and income precipitated by patent explorations for several of our largest products. We have continued to invest in R&D and have successfully replenished our late stage pipeline. The first fruits of these efforts are manifest in the approval on Monday evening of Cyramza by the U.S. FDA. We have three other molecules currently under regulatory review with more to follow soon and we have the very real prospect of launching two additional NMEs empagliflozin and dulaglutide in major markets later this year. We had focused our business in core therapeutic areas including diabetes, oncology, neuroscience and animal health. In oncology, our 2008 acquisition of ImClone is paying off, while in diabetes our global partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim will enable us to launch two potential best in class oral agents in a three year period. And you know about Elanco Animal Health soon to be the second largest enterprise of its kind following our acquisitions of Lohmann Animal Health and Novartis Animal Health. Finally, we worked tirelessly and largely behind the scenes to reshape every aspect of our company to reduce costs, improve quality and productivity and to regain the customer focus that has been at the heart of Lilly's historic record of success. Today, we are a more capable, more agile and more focused competitors than ever before. While we will never declare a victory, we are encouraged by our progress through this most difficult period and with every positive data read out and every regulatory filing, more and more confidence at this company is on a clear trajectory for success. All of this further [builds] our confidence that 2014 is indeed an inflection point for Lilly leading to a bright future. Now with that framing, let me get into the meat of today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since last quarter's call and it's certainly been an event till last three months what we believe shows great promise in the execution of our strategy. On the regulatory front, the first quarter was another eventful period. In oncology, the FDA approved ramucirumab as a single-agent treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer with disease progression after prior chemotherapy. With this approval, ramucirumab becomes the first FDA approved treatment for patients in the study. This is an important milestone for patients with this difficult to treat disease. It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In coming weeks, we will make the product commercially available under the trade name Cyramza. In diabetes, the FDA issued a complete response letter for empagliflozin. The letter cited the need to resolve previously observed deficiencies at the Boehringer Ingelheim facility where empagliflozin will be manufactured. The FDA did not ask for any new clinical trials to support the approval of the applications. FDA has completed its inspection of this facility and Boehringer Ingelheim has provided its responses to the FDA\u2019s observation. At this time, we cannot comment on exactly when we will resubmit the empagliflozin NDA. However, we continue to expect FDA actions in 2014. In late March, Europe CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending approval of empagliflozin as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Assuming the European Commission follows the CHMP recommendation and approves empagliflozin, we anticipate launch of the product in European countries beginning in the third quarter. Meanwhile earlier this month, Australia became the first market to approve empagliflozin under the trade name Jardiance. We also announced that the NDA for the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin has been accepted for review by the FDA. We\u2019re optimistic that this first in class fixed dose combination of a DPP-4 inhibitor with an SGLT2 inhibitor could provide a valuable additional treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes. Finally, the FDA issued a complete response letter for the NDA for Humalog U-200 KwikPen, a concentrated version of Humalog. We expect to resubmit the NDA before the end of the year. In clinical news, we announced that the Phase III REVEL trial studying ramucirumab in second-line non-small cell lung cancer met its primary endpoint as patients treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel experienced an improvement in overall survival compared to patients treated with placebo plus docetaxel. We intend to submit the first application of these data to regulatory authorities in 2014 and will present the detailed data at ASCO later this year. This marks the third positive Phase III trial with ramucirumab. We are pleased with this continued progress which confirms the promise we saw on this molecule when we acquired ImClone. At the AACR meeting earlier this month, we presented data from the Phase I trial of our CDK 4/6 inhibitor bemaciclib. These data were from a cohort expansion in patients with advanced breast cancer and supported our decision to begin our Phase 3 program in breast cancer. You may have seen that the first Phase III trial has been posted on clinicaltrials.gov and will begin this summer. We are pleased with the single agent activity seen in this patient cohort as well as the product safety profile and believe we could have a best in class molecule. Moving to diabetes, we announced that the AWARD-6 trial comparing once weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg to once daily liraglutide 1.8 mg met its endpoint of non-inferiority in the reduction of HbA1c from baseline at 26 weeks. Dulaglutide is the only GLP-1 agonist to show non-inferiority against liraglutide highest approved dose in a Phase III study. We look forward to presenting the detailed data at ADA later this year.  In business development news, earlier this week as I mentioned earlier we announced an agreement to acquire Novartis Animal Health for approximately $5.4 billion. We\u2019re excited to combine two premier and complementary animal health companies, which will create a new top tier global animal health player, one that will continue to lead in innovation and customer value. We expect the acquisition to close by the end of the first quarter of next year. As you will recall, we also announced in February an agreement to acquire Lohmann Animal Health, a privately-held German company that is a global leader in poultry vaccines. This acquisition expected to close this quarter; we\u2019ll establish Elanco as a global poultry leader and solidify Elanco\u2019s vaccine presence and manufacturing capabilities. In other news, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled in Lilly\u2019s favor upholding the U.S. Vitamin Dosage Regimen Patent for Alimta, which expires in May 2022. The German Court also ruled in Lilly\u2019s favor confirming that Alimta\u2019s European vitamin dosage regimen patent would be infringed by the contemplated entry of Actavis\u2019 generic pemetrexed dipotassium product in Germany prior to June 2021. We\u2019re pleased with these rulings and are confident that these patents are valid and enforceable. Also in the news the Sanofi filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the district of Delaware alleging that our new insulin glargine product for which we are seeking FDA approval infringes certain of their patents. We do not believe that the application for approval of our new insulin glargine product infringes any valid claim of the asserted patents. On March 2nd, U.S. patent protection for Evista expire. After a short delay, generic raloxifene is now on the market. And we\u2019ve entered into an agreement with Prasco to sell and authorized generic raloxifene. In an act those product liability case in Louisiana, a jury found in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding compensatory damages and significant punitive damages. Lilly disagrees with the verdict and intends to vigorously challenge this outcome. The agreement between Lilly and Takeda calls for Takeda to defend and indemnify Lilly for losses and expenses with respect to the U.S. litigation. After the verdict was entered in this case, Takeda notified Lilly that it was reserving its right to challenge its obligations to defend and indemnify Lilly with respect to the Allen case only. Lilly believes it is entitled to full defense and indemnification of its losses and expenses related to Allen and in all other U.S. cases. Finally, during the first quarter we executed share repurchases totaling $55 million under our $5 billion share repurchase program. We now have $4.4 billion remaining in the program, which we expect to complete over a multi-year period. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks John. First, I'll review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insight into the underlying trends in our business. On slide 7, you can see that revenue in Q1, 2014 was $4.7 billion, $0.16 below Q1, 2013. This decline reflects a full quarter effect of the Cymbalta U.S. patent expiration as well as the initial effect of the Evista U.S. patent expiration. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 1%. It is also worth noting that wholesaler purchasing patterns substantially dampen the U.S. revenue growth in the first quarter. Excluding this effect of rest of our worldwide revenue would have grown 4%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 5.4 percentage points driven largely by the loss of Cymbalta\u2019s U.S. exclusivity and to a lesser extent of a loss of Evista U.S. exclusivity as well as by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This quarter foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold had a negative effect on gross margin. However in Q1, 2013 foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold provided a benefit to our gross margin. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined from 79.1% in Q1 2013 to 75.8% in Q1, 2014. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters, with and without this FX effect. Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide 8. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A decreased more than $400 million or 14% versus Q1 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 10%, our R&D was down 18%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to our ongoing cost containment efforts and the reduction in the U.S. sales in marketing activities for Cymbalta and Evista. The decline in R&D expenses was driven by milestones payments and an asset termination charge in Q1, 2013 that did not recur this quarter as well as by lower clinical development costs. Other income and expense was net income of $56 million in Q1, 2014 compared with net income of $34 million in the first quarter of 2013. This difference was driven both by lower net interest expense and by higher other miscellaneous income. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.7% an increase of 3.2 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. There are number of pushes and polls driving this change. Recall that our non-GAAP tax rate in Q1 last year was substantially reduced by the recognition of the full year 2012 R&D tax credit. In addition our tax rate in Q1 this year is higher as no legislative action was taken in the quarter on the R&D tax credit up for extension. Finally in Q1 this year we recorded a discreet tax benefit and approximately $30 million which lowered our non-GAAP tax rate by 3.3 percentage points. At the bottom line, net income declined 40% and earnings per share declined 39%. While this is a significant decline, it is consistent with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full year guidance. Slide 9, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and this reconciliation reflects the charge of $31 million pretax equivalent to $0.02 of EPS that was incurred in Q1, 2014 as a result of restructurings reduced the company\u2019s costs. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today\u2019s earnings press release. Many of you have noted that nearly all our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results while we include this expense. For your modeling purposes and as you will see in our 10-Q we recognized amortization expense of $132 million representing nearly 3% of revenue this quarter. Moving to slide 10, you can see the total revenue decline of 16% in Q1 2014 shown in the yellow box in the middle of the page was driven by a negative volume impact of 8% and negative price impact of 6% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 2%. By geography you will notice that U.S. volume decreased 26%, this was largely due to the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta U.S. volume did benefit this quarter from shipments of our authorized generic Evista. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, volume on the rest of our U.S. from our products was down 6% this quarter. Excluding the effect of wholesaler buying patterns I mentioned earlier volume on these products increased 2% in Q1. Revenue in Australia, Canada and Europe or ACE was essentially flat while in Japan volume growth was particularly strong up 37% driven primarily by Zyprexa, Forteo, Cymbalta, Strattera, Tradjenta and Alimta. An increase in the consumption tax that went into effect on April 1st contributed to higher customer purchases. Our best estimate is that this added roughly $70 million or 15 percentage points of growth to our Q1 revenue in Japan. You can also see that the weaker yen trimmed revenue growth by 17%. At current foreign exchange rates this negative FX effect is expected to be much lower for the remainder of the year. In emerging markets, we saw strong performance growth of 15% partially offset by a 6% negative impact from foreign exchange. Volume growth was robust to 13% driven by Cialis, Humulin, Humalog, Vancocin, Tradjenta and Cymbalta. Volume growth in Brazil benefited from a Humulin tender while volume in China grew 15%. Elanco Animal Health delivered revenue growth of 6% and excluding FX, Elanco grew 7%. This performance growth was driven by higher prices for both companion and food animal products as well as by volume growth for food animal products. This was partially offset by a volume decline for companion animal products. Now, let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica Rice : Thanks Phil. Slide 11, shows the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2014 results. Now, at a high level, FX had a modest negative effect on our underlying foreign currency dominated revenue and costs. However, this quarter the effect FX on our cost of goods sold also had a negative effect on our results. In the first rows of numbers you will see the FX negatively affected worldwide revenue growth by two percentage points as Phil mentioned earlier. In the second row, you can see that FX caused cost of sales to increase by 7 percentage points. Driven by the strengthening of the euro, in Q1 this effect this year, the effect of FX on international inventories sold led to a substantial additional cost being booked to cost of goods sold, while last year it led to a modest reduction in cost of goods sold. As a result, excluding FX, cost of goods sold actually decreased 1%. So as you can see in the last two rows, why our operating income and earnings per share declined substantially due to the patent expiration of Cymbalta in the U.S., foreign exchange further reduced operating income and EPS growth by double-digit. Slide 12, shows our pipeline as of April 21. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. Now as John mentioned earlier, we received approval of ramucirumab for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer as a single agent after prior chemotherapy. In addition, we began Phase II testing of a biologic for anemia and we began Phase I testing on a small molecule for cardiovascular disease. And we terminated the development of four assets, two in Phase II and two in Phase I. As John also indicated with a number of encouraging data readouts in 2013, 8 assets in Phase III, 3 assets under regulatory review and 1 just recently approved and more Phase III data readouts, regulatory submissions and product approvals possible this year, we are confident in our ability to return to growth post 2014. Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. In the first three and half months of this year, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on key events we highlighted on our 2014 guidance call. While I would not go through each item on slide 13, we\u2019re excited about the opportunities to continue to advance our pipeline and to share data that will not only help investors better judge our growth potential, but also convey why we view this year as a new beginning in the next phase of Lilly\u2019s rich history. We expect to begin Phase III studies for two assets, bemaciclib, our CDK 4/6 inhibitor for cancer and our anti-sclerostin antibody for osteoporosis. As John mentioned, the first Phase III trial of bemaciclib was recently focused to ct.gov and will begin this summer. With respect to Phase III data, we expect to report top-line results this with detailed data presentation next year for four NMEs and one additional indication for ramucirumab. In January, we disclosed detailed data of the RAINBOW trial for ramucirumab as combination therapy in second line gastric cancer. And we anticipate detailed data disclosures yet this year for dulaglutide; our new insulin glargine product necitumumab and ramucirumab and in non-small cell lung cancer and possibly in liver cancer. We have also submitted the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin for the regulatory view in the U.S. and could have multiple additional regulatory submissions this year across our diabetes and oncology portfolio. Importantly, we\u2019ve seen positive regulatory action on Cyramza as monotherapy for second line gastric cancer. And we expect to receive European approval for empagliflozin later this quarter, following the CHMP\u2019s positive recommendation for approval in late March. Till this year, we could have regulatory action on empagliflozin here in the U.S., on dulaglutide and on our new insulin glargine product, although launch timing will be gated by expiration of Lantus\u2019 patent protection and in the case of the U.S. by ongoing litigation. In other key events for 2014, we are pleased with the Alimta patent rulings granted in our favor in both the U.S. and Germany. And we could receive the ruling this quarter from the recently concluded trials in the UK. And we lost patent protection for Evista in the U.S. in March and data package exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in Europe in the second half of this year. Although, we do not expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015. Clearly, we have a lot going on in 2014 and we\u2019re off to a great start. Now turning to our 2014 financial guidance. When we announced the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health, we lowered our 2014 EPS guidance range to reflect solutions from the deal due to business combination accounting and transaction cost. That non-GAAP EPS range remains unchanged, and our updates are to specific line items primarily to reflect the impact of the Lohmann acquisition as well as movements in FX and the Q1 discreet tax benefits. On FX, the main change is in the strengthening of euro, although a number of other smaller currencies have weakened. In aggregate, these changes modestly benefit revenue, but due to the euro, more substantially add to the cost of goods sold. Our revenue guidance is now a range of $19.4 billion to $20 billion, this increase of $200 million reflects estimated revenue from the Lohmann acquisition as well as the benefit of FX. Gross margin as a percent of revenue is now anticipated to be approximately 73%, down 1 percentage point from our prior guidance. Again this reflects the Lohmann acquisition including the anticipated inventory step up and the negative effect of the stronger euro. We\u2019ve raised our SG&A guidance by $100 million to a range of $6.3 billion to $6.6 billion, again to reflect the Lohmann acquisition. Our R&D guidance remains unchanged at $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion and other income is still expected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. To reflect the discreet tax benefit booked in Q1, we\u2019ve lowered our full year tax rate by 1 percentage point to approximately 19%, which still assumes extension of the R&D tax credit in 2014. In terms of net income, to reflect the dilution from the Lohmann acquisition, we now expect net income to be at least $2.9 billion. At the bottom-line, EPS on a reported basis reflects the Q1 charge of $0.02. Our EPS guidance is now $2.70 to $2.78 on a GAAP basis and remains $2.72 to $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Finally, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be at least $4 billion and capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion. Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance. Now, I will turn the call back over to John. John Lechleiter :  Thanks Derica. Before we take your questions, let me briefly sum up. We describe this moment as a pivotal point for Lilly and it\u2019s literally that. Even as we feel the maximum impact of our patent expirations, FDA approval of Cyramza along with the CHMP\u2019s positive opinion on empagliflozin are significant milestones as we move beyond this period to a path of renewed growth. Our recent announcements to acquire Lohmann Animal Health and Novartis Animal Health position us for continued growth in the attractive animal health business. For the past five years, we have been candid with you about our challenges and our plans for overcoming them and we\u2019ve delivered what we said we would. We said our first priority was to continue to advance our pipeline. And over the course of 2014, we will continue to generate and disseminate data on a number of Phase 3 molecules. We expect to make a number of regulatory submissions of potential new medicines and we expect to launch multiple products, starting later this quarter with Cyramza. We said we would offset some of our revenue loss by driving revenue growth across a broad range of products, geographies and businesses. Three of our so called growth engines performed very well in this quarter. Japan grew 16%, China grew 21% and Elanco Animal Health grew 6% despite the negative impact on companion animal health of a colder than normal winter. We said we would increase productivity and reduce operating expenses significantly and operating expenses in the quarter were down 14% versus the first quarter of last year. Overall, our first quarter financial results put us on track to meet our 2014 guidance. Our solid financial performance will enable us to continue to invest in our pipeline including our new product launches to pay the dividend at least at its current level to recapitalize our physical asset base to reinvest in our business through opportunistic business development and to return excess cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program. We remain confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute it. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil for the Q&A session. Thank you. Phil Johnson : Thank you John. If I could ask John the operator who is helping us with the call today to provide the instructions to the callers for the Q&A session and then we\u2019ll get started with the first caller. Operator : Certainly. (Operator Instructions). And the first go line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much for the questions and appreciate you guys putting the whole management team on the call here. My first question was for John, we\u2019ve seen a trend of increased focus and specialization occurring across the pharma group here, I guess more recently we\u2019ve seen companies actually taking actions to look at our strategic alternatives for non-core or sub-scale businesses, obviously you\u2019ve been require some aspects of these decisions, but more broadly, you [celebrate] your thoughts on these trends and would Lilly look to further narrow its focus and potentially divest assets. My second question was on the CDK4/6 program, if you elaborate a little bit more on the Phase III program here, I guess would you be looking at adjuvant in addition to the advanced breast cancer market? Second and can you just elaborate what\u2019s the earliest duty of this product to market? I am just trying to understand how quickly you can enroll a study is there interims just realistically when we think about this program being at position that you could file? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson :  Chris thank you for the questions. We\u2019ll have John to take your first one obviously and then Sue, if you want to comment on the second piece I can help if necessary. John? John Lechleiter :  Chris thanks for your question, I think that judging from events of the last week, if they combine to make a trend, I think you are, as I think I said in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, you are seeing companies build on their strength, add to existing areas of strength and get rid of assets that where they believe they might be a subscale. Animal health realistically is one of a few opportunities we have to diversify in a meaningful way in a business that we believe still has very strong synergies back to our pharma business, I mean when we look at research, we share common footprint for research, we share a good number of manufacturing capabilities and assets and a global infrastructure that I think enables Elanco to be successful and we\u2019ll continue to enable Elanco to be successful. I can\u2019t comment specifically about whether, we would look to shed other assets. I think from -- we're pretty -- we don\u2019t have that many sort of extra assets or businesses and OTC business for example or our vaccines business or what have you. But I think it's pretty clear that we're going to continue to focus a lot on diabetes and oncology and animal health. I think our bio-medicines portfolio gives us some options. We are going to know by the end of the year, will we be able to establish an autoimmune portfolio with 3 Phase III data readouts. We have a big bet still when you look at Alzheimer's with sola in EXPEDITION III trial ongoing now and enrolling. And then as we have said last call, we've completed [enrollment] evacetrapib which I think could be a very significant product in the cardiovascular space. So, I think we're guided more by where can we build on a solid footprint and on in the area where we have greater opportunity with the assets we have. And the idea of divesting assets would sort of only follow from that go forward kind of thinking, if that makes sense. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you John. And Sue on the CDK4/6 inhibitor. Sue Mahony : Yes, let me try and address the question on CDK4/6 inhibitor bemaciclib. We presented the breast cancer cohort data AACRBT and we have announced that we will be starting Phase III studies this year. In fact, if you look at ct.gov we have on that the Phase III study with (inaudible) in metastatic breast cancer. In addition, to that we have a Phase II single-agent study. We are excited by our single-agent activity that we saw in our breast cancer cohort. So we are initiating a confirmatory Phase II study there. With regards to other life cycle planning and timing of approvals of which I can't speculate on those at this point time, I would just say that we are going to continue to progress this molecule as we do as a safety, as we are excited by the single-agent activity and dosing and safety profile that we've seen so far. We also will be presenting our long cohort at ASCO this year and look forward to sharing more data on that. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Sue. John, if we have the next caller please. Operator : We and that\u2019s Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Anderso - Sanford Bernstein : Thank you. If I could just maybe finish out with a question on the CDK and that lung data coming up. Can you just directionally give us some idea of your level of excitement with that drug in the lung indication and assuming that the data shows some degree of positivity just that kind of the development plan forward? And then my other question is on your animal health business from Novartis, can you give us an idea of what you think that dilution will be to 2015 earnings on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. And you are talking remedying the manufacturing problems that division has had, so operating margin that Novartis disclose, I think was basically breakeven so it\u2019s not profitable. It seems to me that the minute you kind of transport this products into some other manufacturing facility, you have an immediate margins bump up, am I thinking about that correctly and what would be the timeframe for that? Phil Johnson : Great. Tim thank you for your questions. So we will Sue answer the CDK 4/6, Derica if you would ahead and take the question on the impact for 2015 non-GAAP earnings. And then Jeff if you like to talk about the goals we have for getting profits backup overtime that would be great? Sue? Sue Mahony : Sure. With the (inaudible) data we presented last year at ASCO the Phase 1 study and we have done a number of cohort expansion since then. As I said, we presented the breast cancer expansion data at AAC, we will be presenting the lung cancer expansion data ASCO, until we present that clearly, I can't comment on that data, against just to say that we are continuing to look at opportunities to progress this molecule and we will be updating you as we get new data. Phil Johnson :  Thank you, Sue. Derica? Derica Rice : Sure. Tim this is Derica. I can\u2019t comment or I am not able to comment as to what the dilutive effect would be in 2015 at this stage, obviously it\u2019s going to be predicated on when we actually close the transaction and right now we are still projected to close by no later than the end of Q1. What we have said is that if we assume a January 1, 2015 close we would expect that this deal would be accretive on a cash basis by 2016 and should begin to return to historical levels of margins that you have seen on Lilly\u2019s animal health business no later than 2018 our three years post closing. Jeff Simmons :  Yes, yes. So, I will follow up on that. First of all I want to emphasize that the manufacturing problems were as you know in Lincoln, Nebraska they were human health related, this is a big part of our diligence. The transfers have already started to take place on the animal health side. We are very confident as we look at the second half of 2013 in Novartis Animal Health, the trajectory that they are on. They came in to these problems in a top-tier growth 6% to 8% is in animal health business. And we believe when we combine what we have seen in their history and their trajectory in the late part of last year and the transfers that are in place that we can get to exactly where Derica mentioned, two to three years out we can get back to that mid 20s EBIT percentage and we have definitely spent a lot of time and the diligence looking at this transfer and transition in this business. So this was a big part of our assessment of the value. I am limited on more details than that at this stage. Phil Johnson :  Thank you. John if we could have our next caller please. Operator :  And we will go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Phil Johnson :  Hey Mark we can\u2019t hear you? Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group :  I am sorry guys, sorry about that, can you hear me now? Phil Johnson :  Yes we can. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group :  Okay. So I would just like to come back to the CD 4K if possible, couple of questions. Congratulations on the data; looked really good. I am just wondering in the Phase III program, you\u2019re using IB (inaudible) I am just wondering why the choice to combine the PET drug as opposed to letrozole which was obviously Pfizer\u2019s choice. And also wondering on the differentiated neutropenia profile that you\u2019ve seen for your drug, if you have any explanation, so that Pfizer has made some comments in the public domain that your compound made buy into different targets than theirs et cetera. I am just wondering if you might be willing to offer a mechanistic rational? And then finally on use of capital, given the Animal Health acquisition recently, earlier this week, should we as investors and analysts view you at least over the next year or so as reasonably be balance sheet constraint such that we should not have expectations that you could do a deal of similar size on the human health side? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great. Mark, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ll go ahead and have Sue take the CDK 4/6 questions obviously and then Derica on the business development going forward. Sue? Sue Mahony : Sure. The Phase III study that we have currently on clinicaltrials.gov, as you said is bemaciclib in combination (inaudible) in metastatic breast cancer and that includes both first and second line patients, we also I said have the single agent Phase II. We\u2019re going to continue to look at other areas with regards to (inaudible) is one of the obvious combinations of that. With regards to the mechanism of action, we know that bemaciclib is selected to CDK 4 and 6. We can\u2019t comment on why we\u2019re seeing this different levels in neutropenia other than we are seeing a different safety profile. And we as I said, we are able to do continuous dosing with this agent, we have single agent activity with this agent and we have a different safety profile with lower levels of neutropenia other than to say that we have, we selected CDK 4 and 6 I can\u2019t comment on whether there is a specific mechanism of action here. Phil Johnson : Derica? Derica Rice : Mark, this is Derica. As we stated on our animal health investor call earlier this week, the March animal health transaction does not change or materially affect our ongoing capital allocation strategy, we still believe we have the capacity to sustain our dividend at least at this current level, and we're still in a position going forward to consider future dividend increases, this does not affect our outlook in terms of our ability to complete our share repurchase program, we're still committed to the 5 billion. And as it relates to business development, we still have the capacity to pursue the types of deals that you\u2019ve seen from Lilly historically. We\u2019ve never been adding the space of mega mergers, but if you look at our history, the largest deal we\u2019ve done is ImClone, now the second largest deal is to be the Novartis Animal Health and after that was ICOS for about 2.5 billion. So within that space we absolutely have the capacity to pursue those types of opportunities. Phil Johnson :  Mark one thing I might add on the CDK 4/6 neutropenia, it certainly could be that Pfizer condition the market to believe that this mechanism would be causing neutropenia full stop and so those were linked. There was data we presented at AACR to show that those patients that received 30% or greater reduction in tumor size, a significant proportion of those did not have neutropenia. So I think we may need to rethink a little bit what is actually causing the anti-tumor response and what maybe causing neutropenia. John, if we have next callers please. Operator : And that\u2019s Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen: Thank you. Regarding the 2015 outlook, assuming a January 1, 2015 close of Novartis animal health, does Lilly view consensus of 317 as reasonable at this early stage. And if you are not willing to comment, should we conclude you are not comfortable? The second question is on your novel basal insulin. Based on the data that you now have in-house, are you fully confident that you have a differentiated molecule versus Lantus? And then the third question on dulaglutide, you achieved non-inferiority to Victoza in Award-6. But as the numerical trend was worse on some end point, how will you overcome that obstacle in the marketplace? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Steve, thank you for the questions. Derica, if you will take the first one of 2015 guidance relative to street\u2019s expectations that they have currently and then Enrique for the two diabetes question. Derica Rice : Hi, Steve, I like the phrasing of your initial question. But let me try to clarify, I\u2019m not able to comment on specific 2015 guidance at this time. And it has nothing to do with our level of comfort or discomfort, it just means that we're not in a position to provide guidance and we typically haven't at the stage of the game. What we have said is that we do expect that in 2015 that we expect to return the growth and margin expansion and obviously that was prior to the impact or the contemplation of the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. Phil Johnson : Great. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Steve, we have I think very consistently said that when it comes to our innovative basal insulin, we would only see us launching that if we truly can differentiate against Lantus. Now all of our trials are basically against Lantus, we have a number of measures that we are looking at, we have talked about glycemic control, we have talked about nocturnal hypoglycemia, a better weight profile and also lower use of the meal time insulin dose with a product as some indications that we basically saw in Phase II. Clearly, we also saw some signals when it comes to side effects. At this point in time, I'm just going to ask for all of us to wait, we believe that we should be in a position to issue a top line press release this quarter. On dulaglutide, I really cannot comment more than what we basically have said, as part of the press release, we are pleased with the results of Award-6, we will have to wait for the detailed disclosure of the data. At this stage we believe we have a very competitive product and we are very bullish on it. Phil Johnson : Thanks Enrique. John, if we could have the next caller please. Operator : And we will go to John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. John Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks for taking the questions. First question, John you had mentioned about the improved customer focus; can we maybe hear from your business leaders about that customer focus, especially since this changed pretty significantly over the last decade to the payers and the push back impairs on pricing, but in particular oncology and diabetes, how well prepared you are to secure formulary access for your assets, if you are going forward? And then quick question on the CDK 4/6, have you applied for breakthrough designation on the compound, if you haven\u2019t, what is the hold up for applying (inaudible). Thanks? Phil Johnson : Great. John, thank you for the questions, we will go ahead and hit the commercial folks for our pharma business. So, we\u2019ll start with Dave Ricks and then will return to Enrique and then since Sue can comment on oncology part of your first question and then also CDK 4/6, we\u2019ll finish with Sue. Dave? Dave Ricks : Thanks for the question. As John Lechleiter mentioned in his comments, we have taken the opportunity over the last four years as we restructured our company to really improve our capabilities to go to market, this includes significant investments in our payer capabilities, already Enrique in particular commented on that as we prepare for the diabetes launches. But we feel good about both U.S. and non U.S. investments we have made to represent not only the major payers but key accounts at all stages in the healthcare system. We have also substantially restructured our sales force not just to be stronger and leaner but I think go to market in a pretty different way. We\u2019re not going to go into the details of that for competitive reasons here but I think we overall feel good about our ability to commercialize the future pipeline. I would also comment that Lilly continues to investment in our direct to consumer and direct to patient capabilities globally which of course includes the DTC in the U.S. but also other direct patients contact initiatives and patient support outside the U.S. So overall, I think we are in good shape competitively here. Enrique, do you want to add to that? Enrique Conterno :  Sure. When it comes to diabetes, I think all of us know the payer environment is very complex, it\u2019s challenging, both coming from the decision that payers are making as well as competition that we have. From our perspective, we believe and we continue to believe that choice continues to be extremely important. Now, we clearly see that sometimes this is not an option that we have and in those cases, we do compete for preferential access, in particular when it comes to portfolio which is what we are marketing now. As we make the decisions, we do look at both financial and strategic considerations in terms of how competitive we are going to be with the different accounts. I would mention that in the case of Tradjenta, the engagement with the payers is done through BI. Phil Johnson : Sue? Sue Mahony : Yes. And with regards to oncology, clearly from a sales force perspective, we have a very experienced sales force globally in oncology. With payers, again focus is very in ensuring that we are bringing value to those patients in continuing to bring medicines that offer value to patient pays and physicians. We also really clear that we need to ensure that we continue to get value for continuous innovation which is the foundation of oncology development. With regards to our CDK4/6 inhibitor we are focused here is to ensure that we get this medicine to patient as quickly as possible and we will continue to work with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to enable that. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you John. Next caller please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. This is really a question for Sue. Just in the spirit of the industry specializing and getting more focused. In the area of oncology Lilly is conspicuously absent in immuno-oncology is that an issue without immune-oncology agents, can you still be competitive in this arena? And then secondly are you planning to develop studies combining your CDK inhibitor with immuno-oncology or rather ramu or the other TGF inhibitor, could you combine that, is that part of the game plan? But just really can you be competitive in oncology given sort of where the paradigm is changing? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Thanks Jami. Sue? Sue Mahony : Thank you Jami. It\u2019s a great question. Clearly there is a lot of interest and excitement about immuno-oncology and I think it\u2019s been very clear that we think new data some tumors, particularly melanoma in others. We don\u2019t have a PD1 and PDL-1 inhibitor. We do have a number of molecules in our pipeline though that do work on the immune system. The TGF beta pathway is important in immune defects in a number of tumor types and we have both large molecule and small molecule inhibitors to TGF-beta. We also have other molecules in our pipeline in earlier phase including our CXCL-4 antibodies, F1 receptor antibody and our P38 small molecule inhibitor as well as research efforts focused on it. So no, we don\u2019t believe that we're absent in immune-oncology at all, clearly we are excited at this point in time by the fact that over the last 18 months also we would have four positive Phase III studies, I\u2019m sure an overall survival improvement in lung cancer, in gastric cancer. And so with very much focus on ensuring that we get those medicines to patients as soon as possible. And yes we do believe that combination both of target agents chemotherapy and immunotherapy is going to be the future in oncology and we're very much focused on that. Phil Johnson :  Great. Thank you, Sue. Jan, you want to comment as well? Dr. Jan Lundberg : Yes I can also add that we have seen I think the emergence of a new area where a lot needs to be done still and there are a number of additional targets at the preclinical space that is being explored, but that will come to the clinic in due course. So I think we are serious about this and we have also done some key recruitments recently and are strengthening this area, where we can actually then apply our core drugs hunting skills immediately then to novel targets. Phil Johnson :  Thank you Jan. John if we can have the next caller please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger - Morgan Stanley : Yes, thanks very much. I was hoping that you could just explain in some detail how you calculate the -- sorry, I had an incoming call, my apologies. If you could just explain your calculation of U.S. net price, so obviously Cymbalta had a significant negative impact on that calculation. But I just wanted to better understand how you run the calculation whether it\u2019s the step down in U.S. net price in the first quarter or your full buck of business was solely driven by Cymbalta or whether the diabetes franchise is experiencing price declines? And how you go about calculating it, maybe you assume, I don't know the authorize generic price for Cymbalta or something and that drives that calculation down dramatically? And then separately, with respect to ASCO, just wondering, if you are what's your planning on in terms of investor events or specific investor discussions at that event? Thank you very much. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks for the questions Dave. While Derica respond to your first question and then Sue on your question regarding ASCO. Derica? Derica Rice : Hi, Dave. In regards to our U.S. net price calculation, it is really comprised of three elements, one is obviously any going rebate that we provide relative to the prior period. Secondly, here in the near term it does include the impact of the authorized generic which would be at a lower net price. And the third would be any adjustments we made to our growth to net accruals as we reconcile to any receipts that we're receiving from the government. As it relates to the rebate, the first point I started, we did see in the quarter, obviously the impact of the ESI contract in the U.S. where we know in our diabetes business where we did see price deflation rather than price growth on a net basis. So, those are three elements that are driving the price effect that you are seeing in our Q1 results in the U.S. Phil Johnson : Thanks Derica. Sue? Sue Mahony : Yes. With regards to ASCO, we have a number of interesting presentations at ASCO. We have follow up to the RAINBOW, gastric cancer study being presented, we've also got the necitumumab squire first line squamous study being presented as an ORO. And the ramucirumab Cyramza, second line lung cancer study being presented as an oral as well as CDK 4/6 lung cancer cohort. So clearly we feel that we have got some interesting information and we are planning to have a conference call of some sort to be finalized with [you all there], so to stay tuned on that one. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Sue. John, next caller please. Operator : And we will go to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeff Holford - Jefferies: Hi, thanks for taking my call. Just a bit further commentary from you on the insulin pricing environment in the U.S. (inaudible) obviously you\u2019ve got a bit of a onetime impact here. Just give me your thoughts about just sort of going forward how you view insulin pricing environment particularly in the analog space. Secondly do you think there is any other specific areas within animal health that you would look to add or build on this in the future? And then just lastly on your CDK, and there\u2019s been a lot of questions today, but do you think it is possible there could be any kind of different color got into profile regarding neutropenia on this products used more chronically in combination with (inaudible) therapy? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Jeff, thank you for the questions. While Enrique take your insulin pricing question for the U.S. obviously Jeff Simmons for animal health question and back to Sue again for the topic of the data CDK 4/6 inhibitor. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Yes. First when it comes to our overall insulin business, let me provide this a bit of broader context. When we look our overall insulin franchise, we had very good volume growth worldwide. Our volume growth was basically 8% to 9% when we look at our insulin franchise and this volume growth was solid across all regions based on our ability to be competitive when it comes to our presence in different geographies. When it come to the U.S. I think it\u2019s important that we do recognize, there were two impacts here. There was a net pricing impact of the contract ESI and other contracts as well, as well as there was a very significant inventory effect when it comes to wholesalers. That inventory effect was in the high single-digits in the U.S. So that was an important impact for us when we look at our overall demand and all of you have access to the script data, it is very good that we have seen not very significant impact when it comes to our share performance and our overall volume performance. Going forward right, this is something that we monitor very carefully when it comes to pricing, but we have now over 50% of the market that has gone to preferential formula is when it comes to analogs. Question is how quickly will the rest of the market go there I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are fighting to make sure that patients continue to have choice, but at the same time as I have shared we need to be competitive whenever a payers basically makes the decision that they are going to narrow the formulary. At this stage it is difficult to make more comments when it comes to looking at the future of insulin pricing, I would just say that we do monitor this very carefully and we have become increasingly more sophisticated to think about both financially and strategically what\u2019s in our best interest. Phil Johnson :  Jeff? Jeff Simmons :  Yes Jeff. I think to answer your question the first thing I would say is Novartis, deal we announced this week was our eighth acquisition since 2007. So I think we\u2019ve got a good track record here in terms of integration. And our focus, no question, rest of this year and going forward is going to be on efficient and timely integration of both Lohmann, which we hope to close here in this quarter as John mentioned and Novartis. That will be our focus. So I think as you look at acquisitions, it will be back earlier in the pipeline, heavier focus on innovation, 60% of this growth we\u2019ve out grown the industry 3x, and 60% of that growth has been innovation. So it will be acquisitions more at a product level earlier back in a pipeline. Phil Johnson : Okay, thanks. Sue? Sue Mahony : With regards to bemaciclib, clearly we see lower neutropenia in single agents, with single agent bemaciclib. We\u2019ll have to see the Phase III data with combination for fulvestrant to see both the efficacy and safety there. We do have a Phase I safety study that we will in combination with fulvestrant at ASCO, so we have to see some more data there on the safety profile of bemaciclib with fulvestrant. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks Sue. John, next caller please? Operator : And that will be Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS: Yes, first on Alimta, can you give us a little more detail on the usage trends, both in the U.S. and ex-U.S.? And then Enrique, you were talking about diabetes and insulin, maybe you could just give us your sense of what you\u2019re seeing out there with the orals DPP-4s, SGLT2s and also maybe comment on the GLP-1s as well, just trends you\u2019re seeing in the market and growth rates and how much SGLT2s is moving ahead of DPPP-4s and how much is using a combination therapy? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Marc, thanks for question. We\u2019ll Sue obviously take the first one for Alimta and then Enrique the second. Sue? Sue Mahony : Sure. So with the Alimta, if we look at our Q1 performance, Alimta sales grew 2% that was given by the U.S. with negative growth offset by strong performance in ACE and Japan. In the U.S. the decrease was nearly driven by buying patterns with to a lesser extent some selling price impact as we\u2019re seeing higher share in [340B] account. OUS, in Japan we saw again buying patterns, which in the other way was more positive way with regards to stocking in prior to the tax consumption change and also in ACE we saw very strong volume growth driven really in the maintenance. So what we are seeing is we're continuing to see a first line market share growth and continuation maintenance growth. And our focus really with Alimta continues to drive back to ensure that when patient start on Alimta, they continue on Alimta and we get more continuation maintenance. Alimta continues to be the market leader in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in the first line setting globally. We also, Alimta is the market leader in the maintenance setting. However, we still see the opportunity to grow the maintenance market, so that when patient start on Alimta, they continue on to progression and go in continuation maintenance and that\u2019s clearly our focus now and going forward. Phil Johnson :  Enrique? Enrique Conterno :  Very good. First, the market dynamic for the orals, I think we're seeing very good growth when it comes to new patient volumes. We\u2019ll take in combination, both the DPP-4s of new patient starts, the DPP-4 class plus the SGLT2 class. This new patient growth that we're basically seeing is slightly above where we had expected it to be. So we're very pleased with that. I think the SGLT2 class is off to a very good start and it seems that is being adopted very well. When it comes to GLP-1s, I think it\u2019s slightly different that we believe that the GLP-1 market could expand in a very significant way, but we have not seen that at this stage. We, I'll be frank we are counting on dulaglutide to be an enormous catalyst for that growth. I think, I'd share while we have basically looked at the dula, against liraglutide highest dose, our intent of doing that has been to basically ensure that we get the right price and reimbursement for our product. We are not seeking to just switch patients from dulaglutide. The big opportunity that we have in this particular case is to ensure that we can expand the GLP-1 plus in a very significant way. And once again, we see dulaglutide as a pretty important catalyst to that. You were also asking about the payer environment on both of those classes. Without going into a lot of detail, payers today view, when it comes to GLP-1s more differentiation between the products, then maybe when it comes to meal time insulin. I think that's also the case for basal insulins. So the formularies when it comes to GLP-1s and basal insulin don't tend to be as narrow, as they are in the case of meal time insulins. In the case of the orals, formularies today are narrow, that is clearly a risk going forward. But it is not like the case of the meal time insulin, where you may have just exclusively one product in the formulary. In most of the formularies, when it's comes to orals, there tends to be more than one product, maybe two products in that formulary, maybe not all, but maybe two. Phil Johnson : Enrique, thank you. John, next caller please? Operator : And that will be from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse : Yes, thanks for the taking the questions. So, on Ram, just thinking about that one, and seeing the success you\u2019ve had in gastric and lung in the second line obviously data for colorectal and hepatocellular on all that soon. Just can you give us a sense of what other developments that we might see other opportunities from moving that product over now that you got the first approval here? And then just second one unrelated on the destocking seems like quite a bit of an impact here for you guys this quarter. Any special dynamics that you can highlight, and I think there is a talk about weather maybe playing a little bit of a role this quarter, and is there anything else that we should be thinking about and anyway to quantify some of your bigger products like Alimta, Cialis, Humalog exactly how much of an impact that? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Vamil, thanks for the questions. Sue, do you want to take the ramucirumab question and then we will actually have Dave Ricks talk a little more in detail about the destocking that we saw in the first quarter based on stocking in Q4. Sue? Sue Mahony : Yes. Let me talk about Cyramza because clearly we are extremely excited this week to announce that we have the first FDA approval for Cyramza and in fact it\u2019s now the first FDA approved medicine for advanced gastric cancer following chemotherapy. And this is clearly a huge unmet need. And although it\u2019s a very common, it\u2019s a fifth most common cancer globally; it\u2019s the third leading cause of death. It\u2019s a rare disease in the U.S. We estimate about 22,000 patients will be diagnosed with cancer this year, with gastric cancer this year and a proportion of those is going second line treatment. So while I\u2019m talking about ramucirumab, I want to make sure that I mentioned that. And also we are planning that we will have this product available over the next few weeks because we want to get it to patients. We also know that we got a number of questions of price, so I might as well believe it\u2019s now all there. And we have as I said and it is a rare disease in the U.S., it is ramucirumab, Cyramza had been given orphan drug status. And we have priced CYRAMZA similar to other orphan drugs and (inaudible) biologics. So the price of an infusion based on the 60 kilogram patient is -- based on 70 kilogram patient, sorry, is $6,120. And given the median numbers of infusions that we use in REGARD trial which is the pivotal trial that led to disapproval this week its total price per patient will be $24,480. So that\u2019s in the single agent second line gastric cancer. With regard to the combination gastric cancer trial, the RAINBOW study, we have submitted that to -- we plan to submit that as a supplemental NDA to the FDA very soon. Clearly, we also have completed the submission to Europe based on the REGARD study and are working to find the most efficient way of getting the RAINBOW study submitted to Europe and we plan to submit in Japan as well. You mentioned as well, we\u2019ve got the two positive -- the other positive phase study, Phase III study in lung cancer which we will be presenting at ASCO and the HCC and colorectal studies should be leading out yet this year. So we are very excited. Yes, we do plan to do other studies of Cyramza as we plan our lifecycle plans. We are not able to give you specific details there other than to say that given the positive data that we have seen in both gastric and lung, we clearly are looking to ensure that we have full lifecycle plans for this molecule. Phil Johnson :  Thanks Sue, Dave? Dave Ricks :  Yes, in regard to inventories, there is two big effects on Q1, the first obviously the U.S., we have as Enrique mentioned a headwind in the high single-digits to even low double-digits across the marketed product portfolio. I just want to remind investors that we had a very robust Q4 on exactly the same products and stated at that time that there was a tailwind. Why this happens, I think is a cluster of just how the calendar works in terms of their buying patterns covering the holiday period in early January coupled with price speculation. Obviously if we look over a longer period of time this tend to smooth out in the U.S. We also in Q1 had a very strong performance in Japan. A portion of that is driven by Japanese stocking from Q2 into Q1 so you need to look through that as well. Again in long-term this tend to smooth out and I think in market performance for these key brands in diabetes as well as biomedicines I think are on track and consistent across the two quarters. Phil Johnson : Great thank you Dave. And Bob well thanks for the questions. John next caller please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First to follow-up on the immuno-oncology question, just to clarify, are you looking for external collaborations for ramu in lung cancer with PD1 or PDL-1? And could you remind us if the ramu ACC and the other trial that\u2019s ongoing is that going to be an external readout this year? Thank you. The colorectal cancer is the one I missed. Thank you guys. Phil Johnson : Sure. Alex thanks for the question. Sue? Sue Mahony : Sure. Alex we are continuing to look at multiple combinations obviously, Cyramza with its (inaudible) could be combined with a number of different agents. So we\u2019re looking at multiple combinations including immuno-oncology combinations with many of our pipeline molecule, not just with Cyramza. With regards to the ACC and colorectal we should have the ACC readouts in the first half of this year, the mid this year and later this year, we should have the colorectal to readout. We are anticipating that we would do toplines on both of those and have external data disclosure on the HTC Phase III trial this year. Phil Johnson :  Thank you, Sue. John, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : And that\u2019s Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Thanks for taking the questions. Regarding your business development on the pharma side, are you willing to highlight any mechanisms or therapeutic areas of particular interest to you right now? On evacetrapib, it seems like there is less optimism on this class from a kind of mechanistic commercial standpoints in (inaudible) on the outcome trial, what gives you continued comfort this is a viable mechanism? And could you just give some color on where you are seeing this fitting in an evolving landscape in CV risk reduction? And then finally with regards to ramucirumab, can you just confirm the Japanese filing is still anticipate before year-end? Thanks. Phil Johnson :  Great Colin, thanks for the questions. Let\u2019s have Dave [turn out] with evacetrapib question. Sue if you want to reiterate our plans for ramucirumab in Japan? And then John, do you want to comment maybe on or Derica on the business development areas that we're looking at in pharma? Dave Ricks :  Great, thanks. On evacetrapib certainly Lilly remains very optimistic about this mechanism and thus the basis for original investment in evacetrapib remains which is that this drug has a very substantial impact on both LDL and HDL as well as other important cardiovascular markers. We believe that and that effect will demonstrate a significant reduction in major cardiovascular risk. We have a large Phase III program which is fully enrolled, we're waiting for events and we believe we are powered to demonstrate that reduction in major cardiovascular risk based on all those factors and actually on LDL alone. So, we're optimistic about evacetrapib, I think some of the noise in the classes die down posted dalcetrapib readout reminding investors that dalcetrapib molecule was quite different from evacetrapib in both its biomarker effects, but also structure, had much more modest effect in only on HDL. And of course you\u2019ve a competitor at Merck in anacetrapib and they have had some interesting data come out of their own which I think has dampen enthusiasm for that program, but we remained both committed and excited about evacetrapib is potentially very large products in our future. Phil Johnson : Thanks Dave. Sue, on Japan for ramu. Sue Mahony : Sure. With regard Cyramza, yes we are on track to submit in Japan this year. Phil Johnson : John? John Lechleiter : With respect to business development we have lots of business development activities, little bit like the duck floats on the water and the feet are paddling away. We're looking at business development opportunities across all categories that we compete in. You know a lot about Elanco and some of things we've done there, obviously in areas of strength, like oncology and diabetes, we're looking at opportunities that might compliment or strengthen our current portfolio products or which could be used in combination with those products. And in Bio-Medicines, which covers a whole broad range of therapeutic areas, I think a couple of good example recently tanezumab, the collaboration with Pfizer on the anti-CGRP or anti-NGF antibody for pain and then our acquisition of Arteaus in January with the anti-CGRP antibody for migraine. I think we bias towards areas where we have internal therapeutic expertise, where we understand development pathways and where we have key customer relationships. You can expect that we'll continue to remain vigilant and opportunistic when other opportunities come along. Phil Johnson : Great. John, Next caller please. Operator : We will go Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Damien Conover - Morningstar: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a question on the strategic level, it looks like we are seeing more movement from Phase 1 right into Phase 3, I am thinking little bit about this CDK 4/6 but we are also seeing that with a lot of your competitors, AstraZeneca making some announcements earlier today. Just want to get your thoughts on the risk reward of this dynamic and then also any commentary you have on, how much of this decision is internally based versus get it by regulatory authorities? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Sure, Damien. Thanks for the question. I think we will have Jan response. Dr. Jan Lundberg : Yes. We have seen this for some time in the oncology area where some Phase 1 data then are used and then you go directly into Phase 3. And clearly the single has to be strong if you want to do this and you should also have a clear cut understanding of what is the patient population that you are targeting and preferably have some biomarker in the way to guide that. There is clearly a risk in doing this, because in reality you would like to have more Phase 2 data to ensure them the highest probable Phase 3 success rate. And in our strategy, we are talking about robust Phase 2 data as a good guarantee from improving Phase 3 success rates where you actually know the dose, the dosing regimen the patients who are selecting and the marker and the endpoints and so on. In relation to the Alzheimer area we and others have limited Phase 2 data then before you go into Phase 3, which is unfortunate but in reality you need so many patients and so long studies, you might as well do the Phase III trial right away. What you can do there though however is again to select the patients better by only selecting patients for instance then for anti-amyloid therapy that really has amyloid in their brain as detected for instance done by Amyvid scanning. So we actually again try to target those population in Phase III. Phil Johnson :  Great, thank you. I understand the queue is filling up again a bit, so we will continue since we have some time before the bottom of the hour. John, if we could go to the next call please? Operator :  And that will be Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann :  Thanks for the questions and for the extra time. Just in terms of the met MetMAb and some of the decisions that Lilly makes from competitor data, can you just tell us a little bit of what keeps you involved in the c-Met mechanism whether it\u2019d be, you have two inhibitors in Phase II study. So what do you need to see in Phase II to warrant a move forward into Phase III, given the sort of subset analyses that were a bit questionable from a competitor moving forward and then the ultimate failure of that Phase III, what is it that kind of has you take a harder look at that? And then can you give us a little bit more color on the oncology side from a scientific perspective, where how we should be thinking about the CSF-1R antibody and your enthusiasm around that approach in oncology? And then lastly Derica, I know you have been asked this question a number of times, but can you just give us again, you said that $2.9 billion of adjusted net income but $4 billion of operating cash flow, what proportion of that is historical amortization and depreciation, is it sort of a 100% of that or is it about $700 million, just to help us think about the comparable valuations given that most of your competitors actually exclude that from their P&L? Thanks. Phil Johnson :  Great, thanks Seamus. We\u2019ll have Sue take your first question with regard to the MetMAb. We may actually to get back to you on the CSS-1R question and then Derica had to step out for a moment, so I\u2019ll go ahead and take your question on the amortization and depreciation. Sue? Sue Mahony : Yes, thanks Seamus. With regards to our MET program, we remain still excited with our MET program. Our MET antibody is different to the genetic antibody, it\u2019s a bivalent antibody and it\u2019s locked both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent cMET signaling which we believe could be important. We have two Phase II trials ongoing in lung cancer with this antibody. And we\u2019re specifically targeting EGFR mutant population since there is -- the science shows that there is evidence for the relevance of EGFR and MET cross talk. So we believe that with the antibody that we got that\u2019s bivalent as I say, targeting both the ligand and independent ligand MET expression plus our focus on EGFR mutant population that we\u2019ve got an interesting molecule antibody development path and clearly we\u2019ve got a Phase II program that we want to see the outcome of that Phase II program to decide whether we\u2019d move forward with the Phase III. So we remain optimistic. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you Sue. Derica is now back with us, to now supporting the question in last minute, let me go ahead and I\u2019ll take the answer and you can add if you need to Derica. So, Seamus on your question of the amount of depreciation amortization on an annual basis, that\u2019s about $1.3 billion with a good chunk of that being amortization of intangibles. As I mentioned for this quarter that was about a $132 million that we had of amortization of intangibles but as you pointed out, many of our competitors now exclude from their non-GAAP or core earnings. We do not knew that and don\u2019t have any short term plans to change, we certainly have notice that trend over time for more and more of our peers to exclude this, we continue to have discussion internally, but we will go ahead make sure that you guys know where to get to our 10-Q and 10-K language to find these numbers, so that you can make it appropriate adjustment for apples-to-apples comparison. John, next caller please? Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : Hey thanks a lot for taking my follow-up question. I appreciate it, I just wanted to get quick update on your PCSK9 antibody program to a little bit since I think we\u2019ve got an update on that. And the specific question is there has been some speculation out there, I was wondering if you could clarify, if you be willing to clarify or it or not but your antibody might be able to be dosed less frequently than all the other competitors out there, something like once quarterly? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson :  Thanks for the question Mark. Dave, if you want to answer, fell free to chime in Dave. Dave Ricks :  Yes. Mark, as I reminder we\u2019re in the middle of Phase II study, we expect that data in the second half. The purpose of that study is really to better elucidate the dosing schedule for the medicine. But I think it\u2019s safe to say we believe that PCSK9s can make a significant difference in cardiovascular risk and that Lilly PCSK9 may have the benefit of an extended dosing schedule; how long what we would actually decide to do, if we proceed it with the medicine is to be determined. Phil Johnson :  Great, thanks Dave. John, next caller please. Operator : And that will be Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein : Thank you. One of the bare arguments on Lilly relates Alimta and what the future of that product is given changing landscape with the PD1s. So, I know companies maintain 5 and 10 year long range plans, directionally what can you say about how you view Alimta\u2019s trajectory, given what seems to be a change here? Is this something that you think is going to continue to grow or is there going to be some share losses, as you PD-1s start to take some lung business? Philip Johnson : Tim, thank you for the question. Sue, that\u2019s right up your alley. Sue Mahony : Yes, Tim that's a great question and clearly the patent decision that we've got this year makes us feel much more comfortable with regard to the future of Alimta. We're going to have to wait and see what happens with regards to the PD-1s and immuno-oncology. We need to see the data mature, we need to see which patients would be most eligible for those agents. Our focus as I said previously is really to continue to drive the first line and the maintenance, so the continuation maintenance indications for Alimta. And even though we are market leader, we've only got less than 40% share market in the first line setting and only approximately 20% of patients go on to receive maintenance of the first line setting. So we do continue to see that there are opportunities, there are a lot of different agents being investigated in lung cancer which is great, because they needed huge. We made a lot of improvement over the years but there is an awful lot of improvement that needs to happen. So, I think clearly we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re involved in bringing new medicines to patients. We see that the lung cancer market is continuing to be an area of interest as we're bringing new medicines and because of the size and because of the unmet need. So I still see opportunity clearly for Alimta to grow. I\u2019m glad that we won the patent and we are continuing to drive what we believe the opportunity is with three Phase 3 trials that show an overall survival advantage with Alimta and showing that you start with Alimta and stay with Alimta in the front line setting data, we can continue to help patients and we\u2019ll continue to [develop] this brand. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you. We might have time for one last quick question. John, do we have any callers on the line still? Operator : Actually, no further questions in queue. Phil Johnson : Okay, fantastic. Then I will turn it over to John Lechleiter to close out the call. John Lechleiter : Okay, just very briefly I want to thank everybody for joining us. And we appreciate your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. We appreciate your feedback on this format, we have been for the past couple of calls extending the time to allow you to ask more questions and we intend to keep doing that, and to also involve our leadership team which is represented here today and these calls going forward. So if you have any feedback on this approach, please get back to Phil. We\u2019ll see many of you at ASCO and at ADA. We will be back here again in July with report from our second quarter. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Q 2014 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chairman, President and CEO, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead. John Lechleiter : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss Eli Lilly and Company's second quarter 2014 earnings. As the operators said, I am John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Similar to our last call, this morning we are bringing more of our senior leaders into the room here to participate and to answer your questions and we hope that this enhances the quality of the information we provide you during these sessions. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology, Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly diabetes, Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines, Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets, Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of Lilly's Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and our pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Before we get into our Q2 results in detail, I would like to offer this context. Even as we feel the full brunt of our patent expiries, we continue to execute our strategy. Our performance is in line with our expectations and we are on track to meet the goals we have shared with you for the year. And the steady advance of our pipeline only strengthens our confidence in our innovation-based strategy. Cyramza launched to a good reception in the U.S. Empagliflozin has been granted approval in the EU. Our insulin glargine product has been recommended for approval in Europe. And we presented positive data on a number of late stage molecules at the recent ASCO and ADA meetings. We anticipate a number of additional regulatory actions this year as well as additional regulatory submissions and important Phase 3 data readouts. And we continue to manage our expenses rigorously even as we invest to ensure successful launches and continue to advance our pipeline. With that, let's turn to the key events since last quarter's call. Since our last call, we launched Cyramza in the U.S. as a single agent treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior chemotherapy. We are pleased with the uptake we are seeing with the reports we are receiving from the sales organization and with feedback from customers on their experience to-date. We have also a number of positive developments on the regulatory front spanning diabetes and oncology. The European Commission approved empagliflozin or Jardiance indicated in the treatment of Type II diabetes to improve glycemic control in adults. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim anticipate launch of the product in European countries to begin this quarter. In the U.S., Boehringer Ingelheim resubmitted the empagliflozin NDA to the FDA. This was deemed a Class I resubmission, which carries a two month review period. Consequently, we expect FDA action this quarter. In Europe, Boehringer Ingelheim submitted the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin. Also in Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending approval of our new insulin glargine product for the treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. This product, which is part of the Lilly-Boehringer Ingelheim Diabetes alliance is the first biosimilar insulin recommended for approval in the European Union. Moving now to oncology. In the U.S., based on data from the RAINBOW study, we submitted a supplemental BLA for Cyramza as combination therapy in patients with second line gastric cancer. This will be a standard review and therefore we expect FDA action in the first half of 2015. In Europe, where our initial submission was based on the REGARD monotherapy study, we have now incorporated the RAINBOW data in our submission dossier which is currently under review. And finally, we announced that the FDA granted fast track status for our BLA for necitumumab as first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We continue to expect FDA submission before the end of this year. In clinical news, we had a number of detailed data presentations at the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Diabetes Association. At the ASCO meeting, we presented detailed data from the Phase 3 REVEL trial studying ramucirumab in second line non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Cyramza demonstrated statistically significant improvements across multiple efficacy endpoints including overall survival, progression free survival and overall response rate. The improvement of overall survival and progression free survival on the Cyramza plus docetaxel arm was consistent across the majority of subgroups including nonsquamous and squamous histologies. We remain on track to meet our commitment for regulatory submission in the second half of 2014. We also presented detailed data from the Phase 3 SQUIRE trial studying necitumumab in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In the Phase 3 SQUIRE trial, patients with stage IV metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, progression free survival and disease control rate. As I mentioned earlier, we intend to submit this BLA by year-end. Finally, following our initial disclosure at AACR in April, we presented additional data from the Phase 1 trial of our CDK 4/6 inhibitor, Abemaciclib. These data were from two different cohort expansions. One as a single agent in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and the other in combination with fulvestrant in patients with advanced breast cancer. Based on these data as well as the data presented at AACR, we will begin Phase 3 trials later this year in both advanced breast cancer and advanced lung cancer. We are pleased with the single agent activity we have seen with Abemaciclib as well as with the product safety profile and believe we could have a best-in-class molecule. At the ADA meeting, we presented detailed data from three of the Phase 3 AWARD trials of dulaglutide. There was significant investor interest in the AWARD-6 trial comparing once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg to once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg. Results from this study show that dulaglutide 1.5 mg was noninferior to the highest approved dose of Victoza in the reduction of HbA1c from baseline. This is the first head-to-head Phase 3 trial of a GLP-1 to show noninferiority to liraglutide 1.8 mg on this important clinical measure. Detailed data was also presented for AWARD-2 and AWARD-4 head-to-head trials comparing dulaglutide to insulin glargine with and without mealtime insulin. Both trials showed that once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg provided significantly greater reductions in blood glucose for patients with Type II diabetes. Additionally, in both studies hypoglycemia rates were lower for dulaglutide 1.5 mg treated patients compared to insulin glargine. We are very pleased with the results of these three Phase 3 studies for dulaglutide, as well as with those of the Phase 3 studies presented at last year's ADA. If approved, dulaglutide will be the only GLP-1 receptor agonist that is both once-weekly and ready-to-use. We believe it could provide patients and physicians an important new treatment option for Type II diabetes. In the quarter, we also issued two topline press releases for Phase 3 trials, one for our basal insulin peglispro and the other for Cyramza in second line hepatocellular cancer. We announced positive topline results for three completed Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with Type II diabetes for basal insulin peglispro, which is being studied as a once-daily treatment for both Type I and Type II diabetes. The primary efficacy endpoint of noninferior reduction in HbA1c compared to insulin glargine was met in all three trials. Having met the primary endpoints, superiority for HbA1c lowering was examined and in all three trials basal insulin peglispro showed a statistically superior reduction in HbA1c compared with insulin glargine. In addition, in all three clinical trials patients taking basal insulin peglispro experienced statistically significant lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia and had comparable to statistically significant less weight gain than those taking insulin glargine. We remain on track to issue a topline press release this quarter on our Phase 3 trial in patients with Type I diabetes and to make regulatory filings by the first quarter of next year. For Cyramza, we announced that the Phase 3 REACH trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer did not meet its primary endpoint. Overall survival favored the Cyramza arm but was not statistically significant. Although the REACH study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by the efficacy seen in specific subpopulations. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory authorities to inform future trials. In business development news, we announced last week an immunotherapy collaboration with U.K. based Immunocore Limited to research and potentially develop novel T cell-based cancer therapies. This collaboration will result in a third quarter charge of $45 million or $0.03 per share of EPS after-tax that we have incorporated into our revised guidance for 2014. Also, we close the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health, a privately held German company that is a global leader in poultry vaccines. This acquisition establishes Elanco as a global poultry leader and solidifies Elanco's vaccine presence and manufacturing capabilities. We also entered into an agreement contingent upon certain closing conditions to sell the feed additives portion of Lohmann's business to a management led group. Finally along with Sanofi, we announced an agreement to pursue regulatory approval of nonprescription Cialis. Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi acquired the exclusive rights to market Cialis OTC following Sanofi's receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. In other news, the English High Court determined that the vitamin dosage regimen patents for Alimta in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain would not be infringed by a generic competitor that has stated an intent to market certain alternative salt forms of pemetrexed in those countries upon expiry of the Alimta compound patents in late 2015. We strongly disagree with this ruling and have appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal. In the U.S., based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Akamai versus Limelight Networks, Teva and APP filed an unopposed motion asking the Court of Appeals to remand the Alimta case back to the District Court to consider the issue of infringement. No date has been set for a hearing with the District Court. Note that this does not affect the District Court's decision that our patent is valid. We remain confident that this patent is both valid and enforceable against generic manufacturers. A Brazilian labor court ruled against our local subsidiary in a case alleging some employees were exposed to hazardous materials in a manufacturing facility operated by the company between 1977 and 2003. We believe the decision is entirely without merit and we filed an appeal. Finally, during the second quarter, we executed share repurchases totaling $145 million under our $5 billion share repurchase program. And now, I will turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil Johnson : Thanks, John. First I will review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insight into the underlying trends in our business. Moving to slide seven, you can see that our Q2 revenue was $4.9 billion, which is 17% lower than Q2 2013. This decrease in revenue reflects a decline of $1.1 billion in U.S. Cymbalta sales following loss of exclusivity in December last year. In addition, U.S. sales of Evista declined nearly $145 million following that product's loss of exclusivity in March of this year. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 6%, mainly from volume. Recall that last quarter, we stated that our Japan revenue benefited by about $70 million from higher customer purchases in advance of an increase in a local consumption tax. As expected, this quarter customer purchases in Japan were reduced by a similar amount. This negative impact on our overall corporate revenue growth was largely offset by a benefit in the U.S. related to an adjustment in the reserves for managed Medicaid rebates and discounts. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 4.4 percentage points, also driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. This quarter the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold resulted in the modest addition to cost of sales, while in last year's quarter, it resulted in a modest reduction to cost of sales. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 3.4 percentage points from 79.9% in Q2 2013 to 76.5% in Q2 this year. As in prior calls, we have included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide eight. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A decreased 11% or nearly $340 million versus Q2 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 11%, while R&D was down 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the reduction in U.S. sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta and Evista as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts. The decline in R&D expenses was driven primarily by a reduction in late stage development costs. Other income and expense was net income of $54 million in Q2 2014 compared to a income of $12 million in the second quarter of 2013, with this modest change driven by a variety of miscellaneous items. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 22%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to Q2 last year. The main reason for this increase in the tax rate is the lapse of R&D tax credit at the end of last year. At the bottom line, net income declined 42% and earnings per share declined 41%. As in Q1, this decline is significant but very much in line with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full year guidance. In slide nine, we provide the same reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted information for our year-to-date results. Moving to slide 10, you will find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. As I mentioned last quarter, nearly all our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results, while we include this expense. For your modeling purposes, please note that we recognized amortization expense of $134 million representing 2.7% of revenue this quarter. Now let's look at how price, rate and volume affected our revenue growth. Given the significant decline in U.S. Cymbalta and Evista sales, I will provide you with some color on how that affected revenue growth this quarter. On slide 11 you can see the total revenue decline of 17% in Q2 2014, which is shown in the yellow box on the middle of the page, and that this decline was entirely driven by volume. Price added about 1% to revenue growth, while the impact of FX was nil. Excluding U.S. Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 6%, with just over half of that growth coming from volume and the rest from price. Touching on some of the geographic highlights. For the quarter, U.S. Pharma revenue declined 33%, driven by a volume decline of 36%. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our U.S. Pharma revenue increased 13% comprised of 5% from volume and 8% from price. The benefit I mentioned earlier from the adjustment for managed Medicaid utilization had a positive effect a two percentage points of this growth in the form of price. In Japan, as I mentioned earlier, our Q1 revenue benefited by roughly $70 million as customers increased purchases in advance of an increase in the consumption tax that went into effect on April 1. As expected, customer purchase in Q2 were reduced by a similar amount leading to a decline in our Q2 Japan Pharma revenue. Specifically, Japan Pharma revenue declined 15% this quarter, driven by a volume decline of 10%, adjusting for the timing of customer purchases, our Q2 Pharma Japan volume would have increased 5%. You will also see that the weaker Yen is still reducing our growth rate but at a much lower rate than in prior quarters. In emerging markets, we saw good performance growth of 8%, partially offset by a 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Humulin, Forteo, Humalog, Vancocin, and Tradjenta. Sales in our largest emerging markets country China grew 15%. Finally, Elanco Animal Health posted revenue growth of 11%. Strong growth in our U.S. food animal business and in both food and companion animal products oUS was partially offset by lower U.S. companion animal sales. Also at the end of April, we closed the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health. This added nearly $25 million in revenue, primarily oUS contributing four percentage points to worldwide animal health growth. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica Rice : Thanks, Phil. On slide 12, you will see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the growth rates for select items of our income statement. FX had almost no impact on our revenue or operating expenses this quarter. As Phil mentioned, FX did cause a modest increase in the growth of cost of sales with the corresponding negative effect on operating income and EPS. As a result, FX caused our operating income and EPS to decline an additional two to three percentage points. Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of July 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. As John discussed earlier, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim received European approval for empagliflozin. In addition, we began Phase 2 testing of a biologic for diabetes and we began Phase 1 testing of two Biologics, one for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease and the other for ulcerative colitis, and we terminated development of five assets, three in Phase 2 and two in Phase 1. Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. In the first 6.5 months of the year, we are pleased with the progress we have made on key events we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. As you can see from the green checkmarks on slide 14, we had a productive first half of the year, advancing our pipeline and sharing Phase 3 data. While I will not go through each item on the slide, I will give you a reminder of the potential key events for the remainder of this year and provide updates along the way. As John mentioned, later this year we will begin Phase 3 trial for abemaciclib our CDK 4/6 inhibitor in both advanced breast cancer and advanced lung cancer. We no longer expect to move blosozumab, our antisclerostin antibody for osteoporosis into Phase 3 in 2014. The formulation we plan to take into Phase 3 produced injection site reactions at a higher rate than desired. We will conduct additional work with the formulation used in Phase 2 before moving forward. With respect to Phase 3 data, we expect to report topline results this year, with detailed data presentations next year. For our basal insulin peglispro studies in patients with Type I diabetes, ramucirumab for metastatic colorectal cancer, and three immunology assets, ixekizumab, tabalumab and baricitinib. In addition to the submissions we have already completed this year, we continue to expect regulatory submissions this year for the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin for Type II diabetes in the U.S., necitumumab for first line squamous non-small cell lung cancer and ramucirumab for second line non-small cell lung cancer as well as for gastric cancer in Japan. As we previously disclosed, we expect to submit our basal insulin peglispro for Type I and Type II diabetes by the end of the first quarter of 2015, if not earlier. Also this year, we could have regulatory action on empagliflozin in the U.S., dulaglutide in the U.S. and Europe and our new insulin glargine product in the U.S. as well as final EC approval following the recent positive CHMP opinion and ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer in Europe. Now keep in mind that in addition to regulatory approval timing the launch timing for our new insulin glargine product will be impacted by a number of factors, including patent expirations and ongoing litigation. In other key events for the remainder of 2014, data package exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in Europe in the second half of this year, although we do not expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015. Now clearly we have a lot going on in 2014 and we are looking forward to maintaining the momentum from the first half of this year into the second half. Now let's turn to our 2014 financial guidance. Our performance through June places us on track to achieve our full year financial guidance. Since our last earnings call, there have been some minor pushes and pulls but major changes to our full year outlook. As a result, our guidance for nearly all line items as shown on slide 15 remains unchanged. We have revised our GAAP EPS guidance to reflect a charge of $45 million pretax or $0.03 per share after-tax related to the immune oncology licensing deal with Immunocore announced last week, and we slightly revised our outlook for capital expenditures, which has been reduced to $1.2 billion. On slide 16, we have provided a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance. Now I will turn the call back over to John. John Lechleiter : Thanks, Derica. Before the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. While our revenues and earnings continue their decline as we expected, at the same time the launch of Cyramza and a number of approvals and impending launches give us great confidence that we are poised for growth in the years ahead. Our performance is consistent with our expectations and we are on track to meet our 2014 financial goals. We recorded growth in the sales of a number of products and key markets as well as in our Elanco Animal Health business. The 11% decline in our operating expenses shows our ongoing determination to manage expenses rigorously so we can get the most from our well-stocked late stage pipeline. The steady advance of the pipeline strengthens our confidence in our innovation-based strategy and our commitment to accelerate discoveries to the people who need them. And now I will turn the call over to Phil for our Q&A session. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, John. Toni, we are ready for the first caller, please. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein : Thank you. Two questions. The first is, we are seeing price competition in diabetes in various ways starting last year and then recently Glaxo launched their GLP-1 at a pretty big list price discount to existing therapies, which you rarely see drug companies do. This could have an obvious impact on dulaglutide's pricing at launch and I am sure you will say it's too early to discuss pricing, but I am hoping you can still address in general terms, because it is a worrisome trend, not just for dula and Lilly but for other products and other categories for a variety of companies. Then the second question is on Lilly's plans in terms of M&A activity and also tax inversion. You guys, in the past, have been pretty steadfast about only really considering bolt-on acquisitions. Is this still the current stance, because if so that size probably would not be big enough to qualify you for inversion. So how is Lilly thinking about M&A and the potential for inversion? Phil Johnson : Tim, thank you for the questions. We will have Enrique Conterno, President, Lilly Diabetes take the first question on the pricing in the GLP-1 space and then Derica Rice, CFO, take your question on M&A. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Very good. Well, as we all know, pricing in the U.S. has become extremely competitive when it comes to the diabetes space, which is driven both by payors and competition. I think in this particular case, pricing also in a certain way reflects the profile of the very specific products. We are extremely confident in the profile that we bring with dulaglutide and the number of trials that we have conducted. So we do think we have a very strong value proposition. And of course, as we think about diabetes, our stance continues to be the same. We are a proponent of choice. We believe choice is important for patients. And we are seeking basically a dual axis in the diabetes space whenever this is possible. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Enrique. Derica? Derica Rice : Tim, as it relates to M&A activity, our stance and strategy has not changed in this space. We continue to be very interested in looking for those opportunities that can augment our current organic footprint, both commercially as well as scientifically. And that really lies in the space that you have seen us play in historically, looking for in licensing deal and sometimes it's easier to do small M&A transactions to get access to those technologies. We continue also to be not interested in doing the large-scale M&A. We just have not seen that the long-term benefits from those types of transactions. As it relates to inversion, if that ever did come about, it would be a secondary benefit, not the primary driver of us taking any type of M&A action. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Derica. Toni, next caller please. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : Hello? Phil Johnson : Yes. We can hear you. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : Thanks. Can you hear me? Sorry about that. I am sorry. Thanks for taking my question. Just if I could ask the pipeline question. So all across the pipeline, you have had some nice success this year, but perhaps nothing truly transformative. But when I look ahead, I see two things that potentially are really transformative, solanezumab and the CETP inhibitor. And I was just wondering, I think in the past, you have characterized, not the recent past necessarily, but you characterized solanezumab as a high risk pipeline program. I would love to know if you still perceive it as such, now that the new Phase 3 programs are ongoing? And I guess, so we can't do a deep dive in earnings call, the same big picture question on CETP, do you view that as a high risk, moderate risk or low risk asset? And maybe if you could just remind us on the timeline? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great. Mark, thanks for the questions. We will have Dave Ricks, President, Lilly Bio-Meds answer your questions. Jan, if you would like to chime in anything after Dave, please feel free to. Dave. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Mark, for the question. We remain excited about both of these programs, the CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib and solanezumab. Importantly, we are confident on the timelines we have previously communicated as to those data readouts which are clearly not in this year but that coming up over the next couple years. As it relates to CETP inhibitors and ours specifically, we are confident for several reasons. One, the LDL in addition of this asset, we think is enough by itself to achieve the outcomes we have designed in the study to demonstrate. On top of that, of course, there are other effects. HDL lowering or increasing being the most pronounced as well as other cardiovascular potential impacts. So testing the CETP hypothesis with a complete inhibitor of CETP like evacetrapib, we think is something that's new and we are doing an ACCELERATE trial. So we remain excited about that asset and should it play out that it has an impact on cardiovascular risk reduction, we think there is ample market opportunity for such a drug. For solanezumab, I think as we have communicated since the EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION -2 studies, we believe in the mild signal we saw in those studies. We have designed a study now, which we think will be the definitive test of solanezumab in mild patients with Alzheimer's and we have improved, we believe, the probability of success in that versus EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2 by importantly screening out patients who did not have amyloid plaque and by powering the study appropriately for this population. So bottom line, we are bullish on both of these. Of course, there is technical risk because both programs did not complete a normal Phase 2 proof of concept in the sense that you are demonstrating the outcome before starting a Phase 3. So I will stop there and ask Jan if he has any additional -- Jan Lundberg : Yes, I think we can also gain some additional confidence from data from competition. The recent report by crenezumab at the Alzheimer's meeting in Copenhagen, I think supports the data that we have with solanezumab because it was reported there that this antibody which has some similarities to sola in its mechanism of action also reduced the cognition decline in the mild population of Alzheimer's, which I think is the second nonpharmacological agent that actually shows that if you interfere with the amyloid pathway, you can reduce cognition decline in Alzheimer patients. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Jan. Toni, Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our question comes from the line of Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jamie Rubin - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Just a more mundane question. Derica, your gross margin guidance for the full year at 73%, which assumes a significant deterioration in the second half of the year, are you just being conservative with your numbers? Or is there something that we are not aware that we should take into consideration for that? And can you confirm that that would assume a worsening in the second half? And Dave Ricks, for you, just on PCSK9. I know that is a Phase 2 asset, and it would seem that the PCSK9 would directly compete with the CETP inhibitor. What are your plans for this drug? And I think you are probably fourth in line in bringing a PCSK9 to the marketplace. So if you can elaborate a little bit on where you see that project going? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Thanks for the questions. Jamie. Derica, you want to kick this off? Derica Rice : Sure. Hi, Jamie. Good morning. As it relates to our gross margin guidance, let me just walk you through a series of things. One typically Q2 is one of our higher gross quarters, primarily because one, we do not have the slowdown that usually takes place in our production facilities outside the U.S., primarily in Europe due to the summer holiday. And also in the fourth quarter, we typically experience the usual maintenance shutdowns. What we expect and what you saw in the first half of the year is that we had very high production volumes running through our manufacturing facilities and we anticipate that those production volumes will be lower in the second half for the reasons I cited earlier. So the gross margin performance that you are seeing thus far for us is pretty in line with the expectations that we have for the year. The second thing that I would also highlighted is that also what you will see in the last six months of year is a full absorption and dilutive effect of the Lohmann Animal Health acquisition which we talked about, the $0.05 hit, when we announced the deal for the year and we also talked about the fact that it would be dilutive to our gross margin as well. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Derica, Dave? Dave Ricks : Great. Thanks, Jamie, for the question on PCSK9. I think you are correct that we are behind in this class but we think the class has a place in the management of cardiovascular risk. Obviously there's assets in front of us that are reading out positive data. So the probabilities here look good for the class. I think for us the really question is one of differentiation, maybe not so different to the question on the GLPs. We are conducting right now a Phase 2 experiment to really elucidate a differentiated profile. And I think that data is going to be really key for our decision making about what to do next. Whether that would be to proceed full speed ahead, perhaps share risk with another partner or perhaps to have someone else take the asset forward and Lilly move on to other opportunities. So we need to see that proof of concept and based on that information, we will make some decisions in the quarters ahead. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Dave. Toni, next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John Boris - SunTrust: Thanks for taking the questions. First one for Derica. Just one item in your guidance that seemed to change was the CapEx, which seemed to move down on your guidance. Can you maybe just characterize what's going on in the CapEx line and where that savings is going to be going? Second question for Jan. It looks as though there were some pruning of the pipeline to your oncology assets. Can you maybe help us understand what the next assets or beyond ramu and neci within your strategy that you will be focusing on within oncology. If there is any in Phase 2 you can point out. And then on the Immunocore deal for novel T-cell based therapies, are there any particular mechanisms that you are targeting along with T-cell area or looking to optimize with that codiscovery and codevelopment strategy? Thanks. Phil Johnson : John, thanks for the questions. Obviously Derica will take your first question on capital expenditures and maybe John and Sue, you would like to comment on the oncology questions that John had. Derica? Derica Rice : Sure. Hi, John. From a CapEx standpoint, it's really fairly straightforward. Our manufacturing team and our facilities group have done an excellent job of just driving productivity and being able to bring in projects still on time, but at lower cost. So that $100 million change in our outlook for CapEx s really spread across a multitude of capital projects where you are eeking out increased efficiencies. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Derica. Jan. John Lechleiter : John, with respect to what you term pruning of the pipeline, I think the fact that we had three potential cancer drugs that fell out of Phase 2 is somewhat a factor of just the abundance of cancer opportunities that we have in Phase 2. It reflects the ongoing nature of the business decision making related to data that we have gathered and other priorities that we have set. I think going forward, you are going to see Lilly much more focused on the clinical progression of the molecules where we believe we have a competitive lead and that we believe offer the greatest opportunity for Lilly. We have got a great position today of really having an abundance of riches and yet we have finite resource. With an ever more competitive environment, I think it's important that we put clear focus and resources behind those that we believe provide for us the greatest potential and the greatest opportunity for patients at the end of the day. With respect to the T-cell therapies, I am going to ask Sue to comment, both on your second question about the oncology portfolio and then specifically on immuno-oncology. But we believe immuno-oncology is an important area. We have said this. We believe we have assets already in our pipeline that really factory in to this disease, to this mechanism a writ large and the Immunocore deal was, we think a great opportunity for us to influence the immune cycle, hopefully for the benefit of cancer treatment in a very specific way. And again, I will ask Sue to comment in greater detail. Sue Mahony : Sure. Yes, thanks. Clearly with regards to the oncology pipeline, we are looking at the key cancer pathways, including cell cycle inhibition, the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy. You are aware of bemaciclib. Obviously, we are very excited about that molecule. We have initiated our Phase 2 study, single agent study. We are on track to initiate the fulvestrant Phase 3 study in breast cancer in the next few weeks. And the additional Phase 3 study, both with a breast caner with aromatase inhibitor and in lung cancer will be starting and KRAS lung cancer, we will be starting towards the end of this year. So that is one molecule we are very excited about and we are moving forward rapidly with that. In other molecules that we have in our pipeline that we are continuing to progress, our c-Met antibody which is a bivalent antibody that we believe could have different properties than other agents out there. And then, our TGF-\u03b2 small molecule inhibitor or galunisertib, which is in Phase 2 development, and this is actually a molecule that is getting a lot more interest because it targets the pathway that modulates and functions T Regulator Cell. So that is one agent that we believe that could have or does have a new modulating activity and we are going to be seeing further combinations with that agent, both with other targeted agents and with other immunotherapy agents. We have two other agents that we have got in clinical development as well that impact the immune system includes the CXCR4 peptide antibody which is in Phase 2 development, and that's involved in the trafficking of immune cells in tumors and rCSF-1 antibody that's in Phase 1 and that targets monocytes and macrophages involved in creating an immunospecific environment in the tumor. So we have three assets in clinical development that impact the immune system. We are also continuing to increase our discovery efforts and capabilities both internally and through recruitments externally if necessary and we have got a number of targets that we are interested in. In addition to collaborations and partnerships and potential acquisitions that we are looking at, and Immunocore is the recent one that we have announced and we are very excited about looking at novelties. So base cancer therapies, that deal specifically looks at three targets. We have identified three targets. We can't tell you what those targets are now but they are ones that we believe that have potential and clearly if we decide to take those into the clinic, we will be looking at combinations with other oncology assets and other assets in our pipeline for those agents. So we are very excited about the opportunities that we have got in oncology and as John said, it's really a case of making sure we are prioritizing and putting our focus in the right areas to making sure we are progressing the molecules that have got the most potential for patients. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Sue. Toni, if we can have the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much. Just had a few here. So my first one was, as we look at Lilly returning to growth and as cash flow starts to recover, can you just share some of your views on your products and potential divestitures of non-core assets? We have seen a number of players in the space that would consider looking at the divesting some of those businesses? Just thoughts from Lilly in terms of, if that's something that could be on the table? Second question on the CDK program in breast cancer. I think Pfizer announced, it's moving forward with a palbociclib filing based on Phase 2 data. If that drug is approved early next year, just can you comment what that means competitively Lilly, as you think about your program and the timing of that program relative to Pfizer's launch? And then finally, I am not going to sound so generically, but your on sclerostin inhibitor, just talk about next steps from here and your confidence that this is something you can dress? Just trying to understand what we should be watching for on the updates there. Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Chris, thank you for the questions. We will have Derica take the questions on strategies around late stage assets, post patent assets. Sue Mahony on what the palbociclib potential approval could mean from a competitive perspective, and then Dave, want to take lead maybe on talking about the sclerostin question, that would be great. Derica? Derica Rice : Hi, Chris. As it relates to, I guess this is a little bit of still, a further extension of our capital allocation strategy. We have got a number of deals over the last few years to take advantage and make sure we are maximizing the potential what's sitting inside not only Lilly's labs but also Lilly's even currently marketed products. So even if you look at Evista, we did some deals there outside of the U.S. to make sure that we were able to put proper resourcing behind that at a time when we were diverting some of other resources more towards the pipeline to advance the late stage assets that we saw with future potential. I think going forward, we will continue, as you heard even from Dave and from John as well, that we have a pretty robust and pretty full clinical stage pipeline today. And we believe there are potentially more opportunities than we will have the capacity to progress on our own. So it is possible that going forward you will see us as we cycle through those deciding which assets we will go alone and as Dave said, which assets we may partner and which assets we may find other ways to monetize the value from. The good news is that we are at the beginning of this cycle as we are getting great discovery output from our research labs and that's what affording us these opportunities that lie ahead of us. And we have no intentions of doing anything that will damage that flow of new molecules moving into the clinic and it gives us the optionality down the road. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Derica. Sue? Sue Mahony : Yes, with regard to the palbo potential approval, that really doesn't have any significant impact on our plans for Abemaciclib. Clearly our focus is on ensuring that we get our three Phase 3 studies up and running as quickly as possible this year, which we are on track to do. I am very confident that the team has got a good plan in place to ensure that we get rapid enrollment in these studies. We are confident in our molecule. We believe that we could have a best-in-class molecule here with single agent activity and continuous dosing. So as I said, our focus really is ensuring that we get these trials up and running as quickly as possible, and I think we are on track to do that. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Sue. Dave? Dave Ricks : Great. Thanks, Chris. Maybe just quickly as well on asset mix and looking to change that, I would say, on the late lifecycle, in market assets, I think we are open to that as well, but we need to have a transaction that produces value. So I think when we see those things we move on them. I think the Cialis announcement with Sanofi this quarter is an example of that where we are harvesting late lifecycle value from Lilly assets. On sclerostin antibody, pronounced blosozumab, for those on the phone, we had completed a proof of concept study in severe osteoporosis. We are excited by that data. We remain excited by the data. In conducting a transition from a Phase 2 formulation to a final commercial image, we did have some results that surprised us a bit in making that transition. We needed a bit more work on the formulation so that we have really a competitive or even differentiated commercial product image. We had scheduled or had communicated a potential for a start to the Phase 3 program toward the 2014 and today we are just saying, that's not going to happen in 2014 because of this delay. As we have more information, we will come back to the investment community to share firmer timelines. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Dave. Toni, next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink: Thanks for the questions. So just a few quick questions. First off, maybe for Jan. Can you give us your general thoughts on the data that was presented on Roche's crenezumab? I think we have seen some data that looked somewhat similar, but can you just maybe compare and contrast what we saw with Lilly's solanezumab versus crenezumab, and how these molecules are fundamentally different? Second question is for Enrique, on the launch preparation for dulaglutide. Can you just give us a sense of where we are, as we lead into a potential action date from the FDA? Have we the facilities? Have they been inspected? How is inventory building? And how would you recommend that we assess the dulaglutide launch, given recent product launches and perhaps access, although I would think that Lilly might have a bit of a better opportunity given its ability to leverage the portfolio? And then just a quick update on the glargine challenge in the U.S. and if you would consider and risk launch following the expiration of the 30 month stay? And my last question is, if you can remind us, post the Lohmann acquisition and perhaps Novartis, Derica, would you be able to tell us what the overall deal related noncash charges that get baked into the P&L on an ongoing basis and your adjusted earnings? Can you remind us what that number is currently? And it what may move to? And then perhaps what prevents Lilly from moving to the industry standard cash EPS? Thanks a lot. Phil Johnson : Okay. Keep us on track here. If we miss one of your questions, don't hesitate to let us know, but I think we will go ahead and have Jan talk about the data for Roche's crenezumab. Obviously, Enrique, the two middle questions on launch for dulaglutide and the status of the glargine legal situation here in the U.S. and then Derica, the last one on the noncash charges. So Jan, you want to start please? Jan Lundberg : Yes, first I would like to make a comment, and since it's not a head-to-head trial, I think it's more compelling than different trials and done under different conditions, but as I said before, the data are generally supportive between solanezumab and crenezumab. We should remember though that the crenezumab is a Phase 2 trial, which is clearly much smaller than EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2. And I think for our EXPEDITION-3 is going to be the most important trial, which is even 60% larger than the previous EXPEDITION trials and the focus, I think here is clear. It is the mild Alzheimer's patients that could have the best impact from solanezumab and we are selecting the amyloid positive ones which is also a key criterion. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Jan. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : First on dulaglutide. We are, by the way, expecting that the trade name which is going to be TRULICITY. We are very much on track. The action date for both the U.S. and Europe is this year. So our launch preparations are very much ongoing. There is not much more really that I can discuss at this stage whether it's pricing or inspections and so forth. Just to say that at this stage things are going on truck from our perspective. When it comes to our new insulin glargine product, we are also expecting tentative approvals this year and clearly we do have in the U.S. the 30 month stay. I can't make many comments about the ongoing litigation, but clearly we do not believe that we are infringing any of the asserted patents. So we are hopeful that we can resolve this as soon as we ca. Hopefully even before the 30 month stay. But if that is not the case, we have the conviction in terms of what our position is and we are not infringing any of those asserted patents. So we will be planning to launch at this stage. Phil Johnson : Enrique, thank you. Derica? Derica Rice : Hi, Seamus. For amortization of intangibles that's embedded in our operating results, as you heard from Phil earlier, for the second quarter about $135 million is what's reflected in our Q2 results. When we think about Lohmann, if you look at it on a full-year basis, a full twelve month basis, somewhere between $15 million to $20 million. As it relates to Novartis Animal Health. I am not able to share that with you until we actually close the deal and we have the final purchase accounting. So that number is still moving at the moment. Phil Johnson : And in terms of any thoughts about moving towards where most of the peers said of the non-GAAP treatment of amortization, Derica? Derica Rice : Thanks, Phil. We have obviously gotten some input both from people such as yourself, Seamus on the sell side as well as we have gotten some inquiries on it from some of our buy side investors as well. It's something we are taking under consideration. Actually, we plan to come back and inform you as to what are our actions going forward will be. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Derica. Toni, if we can have another caller, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen: Thank you. I have three questions. First, on dulaglutide. There's no question that you have a best-in-class asset. But what portion of the GLP market would be receptive to a modestly effective but less expensive product from GSK? And is that portion 10% or 30%? Secondly, Lilly has given out some time ago now, a very specific guidance on SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales without specifying a year in which that will be achieved. Consensus, I believe, has Lilly achieving these targets in 2019. Can you tell us whether Lilly's internal forecast has you achieving these targets before 2019? And if you aren't willing to say, would you say whether Lilly plans to achieve these targets this decade? And then the final question is that, it seems that 2015 is setting up to be a phenomenal year with sales and earnings up very strongly. Yet consensus covers a wide range. What early observations would you like to make about 2015? For instance, please take the opportunity to rein in the high end of those estimates, unless compared to your expectations, the high end is just fine. Thank you. Phil Johnson : All right. Steve, thank you, for the three questions. Well I will have Enrique take the dulaglutide question, and Derica you will have to comment on timing or some of the goals for the SG&A and R&D as a percent of revenue, and then any initial thoughts on 2015. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Steve, thank you for your comments. I am going to quote you on dulaglutide as a best-in-class asset. VERY much appreciate it. We certainly believe so. Look, on your specific question about -- there are different types of profiles in the GLP-1 class and some look less efficacious. I will be honest, I think the value proposition for those products is very complicated. We do know that improved glycemic control leads to reduction in complications. That is a very strong value proposition. It does what we seek that. So it is difficult for me to say what type of share would those products get, but I do not believe it is going to be very much. Phil Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Derica? Derica Rice : Hi, Steve. As it relates to our margin guidance that we put out there, Steve, we actually have provided a timeline, at least up till now. What we said is that, no later than 2019 or by 2019 we will achieve a total operating expense as a percent of sales somewhere in the 48% to 50% range. Getting back to the historical levels of profitability that you have seen from Lilly pre-patent expiration. We still expect to at least meet that timeline. There clearly will be opportunities to update that outlook as we move forward. As it relates to 2015, Steve, it is still early. I am not in a position to share details on our outlook for 2015. But we have said though is that we do, coming out of 2014, expect to return to growth and to begin our journey towards expanding our margins. And so that is the kind of performance you should expect to see and obviously in the near future we will have an opportunity of giving you more specifics around 2015 as we think about our usual timeline for issuing guidance. Phil Johnson : Yes, and then typically, Steve, that guidance is given in that first full week of January. So probably somewhere around January 7 you should expect to be seeing a day reserved for the 2015 guidance call. Toni, if we can have next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse : Yes, thanks so much for taking the questions, so two that I have. One on the CGRP antibody. I think that's a pipeline asset people don't talk about too much yet. Can you just talk a little more on your expectations there? We have obviously seen some setbacks previously in that space. What do you think are the differentiating points for that product? And what would you say are some of the key decision points that you have coming up here? And then just looking at your slide 14 with the key events, it doesn't look like any other major external data readouts the rest of this year. Any chance any of the autoimmune studies that you have ongoing that we might see some of those at AACR later in the year? Or if not, should we assume ULAR next year might be a big meeting for you guys with all three of these assets there? Phil Johnson : Vamil, thank you for the questions. We will have Jan lead off on the CGRP. Dave, feel free to chime in and then I will ask my colleague Ilissa if she wants to comment on some of the data readouts for the back half of the year, Jan? Jan Lundberg : Yes. Calcitonin gene related peptide or CGRP has been implied as an important mediator in migraine since quite some time and it has been shown by small molecules that you can reduce then the acute migraine symptoms by giving up oral agents. The problem with both agents were that yes, they prove the hypothesis that CGRP is an important mediator, but they were not safe for chronic use, because they had liver toxicity. That's why I think the antibody, in a way, comes in with an open door where the mechanism has been proven and antibodies, as we have seen with ours, are generally safer. So they are more appropriate also then for potential to chronic use. And as you know, we described the positive data from a proof of concept study recently where the effect in chronic migraine was shown reducing the migraine headache days and also migraine attacks than in so-called episodic migraine. So what we are doing now with this molecule is to do some more dose ranging and studying and preparations then for Phase 3. And we also recently announced that we will start to study on osteoarthritis also for this agent. Phil Johnson : Great, Jan. Thank you. Dave, any comments? Dave Ricks : No. Phil Johnson : Okay, Ilissa? Ilissa Rassner : Sure. Thanks, Vamil, for the question. So a while you are correct, that we don't have any detailed data readouts listed for our immunology portfolio, we are expecting internal data readout in the second half of this year, starting with ixekizumab, followed by tabalumab and towards the very end of the year, the first trial we will readout for baricitinib. Those trials should have detailed data readouts starting in 2015. I will also remind you that we are expecting topline results as well for our basal insulin peglispro in diabetes for the Type I trials and that will be in the third quarter of this year. Phil Johnson : And as has been our past practice, Vamil, I think you should expect that the various trials that Ilissa just mentioned would lead to topline press releases providing an update at a high level on whether or not the trials have met their endpoint. So what kind of safety profile we have seen and some of our thoughts on next steps for those molecules. One I might mention that's broader across the portfolio, the REACH trial of ramucirumab in hepatocellular cancer, I think it is quite possible and likely that we have detailed data presented at a medical meeting before the end of the year that should get some additional insights into the commentary we provided around subgroup data that we found to be quite interesting. Ilissa Rassner : And then also for ramucirumab, there is the colorectal data that would lead out towards the end of this year, possibly early next year and could have a topline readout as well. Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse : Great. Okay. Thank you. Phil Johnson : Thanks for the questions. Toni, next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for taking the questions. On GLP-1s, we should see Phase 2 data for Novo' oral GLP-1 in Q2 2015. I was just wondering if you would give us your thoughts on this approach and how you view it as a potential competitive threat to the GLP-1 market, as well as the DPP4s and SGLT2s? On SGLT2 fixed combos, one of your competitors has stated that they view the approval of these as a significant inflection point for the acceleration of cost growth. I am just wondering how you are thinking about this opportunity and do you share this view? And then finally, just on the basal insulin peglispro, I think I heard you say that the U.S. filing was going to be 1Q 2015 or earlier. What are the factors that could lead to an earlier filing? And how soon could this be? Thanks a lot. Phil Johnson : Great. Colin, thank you very much for the questions, and those are all directed to Enrique Conterno. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Thanks. On oral GLP-1s, we have said that this is an area that is attractive and is an area where we very much looking at as well. I won't comment. I think your question is probably more appropriate for one of our competitors. When it comes to the fixed dose combination, if you are referring to the fixed dose communication between a GLP-1 and insulin, we clearly see the combination of a GLP-1 and insulin as important therapy. We do believe with dulaglutide and our insulin portfolio, we can provide very significant value when it comes to providers and payors. We do believe that the restriction that is imposed by having a fixed dose combination in this particular case, in a certain way, takes away from the flexibility that endocrinologists want and need, given how insulin is titrated. They are giving some indications here but I should also comment about the SGLT2s and DPP4 fixed-dose combination. We do believe this is an important product for us. Of course, we are developing this with Boehringer Ingelheim. We have submitted this in the U.S. and we believe we are significantly ahead of our competition. Today about 25% of the SGLT2 use is on top of a DPP$0. So that gives you a sense of the possibilities for overall class growth and branded growth and the impact that this fixed dose combination could have. Finally, you asked about whether we could file earlier than Q1, basal insulin peglispro? That is a possibility, but at this stage, I think what we said is we would file by Q1. Clearly we are working on getting the readout for our Type I studies and we expect that we are going to be seeing this later this quarter, and we expect the press release together with that. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Phil Johnson : You are welcome. Next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes to from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeff Holford - Jefferies: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got two questions around insulin glargine products. Just firstly, can you just give us a bit more color on why you have added the three mil cartridge to your filing? And does this potentially relate to being able to come to the market with a product such as the OptiClik device which Ypsomed had previously there to try and get around some of the Solostar patents? And then secondly, can you just update us a bit more on your thoughts around timing of European launch and what kind of presentation the product would have, in terms of device or not? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great. Jeff, thank you for the questions. We will stay with Enrique. Enrique Conterno : Sure. On insulin glargine, we have submitted two NDAs. You are right. One for prefilled pens and one for an insulin for cartridges. Clearly, those are two independent NDAs and we have been sued on each one of them. So that's all I will say, basically, at this stage, but we will be intending to, basically, oppose the patent expirations and resolving the ongoing litigation to be able to bring both of those to the market. Your second question was related to Europe. Clearly the patent expiration for Lantus is in 2015. We are expecting tentative approval this year. So we are very much in our preparation, but that's as much as I can comment. Of course, we take very seriously the patents, but are in place and we will launch after those patents have expired. Jeff Holford - Jefferies: Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : You are very welcome. Toni, next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. A question on ramucirumab for second line metastatic colorectal cancer. My understanding is that the Phase 3 trial, those patients could have been treated with Avastin first line. So how should we think about the process of this trial, given the similar mechanism of action and given the clinical profile we have seen with ramu so far? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Thank you very much, Alex. Sue Mahony, please? Sue Mahony : Yes, Alex, you are right. This is a second line trial after Avastin in first line. Clearly, we will wait and see what the data shows. We will have that data towards the end of this year and we will be announcing topline and then we will be planning to present it at a scientific meeting next year. So I think it's too early to speculate at this point. We will have to wait and see what the data shows us. Phil Johnson : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Toni, next caller, please. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS: My first question is how are you thinking about the biologic psoriasis market? There's several players there. So are you thinking about your product being differentiated? Second, there was a comment earlier on the call about an adjustment in the U.S. for managed Medicaid. How big was that adjustment? Can you just explain what happened there? And then third, just on the insulin products. Any major changes in the quarter? Humalog, Humalin seemed to be bouncing around first quarter, second quarter quite a bit relative to what I would have thought the scripts were doing. So if you could just give us a sense of what's going on there? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Absolutely happy to, Marc. Thanks for the questions. Dave Ricks, we will have you go and start with the biologic market with psoriasis. Derica, if you could comment please on the managed Medicaid situation. Enrique, for the U.S. insulin sales trends we have been seeing. Dave? Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Marc. As it relates to psoriasis treatment, we have seen our rapid growth of TNF use over the last decade in treating moderate to severe psoriasis and then more recently, of course, alternate mechanisms with Stelara which has been met with great success in the market. We believe IL-17s are another step forward in therapy for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and you can see some of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 readouts from the three competitors, which are all neck and neck in the very last stages of testing here. The promise of the class is really to move the standard of what good is from a PASI 75 clearance to really something north of that, PASI 90 or total clearance which can now be possible for these patients who suffer from this difficult condition and we see IL-17s delivering PASI 100 or complete clearance substantially above both anti-TNFs and Stelara. So that's the value proposition for the class. Within the class, we of course have our own differentiation strategy, which includes of course efficacy. We will have to see the safety as it bears out and then dosing regimens which are all different between the various players. We have not disclosed or read-out our Phase 3 program and that will be coming soon in a topline fashion. So we will wait to say any more until when we see those data in a complete form, but we are bullish on the class. Phil Johnson : Excellent, Dave. Thanks, Dave. Derica? Derica Rice : Hi, Marc. As it relates to the U.S. and the managed Medicaid, this is really us, as we got additional receipts in from customers. We were able to true up the accruals and provisions on our book. Dollar wise, it's about $60 million, which in effect was about two percentage points of growth in the U.S. So just as a reminder, our U.S. overall sales was down about 30%. If you were to exclude the impact of the Cymbalta and Evista patent expirations, our growth was a positive 13%, which was about eight percentage points of price, five percentage points of volume. So of that eight percentage points of price, two percentage points of that was the managed Medicaid adjustment. Phil Johnson : Excellent. Thank you, Derica. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. Marc, you are correct. When we look at the underlying script growth for our insulin business in the U.S., Q1 and Q2 are very comparable but we do see you in terms of our reported sales, we were at minus 1% for Humalog in Q1 and we were 17% growth for Q2. So a big difference there. Let's remember that in Q1, we had a significant wholesaler destocking that impact in the growth rate. In the case of Humalog, that impact was 8 to 9 percentage points in Q1. So that that explains the part of the difference. In Q2, we just discussed managed Medicaid, in the case of Humalog, that impact was 4%.So those were we had, I guess, some very unique impacts to each one of those quarters. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Toni, next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Damien Conover with MorningStar. Please go ahead. Damien Conover - MorningStar: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on the insulin franchise. Just had a question for the pricing power with Humulin. It looks like a very strong growth in the U.S. with price. I just kind of want to understand that in the context of the Express Scripts negotiations on getting on the formulary there, but still being able to drive some price. Wondering if that price is coming from customers outside that formulary? Or if that formulary still allows for some pricing power? And then secondly, when you think about the renegotiations with the PBMs, and we are likely to see the formularies in August, I wanted to see if anything strategically has changed with the negotiations there after you have had a couple quarters here of a more aggressive negotiation that happened last year? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Damien, thank you for the questions. Enrique Conterno. Enrique Conterno : Sure. On Humulin, a big part of our human insulin franchise in the case of Humulin is that we have a very unique product in Humulin R U-500 which basically has significant growth on where the pricing pressures are not as high as with the rest of the insulin franchise, and you basically see some of that reflected in terms of both price and volume. Your second question related to our ongoing discussions or negotiation with the PBMs and payors, I won't be able to share much on that front. Phil Johnson : Okay, great. Damien, thanks for the questions. Toni, next caller, please? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes form the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank : Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to go back briefly to the inversion subject. And for John and Derica, companies that have done inversions almost always claim that tax efficiency is a secondary sort of effect. So I would like to hear how you are and the Board is thinking, John, on this subject has evolved over the past year or so? And sort of a nitpicky follow-up. Derica, you indicated that Lilly isn't considering or doesn't generally agree with large scale M&A for Lilly. But would a $20 billion to $30 billion deal, definitionally, be considered large scale M&A? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Okay, great. Thank you very much for the questions. Welcome back to the fold. Wasn't expecting to hearing you on the call, but its great to hear your voice. Derica, for the inversion and the definition of large scale, please. Derica Rice : Well, to me, $20 billion to $30 billion is a pretty large number. At least from my basic math class in Alabama. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank : So maybe the rest of the question is moved then? Derica Rice : Again, even if we were preparing to through our series of patent expirations and there is a lot of speculation of other thoughts we needed to do to manage our way through this tough period in the history of Lilly and still clearly large-scale M&A was one of the options that was on the table. Again, as we looked at all the data, both looking at other transactions by other firms that historically there is that near-term benefit you can gain but longer-term, the core to this industry and we believe the core to our business as Lilly is, your ability to innovative and get new molecules out of your labs that create clinical differentiation. And so that's where we chose to focus and expend our energy. So when we think about business development transactions, ways that we can augment that innovative platform or footprint for us, we are absolutely interested in. Things that would begin to create a distraction and could begin to hamper or dampen our ability to produce new innovative research and development, are things that we are really quite not interested at the moment. And for us, it's been a combination of those smaller deal bolting on to our organic strategy and I see that being the path going forward. John Lechleiter : Gregg, it's John Lechleiter. It's nice to hear from you. I think the only other comment I would make is, look, I think that the activity around inversions right now just points to a failure of our U.S. tax code and it really keeps American companies, not just Pharma industry, but across industries from being competitive with their overseas counterparts. We have been talking about tax reform. I think the first TV interview I gave when I became CEO in 2008, a big discussion was tax reform. We need a lower rate. We need a territorial system. We don't need Band-Aid approaches in between. It's time for the Congress to step up to the bar and get this thing done. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank : Thanks, gentlemen. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Gregg. Thanks, John. Toni, next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Purcell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark Purcell - Barclays: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Staying with diabetes, lots of questions. But I wondered, for clarification, for the glargine product in Europe, should I expect from some of the comments you made so far, to see this product launched in Europe in Q2 next year? And then in terms of the SGLT/DPP4 combo, actually you are about a year ahead. So again, heading in towards a Class 1 review, how confident you are of launching that product after the PDUFA early 2015? Straying away from diabetes and thinking about your margin targets and where you are heading with a very broad pipeline. Some of these areas you are heading into are fairly crowded. There could be some serious battles in primary care and cholesterol. Obviously, there's some entrenched competition, increasing competition in the immunology space. So how do you consider going alone on some of these assets outside your core are for the moment versus partnering with players already in the space? And then lastly, clearly some very rigorous management recession on R&D costs, as you mentioned several times on the call. Should we be more comfortable now towards the lower end of your guidance range for SG&A and R&D cost lines for the full year? Or are there phasing effect such as initiation of new R&D trials which we need to be alerted to at this point? Thanks a lot. Phil Johnson : Great, Mark. Thank you for the questions. We will have Enrique take the questions on the insulin glargine in the European Union and then thoughts on the lunchtime for the SGLT2/DPP4 combo and then for the going alone versus partnering, some of how we think about that given some of the investments required to compete in these marketplaces, Derica, if I would ask you to maybe make a comment based on these volunteer business in particular if you want to comments as well, please feel free to, and then Derica if you could comment on the lower end the guidance range we have got for SG&A and R&D and how we should be thinking about where we are tracking. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : So when it comes to glargine in Europe, as I mentioned, we are expecting to launch after the patent expiration in Europe. I do not believe that I provided an expect date on that, but clearly we are undertaking all of the preparations so that we can do that. When it comes to the SGLT2/DPP4 combination, the EMPA/LINA fixed dose combination, we had shared that we have submitted that. We shared that early this year, which basically puts with an action date of early 2015. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Derica? Derica Rice : Mark, I will start with that the guidance in terms of operating expenses. I am not able to guide the investment community to one end or the other of the range. What I can say is we feel very good about meeting those goals that we established for the year and we feel very confident that we will be within the range that we provided. As it relate to, I guess your earlier question also around, as we look at our portfolio, the good news is that we believe we produce an abundance of clinical opportunities in our pipeline and some of those are core areas and some of those are maybe outside or tangential. Clearly, we will be able to evaluate each of those molecules and decide which path we choose to pursue as we consider each one of those. But the good news is that we have optimality and Dave, I don't know if there is anything you would like to add to that. Dave Ricks : Well, nothing more than, we always look, I think, almost every asset at options to partner, either to share risk if it's a critical stage asset or as the asset matures a trade value, sometimes by accessing reach, sometimes by capability or this other unique sort of portfolio fits or portfolio trade options that manifest themselves. So we are open-minded about all that but it has to make sense in terms of value creation and we are not going to talk about those in advance in this setting. But I think that's our mindset as it relates to partnering. Phil Johnson : Excellent. Thanks, Dave. Toni, next caller please. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes -- disregard. They have disconnected. Thank you. Phil Johnson : Okay, all right. Having exhausted the queue, I will turn it over to John to close our call today. John? John Lechleiter : Okay, thanks, Phil. And I will be brief. To all those on the call, we appreciate your continued interest in Lilly. Our performance once again is in line with our expectations this quarter. We are on track to meet our 2014 financial goals and continued progress advancing the pipeline places us on track to return to growth and margin expansion post 2014. We believe our strategy is the right one for Lilly to create value for patients, for physicians, payors and of course our shareholders. And our ability to execute so far gives us increasing confidence that Lilly is indeed poised for growth. As always, you can expect we will keep you apprised of our progress. Thanks again.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chairman, President and CEO, John Lechleiter. Please go ahead, sir. John C. Lechleiter: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss Eli Lilly & Company's third quarter 2014 earnings. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who's President of our Lilly Bio-Medicines business; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of our IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Before we cover our third quarter results in detail, I'd like to provide some high-level comments about where I see our company at this important juncture. Losing patent protection in relatively rapid succession for Gemzar, Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista created an unprecedented challenge for Lilly. Leading up to and through this period of patent expirations, our management team made disciplined choices so that we could invest to drive growth in key brands, geographies and businesses, and replenish and advance our pipeline. We've stayed focused on executing our strategy and I'm proud of the results we delivered to-date. In the face of a series of major patent expirations, we drove strong financial results from the rest of our business. We delivered on our promise to maintain our dividend while at the same time, returning additional cash to shareholders via share repurchase. And the significant progress we've made with our pipeline reflected in the large number of regulatory and clinical milestones achieved this past quarter validates the decision we made to maintain our investment in R&D. As we begin to turn the corner with multiple new product launches over the course of this year and next, having withstood the profound economic impact of patent expirations for 4 of our largest products, we also recognize we operate in an ever more challenging external environment. We intend to apply the same focused, disciplined execution of our strategies that we've displayed in recent years in order to succeed, and I'm confident we will. We aim to compete effectively and to win in diabetes, oncology and animal health. This includes investing in successful launches for Jardiance, Trulicity and Cyramza, including important new indications of line extensions, and continuing to drive growth in our Elanco business following the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. In the near term and long term, these businesses represent significant growth opportunities for our company that we must capitalize on. In our Bio-Medicines business, we have opportunities to drive a subsequent wave of substantial growth in areas that include autoimmune disorders, with molecules like ixekizumab and baricitinib; cardiovascular disease with evacetrapib; Alzheimer's disease with solanezumab and other molecules to follow; and in pain with tanezumab and our CGRP antibody, all dependent on Phase III data readouts that will be accomplished for the most part over the next 2 years. In R&D, we will sustain the flow from our pipeline and bring ever more innovative drugs to patients and do so more quickly and effectively than in the past. On the commercial side of our business, we will continue our quest to find ever more efficient and effective ways to engage physicians, patients and payers and we intend to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities in Asia in particular, specifically Japan and China. Going forward, we'll remain focused on executing our innovation-based strategy, focusing in on those areas where we have strong presence and capabilities or where we determine we can establish a leadership position. We believe this provides the best opportunity to meaningfully improve patients' lives and create value for shareholders. With that, let's turn to the key events since last quarter's call. For the second quarter in a row, we launched a new product. In the second quarter, we launched Cyramza in the U.S. for second line gastric cancer. In the third quarter, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched the oral SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance in the U.S. and in certain European countries. We're optimistic about the potential of this brand, including the opportunities that could come with being first to market with a fixed dose combination of an SGLT2 and a DPP-4, as well as being the first SGLT2 to report out results from a large cardiovascular outcome study in the second half of next year. We've also had a large number of positive developments on the regulatory front. In fact, I cannot recall another time in my 35 years with Lilly, so full of positive regulatory actions. In our diabetes business, we achieved regulatory milestones in the U.S., Europe and Japan for dulaglutide, our once weekly GLP agonist. Here in the U.S., the FDA approved dulaglutide or Trulicity for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Trulicity truly was designed with the patient in mind. It comes in a single dose pen that does not require mixing, measuring or needle attachment and can be administered any time of day independent of meals. We're excited to enter the GLP-1 market with Trulicity and we believe this product can be a catalyst for growth of the class. We began shipments of Trulicity here in the U.S. earlier this week. In Europe, the CHMP recommended approval of Trulicity and we anticipate European Commission approval this quarter, with European launches beginning early next year. In Japan, we submitted dulaglutide for regulatory review and expect regulatory action in the second half of 2015. The European Commission also approved the Humalog 200 units per milliliter KwikPen for the treatment of diabetes. This product is bioequivalent to our current product, Humalog 100, and is intended for people with diabetes who take more than 20 units of rapid acting insulin per day. In the U.S., we remain on track to resubmit Humalog U-200 by year end. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we achieved additional regulatory milestones in the last 3 months. We received FDA approval of Jardiance or empagliflozin, a once daily oral SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the product in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. Also in the U.S., we submitted the fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin. In addition, we made progress with our insulin glargine product as the U.S. FDA granted tentative approval of Basaglar. With this action, the FDA determined that Basaglar meets all regulatory requirements for approval. However, it is subject to an automatic stay of final approval as a result of patent infringement litigation filed by Sanofi. The FDA may not give final approval until mid-2016 unless the court determines the patent is not infringed or is invalid or unenforceable prior to that time. We're confident that we do not infringe any of the patent claims asserted and that we will prevail in this litigation. In Europe, the European Commission granted full approval of our insulin glargine product. This product called Abasria is the first insulin approved using Europe's biosimilar pathway. Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim will launch our insulin glargine product based on dates that do not infringe valid and enforceable patents. As you can see over these past 3 months, we made significant progress advancing our diabetes pipeline, moving closer to our goal of offering the widest range of diabetes treatment, spanning orals, GLP-1s and insulins both basal and mealtime. We feel each of our products will be competitive in its class, putting us in a unique position to help people with diabetes as well as the physicians who help them manage their disease. Diabetes wasn't the only area where we saw significant regulatory progress. Our oncology group has been busy as well. We achieved regulatory milestones for ramucirumab across all 3 major geographies. We received a positive opinion in Europe for ramucirumab in second line gastric cancer. This opinion included use in combination with paclitaxel as well as monotherapy use. As with Trulicity, we anticipate European Commission approval late in this quarter, with European launches beginning early next year. We submitted ramucirumab to Japanese regulators for the treatment of second line gastric cancer and were granted a priority review. We expect regulatory action in Japan in the first half of 2015. And here in the U.S., we submitted ramucirumab to the FDA as a treatment for second line non-small cell lung cancer. The FDA assigned a priority review and we anticipate FDA action before the end of this year. This could lead to a launch in early 2015. Keep in mind as well that we have an ongoing FDA review of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in second line gastric cancer. The action date for this submission is in the first quarter of next year and we expect FDA to act on or before the action date. Finally, with FDA having granted Fast Track status to necitumumab as a first-line treatment for squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we initiated our rolling submission, which we expect to complete before the end of this year. Turning now to clinical news. During the quarter, we also had Phase III trials read out in each of our therapeutic business areas : diabetes, oncology and bio-medicines. In diabetes, we announced positive top line results of 2 Phase III clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes for basal insulin peglispro or BIL, which is being studied as a once daily treatment for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In both trials, BIL showed a statistically superior reduction in HbA1c compared with Lantus. We've now completed the clinical trials for registration and are on track to submit to U.S. and European regulators by the end of the first quarter of 2015. In oncology, we announced positive top line results for RAISE. This is a Phase III study of Cyramza as second line treatment in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. RAISE showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients treated with ramucirumab plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. We expect to initiate regulatory submissions based on these data in the first half of 2015. This marks the fourth positive Phase III trial in which Cyramza has improved overall survival, 2 in second line gastric cancer, 1 in second line lung cancer and this 1 in second line metastatic colorectal cancer. Finally, in our Bio-Medicines business, we announced positive top line results for 3 Phase III studies of Ixekizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. All primary and key secondary objectives were met in the 3 studies, and Ixekizumab was superior to Enbrel on all measures of skin clearance in both of the active comparator trials. In our Phase III trials, up to 41% of patients treated with Ixekizumab achieved clear skin at week 12, with just 1 injection per dose. These results give us confidence that if approved, Ixekizumab could make complete resolution of psoriasis possible for significantly more people. We plan to submit Ixekizumab to regulatory authorities in the first half of next year. We also announced our decision to discontinue development of tabalumab, our anti-BAFF antibody. This decision was due to insufficient efficacy in 2 Phase III trials in lupus as well as in a Phase II trial in multiple myeloma. I'd also highlight, at the Annual Meeting of the European Society for medical oncology, we presented detailed data from the Phase III REACH trial, studying ramucirumab as a second line treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after treatment with sorafenib in the first-line setting. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival for the full study population, we saw encouraging results in patients with high baseline levels of alpha-fetoprotein. These data could form the basis of continued study of ramucirumab in this setting. During the third quarter, we completed enrollment in our core registration program for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Later in the call, Derica will provide you an update of our plans for top line press releases for this program. We also began Phase III testing for our CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib as we dosed our first patients in the first of 2 breast cancer trials. Dosing in the second breast cancer trials and in a lung cancer trial is anticipated later this quarter. In business development news, we announced an agreement with AstraZeneca to codevelop and commercialize AZD3293, an oral beta-secretase cleaving enzyme or base inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We recognize the initial milestone of $50 million pretax or approximately $0.03 per share after-tax as a charge to earnings in the third quarter. We aim to advance this potent base inhibitor quickly into a Phase II/III clinical trial in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Lilly will lead clinical development while AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing. The companies will take joint responsibility for commercialization. In line with our previously announced plans, we completed the sale of Lohmann Animal Health feed additives business to a management-led group. And earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our existing research agreement with Zymeworks to include development of immunomodulatory by specific antibodies for cancer. In other news, we announced plans to close and sell 1 of our 3 manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico. As a result of this action, we expect to record a charge of approximately $170 million pretax or approximately $0.16 per share after-tax in the fourth quarter. The IRS issued final regulations related to administration of the branded prescription drug fee under the Affordable Care Act. The final regulations modify the timing of when a company must recognize expense for their share of the fee. As a result, we recognized a $119 million non-tax-deductible charge in the third quarter for the fee we expect to pay in 2015. This accounting change has no impact on the timing of cash payments. Also, the third quarter charge is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Finally, during the third quarter, we repurchased shares worth $300 million under our $5 billion share repurchase program. Since authorizing the program in October of last year, we've now repurchased $1 billion worth of our shares. Combined with our dividend in the last year, we've distributed $3 billion to shareholders. And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil? Peter J. Johnson: Thanks, John. First, I'll review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insights into the underlying trends in our business. Moving to Slide 8, you can see that our Q3 revenue was $4.9 billion which is 16% lower than Q3 2013. This decrease in revenue reflects a decline of $1 billion in U.S. Cymbalta sales on a loss of exclusivity in December last year. In addition, U.S. sales of Evista declined over $150 million, following that product's loss of exclusivity in March of this year. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 7%, mainly from volume. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 5.2 percentage points, also driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. In Q3 both this year and last year, the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold had a minimal impact on cost of sales. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 4.8 percentage points from 79% in Q3 2013 to 74.2% in Q3 2014. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. Non-GAAP measures are shown on Slide 9. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, decreased 8% or nearly $235 million versus Q3 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 6% while R&D was down 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the reduction in sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts. The decline in R&D expenses was driven primarily by a reduction in late stage development costs, partially offset by a $63 million charge associated with the termination of tabalumab development. Excluding this charge, R&D expenses declined 14% and total operating expenses declined 10%. Other income expense was net income of $93 million in Q3 2014 compared to a net expense of $31 million in the third quarter of 2013, with the change driven primarily by gains on the sale of certain equity holdings and income from miscellaneous milestones earned. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 22%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to Q3 last year. The main reason for this increase in the tax rate is the lapse of the R&D tax credit at the end of last year. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share declined 41%. As in the first half of the year, this decline is significant but very much in line with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. On Slide 10, we provide the same reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted information for our year-to-date results. Moving to Slide 11, you'll find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. As you're aware, nearly all of our peers exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results while we include this expense. For your modeling purposes, please note that we recognized amortization expense of $134 million, representing 2.7% of revenue this quarter. Many of you on both the buy side and sell side have noted that our inclusion of amortization expense in our non-GAAP results distorts comparisons of our financial ratios with those of our peers. After careful consideration, we've decided that we will exclude amortization expense from our non-GAAP results beginning in 2015. In particular, we hope that this change will assist portfolio managers in making better buy-sell decisions. Now let's look at how price, rate and volume affected our revenue growth. On Slide 12, you can see the total revenue decline of 16% in Q3 2014, shown on the yellow box in the middle of the page, and that this decline was almost entirely driven by volume. Price added about 1% to revenue growth, while the impact of FX was 0. Excluding U.S. Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 7% with about 5.5 percentage points of growth coming from volume and the rest from price. Touching on some of the geographic highlights. In the U.S., pharma revenue declined 37%, driven by a volume decline of 38%. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our U.S. pharma revenue increased 6%, about half from volume and about half from price. Pharma revenue in Japan grew 4% with exchange rate masking stronger underlying growth. As you can see, volume was up 10% in Japan and revenue growth in constant currency terms was 9%. In Emerging Markets, we saw strong growth of 18%, almost all from volume. Sales in our largest emerging market country, China, grew 21%. I'd also highlight the consistent strong growth we've seen from our Emerging Markets business this year, with 14% revenue growth in constant currency terms through the first 9 months of the year. Finally, Elanco Animal Health posted revenue growth of 10%. The Lohmann acquisition drove 6 percentage points of growth with our base business driving the remaining 4 percentage points. This lower base business growth is due primarily to competitive pressures and to a lesser extent, to slower market growth in the U.S. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice: Thanks, Phil. On Slide 13, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the growth rates for select items of our income statement. FX had almost no impact on our revenue or operating expenses this quarter. As Phil mentioned, FX only had very little effect on cost of sales. As a result, the decline in our EPS is very similar with and without FX. Slide 14 shows our pipeline as of October 16. As John discussed earlier, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim received European approval and tentative U.S. approval for our new insulin glargine product and the FDA approved Trulicity. These approvals leave our regulatory review column empty. However, this shouldn't last long as we expect to complete regulatory submissions for necitumumab, basal insulin peglispro and Ixekizumab over the next 3 quarters. As mentioned earlier, we began Phase III testing for abemaciclib in breast cancer. We began Phase I testing of 2 monoclonal antibodies, 1 for cancer and the other for rheumatoid arthritis, and we added the base inhibitor through our collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca. Finally, we terminated development of tabalumab and of a Phase I oncology asset. Next, let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. We're very pleased with the progress we've made on the key events we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. As you can see from the green check marks on Slide 15, all the possible regulatory actions resulted in timely approvals, and we achieved nearly all of the other pipeline milestones. It's certainly been a very productive year and a pivotal one as we emerge from our YZ patent expiry period and look to return to growth. Before the end of the year, we expect to begin our second Phase III breast cancer study as well as our Phase III lung cancer study with abemaciclib. We expect to complete the rolling FDA submission of necitumumab for first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to receive FDA action on ramucirumab for second line non-small cell lung cancer, and we expect to lose European data package exclusivity for Cymbalta in depression, following a loss of data package exclusivity for stress urinary incontinence in the third quarter. We continue to expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market in 2015. Also, after discussions with Incyte, we've agreed upon our disclosure plan for the Phase III trials of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. This includes issuing the top line press release for the first trial late this year or early next year. In addition, the top line press release for the final 2 trials is likely to be issued late next year, after completion of the full 52 weeks of treatment. Clearly, we've achieved a great deal in 2014 and we're looking forward to maintaining this momentum both as we close out the year and during 2015. Now let's turn to our 2014 financial guidance. Our performance through September places us on track to achieve our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance which remains unchanged at $2.72 to $2.80. We are updating our GAAP EPS guidance which is now $2.34 to $2.42, to reflect the charges taken in the third quarter as well as those announced for Q4. In addition, we are updating a number of the individual line items. We've narrowed our revenue range to $19.4 billion to $19.8 billion due to the weakening of the euro, yen and pound that occurred late in the third quarter as well as the recent competitive pressures and market dynamics in the U.S. we're seeing in Animal Health. Both of these factors prevent future headwinds for revenue. We raised our estimate of the gross margin percent to roughly 74.5%. A major driver of this change is the weakening of the euro. While that brings a revenue headwind, it does provide a near-term benefit on the cost of sales. In addition, a shutdown to implement production changes at one of our bulk insulin plants will now occur solely in 2015 rather than span 2014 and 2015. As a result, idle plant, a period manufacturing expense will shift out of 2014 into 2015, benefiting this year. In total, our operating expense guidance is essentially unchanged although we have modified the range for the individual components. We've narrowed and lowered the non-GAAP range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses to $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion and we've added a line to reflect GAAP guidance for the same line item which includes the $119 million additional pharma manufacturing fee. We've narrowed and raised the range for research and development expenses to $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion to reflect the third quarter charge for tabalumab, the base deal with AstraZeneca and trends in our research spending. Based on the amount of year-to-date other income, we've raised the non-GAAP range for other income and expense to a range of $200 million to $250 million of income. While our non-GAAP tax rate guidance continues to be approximately 19%, we're now providing GAAP tax rate guidance of approximately 20%. These tax rates assume a full year 2014 benefit of the R&D tax credit and other tax provisions up for extension. If these items are not extended, both 2014 tax rates would be approximately 2 percentage points higher. Similarly, our expectation for non-GAAP minimum net income remains unchanged at $2.9 billion and we're now providing our expectation of GAAP minimum net income of $2.6 billion. Finally, our guidance for minimum operating cash flow as well as capital expenditures is unchanged. Keep in mind that our 2014 financial guidance assumes the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health closes in 2015. Should the acquisition close during 2014, we'll revise our 2014 financial guidance if necessary. On Slide 17, we provided a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance. Now before the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. From a financial perspective, the first 9 months of the year have played out much as we'd expected. We've seen our revenues and earnings decline due to the U.S. patent expirations of Cymbalta and Evista. We've prudently managed expenses, driving a double-digit reduction in our operating expense base. From a pipeline perspective, we've met or exceeded our expectations. The flow of positive regulatory and pipeline news has been substantial and we've launched 3 new products : Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity. The steady advance of the pipeline strengthens our confidence in our innovation-based strategy and our commitment to accelerate discoveries to the people who need them. In addition, it positions us well for a return to growth and expand margins in 2015 and beyond. And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for the Q&A session Peter J. Johnson: Thanks, Derica. Marla, if you could go ahead and provide instructions to the callers for the Q&A session, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division : Two questions if I may. One perhaps to Derica or maybe even to Dave Ricks, and the second to you, John. The first is really around the sales footprint. You've done a very nice job at keeping cost down but the question is with new launches, obviously, there is the need for additional marketing expense and maybe additional salesperson. So I'd love for you to -- if you could provide some idea or thoughts around both U.S. and non-U.S. footprint with respect to sales individuals. And then the second, John, you've made a good comment about keeping the dividend at the same rate, especially as you entered this particular year, but as you move forward with these new launches, have you given some thought to when it's prudent for the overall business to actually raise that rate? Peter J. Johnson: Tony, for the sales footprint, Dave, if you don't mind maybe talking about some of the things that have been going on in maybe U.S. and Europe and in terms of some of the restructuring since you've been very involved in that. And then maybe Enrique and Sue, if you could talk about some of the preparations for launches since that's hitting you first in terms of the progression of the pipeline. And then Derica, if you want to take the question on the plans we have for the dividend, thoughts around the dividend. David A. Ricks: Great. Tony, as it relates to the loss of exclusivity products, as we've been discussing here over the last 2 years, we've been taking down our sales footprint market by market. Typically, those are anticipating. They have been in advance of the LOE event. So in the U.S. you're seeing the full year effect of sales reductions in 2014 which mostly occurred in 2013 related to Evista and Cymbalta. As it relates to Europe, our patents are expiring this last quarter, reporting on now, some of those actions have been taken, some have not. But we do anticipate over the next year, rationalizing the footprint to the products we have in biomed, not including Cymbalta, of course, being the major contributor. Going forward, we're quite confident we have the personnel and coverage to launch our new product portfolio effectively in those major markets. Of course, we're shifting much more to a specialty type business, so the absolute numbers are lower than what we had in the past in biomedicines. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno: Sure. So when it comes to diabetes, Tony, we've had a very significant footprint on a worldwide basis. I think what we have said before is that we basically expect to leverage this footprint. We do see some increases but they are limited when it comes to our overall sales force. We've seen some increases in the U.S. but more marginal when it comes to Europe. Susan Mahony : Tony, with regards to oncology, we're going to be using the footprint that we have in oncology. We've got an experienced oncology sales team globally, very experienced in thoracic oncology and as well historically in GI and we'll be using the expertise and the people that we've got globally on that commercial perspective to launch our products. Derica W. Rice: Tony, this is Derica. From a dividend perspective just historically, before we entered this YZ period, our dividend payout ratio was in the 40% range or the mid-40s and that's kind of been on par with where our peers were as well. We knew as we went through this period that we would see a spike in our payout ratio as we went through this income decline, so the law of the ratio itself. As it pertains to when would we consider to increasing the dividend going forward, I don't believe we'll wait until we have to get back to that 40%, 45% range. It's going to be more predicated on our confidence as we see how some of the pipeline and regulatory and launch news play out over these next couple of years. Operator : We'll go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : If I may, just 2 quick ones. Number 1, just a clarification. Can you guys clarify what, if any, interim analyses might be available to you for solanezumab as well as evacetrapib in 2015? Again, if any. And number 2, I was wondering if you could speak about the Tradjenta outcomes trial. I'm just wondering if there is prospectively evaluated endpoint of hospitalizations for heart failure. This has obviously become an endpoint of interest to the physician and the Wall Street community. Peter J. Johnson: Mark, if you can still hear me, are you referring to the Tradjenta outcome study or studies or are you referring to the empagliflozin outcomes that we talked about having data for in the second half of next year? Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Actually, both would be nice. Peter J. Johnson: I knew when I asked the question, that'd probably be the answer. All right, we'll see if we can accommodate that. So Dave, if you could start us off please with the interims for solanezumab. Enrique, if you want to handle the question on the measures for the outcome study, that would be great. David A. Ricks: Thanks, Mark. On, evacetrapib we have said we will be conducting an interim analysis. We expect that to be happening sometime in the first half of 2015. This is of course, a safety review but also includes some efficacy features. I think as we've said before, it's a reasonably low bar given that in lipid management studies, quite a bit of the benefit is often seen in the back half of the trial. So we'll of course, await that event and communicate quickly afterward if there's any change to the program. Otherwise, we continue to expect a final readout on that data in 2016. As it relates to solanezumab, we did build into the protocol, a possibility of an interim review. We have not decided to conduct that or not. One of the key reasons for that is this review needs to be conducted late enough where we have enough patient exposures. You may remember in EXPEDITION 1 and 2, a lot of the benefits started to accumulate after 40 weeks of exposure. And there's a relationship between the rate at which we've recruited the study and whether there'd be value in conducting such an assessment or just waiting a short time further for the final result. The study continues to enroll and so we'll be making that determination sometime in the next 12 months. Peter J. Johnson: Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno: Very good. So just to clarify, we are expecting for our EMPA CV trial to report out next year, and when it comes to Tradjenta in 2018. So a big difference in terms of when we expect the results. Both of these trials have similar measures. So we look of course, the CV desk, we look at MI and we look at stroke. In addition to that, the Tradjenta trial has hospitalization for unstable angina. So those are the prospective measures that we look at. We do have the ability to look at hospitalization due to heart failure. This is of course, an important measure. We would know more about the DPP-4 class I think, when the tech study basically reports out from Merck's up and down [ph] , we should get some clarity in terms of this particular measure. Operator : And next we'll go to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Timothy Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : As you near the launch of your Lantus look-alike, the insulin glargine product, I'm hoping you can give us your latest commercial assessment of the opportunity both here in the U.S. and then in Europe where you'll launch first. At one point in the past, you talked about what you thought could be the market share potential of your product which was quite a bit higher than how Sanofi has described it and they continue to minimize the threat to their product from your program. When are we going to learn more from Lilly on some of the EU specifics like pricing and exact launch timing? And then my second question is on as we near the end of 2014 and move into 2015, I'm hoping you can qualitatively describe the pushes and pulls in R&D spending. It seems that you've crossed a lot of milestones in your pipeline and maybe there could be some easing up on R&D spending and that's already a trend it seems like that we've started to see in 2014. So directionally, as you think about R&D in 2015, what should we be considering? Peter J. Johnson: Thanks, Tim. So Enrique, if you'll handle the first question and then maybe Jan and I will tag team the second question for you. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno: Well, on glargine, I don't think that we've discussed before what we believe is going to be our share update. I think what we have shared is that we expect that glargine will continue to be a very important product going forward. Clearly, there is a very significant opportunity. How biosimilars in Europe or in the U.S., these glargine follow ons basically compete and what those dynamics will be, will be critical to see what is going to be the share of the overall biosimilar market. We clearly are not the only 1 that are coming. We are maybe the first that will be entering the marketplace. But clearly for us, we like our chances because we do have the commercial footprint, the expertise in diabetes and the very extensive manufacturing capacity and devices to make sure that we can provide an excellent customer experience and go toe-to-toe with Sanofi. So we do have expectations for this product. We have to recognize that this is a very significant opportunity overall and even any type of level of market share can be basically meaningful from a revenue perspective. Peter J. Johnson: Tim, this is Phil. On your second question, just as a preamble. We will issue official financial guidance including R&D spend on January 7 of 2015 for 2015. In that same meeting as we have in the past, we'll talk about some of the specific late stage developments that we would expect over the course of the year including Phase III starts, so I'll limit my remarks today to some of the things that are sort of already out there and known in the public. For pushes and pulls on R&D spend, clearly we've had a lot of trials read out this year that will not be continuing into 2015 that does provide some relief in terms of year-on-year compares. We do have trials that are ramping up for things like abemaciclib as we'll have all 3 of those trials enrolling quickly, we expect, over the course of 2014 and what remains in 2015. We also, pending the full removal of the partial clinical hold by FDA, could be restarting Phase III trials and a significant number of them potentially for tanezumab that would also add spend in 2015 that we did not have in 2014. And then also the collaboration with AstraZeneca for the base inhibitor which we're excited about, we do expect more spend in '15 compared to '14. In the past, Derica on many occasions has said that going forward roughly, we're looking at the sort of $5 billion number plus or minus a few hundred million dollars likely, as the place that we will be, obviously dependent upon pipeline outcomes and good investment opportunities in the pipeline. Jan, do you want to comment maybe on some of the things that are in earlier stage development that you're following in or are very interested in? Jan M. Lundberg: Right. I think we should remember that positive Phase III readouts also would trigger additional opportunities. And we have a number of line extension opportunities and also the new combinations and so on that -- that we could pursue which we are currently discussing, and this is oncology, diabetes and the autoimmune space for instance. We also are very keen then of how sustainability of the pipeline and looking at additional Phase II investments. And here, oncology have a number of readouts next year including the gargalunisertive [ph] the TGF-beta compound, the MetMAb and several others. Diabetes, we have the glucagon receptor antagonist or oral first in class agents. And in the Alzheimer areas, as Phil said, we have our new base program in addition and we also have our plaque specific antibody N3pG which will generate new data. And just to remind you, we have also some very intriguing preclinical data with combinations of base and N3pG which actually cause more or less a total clearance of plaque in Alzheimer models. In the pain area, Phil mentioned tanezumab, our NGF antibody which we are very excited about based on the previous data and various pain situations. And we need to clear then, the situation with the regulators, with some additional preclinical safety data. We have our CGRP antibody which we are not only testing in migraine prevention but also recently in osteoarthritis, since we believe that this could be a pain mechanist that can be applied more generally. We also are looking upon data from our PCSK9 antibody and evaluating then the efficacy and so on, to see if this could be the potential best-in-class molecule in that area. And blosozumab, as you know, we delayed Phase III start but they are working very much on a new formulation so we could come back. And finally, we are getting data from myostatin on muscle building and we have recently reported that this not only builds muscle mass, but also strength. So we have a lot of opportunities coming both on existing then enemies [ph] , but also in some of the new ones. Operator : We'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just had 2 here. First, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the animal health commentary from your press release and the prepared remarks on increased competitive dynamics? Just trying to understand that a little bit better. And the second question was on the near term diabetes launches. Can you just help set some expectations in how you're kind of seeing the shape of those launch curves? It seems like we've seen some kind of non first-in-class primary care launches that have seen fairly slow initial uptick in first year ramps. And then these products go on to be very successful but I'm just trying to think with these opportunities, is that a reasonable way to think about how these products will launch? Or is there anything you think about with these profiles or that you can do from a pair perspective that might result in a different kind of uptake curve for these products? Peter J. Johnson: Thanks, Chris. We'll have Jeff Simmons take your first question and Enrique take the second. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons: I'll start kind of at a high level, Chris. As you know, Lilly has been very intentional and strategic about its animal health business. We've outpaced the industry in growth the last 6 years. We intend this year to be at or above industry growth rates. As you saw, our growth driven by both Lohmann as well as organic growth that we've seen in our existing business. But as Derica mentioned, there's 2 competitive pressures that were anticipated and they are both first in the companion animal space, seen a couple of new competitive entrants as well as we've seen the market actually not grow as anticipated. That was driven by one, cooler weather and then second is a little bit more movement into the OTC channels. On the food animal side, we've seen market growth not be quite as aggressive as it was last year. Some of that is, as you know, the swine virus has dropped pig population around the world, anywhere from 7% to 10%, and then just some of the natural dynamics in the market. I would say the other thing that materially impacted us was Zilmax last year went off the market and we saw 1.5% or so growth in our food animal business by filling this gap in the marketplace. And so year-to-year, that impacted our growth rate as well. But overall, we feel very good. Acquisition growth, international growth and innovation growth will allow us to see in the medium and long-term, at or above industry growth rates. Peter J. Johnson: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno: Maybe some comments on the structure of the market which I think in a certain way, impacts how we basically view the upticks of new products. And this is regardless of whether the product is first-in-class or second or third in the class. First, I think when we look at access, about 50% of the market in the commercial space -- 50% of the market basically is available for access when it comes to new products. First-in-class, second-in-class, third-in-class, you're likely going to be on a lower tier when it comes to the co-pay but it is not off formulary. About 25% of the market in the commercial space is going to have some sort of restrictions -- so step edits or some sort of restriction that goes beyond just the co-pay. And about 1/4 of the market, the rest of the market basically is of formulary. So we need to take that into account as we look at the uptick of new products in today's world. In Part D, the situation is different because it basically takes a lot longer to be able to get into the Part D formulary. And it's not as simple to be able to get into a Part D formulary in the middle of the year. Now as we look at upticks for our products, we look at our performance, we've seen the plants where we have access. Of course, we also look at our overall performance. But as I look at empagliflozin, as I look at the issue of the 2 class, I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the uptick of this class. Not just the overall volume of prescriptions that we basically see but we basically have seen an acceleration of the upticks with the additional players coming into the market. So that to me is very encouraging. But not only is the quantity of prescriptions interesting but I think the dynamics of those prescriptions. Because they are coming at the expense of sulfonylureas. So primarily, the substitution that is happening is for when it comes to new patients, our patients instead of going to an SGU, they are going to an SGLT2. That to me I think, is extremely interesting because there is the -- just today, after metformin continue to be very widely used. So I'm very encouraged by the uptick of the class. It is early for me to make many comments about Jardiance but I would say based on 6, 7 weeks that we're on the market, that we're off to a strong start. Operator : We'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I have 3 questions. First, with respect to the SG&A outlook, should investors expect SG&A to decline or stay [indiscernible] Peter J. Johnson: Dave, you're cutting out. We can barely hear you. David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Sorry about that. Is this better? Peter J. Johnson: Yes, it is. David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, great. So the first question is with respect to the SG&A outlook. Should investors expect SG&A to decline in 2015 or stay flat? Second, with respect to the earnings impact from the Novartis Animal Health acquisition in 2015, could you just review what you've stated previously and also comment on the amount of amortization that Lilly will exclude? And then third, could you just provide some perspective on the variables that will impact your decision over the next year regarding whether or not to take an interim look at the solanezumab data? Peter J. Johnson: We'll have Derica handle the first 2 and then Dave, do you want to do the third please? Derica? Derica W. Rice: David, in regards to the SG&A outlook, I'm not in a position to provide you '15 guidance at this point. As Phil said, we will have a more extensive dialogue around that on January 7. So if you'll just kind of live with this till then. And then likewise also in terms of the earnings impact anticipated from the Novartis Animal Health, until we actually close the deal which we anticipate being some time in 2015, we're really not in a position to talk about that at this stage. What we did say at the time we announced the deal is that by 2017, we would expect to have achieved at least $200 million of benefit or synergistic benefit that would result in cost savings as well as we should be able to get back to our historical levels of profitability in that 2017 and 2018 time frame which for our animal health business has been at that 25% roughly level of profitability. As it relates to amortization, what we can talk about at this stages is the amortization that we're seeing in our base business today. Obviously, it will be eventually impacted once we close the Novartis Animal Health deal. But in this quarter alone, we had $134 million of amortization expense in Lilly's results. And on an annual basis, it's about $500 million, $540 million. And then obviously, if we're able to close the Novartis Animal Health deal, that number will grow or get bigger as a result of that acquisition. Peter J. Johnson: Dave? David A. Ricks: I think there's an earlier question on this as it relates to the sola interim review. We do have a feature to potentially conduct such a thing. But the primary -- there's many reasons why we would pull that trigger or not but the primary one relates to patient exposure versus the amount of time left in the study. So you may recall an EXPEDITION 1 and 2, most of the drug impact appeared to occur after week 40. And so what you want is enough patients with at least that exposure, to conduct the appropriate statistical analysis. On the other hand, if the study enrolled very quickly, it wouldn't be so wise to use alpha to take that look. I think our current situation for -- as investors know, is that the study's enrolling quite well. And so we're not in a position to make a statement about whether we would conduct an interim review or not but those are the considerations we would weigh. And some time next year, we'll have something to say about that. Peter J. Johnson: Great. Thanks, Dave. Before we go to the next caller, I'm sure that our Chief Accounting Officer, Donald Zakrowski, is listening, so I do want to go ahead and just set expectations. When we provide guidance on January 7, we will still have to make high-level assumptions about how we'll allocate purchase price and what the financial impact will be to both reported and non-GAAP results for 2015. It'll be later in the year that we'll actually be able to finalize those numbers, so you should expect that there could be some variance. Hopefully, it's not very large but some variance on specific line items or the amount of purchase price allocated to intangibles that are being amortized. So again, we'll do a great job I'm sure, with our accounting group, to get as close as we possibly can for our guidance but you may see some variability as we go through the year and finalize the accounting for the transaction. Operator : We'll go to the line of Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregory B. Gilbert - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I have a few. First, emerging markets growth was quite strong. Is that based on early benefits from your new commercial model or are there other factors we should be aware of that might be shorter term in nature on the pipeline? How is the base inhibitor from AstraZeneca different from your prior experience and perhaps, from Merck's approach? And lastly, on your PCSK9, Jan, you indicated you would assess to see whether it could be best-in-class. Are you setting the bar that high because of the expense or could you shed some more light on what you think about your PCSK9 inhibitor base and what you've seen to date, and what's sort of the go, no go decision it will be based upon? Peter J. Johnson: Chito, we'll have you take the first one on the emerging markets growth. And then Jan, if you'll the base and PCSK9. And Dave, if you have any comments to add to the PCSK9, feel free to do that as well. Chito? Alfonso G. Zulueta: Good to have the first question for the emerging markets for the year. So delighted to have the question. We're obviously thrilled to see the strong growth for the quarter and year-to-date. Let me make sure everybody understands so that a part of that strong growth is driven by a tender that we won for Humulin in Brazil, and a few one-time items with regards to China and our anti-infectives business. The underlying business is growing at around 8% to 9%, solid growth. The key drivers again would be China, really our diabetes business; strong growth in Latin America and pockets within the Middle East. Our fastest growing product, if you exclude Humulin because of the tender, is actually Forteo which is growing at 24%, 25% year-to-date. We think there's a lot more opportunity there but so is Humalog. So with the diabetes opportunity in China and emerging markets, Humalog is growing over 20%. I think it's early to say that the actual new commercial model is having an impact. Clearly, I'm seeing across all our affiliates, that the move to nontraditional, non-salesforce alternative channels is taking shape where we're seeing a significant growth in our interactions with customers using the digital channels which I think are, from our perspective, more effective and in fact, more efficient. Peter J. Johnson: Thank you. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg: Okay. The base inhibitor from AstraZeneca is also an oral compound and it's a nonselective base 1, base 2 agent which is similar then to our previous agents and also the Merck inhibitor now in Phase III. This agent has Phase I data, showing a dramatic a beta [ph] lowering in cerebrospinal fluid which is a good indication there are no target engagement in the CNF. But what we need now is longer exposure data in patients in Phase II before starting Phase III, to exclude that we see similar effects as we had on the liver or potentially other side effects, remembering that this class needs a strong safety component. We are very encouraged by the data we have seen so far. But again, we need longer safety exposures before we can start Phase III. In relation to PCSK9, I think we are all very enthusiastic about this class based on initial Phase III data from several competitors, including some preliminary data on positive mace [ph] outcomes. Therefore, for us, I think being behind, we will have a very high hurdle on this agent looking at what is the LDL lowering efficacy, how long is the duration of effect and what about injection convenience, the volume and the regiment and so on. And we have not yet made those evaluations. Operator : We'll go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : First question just has to do with your gross margin going forward. On your insulin lines in particular, there's some ongoing manufacturing changes that you're making to improve the efficiency of your production of your insulins. When you benchmark ourselves against your competitors, how much of an improvement do you think we might be able to see on the gross margin line from that and the timing of that as it filters through? Second question. In autoimmune, it would appear that you have a couple of assets there that could be ideally positioned to compete in somewhat highly competitive markets. How should we be thinking about an autoimmune buildout and the implications of that for 2015? And then just the last question on Alimta. Any update in Europe on either the German or the U.K. appeals? Peter J. Johnson: So we'll cycle among the 3 business unit Presidents. Enrique, if you take the first question, the gross margin for insulin; Dave, for the commercial support for Autoimmune platform going forward; and then Sue, if you'd like to handle the European situation for the Alimta challenges. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno: So improving our gross margin for an insulin portfolio I think, is critical to us. We are in the process of executing our insulin technical agenda to be able to do that. What we have shared in terms of the benefits and improvement is that we should start seeing some benefit, but it's limited in '15 and more fully in 2016. Over time, because of learning curves and so forth, we do expect this to be very significant, and we have shared that our gross margin for insulin should improve by several percentage points over time. So a very important initiative for us and also is one that gives us flexibility when we look at our facility as being able to produce different types of insulins. So important initiative and we are very much on track to deliver what we've been expecting. Peter J. Johnson: Dave? David A. Ricks: We're obviously very excited about our possibilities in autoimmune. I would point out that each of the products have their own marketplace. And so although they may fit into a therapeutic area that's quite broad, we'll be competing against different products in each case. We've announced in the quarter last quarter, Ixekizumab's data and we're very pleased with the fact that it met all of the 10 points in a very strong way. We are working extremely hard right now to get that submission to the FDA in the first half of 2015, and we're encouraged by the possibilities for the IL-17 class, but also about the possibility for us to have a differentiated product within that class, and really successfully be able to move patients to the possibility of complete clearance of plaque psoriasis which is -- or a significant portion of them, which is what we understand patients want. The buildout for that business is, as I mentioned on a previous question, not as significant in terms of people and organization but is significant in terms of the capabilities. So the company is hiring from the outside, we're building medical infrastructure, patient support infrastructure as well as selling resource. To do that, we plan to be completely prepared to compete with the strongest players in the psoriasis sector at the time of launch. Baricitinib, we anticipate data soon. And I think as Derica mentioned, we will likely have a top line release on the first study over the next few months. And this also will be in a very competitive space in RA. We see baricitinib as a potentially disruptive technology in that space and one in which we could really change expectations for the treatment of RA for many patients. We'll wait for the data of course which will further inform our strategy. But we will also compete effectively in areas of medical sales and patient support across that product and plan to play to win in RA, assuming the data supports a submission for baricitinib. Peter J. Johnson: Thanks Dave. Sue? Susan Mahony : With regards to the Alimta patent situation in Europe, as a reminder, the European patent office ruled in our favor in terms of validity, and that is being appealed. We still do not have a date for hearing with regards to that. On the infringement, the German case that was ruled for us is being appealed and a date has been set for March of next year. And in the U.K. where the English high court ruled against us, and that covers France, Italy and Spain, that is also being appealed with a date set for March of next year. Operator : We'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Two questions. Lilly's 2014 guidance range implies Q4 EPS from down 8 to up 3. Why are you still guiding to such a large range with only 9 weeks left in the year and why didn't you choose to tighten the range today? And the second question is on the base inhibitor. There would seem to be 3 possible reasons why you did this deal with Astra. The first is that you fear that Merck is too far ahead of your own preclinical candidate, the second is that you see some weakness in the Merck agent, or the third is that you need a base to combine with your other agents internally. Any thoughts on which of those is most likely? Peter J. Johnson: We'll have Derica take your first question and then Dave, if you want to take lead maybe on the base inhibitor question. Jan, feel free to chime in as well. Derica? Derica W. Rice: Steve, we left the guidance range unchanged, essentially to say that our business in totality and aggregate we see as being unchanged at this stage. We did modify some of the line items. As you saw, we raised the bottom end of our R&D, we lowered the top end of SG&A but in total, we believe that our total OpEx will stay about in line with what we expected for the year. And then likewise, we're dealing with some of the top line headwinds as it relates to rate when you think about our outlook for the remainder of the year. So overall, we felt comfortable with the guidance range that we had. There was nothing behind -- anything beyond that to read into it -- no change to our EPS guidance range. Peter J. Johnson: Thanks Derica. Dave? David A. Ricks: Steve, to answer the question on the base deal, we're very excited about the collaboration with Astra, not only because we like the asset, we like the space but also we get a very complementary type of alliance with Astra Zeneca on this. You mentioned 3 reasons why we might be interested, I think those are all good reasons, there may be a few others. This product is clearly ahead of our own internal efforts, given the setback we had in 2013 on our own clinical stage program. It is different in terms of the approach to base inhibition from a chemistry perspective, so that's a good thing. With Merck's program we, of course, watch that carefully. We do think there's opportunity for differentiation and a best-in-class approach even if it's not first-in-class. And as Jan mentioned previously, we are excited by -- I would say we anticipate that combination therapy, particularly anti-body, small molecule combinations in the treatment of Alzheimer's will become the norm. And so having all these -- as many of these mechanisms is possible is probably a good thing for combination studies and offering more value to our customers. So amongst these 3, it's really all of the above, Steve. They're all good reasons to do this deal and we're excited by it. We have an aggressive plan for development and we'll give you further updates into next year on that. Enrique A. Conterno: And just a final comment on tanezumab [ph] which, as you probably know, have genetic validation where people in Iceland and who have some mutation in this base cleavage cycle of APP actually are protected against dementia and live very long. So I think that seems to be very attractive options they may make. Operator : We'll go to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : So first, Derica, can you be a little bit more specific on the percent of the gross margin benefit from FX versus the plant shutdown delay? I presume that the plant shutdown delay would then kind of recur or be delayed into the -- 2015. Just trying to get a sense of what the magnitude of that difference would be and if that would be a repeat delay or if it's something that you would expect then to kind of -- it's shifted to 2015 and then it's shifted again to 2016, so really, there's just a benefit this year but we need to kind of anticipate a differential but not a double hit in 2015. Second question. In terms of your expectations for U.S. coverage and access relative to Trulicity. I was just hoping that you could give us a little bit of color on your hopes for overall access, unrestricted access and Medicare coverage. For Dave, the key differentiating features of Xeljanz just versus Xeljanz with baricitinib that are hoped for in the product profile. And then lastly, for Susan, maybe ramu approval. It's possible that we could see second line lung approval in the fourth quarter this year. How should we think about the pace of uptake, the percentage of second line lung patients likely eligible for therapy and the duration of a real-world therapy in that context? Peter J. Johnson: I think I've got that down, Seamus. So we've got the percent gross margin benefit coming from FX versus the shutdown. We'll have Derek obviously handle that one. So then the U.S. access outlook for Trulicity, Enrique; Zelgan versus baricitinib profiles, Dave; and then Sue, the ramucirumab approvals, some of your thoughts on the pace of uptake and the percent it'd be eligible in the second line. Derica? Derica W. Rice: Seamus, in regards to our gross margin revised guidance for the remainder of the year, what's -- the primary driver is the benefit or the FX benefit. So we get a top line headwind but we get a tailwind in terms of the cost of sales impact when you include the FX impact on the inventories expected to be sold during that period. As it relates to the shutdown, it is a benefit in this year. We do expect to be more on a normal cycle next year so this is we would view as a kind of a one-time movement. So we wouldn't expect to see 2015 shutdowns being -- scheduled shutdowns being pushed out. Peter J. Johnson: Thanks, Derica. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno: Seamus, I wouldn't be able to give you what our access goals are for Trulicity but I will share once again, that as we look at the diabetes space, regardless of class as we -- and regardless of order, what we basically see is that about in about 50% of the commercial space, we are able to get access maybe with the higher co-pay but it is access. And we believe that we can very much compete in that space and most companies can. In about 25% of that space, you have step edits. In some cases, in the GLP-1 class, this is going to be a step edit over GLP-1. So you have to be in a GLP-1 before you could maybe go on the new GLP-1 that is launching, in this particular case, Trulicity. And in about 25% of the commercial markets, there's really no coverage until basically the P&T makes a formal decision to be able to do that. On Medicare, on Part D, I think the situation is different because of the schedules. And while we are working to try to get coverage some time in 2015, I think the discussions are typically around 2016 coverage for Part D and whether we can maybe accelerate that into 2015. I have to say that we have been having discussions with payers around Trulicity and I do believe that we have a very strong value proposition, and that's basically what our payors are sharing with us. Peter J. Johnson: Thank you, Enrique. Dave? David A. Ricks: Thanks for the question. Obviously, the big caveat on all this is we need to see the Phase III data from our program and we're looking forward to that first study toplining here in the next several months. Which as a reminder, the TNF-IR study, so these will be refractory patients to TNF therapy, there's a complete program which also spans pre-biologic patients as well as a head-to-head against humira [ph] which is our structure study and it's fully powered for noninferiority. So one feature that could be different from tofacitinib is the clinical program. We built this program, looking at our own Phase II data but also what they had conducted. And we are optimistic that it will yield the kind of label, should these studies demonstrate the effect that we saw in Phase II, it will be very competitive in the RA market for us. Of course also, we have a difference. Although they're both JAK inhibitors we have different receptor activity. We are selective that JAK1/JAK2 pathway where tofacitinib is not, it's a pan JAK inhibitor, this may manifest in different side effects or effects. And again, the clinical program will have to bear that out. Recall as well that we are very happy with our dose, our ability to select the dose that yielded a very significant efficacy result that was published in our Phase II studies. Really with the side effect profile that we think is quite appropriate for the RA patients and competitive with biologics, yielding the possibility of an oral medicine with biologic-like efficacy. And so head-to-head comparisons haven't been conducted but for instance, if we look at our competition which is unable to gain EMA approval really based on lack of effect at the 5 milligram dose, we think that could also be different. Ultimately in this class for early uptake as well, the overall safety profile emerging from the Phase III program will be essential to look at. We don't have that data in front of us but have been conducting regular data monitoring committee meetings and have been pleased that there haven't been any changes made to the program. So we'll wait for our data to come out. The way we designed this was to have a differentiated profile and really be able to present to the market, something that could change expectations for patients who suffer from RA. Peter J. Johnson: Thanks, Dave. Sue? Susan Mahony : Seamus, with regards to Cyramza, clearly we're very happy to not only have a positive Phase III study with Cyramza in second line lung cancer, but also get priority review. So we are hoping that we'll get an action by the end of this year and be ready to launch next year. Regarding uptake, clearly, I can't give you full details of that but I will say a few things. Firstly, this is the first agent to show a benefit in a broad patient subset, both in the squamous and the non-squamous in second line setting. And we have a good experience with thoracic oncology with Alimta in first line and this would now be in broad-based second line. So we're excited by the opportunity that we've got with this agent in the second line setting and clearly, our plan is to ensure that we have a successful launch. Operator : We'll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : John, you've been quiet on this call, I have a question for you. On the last earnings call, a lot of us asked you whether or not you're interested in a tax inversion deal and in hindsight, very smartly, you said you weren't. And congratulations, it's been a mess out there. But I'm just curious what your Washington folks are telling you about prospects for corporate tax reform. With the midterm election in a couple of weeks, looks like prospects for Republicans to gain control of the Senate look pretty promising; who knows, it's pretty close. But just what -- how should we think about potential changes to tax reform which will even the playing field for U.S. companies relative to foreign enterprises? John C. Lechleiter: Jami, up to this point, I've been delegating effectively here, but you got me. I think on tax reform, obviously a lot depends on what happens in November and some of the subsequent dynamics and of course, what else is happening in this crazy world we live in. I think I can say and then our guys in Washington would say, we're cautiously optimistic that the next 2 years will bring about some sort of meaningful tax reform. I've never seen an issue where I go around and talk to people in both parties and everybody's in agreement that we've got a lousy system now that makes American companies less competitive. People seem to agree on the fact that we need a lower rate and that a territorial system of some kind would make sense. There's not unanimity on that but I think there's -- you get a fair degree of alignment. And then we get into the details and that's where the devil is. I mean, some companies are capital-intensive, some are R&D-intensive. Some have the bulk of their operations here, some like Lilly are sort of equally divided between the U.S. and o U.S. So I don't think there's a necessarily easy answer, even if we all agree that the status quo really doesn't represent sound policy and doesn't really put the U.S. on the best possible footing to be competitive. So we're going to keep pushing for it, we're going to keep talking about it and as I say, I think there -- I believe there is a window over the next 2 years and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, not just Lilly, really beating on this drum as well, Jami. Operator : We'll go to the line of Vamil Divan. Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So just a couple more on the base inhibitor which we've discussed quite a bit already. But one is just a very simple question. I don't understand why you guys listed on Phase I on your slideshow and your pipeline, I think, was Slide, 14, when there's already a Phase II/III study that's ongoing that you guys talked about, at least the Phase II part has already started. So just a simple question there. And then my other question just related to that study. I couldn't tell from reading the description if you guys are actually using your amyloid imaging agent to screen patients, at least those who might have mild AD for entry in this study. And if you could just clarify if you are or not? And if not, why not? And then one other quick one, if I could, on the diabetes side with the basal insulin peglispro. It's obviously the top line release you guys put out earlier, but if you can just give us a sense at this point, now that you've seen some of the Phase III data internally, what group of patients do you think would be the best candidate for that drug? Especially given some of the side effects we're seeing there on the triglycerides and some of the changes in HDL and LDL. Peter J. Johnson: I'll go ahead and take your first one the phase of development for the base inhibitor. Dave, if you'd like to take the second question on the trial itself; and then Enrique, for basal insulin peglispro. So I believe both AstraZeneca and Lilly follow a similar process for calling something a Phase II asset, and that's when the first efficacy dose, the first dose of the drug is actually administered to a patient. We do expect that will happen in the near term. Just recently, that trial has started to screen patients. Should they pass those screens and after a certain period, they will receive their first dose. So it should not be too long into the future, you will see that formally change, I think, for both Astra and Lilly, to show us a Phase II asset. Dave? David A. Ricks: There are many design features in the Phase II/III program. We've incorporated learnings from our past failures and observations and disease modification in Alzheimer's. Among those include screening patients for the presence of amyloid plaque. There are many other things and this is I think why the collaboration makes sense for AstraZeneca and us, to harvest those learnings and build that into a base program, and ultimately, try to maximize the probability of success. So, yes, we're conducting screenings on these patients. Enrique A. Conterno: Well, when it comes to our basal insulin peglispro, we have conducted our studies across type 1 and type 2, nice patients switching from glargine and also in combination with mealtime insulin and so forth. And so we have a wide spectrum of studies. I think consistently, what we have seen is superiority when it comes to hemoglobin A1c. And as you mentioned triglycerides, we are encouraged. I think when we look at some of the CV data in terms of -- and what we have shared so far is that we have already excluded -- when we look at our trials, we have already excluded the 1.3 hazard ratio and that our observed hazard ratio when it comes to the CV event is basically below 1. So we are pretty excited in terms of what this product would offer patients now. Specifically to your question, how does the benefit would vary across different patient types, I think is a discussion that we can have when we basically disclose the detailed data at ADA. Peter J. Johnson: As we're reaching the bottom of the hour, if there are callers still in the queue, the IR team will get back to you shortly. For those of you who have additional questions, do feel free to call us during the day. We're happy to help with your questions. John, would you close the call, please? John C. Lechleiter: Sure. Thanks, Phil. To all those on the call, we thank you for your continued interest in our company and for your support. As we near the end of our journey through years YZ, I'm extremely proud that we have executed on our strategy and delivered on the commitments we shared with you nearly 5 years ago. We remain convinced that our strategy is the right one for Lilly in order to create value for patients, physicians, payors and our shareholders. And our ability to execute so far gives us increasing confidence in our future prospects. As always, we will keep you apprised of our progress. Thanks again, everyone.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chairman, President and CEO, John Lechleiter. Please go ahead, sir. John Lechleiter : Thank you, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us to discuss Eli Lilly and Company's fourth quarter 2014 earnings. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As usual, I'll begin by highlighting key events that have occurred since last quarter's call. Following FDA approval in September, we launched Trulicity in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. We also received regulatory approval for Trulicity in Europe. We\u2019re in the process of launching in the U.K. and Germany and anticipate launches in additional EU countries over the course of this year and next. In diabetes, we also resubmitted Humalog U-200 KwikPen in the U.S. and along with Boehringer Ingelheim we received approval in Japan for both Jardiance and our insulin glargine product. In oncology, Cyramza was approved by the European commission for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and by the FDA for two new indications second line non-small cell lung cancer and advanced gastric cancer in combination with paclitaxel. Enabled by a fast track designation, we also completed the rolling FDA submission for necitumumab in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And we submitted necitumumab to European regulators for the same indication. On the clinical front along with Incyte, we announced that baricitinib met the primary end point of improved ACR20 response compared to placebo in the Phase 3 RA-BEACON study in patients with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who previously failed one or more TNF inhibitors. The study included a high percentage of patients who would also receive prior treatment with one or several non anti TNF biologic agents. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2/3 AMARANTH study of AZD3293, an oral BACE inhibitor being studied for Alzheimer's disease. Earlier this month, we presented Phase 3 data ASCO-GI from the RAISE trial evaluating Cyramza in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In this trial, Ramucirumab prolonged both progression free and overall survival. And we began the second Phase 3 trial abemaciclib in breast cancer as well as a Phase 3 trial in lung cancer. On the business development front, we announced a pair of immuno-oncology collaborations. One with Bristol-Myers Squibb to study their PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo with  galunisertib, our TGF-beta kinase inhibitor, in a Phase 1/2 study in patients with glioblastoma, hepatocellular and non-small cell lung cancers. The other was Merck to study their PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda at a Phase 2 study with Alimta in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer and in Phase 1/2 studies with Cyramza in gastric, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer, as well as with necitumumab in non-small cell long cancer. We also announced a worldwide licensing collaboration with Adocia focused on developing an ultra-rapid insulin known as BioChaperone Lispro, for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim announced changes to our diabetes collaboration; the companies will continue co-promotion work in 17 countries, representing over 90% of the collaboration's anticipated market opportunity. While in the other countries, the companies will exclusively commercialize the molecules they brought to the collaboration. And finally on January 1st, we completed the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. In another news of note, we increased our quarterly dividend by 2% to $0.50 per share and we repurchased $300 million of stock in the fourth quarter of 2014 under our outstanding $5 billion share repurchase programs leaving $3.7 billion remaining. I would also highlight that the total cash distribution to shareholders in 2014 was nearly $3 billion. Now, I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance in the quarter. Phil Johnson : Thanks, John. And Tom with AT&T, if you could check, we should be the only line as open at this time, we're getting quite a bit of feedback if you could sure that other lines are close, we\u2019ll appreciate it. Thank you. First, I'll review our GAAP results and then I'll discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some additional insights into the underlying trends in our business. Keep in mind that our 2014 non-GAAP measures include the expense associated with amortization of intangibles. As discussed on our January 7th call, our 2015 guidance however excludes this expense. When we report Q1 2015 actual results in April, we\u2019ll provide you with 2014 by quarter, restated for removal of amortization of intangibles, and if we had acquired Novartis Animal Health on January 1, 2014. As we report our results during 2015, this should provide a meaningful view of the trends in our business. On Slide 8, you can see the revenue in Q4 was $5.1 billion. This represents a decrease of 12% compared to Q4 2013 driven by reduction of over $500 million in U.S. Cymbalta and of nearly 200 million in U.S. Evista. Recall that we lost Evista facility for Cymbalta in December 2013 and Evista in March 2014. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue was essentially flat as underlying performance growth was offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 60 basis points, driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold. This quarter foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold had a positive impact on our gross margin. However, in Q4 of 2013 there was a negative impact on our gross margin. Excluding this FX effect from both 2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined from 77.0% in Q4 2013 to 73.9% in Q4 2014. As in past quarters, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. Non-GAAP measures are shown on Slide 9. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A declined by 13% or nearly $450 million compared to Q4 of 2013. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 8% while R&D declined 20%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to reduction in sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts and to lesser extent foreign exchange. The reduction in R&D expense was driven by lower late stage clinical development costs. Other income and expense was income of $45 million in Q4 2014, compared to income of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. This increase was due to larger gains on investments. Our tax rate was 14%, a decrease of 6.5 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease includes recognition in the fourth quarter of 2014 of the full year U.S. R&D tax credit. At the bottom line, net income was flat while earnings per share increased 1% reflecting the benefit of share repurchases. Turning to full year results shown on Slide 10, revenue decreased 15%. Now, to place this in perspective, this equates to year-on-year reduction in revenue of $3.5 billion. U.S., Cymbalta and Evista decline by a total of $4.1 billion while FX reduced revenue by over $350 million. These reductions were partially offset by performance growth in the rest of our business of nearly $1 billion or over 5% primarily by insulins, our animal health business, Cialis, Alimta, Forteo, OUS Cymbalta, Trajenta and Cyramza. Full year revenue totaled just over $19.6 billion or about 400 million less than the minimum we targeted starting back in 2009. Gross margin declined nearly four percentage points due to loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and to a lesser extent Evista. And to reductions and spend behind Cymbalta and Evista, lower late stage clinical development costs and significant ongoing productivity efforts total operating expenses decreased 11% or over $1.4 billion as R&D expenses declined nearly 800 million and SG&A expenses declined more than $600 million. Finally looking at the bottom line, despite 400 million less topline revenue than we targeted, we nearly met our 3 million minimum net income goal posting non-GAAP net income of $2.988 billion and EPS of $2.78. While not shown here, when we issued our 10-K you\u2019ll see that we also exceeded our goal of $4 billion in operating cash flow. Our full year result reflects successful execution of our strategy for managing one of the industry's most challenging series of patent expirations. Driving growth in Japan, emerging markets and Elanco, and in brands not losing patent protection. Replenishing and advancing our pipeline and reducing our cost structure and increasing productivity across our business, to fund the R&D necessary to fuel our future growth. Slide 11, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. Let's take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue. On Slide 12, in the yellow box on the middle of the page, you can see the total revenue decline of 12% in Q4 2014 was driven by a negative volume impact of 9% and a negative foreign exchange impact of 4% partially offset by favorable price impact of 1%. The negative foreign exchange impact is larger than we've seen in recent years and was driven by the strengthening of the US Dollar against many developed and emerging markets currencies. By geography, you will notice that U.S. revenue decreased 22% driven by volume. This was due to loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, EUS pharma revenue increased 5%. I would note that this year, we extended our shipping to wholesalers until December 30, resulting in lower wholesale inventory build this year end. In Australia, Canada, and Europe, or ACE, you will see a negative 7% rate impact drove the overall 4% decline in revenue. While on a constant currency or performance basis, ACE revenue increased 3%. In Japan, pharma revenue decreased 10% driven by the weaker Yen. On a performance basis, our Japanese pharma revenue increased 2%. Growth this quarter was negatively affected by the timing of Cymbalta shipments to our marketing partner Shinogi, as well as by volatility we have seen in customer purchases over the course of 2014 due to increases in the consumption tax. Turning to emerging markets, we saw mid-single-digit performance growth driven by volume growth of 7%. As a result of the significant negative effect of FX, our reported emerging markets revenue declined 3% versus last year. Elanco Animal Health delivered revenue growth of 9%. Excluding FX, Elanco grew 12%. This performance growth was driven by OUS animal products, including the acquisition of Lohmann, as well as OUS companion animal products and US food animal products. This was partially offset by a continued decline in the US companion animal product sales, principally Comfortis. Moving to Slide 13, you will see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2014 results. For the four year 2014, FX had a modest negative effect at both the top and bottom line. For the quarter however, we saw a larger effect, and one that differed at the top and bottom lines. As I mentioned earlier, FX was a topline headwind, reducing revenue in US Dollars by four percentage points. In terms of cost of good sold, FX provided a substantial benefit which led FX providing a modest tailwind benefit for operating income and EPS. Excluding FX, you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in fourth quarter declined 4% while including FX, EPS grew 1%. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica Rice : Thanks Phil. Slide 14 shows our pipeline as of January 23. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrow showing progression and red arrow showing attrition. You will see that necitumumab has moved into the regulatory review column, following submissions in the U.S. and Europe. And as John mentioned, Phase 2 testing began for AZD3293, the base inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease that we are developing with AstraZeneca. And in Phase 1, we initiate human testing of a small molecule base inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease. We also began Phase 1 testing of two biologics, one for diabetic complications and one for hypoglycemia. And we terminated development of a Phase 1 biologic for anemia. Next, let me provide a recap of how key event played out in 2014. I'll remind you of our key events for 2015 and quickly review our 2015 financial guidance. Slide 15 is the slide we provided you in January of last year to track our progress against these milestones. As you can see from the preponderance of green check marks, we made significant advances in our pipeline in 2014. These advances included major progress on eight new molecular entities. Approval and launch of three new products, Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity, approval of our insulin glargine product, submission of necitumumab, and positive Phase 3 trial readouts for Basal insulin peglispro for diabetes, Ixekizumab for psoriasis, and baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis. 2014 was a very productive year for advancement of our pipeline and we expect 2015 to provide more of the same. On Slide 16 list keep events to watch for in 2015. And we will update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you monitor our progress. Since I've discussed this with a detail on our January 7th call, I will not go through each item again today. However, it\u2019s clear from this list of key event that 2015 will be another important year for execution of our innovation based strategy and we are excited for what we believe the year may bring. We know it's unreasonable to expect all of these potential events to be positive. However, we believe it\u2019s very possible that a significant majority will break our way and solidify our near to medium term growth prospects. Turning to our 2015 guidance, we have updated the guidance we provided on January 7th to reflect current FX rates. That is the only item prompting these changes. Now before I step through this specific line item changes, I would like to provide some high level thought on the impact to us both this year and moving forward. On our call in early January, we provided a full P&L impact of FX to our 2015 results. Now this included a topline revenue headwind of about 2.5% or $500 million and a bottom line EPS headwind of about $0.03. At the current FX rate, the revenue headwind for 2015 will be more like 6% to 7% and the EPS headwind would be about $0.07 per share, not the $0.03 we shared earlier this month. Now as we discussed before, the FX effect on international inventory sold that flows through cost of sales provides a short term offset to the underlying operational impact of FX. The $0.07 EPS headwind I mentioned is in fact comprise of an unfavorable operational FX effect of about $0.57 largely offset by favorable FX effect on international inventory sold of about $0.50. Should FX rate remain stable, this cost of sales benefit would go away as we sell the existing inventory will likely be nil in 2016. So we do experience the same, the exact same operational FX effect throughout our P&L as some of our peers and other U.S. multi nationals. Difference in some however, the FX effect on cost of sales means that the full effect of FX does not show up immediately in on our P&L. We will see part of it this year and the remainder next year. Now turning to the individual line items, you can see on Slide 17, the FX has caused us to reduce revenue by $800 million, increase our gross margin percent by 1.5 percentage points, reduce marketing, selling and administrative expenses by about $200 million and reduce research and development expenses by $100 million. As I mentioned earlier, if current FX rates hold for the full year, EPS would be reduced by about $0.04 per share from our prior assumptions and we have adjusted our outlook accordingly. However, as our outlook still falls within our existing GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges, these ranges and guidance remain unchanged. Hopefully, this additional color is helpful as you think about how FX may affect our result. Also keep in mind that our 2015 GAAP guidance does not include the $200 million payment that we will make to Pfizer if the FDA removes tanezumab from partial clinical hold, and we move forward with the Phase 3 development. And it is based on our current estimate for how we'll account for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition and which could change based upon revise estimates and final accounting treatment. And as I mentioned earlier, 2015 guidance for non-GAAP measures excludes amortization of intangibles, as well as the other items listed on Slide 24. In summary, we enter 2015 having successfully navigated through the most significant period of patent expiration in our history. Over the past five years, we delivered on our financial commitment, we advanced our pipeline and what we build what we believe is a sustainable R&D engine. Again in 2014, we made excellent progress implementing our innovation based strategy. Not only did we advance our pipeline but we also significantly reduced costs and increased productivity. Throughout the balance of this decade, we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins. Bolstered by the recent acquisition of Novartis Animal Health, we have a solid base business and we intend to build on that base with a first wave of new product launches in diabetes, oncology and immunology followed by second wave of potential launches in cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, pain and oncology. And as John mentioned on our 2015 guidance call, going forward you will see us sharpen our focus on areas where we are best positioned to compete and win. And continue to look for ways to increase productivity and do the work of pharmaceutical R&D better. We enter this post-patent period in a position of strength and we are very optimistic about the opportunity before us to improve patient's lives and create value for shareholders.  Now this concludes our prepared remarks. Now I will turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil Johnson : Thanks Derica. Given the 90 minutes we allot for the overall call, and the relatively brief prepared remarks, we do have quite a bit of time for Q&A but it would be great and appreciated if you limit your questions to two or three. If you have additional ones feel free to rejoin the queue later. Tom if you could provide the instructions for the Q&A caller please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. So, I have three questions. First, with respect to the sola extension study data readout ahead, could you just please characterize that? And discuss your level of enthusiasm for that data? Second, with respect to tanezumab, you were expecting to restart Phase 3 this year. Should we expect a readout in 2016 or 2017 from that? And then finally, Derica, it would be great if you could just explain once again -- and I know you have before -- but why your FX tends to lag peers? And just in terms of the accounting, whether there is an international cost of goods accounting difference? That would be helpful in just putting it in perspective. Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great Dave. Thank you for the questions. We'll have Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines handle the first two on solanezumab and tanezumab and Derica obviously be FX question. Dave? Dave Ricks : Hi, Dave. Thanks for the question. On the solanezumab extension just a remainder we have a 24-month period where we are measuring patient's who all rolled off expedition one and two into drug treatment at their choice of course. In that data we do expect to come out in the near future because it's not published or announced I can't really elaborate on what's inside that but again we are looking for evidence of a disease modifying effect in that patients who were started on sola coming off placebo. Don't catch up to those that had sola all along. And so with that sort of guidance of what we are looking for, we wait for the data to be published in the future. On tanezumab we are hoping to have the class and tanezumab remove from clinical trial hold this year and initiate Phase 3 studies as Derica mentioned. We have not posted those studies or their design yet, so it would be premature to comment on when they'd be completing read out but I would guide you to say it's probably beyond 16 Dave. Derica Rice : And David, as regards to the FX effect on international inventory sold, recall that our inventory turns in Lilly is about 12 months. And so if you take back as we build the inventory during the period where the dollar was at a weaker level, or the euro and the yen was at a higher level, those inventories went on our balance sheet as we sell those inventories into the marketplace. Those inventories get revalued at current exchange rate and that benefit or that differential flows through P&L at that point in time. So in the case scenario we're looking at today, where the dollars has been strengthening, it comes to us as a benefit. You've seen in prior periods when the rate was going the other way when foreign currencies were strengthening against the US dollars and you were seeing a negative effect or an unfavorable effect flowing through our P&L through cost of goods sold. Phil Johnson : Thanks Derica. Tom, next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Greg Gilbert : Thanks. Good morning. First, on Trulicity, you have been very bullish on the opportunity in the past, given the ideal mix of attributes. So I was hoping you could give us some early metrics on launch success, beyond the simple IMS-type of data we all see. And then secondly, for John, what are senior management team's and your most important corporate objectives in 2015? Aside from the typical meeting or exceeding of the financial metrics you have provided? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Thanks Greg. Enrique, for the first question please. Enrique Conterno : On Trulicity, we have to keep in mind that in mid-November we launched this product in the U.S. to specialist, specialist roughly represent about 30% of the market opportunity. We are in the process of launching as we speak in primary care right now, and as I have shared in the past, for us it is critical that we basically expand the GLP 1 market. We believe that Trulicity can be an important catalyst for the overall growth of the GLP 1 class. So we basically have to wait for that. In terms of metric that we actually look at specific to our near, medium and long term objectives are looking at the breadth of prescribing when we look at Trulicity. So we want to make sure that there is a strong breadth of prescribing in particular among primarily care customers. John Lechleiter : Greg, hi, this is John. Thanks for your question. I think I would say three things in terms of what we\u2019ve thought the senior management team has talked about around the table. Number one is to launch well - we\u2019ve launched three products last year Cyramza, Jardiance and Trulicity. We have within 12 month window an opportunity to launch others potential our insulin glargine product, necitumumab. We have other filings in the work. So this is \u2013 we're exercising that launch muscle now and I think that's something we\u2019re acutely focused on. Secondly to renew our pipeline, we've paid particular attention to putting the company in the position where we do not have to go through the boom and bust cycle, that's characterize the last 10 years. We're very focused on our Phase 1 molecule enteries on progression from Phase 2 to Phase 3 and ensuring that those molecules are high quality and substantially derisk by the time we get to Phase 3. And finally I would say improving productivity. We work and operate a very competitive world. We're in growing but very competitive classes and I think learning to operate across our business and ways that respond to the increased demands of our customer and the competitive pressures is something that's on our desk everyday and we're driving with the new conviction. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. Tom, next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A few questions, please. You have several drugs for diabetes, either in the pipeline or that have recently been approved. This includes your new GLP 1, your insulin glargine, your novel basal, and empagliflozin, and then various iterations of those products. Of the four that I have just listed, which one product excites you the most, in terms of the future commercial potential, let's say, five years out? And then a second question. I would love to hear how you think the commercial rollout of your version of insulin glargine will play out, both in Europe and the US? Ignoring any of the legal challenges that are being mounted against you. I know you can't really comment on price specifically, but can you confirm that, generally speaking, price is really the only selling point with a product like this? And therefore, you will likely price it at whatever it takes to compel payers and prescribers to get on board? And then last, third question, is just on Alimta. You mentioned price erosion in the US. It's not clear to me what the driver of that erosion would be? Phil Johnson : Tim thank you for the questions, Enrique can turn for the diabetes will have you handle the first two of the diabetes pipeline assets and insulin glargine and either Sue if you want to look at the U.S. performance and see what explanation you have for his question on Alimta U.S. piece. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Tim, I really believe that I can make a strong case for each one of these products that you have mentioned. We just discussed Trulicity when Greg asked the question about, let's look at Jardiance for a second. We have the EMPA/LINA fixed dose combination coming up. We have a cardiovascular study that we've going to reel out in the middle of the year. Those two are very significant events when we look at the brand. I'll comment on insulin glargine in just a second and then of course we do believe that with our innovative basal insulin peglispro we've been able to show reductions in hemoglobin A1c versus the standard of care in basal insulin therapy which is something that has not been shown before. So I can make very good case for each of these products. We have to basically launch this product and see how they are accepted by our customers. When it comes to insulin glargine, I would say that it priced the only way to compete, I would say no. And I won\u2019t share how we intend to compete when it comes to our commercial rollout but clearly we do have a portfolio of diabetes solutions. We know that diabetes price does play a role, we have the liver devices and we think that we will be able to offer our customers an important alternative when it comes to glargine, with our own insulin glargine product. Derica Rice : And then Tim, on the Alimta U.S. question, we had a very similar very low single digit less price benefit in the quarter like we had in the prior quarters. On various quarters there will be adjustments made for the accruals for rebase and discounts. There is variability and noise in those kinds of adjustments this particular quarter this happens to be negative adjustments relative to Q4 2013 but there's nothing unusual on the underlying trends that we're seeing what we would have in past quarters. Phil Johnson : Tom, next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Salim Syed : This is Salim in for Mark. Thanks for all color. Three questions. One on your CETP. Can you just tell us exactly how we should expect disclosure this year? And if you can just confirm for us that it's just a futility analysis? So the trial cannot be stopped for efficacy? And then just on diabetes, and with all the pricing pressure talks, can you remind us of the net price increases you have been taking? Maybe for 2014 and recently? And if you think that's sustainable going forward? And then on your GLP 1, Dulaglutide, is there -- is -- Novartis obviously made theirs -- at least are trying to develop their in Phase 3 for an oral. Their [sinagatide] [ph] is an oral sinagatide. Is there a reason why you would or should not do the same thing for Dulaglutide? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Thank you for the questions. We\u2019ll have Dave Rick handle the first question on CETP inhibitor and then Enrique your diabetes question. Dave? Dave Rick : Thanks for your question. On Evacetrapib I think we\u2019ve communicated in the past, we do have an event driven futility test which is in the near future, either be in Q1 or early Q2. I want to play down expectations of any great news coming out of that because the futility hurdle is pretty low in that test. So we will be conducting this in a blinded fashion along with a normal periodic safety review. And this is really the last major set of reviews prior to conclusion of the study we hope in early 2016. So when we have to something to say about that, we can elaborate further. Yes, we\u2019ve said in the past, that\u2019s not the kind of analysis, being a futility analysis, that would cause us if it is not met, in other words study continues any kind of press release. So we provide regular updates for example on next quarter's call if it's appropriate on the status of that particular analysis. Enrique Conterno : I assume your questions on the least price increases and net prices refers to our insulin franchise. We have taken least price increases but we also have increased our rebates that we basically - in how we control with the pairs. As we look at the results for Humalog in the U.S., where we basically saw a minus 2 comparing Q4 of 2014 versus Q4 of 2013. A couple of things that I would have you keep in mind yes of course we did have pressure from managed care contracts. But we had two special events in fact in those results. We had wholesale buying patterns, nine points when it comes to Humalog or 9%. And then adjustments due to prior periods, primarily driven by greater utilization in Medicaid and Medicare about seven points. So you can think of those anomalies for the quarter but clearly we do see a highly competitive market when it comes to diabetes. On your question on GLP-1s, whether we are thinking about oral dulaglutide, I cannot comment on our specific class when it comes to GLP-1 but we have expressed that this is an area of interest to us. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Enrique. Tom, next caller please. Operator : Next question is from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Tony Butler : Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. There are two. First is on Cyramza. I am curious if you might be able to provide some color of what you are hearing back in the field in gastric cancer. And second to that question is, have you launched in non-small cell lung, given the recent approval? And if you have, any comments back from the field on that launch would be helpful. And then second, back to solanezumab and EXPEDITION 3, clinic trials [ph] states enrollment continues, and I am just curious on the rate of enrollment? Given, I think, the total number is 2,100 or so. So the question is, is that rate going -- or occurring in a timely fashion to what you would have expected, given that you are looking for individuals who have a positive plaque in the brain? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Tony. So Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncoloy for the first question on Cyramza and then Dave again on solanezumab. Sue Mahony : Regarding Cyramza in the U.S. we\u2019re hearing actually very good feedback on Cyramza in gastric cancer. Q4 sales of Cyramza was $34 million that really is on gastric cancer sales and given that we only had the combination approval towards the end of the year that really is mainly monotherapy. Since these launched to combination study we\u2019re seeing additional use of Cyramza in second-line gastric cancer with paclitaxel. We have NCCN category 1 status now both for the monotherapy and for the combination therapy in gastric cancer. And with regards to the lung indication, we had the privilege, at the end of the last year we literally just launched that, so it's way too early to give you impact on that. But as I mentioned, we're feeling very good about the gastric updates. Dave Ricks : On sola, we remain very encouraged by the enrollment in Expedition-3. I really think Lilly has a best in the industry capability on conducting late phase Alzheimer's studies. And as you pointed out we're through in significant complexity which is the requirement to prove positive amyloid to enter the study in a 100% of patients. But I\u2019m pleased to say I think our last update was we were two-thirds enrolled, we continue to progress to complete enrollment soon. I can't say we will mostly likely beat the enrollment window we saw on Expedition 1 and 2 which was a similar number of patients as reminded that was 22 months. So we would expect the enrollment soon and then of course look for read out in 2016 as we've discussed previously. Phil Johnson : Thanks Dave. Tom, next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with your operating margins. Obviously exiting the period of YZ, your operating margins are in the high teens. If you look across the businesses where you are having greatest amount of launches -- oncology, diabetes -- and you benchmark those businesses against your industry peers, the operating margins of some of those companies are in the high 30s. So when you think about operating margin expansion going forward, can you maybe help us understand or characterize how those businesses are potentially going to be contributing to that? And any color on the magnitude of expansion would be helpful. Second question, on Alimta, Germany/UK. Any update on the patent challenge that's going on there? And then lastly, just on the BioChaperone insulin lispro, if you can possibly characterize the profile of that product? What phase of development, and when you anticipate it might go into clinical? And how it might contrast with the insulin oligo that is being worked on by one of your peers? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Thank you, John. So Derica obviously for your first question the operating margins and then Sue if you comment on the European patent litigation and then Enrique if you will take BioChaperone and Lispro and Jan if you can contribute if you like as well. Derica? Derica Rice : As you know we stated that we expect to get our OpEx as combination of SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales back to that 50% of sales or less by 2018 on a full year basis. While I'm not in a position here on the call to break out the operating margin by business unit, let me just share with you some color as to how we see ourselves improving our margin overtime and provide some examples. So, one of things we\u2019ve talked about is we\u2019re launching in the area of oncology, obviously highly specialized, we believe we have the commercial footprint in place so even if Sue is launching new product and new indications, we believe we can accommodate that within our existing footprint. Likewise the same is true in diabetes as well where while we may be tweaking around the edges there are not any wholesale changes in our commercial footprint and from a sales force standpoint clearly there is the variable marketing spend behind these brands. And then if you look on the manufacturing side, we see ourselves opportunity as we continue to execute and complete the tactical agenda in our insulin business. And from a manufacturing standpoint which enables us to be able to produce the basal insulins that we\u2019re launching in the same facilities today, where we produced our existing insulins in terms of Humulin and Humalog. So therefore we\u2019re getting a more throughput through the same existing manufacturing footprints which should bring down our per unit cost flowing through those facilities. So these are some examples of how we believe we will be able to get increased leverage out of our existing infrastructure which will enable us to grow our OpEx at a slower rate and our cost base at our topline and giving us that positive leverage to return to the historical levels of profitability. Sue Mahony : I actually don't have any update on the European patent situation, the two case is the German and the U.S. case as you know are both being appealed, the hearing for both of those is set for March. So we look to forward being able to provide data on that following those hearings. John Lechleiter : It is requested the Germany and the U.K. case, not U.S. case in March. Susan Mahony : Yeah, thank you. Enrique Conterno : On BioChaperone, this product is already in the clinic. We do have some Phase 1 data and the reason we did a partnership is as we looked both our internal problems as well as what was out there, we felt this was the most compelling assets when we looked at the profile. We are looking for something that is factor-on and factor-off with the benefit that could basically bring including lower rates of hypoglycemia and lower variability when it comes to overall blood glucose. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Enrique. Tom, we can go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have three questions. First, on the evacetrapib interim look, on the Q3 call, I believe the Company said that there are efficacy features to the interim look. Can you give us examples of efficacy features? Are you just looking at HDL and LDL levels? Or are you also looking at trends and efficacy, or events? Secondly, in the PD-1 arena, I am curious as to why Lilly selected the Bristol PD1 for one study, and the Merck PD-1 for three others? Do you see clinical differences in the PD-1's you seek to accentuate? Or was it for financial or competitive reasons? And then lastly, a question for Jeff. There are many emerging modalities in Animal Health. We recently saw approval of the first monoclonal antibody for cancer. As a leader in Animal Health, what emerging modalities does Lilly Animal Health find most interesting? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Thank you for the questions. Dave Evacetrapib please and then Sue for the PD-1 question on the Bristol and Merck collaborations. And then Jeff for the animal health question. Dave? Dave Ricks : On Evacetrapib we do expect an event driven interim look soon this is for futility. As I said before the bar from an efficacy perspective is low really ruling out absolute futility and we will look at major cardiovascular events in that look. But I think we've said before, don't expect a major press release on both sides of that of course if we stop to study for futility we would announce that. Susan Mahony : With regards the trials I wouldn\u2019t lead anything into the number of charts that we got with each company. Basically the decision was made based on the interest of each company at that point in time. We foresee that we\u2019ll continue to have ongoing collaborations in the future with other companies. Again it will depend on our interest and their interest. Jeff Simmons : Great question I think in Elanco we see a few very key spaces going forward in the medium and long term future. Continued animal disease continues to be a problem both at the respiratory and enteric levels, so that covers a couple key classes that we're worried about. So, Bovine respiratory disease continues to be a big challenge. So that\u2019s one space. Second is mastitis continues to be one of the most unmet needs in dairy at this stage and we\u2019re expecting to make a nice innovation launch in that space in the U.S. this year. And then I think the whole area of immune modulation turning the animals immune system and activating it against the disease, versus today when you look at current medications antibiotics et cetera, it's trying to introduce immune modulation. And I think the last one in the pet space is renal failure. It's continuing to be major issue especially the fee line area. So those are some of the big spaces. Pain would be another one as well. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Jeff. Tom, next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for the questions. So a few here. First off, can you talk a little bit about the BioChaperone, and really what needs to be proven to advance this program into Phase 3? The second question, can you also update us on what you are seeing globally in the premix market? How market share is evolving here? And what you seem from a demand perspective, for a once-daily premix product? And then lastly, on the CETP inhibitor, have you evaluated the LDLC reduction using Merck's -- or Merck has published, which is this beta quantitation method. And if so, what did you see, in terms of the LDL reduction capabilities? And if you haven't done that, could you just give us what your estimate is of LDL reduction on top of statins, with the 130 milligram dose that's used in the Phase 3 outcome study? Thanks a lot. Phil Johnson : Thanks Seamus. So Enrique again on BioChaperone, and as well as the premix question with regard what you\u2019re seeing for share market as well as just demand for once daily premix outside of the U.S. it sounds like. And then back to Dave on the CETP inhibitor. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : I won't be able to - Seamus, unfortunately discuss the program that we have for BioChaperone. What you should expect is that we need to make sure that this product is going to be effective in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and we intend to conduct the right clinical studies to ensure that we can have a thoughtful Phase 3 commercial decision. As I mentioned, clearly we already have mealtime insulins in the market, so we need to show some benefits when it comes to differentiation vis-\u00e0-vis what\u2019s already marketed but won\u2019t be able to comment on that because we believe its important competitive information. On the premix market, clearly the premix market has been in many areas of the world declining with exception of emerging markets where we see continued growth of this category. When we look at the share performance Lilly has done fairly well. So we are gaining share in this market whether it\u2019s in U.S., whether it\u2019s Europe, Japan or emerging markets. And I'm not sure how to comment on whether once daily premix would be a strong benefit. We will have to see what the clinical data for that is. If I'm speculating about what you're talking about, right, a premix needs to provide I believe noninferior control to whatever the standard treatment is when it comes to diabetes. And this particular premix that I think you are talking about, may -- did not meet the primarily endpoints when it comes to hemoglobin A1c control, vis-\u00e0-vis basal-bolus therapy. So clearly, all is going to depend on the actual clinical data. Phil Johnson : Was there the CETP question? David Ricks : Okay. Yeah, sure. Sorry. The gap there. I thought there was another question between it. Seamus thanks for the question on CTP. I think a couple points of clarification. All along we've been quoting LBO reduction numbers for our program using these so called direct measurement methods. I'm not actually familiar with the statement you made about Merck's method, but we use this direct method, which is the more accurate way and our numbers are made consistent throughout. Perhaps with our program the confusion has been, we reformulated as we went to Phase 3. We had tested 100 and 500 in Phase 2. And the formulation of 130 that you mentioned is more bio-available than the 130 equivalents in the Phase 2 study, if that make sense. So, we would expect the LDL reductions between the one and the 500 that were previously published. And that puts you somewhere in the 30s in terms of percentage reduction using the direct LDL measurement. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, next caller, please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jay Olson : Hi. It's Jay Olson in for Jami Rubin. Thank you for taking the question. Actually, just a couple questions on animal health. Can you please tell us what Elanco's EBIT margins were in 2014? And then, when the Novartis Animal Health deal was announced, you guided to a dilutive impact on 2015 earnings, followed by accretion in 2016, with some cost synergies and mid 20% EBIT margins. Can you just update us on whether all of your targets are still on track? And then finally, are you, now that the Novartis Animal Health deal is closed, are you comfortable with the size of Elanco? Or do you anticipate additional business development? And if so, would it be in the companion animal arena, or in livestock? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great, Jay. Thank you for the questions. Those were all for Jeff. Feel free, and then if you want a comment at all, Derica, on the accretion dilution as well. Derica Rice : Sure. I'll take the first one. For 2014 it was around 24% was the EBIT margin. And then, in regards to, just to clarify, when we announced the deal we did say it would be dilutive in 2015. And we said that we expect by 2017 to return the combined entity to the historical levels of profitability, which was in the mid-20s in terms of margins. Jay Olson : Right. Jeff Simmons : Yeah. And just to build on that, I think when you look at the Novartis, we feel good. It's better than expected in a couple of areas. Again, we're just a few days in, but close timing was better than expected and also the required divestitures really only meaning to sell one brand in the U.S. and all the other areas where we're clear on. So, at this stage, we've only got limited detail on moving forward, being we're just a month in and we'll definitely give a better view more clear detail in Q2, Q3. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Jeff. Jay Olson : About business development? Phil Johnson : About the business development and priorities. Jeff Simmons : Yeah. We're going to continue from business development perspective. I mean, we feel very good about scale and share our voice being able to -- and Novartis we see as vehicles for the next year of growth. And they've increased our portfolio, our pipeline, and our share of voice. We're seeing that already in the early planning of both of these integrations which are working very well. I think we're going to look now very much as we have in the past with other acquisitions is where the strategic areas of need are. So, vaccinations in that space, emerging markets in comp animals will continue to be targets and we'll probably be more regional than global in nature. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Jeff. Tom, next caller please. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Wendy Lin : This is actually Wendy Lin on for Chris Schott today. I have two questions on Alzheimer's. It's on the N3PG path-specific antibody. Can you talk about the time lines and the next steps in here? And then on the base inhibitor, can you talk about your study design? How do you see that molecule comparing with Merck's? And when could you move it into Phase 3? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks for the questions. Jan, if you'd like to lead off with commentary on the N3pG monoclonal antibody. And then, Dave, if you'd like to provide the thoughts on the base study design? Jan? Jan Lundberg : Okay. So the N3pG antibody is a plaque-specific antibody. And it's in Phase 1 studies, although it's actually done in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild or moderate Alzheimer's. The purpose of that study is actually to look at safety and have some pharmacodynamic markets, so effects primarily looking at imaging before and after treatment. And the planned completion of the trials are then second half this year. John Lechleiter : Great. Thank you, Dave. As it relates to the base program in alliance with AstraZeneca we've announced to begun Phase 2/3 program. So one feature of this is, it say Phase 2 program to confirm dose and safety which will then convert into a Phase 3 perhaps toward the end of this year, early next year depending on enrollment. I think the two key things. We don't have any comparative data with Merck's base inhibitor. Two key things I mentioned in terms of the study itself and then one operationally. We will be positively screening for amyloid as with the sola EXPEDITION 3 study in this program as well. So the 100% of the patients in the study have confirmed Alzheimer's, and we know that\u2019s an issue from other experiences in this field. And then, our study is a mild Alzheimer's disease study. And I believe Merck has a mild, moderate plus a prodromal, so different population mixes. We also have different endpoints we're looking at. We favor the activities daily living and cognitive ADAS-Cog measurement points; I mean Merck's looking at different points as well. So there are differences. We'll have to see how it plays out. I would say operationally, for the previous comment on sola, we feel good about our team's ability to enroll patients in these types of studies. And, of course, there is a race to get a drug to patient suffering from the illness. So we're very focused on timelines and feel confident in our ability to execute. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ari Jahja : Good morning. This is Ari Jahja in for Vamil Divan. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three questions here. First, on gross margin guidance, can you please clarify to what extent the upward revision is impacted by inventory step-up and amortization related to the Novartis Animal Health deal? Second on pharma net pricing. Can you share your thoughts on key headwinds and tailwinds in different regions? It is interesting that emerging markets is the only part delivering positive net effect last year. And then lastly, for Enrique, pertaining to the new insulin glargine product, can you talk about Lilly's preparedness ahead of the launch this year? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Thanks Ari Jahja. And was your second question on animal health pricing or just pharma pricing? I'm sorry. Ari Jahja : Pharma. Phil Johnson : Okay. So Derica, do you want to comment on the gross margin piece to start with? Derica Rice : Sure. In regards to the gross margin change in our guidance, it only relates to FX. So this is not driven by the step up of inventory for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition. In fact, that was included in our regional guidance that we shared on our January 7th call. So, the 78% gross margin projection today is solely due to the change in outlook in terms of the effect on inventories expected to be sold through the period. Phil Johnson : Dave, you want to comment on other part? David Ricks : Yeah. Let me maybe just jump in on the -- you're commenting on the 2014 effect of price rate and volumes are we show here in the U.S. being down one on the year perhaps that\u2019s a surprise. Remembering Japan had 2014 was the biannual price year, so we expected and planned for price pressure there. ACE, I think we are macroeconomic pressure in our business along with the plan for generic event of Cymbalta which lead into this year. The U.S. is down primarily driven to the AG offers generic business transactions we conducted on both Evista and Cymbalta which had an effect on our price per unit in a significant way during the year. So, I think that's more or less a one-time event for the U.S. market. Phil Johnson : Great. And I apologize. I missed your last question. Ari Jahja : Insulin glargine readiness. Phil Johnson : Okay, Enrique great. Thank you. Got it. Enrique Conterno : I'm not sure. What I can say other than we are ready. Clearly, we expect to launch in Europe this year post the expiration of the license patent. Phil Johnson : Excellent. Thank you, Enrique. Tom, next caller please. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks a lot for the questions. So just two things. One -- I don't know if I missed the answer to this question -- but pricing on the animal health side of the business? What was the driver there? And is that something that -- where we could see that kind of pricing power going forward? And then separately, as you look at the choice to enroll Amyvid-only patients, do you have internal data suggesting that the Amyvid staining, or the Amyvid biomarker-positive patient population in the EXPEDITION studies actually did have a wider magnitude of benefit? And suggesting that there could be greater power in EXPEDITION 3? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Seamus. So Jeff, for the animal health pricing question, and then back to Dave on solanezumab. JeffSimmons: Yeah. So, on pricing and animal health, Seamus, a couple of comments. First of all, we have a very market-based pricing, especially on the food animal side. So as you\u2019ve see economics get better in the meat and milk's business and our return and our value preposition changes, we base a lot of our pricing model of on that. Second is we have taken a very global assessment of these markets and the value aspects of this, and have taken a global pricing approach that I think has also benefited. And then, I think lastly on pricing its liking to our value base strategy. As you know, we bought an analytics company and we're offering a broader set of solutions. So those are the key things. I think we've got to continue to look as you go forward at the cyclical nature, especially of the food animal business and the competitive nature of the comp animal business. So I think the intension is can you get a 1% to 3% price is a question that's out there in the industry that's still isn't validated yet, but I think those are the factors to watch going forward. Phil Johnson : Thanks Jeff. Dave? David Ricks : Yeah. As it relates to the amyloid positivity I should be clear, we test the primary number of subjects select for PET scan, some do receive, see themselves as well, but confirming positive amyloid we think is key to development in Alzheimer's. And we believe that because we do have data in house that shows that patients who don't have amyloid do not respond to an anti-amyloid treatment. And we also know from larger scale population studies, they also don\u2019t progress at the same rate. So if they're in the placebo arm they're going to over-perform. So for all these reasons and just logic, we believe that's a critical element in Alzheimer's drug development. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, next caller please. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple questions. On your novel basal insulin, you continue to talk bullishly about it on your early January guidance call. And you said this remains a very important product for the Company. And that's just not congruent at all with how consensus views the drug. Consensus is very skeptical, recognizing that there might be some positive efficacy attributes. But there is also some unique and potentially worrisome toxicities, like fatty liver. And in a competitive category like insulin, it seems that unique side effects could basically take down the commercial prospects for the product. So I am hoping you can tell us what you think analysts are missing with this program. And then the second question on -- a general question on base inhibitors. Are -- what are the theoretical safety issues to monitor with these compounds, given the magnitude to which they lower A-beta production? It seems like that's confounded by the fact that nobody really knows what the physiological role of A-beta is. So how do you know what to watch for? And has there been any signals, in any human studies, that you are aware of? Or animal studies? Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Tim. Enrique, if you'll handle the first question on the novel basal insulin peglispro, and then, Jan, if you'd like to hand the base question in terms of safety things looking out formally we've seen so far with molecules in humans. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. So, on the efficacy side, I think what we basically have is five positive Phase 3 trials against Lantus. Now let's keep in mind that we have not disclosed what the level of improvement is, but statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in five trials is unprecedented and hemoglobin A1c reduction it is a -- has a tangible benefit when it comes to outcomes, in particular in terms of the development of macrovascular complications. So we see this as extremely important. You spoke of some of the signals that we basically saw in our Phase 3 programs. At this stage though I think we have to wait for us to be able to disclose the beta at ADA for you to be able to see exactly what is the benefit risk profile of this product. Phil Johnson : Thanks Enrique. Jan? Jan Lundberg : Yes, if we look at beta-secretase or base inhibitors, the current base inhibitors in the clinic affects both the base one and the base two enzyme and clearly for the Alzheimer indication and the thinking is it's the base one enzyme that is then cleaning the APP precursor. If we look at potential side effects, we experience then probably other companies as well off target effects with some initial base inhibitors, which we believe then underline some of the liver toxicity, which is not unheard of with small molecules. The more specific toxicology observations that we see is actually a deep pigmentation in some animals and the potential explanation for that is probably a base two effect. So this is something that also needs to be monitored in the clinic. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Jan. Tom, do we have any callers in queue? Operator : And we have a follow-up question from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have two questions. First, on your CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine, looks spectacularly effective, but with significant safety concerns, including maybe cardiovascular, wound healing, intraocular pressure, maybe [teratogenicity] [ph]. What are next steps for this compound? And there are a number of similar compounds in development. Why is Lilly's best in class? And then second question, on ixekizumab. Lilly has provided solid top line data in psoriasis. I know there are no head-to-head studies verses Novartis' secukinumab. But based on the full data, which you have and we don't, would you say ixekizumab is comparable to secukinumab? Does it have a chance to be better? Or is ixekizumab less robust than secukinumab? Phil Johnson : Thank you, Steve. Jan, would you like to comment maybe on CGRP please and then\u2026 Jan Lundberg : Calcitonin gene related peptide or CGRP has been around for quite some time and has been and the mechanism has been studied both with small molecule oral agents as well and has more recently monoclonal antibodies. And the studies with oral agents I think showed quite positive data in acute migraine treatment relief of symptoms, but due to probably off target liver talks these agents could not be used for more chronic treatment. On the other hand, they were also tested in a variety of patients with other diseases and there were no real other side effects seen and this has been confirmed even more with the monoclonal antibodies, which have -- are very specific and we have not seen any side effects with these type of agents so far in our studies. And currently we are then in migraine in Phase 2 preparing for Phase 3 with more safety and dose ranging studies and we're also studying these agents for osteoarthritis, but we are very bullish on this mechanism and realising it is a competitive area with several other players, but we're doing our utmost to execute the trials in a very rapid fashion. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Jan. Dave? Dave Ricks : As it relates to the IL-17s we're quite excited about this class. We think both psoriasis has a lot of room for growth and IL-17s present really a compelling difference as a Group versus available therapies, I think you have a strongly exhibited in the topline results we put out in September which demonstrated a very significant effect size improvement over etanercept, in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, with ixekizumab. We don't have class comparisons as you mentioned and Steve you will see our data come up pretty soon with a more full look at what we\u2019re looking at. But I'll just say qualitatively, we think we have the potential to have the best drug in the class because at maximum doses, we see extraordinary rates of PASI 100 clearance and I think our numbers are high. So all the data is not out. We need to see Amgen's full data set but I think we feel good that we could have the most effective medicine in the class. And as we reported safety of ixekizumab in the moderate to severe patients with psoriasis was similar to that we saw with etanercept. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks Dave. Tom, one last poll if we have any additional callers. Operator : There are no questions in the queue at this time, sir. Please continue. Phil Johnson : Thank you very much. I'll go ahead and turn it over to John and then to wrap up the call. John? John Lechleiter : Thank you, Phil. A brief wrap-up here. To all those on the call, we thank you for your continued interest in our company and for your support. As we emerge from this journey that we have taken through years YZ, I'm extremely proud that we have executed on the strategy that we laid out for you and deliver on the commitments we shared five years ago. On January 7th, we outlined our objectives for the balance of this decade. We intend to drive year-on-year revenue growth through the balance of this decade, spurred by new product launches from our pipeline. Next, we aim to turn that revenue growth into even greater earnings growth by controlling costs and leveraging existing infrastructure. At the same time we aim to maintain a sustainable flow of innovative medicines from our pipeline. And finally we will deploy capital to create value which includes returning excess cash to shareholders via both the dividend and share repurchases. We remain convinced that our strategy is the right one for Lilly in order to create value for patients, physicians, payers and our shareholders. And our ability to execute so far gives us increasing confidence at our future prospects. As always, we will keep you apprized of our progress. Thank you once again.

[Operator Instructions]. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Derica Rice. Please go ahead, sir. Derica Rice : Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's first quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Derica Rice, Lilly's Chief Financial Officer. John Lechleiter our Chairman, President and CEO is traveling overseas and is unable to join us today. However, I do have a number of my colleagues with me here in person or dialing in. And they are Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Elissa Rassner, Brad Roebling and Phil Johnson of Investor Relations team. During this call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Now, 2015 is off to a very good start. This quarter we had solid underlying business performance offset by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lingering headwinds from U.S. patent expirations of Cymbalta and Evista. Our continued focus on cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line and we saw positive progress with our pipeline spanning regulatory approvals, submissions and Phase III data readouts. Now, I'll begin today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since our last quarterly earnings call and there have been quite a lot of them. Starting with commercial milestones, our U.S. colleagues began promotion of CYRAMZA for second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after receiving FDA approval late last year. While in Europe, our colleagues launched CYRAMZA for the treatment of second-line gastric cancer. In diabetes, following EU approval in Q4, we launched Humalog 200 units [Technical Difficulty] KwikPen, the first 200 units per mil mealtime insulin that is targeted for people who take more than 20 units of rapid-acting mealtime insulin per day. And following FDA approval at the end of January, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched Glyxambi in the U.S. in March. We're excited about the potential of this product, which is the first approved single-fill combination of a DPP 4 inhibitor and an SGLT2 inhibitor. Turning to regulatory milestones, in addition to FDA approval of Glyxambi, Boehringer Ingelheim received a positive opinion from Europe's CHOP for the single pill combination of Empagliflozin and Metformin for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. If approved, the product will be marketed under the trade name Synjardy. In oncology we achieved a number of regulatory milestones for Cyramza. After receiving a priority review, Cyramza was approved in Japan as a treatment for patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer. Given the regulatory timelines for pricing in Access decisions, launch is expected midyear. We also submitted Cyramza in both the U.S. and the EU for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. I would note that the FDA's review of this SBLA is moving very quickly. And also in the EU, we submitted Cyramza for second-line non-small cell lung cancer. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in bringing Cyramza to market, having received regulatory approvals in the U.S., the EU and Japan within less than 12 months. As I'll discuss later we're also excited about life cycle opportunities for this brand. In our bio-medicines business, we submitted ixekizumab to the FDA for review as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. And along with Pfizer, we announced that the FDA removed the partial clinical hold for tanezumab. As a result, we will begin Phase III trials in multiple pain indications before the end of the year. Our decision to proceed with the development of tanezumab triggered a $200 million payment to Pfizer. On the clinical front, along with Incyte we announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint of improved ACR20 response compared to placebo in the Phase III RA build study in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to or were intolerant of at least one conventional DMARD. At the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in March, we presented detailed results from the positive Phase III Uncover One study evaluating ixekizumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Also for ixekizumab, we issued a topline press release earlier this week announcing positive results from the Phase III Spirit P-1 study evaluating ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who were naive to biologic treatment. I'm also pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment of the EXPEDITION 3 trial evaluating solanezumab in amyloid positive patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Given that we completed enrollment ahead of schedule, we now expect last patient visit in October of 2016. For our CTP inhibitor evacetrapib, we announced that the accelerate Phase III study in people with high-risk vascular disease will be extended by approximately six months. Last patient visit for this study is now expected in July of 2016. And we announced that regulatory submission of our basal insulin peglispro will be delayed in order to generate additional clinical data to further understand and characterize the potential effects, if any, of changes in liver fat observed with [indiscernible] treatment in the Phase III trial. We're working with regulators to determine specific next steps but we do anticipate the regulatory submission is likely to occur after 2016. And we look forward to presenting detailed Phase III data at this year's ADA meeting. On the business development front, we announced three deals. The first was an agreement with Hanmi for the development and commercialization of Hanmi's oral BTK inhibitor for the treatment of autoimmune and other diseases. Lilly will have worldwide rights, excluding China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea. The second was a collaboration with Innovent for the development and commercialization in China for three investigational cancer treatments. In addition, Lilly will be responsible for the development and commercialization outside of China for a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule and for up to three preclinical bi-specific immuno-oncology molecules from Innovent. And the third deal which we announced last week with Bristol-Myers Squibb was for the transfer back to Lilly of Erbitux' commercial rights in North America. These rights were scheduled to revert to Lilly in September 2018 but we expect this deal will accelerate that transition to Q4 this year. In other news, the German Court of Appeals ruled that the vitamin regimen patent for Alimta would not be infringed by a generic competitor that intends to market a dipotassium salt form of pemetrexed in Germany once the compound patent expires in December of 2015. We will seek permission to appeal this ruling to the German Supreme Court. And finally, we repurchased just over $300 million of stock in Q1 leaving $3.4 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the first quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. 2014 was a productive year for execution of our innovation-based strategy. Likewise 2015 is off to a strong start with more to come. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil? Phil Johnson : Thanks, Derica. Before I review our Q1 results, it may be helpful to comment on the presentation of our GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. For our GAAP results, remember that we closed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1. So in interpreting our GAAP results and growth rates versus 2014, please keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health. While 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition, including financing costs, integration costs, inventory step-up costs, amortization of intangibles and other miscellaneous adjustments. For our non-GAAP measures, recall that like our peers, we're now excluding amortization of intangibles from our non-GAAP measures. To provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business, based on our current reporting practices and business configuration, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we had closed the acquisition on January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we're reporting our financials this year. In addition to aiding your analysis of our non-GAAP measures, you'll see that we posted an Excel file to our Investor Relations website that contains our 2014 non-GAAP measures adjusted to remove intangible amortization and to add Novartis Animal Health. With that background, let's take a look at our results for the quarter. Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. As I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first-quarter reported or GAAP results. Moving to slide 9, you can see that Q1 revenue was just over $4.6 billion. The decrease of 6% compared to Q1 2014 reflects significant FX headwinds. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue on a non-GAAP basis was essentially flat. As we discussed on our guidance call, this year we will still feel the negative effect of the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. This quarter sales of those two products in the U.S. declined by nearly $200 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue increased 5% this quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 3.6 percentage points, going from 74.6% to 78.2%. This increase was entirely driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on International inventories sold which increased cost of sales in Q1 last year but decreased cost of sales in Q1 this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent declined by 1.1 percentage points, going from 76.4% in last year's quarter to 75.3% this quarter. Please do take note of the level of our gross margin percent excluding the FX effect on International inventories sold. Again you'll see that this is running at roughly 75%. As we discussed when updating our guidance on our Q4 earnings call, in 2015 we expect a substantial FX benefit that should push our gross margin percent into the 78% range. However, if FX rates stay at their current levels, that benefit will essentially go away in 2016. So as you construct your estimate of our 2016 gross margin percent, you should be making adjustments off of a 2015 base level of roughly 75%. As in past quarters, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, declined by 7% or nearly $200 million, compared to Q1 of 2014. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 6% while R&D declined 9%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign exchange as well as to ongoing cost-containment efforts. The reduction in R&D expense was driven primarily by the lower late- stage clinical development costs and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. As implied by our full-year guidance, we do expect the level of R&D spend to be higher for the remainder of the year as we start Phase III trials for tanezumab, our CGRP monoclonal antibody, olimertumab and additional indications for Cyramza. Other income and expense was income of $93 million in Q1 2015, compared to income of $36 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase versus last year was due to a favorable legal judgment and larger net gains on investments. Our tax rate was 22.9%, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit realized in Q1 last year. Also our tax rate in both periods did not include the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions including the R&D tax credit, as those provisions had lapsed. At the bottom line, net income increased 16% while earnings-per-share increased 18% reflecting the benefit of our share repurchases. Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 19. Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue. On slide 11, in the yellow box in the middle of the page, you'll see the total revenue decline on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier of 6%. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline as you see the 6% negative effect from FX that we booked this quarter with a favorable price effect of 3% offset by a volume decline of a similar amount. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. Pharma revenue increased 4% driven by price partially offset by volume. A number of pushes and pulls affected U.S. Pharma revenue growth this quarter. First, as I mentioned earlier, Cymbalta and Evista declined following their patent expirations. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista the rest of our U.S. Pharma revenue increased 18% with over 7 percentage points coming from volume. Also recall that on our Q4 earnings call we mentioned that an extension of shipping days through the end of December 2014 resulted in lower wholesale inventory build in Q4 of 2014 than in Q4 of 2013. As expected, this led to less wholesale inventory burn in Q1 this year than in Q1 last year, benefiting this year's growth rate. So when adjusted for wholesale buying, as well as Cymbalta and Evista, our U.S. Pharma revenue grew 14% this quarter with 3 percentage points coming from volume. Moving to our International operations in Australia, Canada and Europe, or ACE, you'll see a negative 13% rate impact was the primary driver of the overall 16% decline in revenue. While on a constant currency or performance basis ACE revenue decreased 3%, driven primarily by the initial effects of a loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta. In Japan, Pharma revenue decreased 23% with half of the decline coming from the weaker yen. On a performance basis, our Japanese Pharma revenue decreased 11%. You may recall that we experienced substantial wholesaler buying in Q1 2014 in advance of an increase in the local consumption tax. Adjusting for the increased buying we saw last year, our Pharma revenue grew about 9% on a performance basis driven by volume. Turning to Emerging Markets, we saw mid-single-digit performance growth driven by volume growth of 7%. As a result of the significant negative effect of FX, our reported Emerging Markets revenue declined 4% versus last year. Our Pharma revenue in China grew 6% with nearly all of that growth coming from volume. On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 4%. Excluding the negative effect of FX; Elanco revenue increased 2%. This performance increase was affected by competition in the U.S. for companion animal products. Moving to slide 12, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q1 2015 results. Given the significant and swift strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this is one of those quarters where FX has the opposite effect on the topline as it does on the bottom line. This quarter FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by 6 percentage points. In terms of cost of goods sold, however, FX provided a substantial benefit which led to FX providing a tailwind or benefit for operating income and EPS. Excluding FX, you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter grew 7%, while including FX non-GAAP EPS grew 18%. Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of April 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression, red arrows showing attrition and stars showing molecules added through business development. You'll see that ixekizumab has moved into the regulatory review column following regulatory submission in the U.S. Following our agreement with Tosano to develop their proprietary formulation of parathyroid hormone 1 to 34 using a microneedle patch system, you'll see that asset showing up in Phase II. And in Phase I you'll see two assets have been added through business development activities, an ultrarapid acting insulin through our deal with Adosha and a BTK inhibitor initially being studied in immunologic diseases through our deal with Hanmi. In addition we began Phase I testing of a small molecule for diabetes and another for Parkinson's disease. And we terminated development of a Phase I small molecule for cardiovascular disease. You'll also see that we've moved Blosozumab from Phase II to Phase I. Our efforts to identify a commercially attractive formulation have been unsuccessful and we've decided not to move Blosozumab into Phase III development for osteoporosis at this time. We'll evaluate our strategy for the Blosozumab development program to determine next steps. Now let me turn the call back over to Derica. Derica Rice : Thanks, Phil. I'll recap progress we've made in our key events for 2015 and then review our 2015 financial guidance. Turning to slide 14, you may recall that when we showed this slide on our Q4 earnings call in late January, we had already achieved two events, presentation of data for ramucirumab in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and completion of the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health. Since that time, we've achieved a number of additional milestones. We begin our second wave of Phase III trials for Cyramza, initiating a pivotal trial in first line gastric cancer. In terms of the additional lifecycle investments in Cyramza, you'll also see that we've specified that the Phase III lung cancer trial will be in the first-line setting in patients with the EGFR mutation positive. And we've added two new Phase III trial starts to our list of 2015 events. One is second-line bladder cancer and the other in second-line liver cancer in patients with elevated baseline alpha-beta protein levels. This is the population where we saw a pronounced overall survival benefit in the Phase III reach trial. You'll also see that we've added a key event for our CGRP monoclonal antibody. In the coming weeks we expect to start a Phase III trial in patients with episodic cluster headaches. Moving to the next Section, as mentioned earlier, we issued a second positive Phase III topline press release for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. And earlier this week we issued a topline press release outlining positive results from a Phase III trial of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis. Also for ixekizumab, but in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, we presented detailed results of the Phase III Uncover One trial at the AAD meeting in March. In the regulatory submissions category, you'll see the green check marks for the ramucirumab and ixekizumab submissions I mentioned earlier, as well as the red checkmark for the delay in submission for basal insulin peglispro. While in the regulatory actions section, you'll see the green checkmarks for the approvals received in Japan for Cyramza in gastric cancer and Glyxambi here in the U.S. Finally, we've reflected the progress made with tanezumab, lifting of the partial clinical hold paving the way to resume Phase III trials, as well as the negative Appeals Court ruling on Alimta in Germany. 2015 represents another year for execution of our innovation-based strategy and we're pleased with our progress so far and are excited for what lies ahead. While we know not all of the remaining events are likely to be positive, we're increasingly confident that a significant majority will break our way and solidify our near- to medium-term growth prospects. Now turning to our 2015 financial guidance, I first point out that our substantial EPS beat in the quarter relative to consensus came from two line items. Lower R&D expenses and higher other income. In both cases, we believe these represent differences in timing between our expectations and consensus, not differences in expectations for the full year. In terms of our non-GAAP guidance for 2015, at a high level, we're reconfirming our full-year guidance, both the individual line items and the EPS range. To provide some more color, we have seen further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our call in late January and this is causing further FX headwinds at the top and bottom lines. However, the underlying performance of our business is offsetting this additional downside. Specifically on FX, when compared to our late January outlook, we expect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar to trim an additional $150 million to $175 million from revenue and another $0.05 to $0.06 from EPS. For the full year, we now expect FX to reduce revenue growth by about 7.5% or about 1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. In terms of EPS, we now forecast a negative FX effect of about $0.13. Comprised of an operational FX hit of about $0.60 offset by benefit to cost of sales of nearly $0.50. As we discussed, should FX rates remain at current levels, this cost of sales benefit in 2015 would essentially go away in 2016. You'll want to consider this as you model our gross margin percent and EPS for 2016. For our GAAP guidance, you will see that we've incorporated changes related to our decision to proceed with the development of tanezumab and the deals we signed with Hanmi, Innovent and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Finally, keep in mind that our 2015 GAAP guidance is based on our current estimate for how we'll account for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition and the Erbitux deal and could change based upon revised estimates and final accounting treatment. In summary, while our first-quarter revenue reflects the impact of foreign exchange headwinds and the lingering effect of U.S. patent expirations for Cymbalta and Evista, Lilly remains on track to return to growth in 2015, driven by excellent progress in our innovation-based strategy. We had solid underlying business performance and our continued focus on cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line. Recent new product launches, along with the growing success of our late stage pipeline, reinforce our confidence in our future. Since our last earnings announcement, we've seen one FDA approval and two FDA submissions, in addition to approvals and submissions in Europe and Japan. We've also seen a continuing series of positive data readouts for our late stage assets. We're pleased with the performance of recently launched products as well as growth at several established products. Excluding the hit from unfavorable exchange rates and lower U.S. sales of Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue increased 5% this quarter. We've started 2015 in a position of strength and our continued cost containment efforts allow us to build on our innovation-based strategy through both internal and external investments. As we transition from a period of unprecedented patent expirations to an era of growth, we're seeing tangible results from our innovation-based strategy and we're increasingly optimistic about the opportunity we have to bring innovative new medicines to patients and create value for shareholders. As we discussed in January, throughout the balance of this decade, we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins. You'll see us sharpen our focus on areas where we're best positioned to compete and win and find ways to increase productivity and do the work of pharmaceutical R&D better. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will go to the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Salim Syed : This is Salim in for Mark. Thanks so much for all the color on the call. It's really helpful. Two questions, one on Glyxambi. Can you give us your thoughts, where are the patients going to come from? Do you expect cannibalization of your new products or are these going to be new patients to the Lilly franchise? And then Cyramza, if you could provide, please, a breakout on gastric versus lung sales? Thanks. Jan Lundberg : Obviously, Enrique, first question for you on Glyxambi and then over to you, Sue, for the Cyramza question. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : On Glyxambi, clearly we're looking at the benefit that this product could provide for patients that are not achieving good control on metformin. So we see this as a very attractive options for many of those patients. And that's basically what our clinical results also say. So we're excited. We're the very early stages of our launch. We launched in late March, so we're, at this time basically introducing this product to healthcare providers. Sue Mahony : Sure. And with Cyramza, the vast majority of the sales that we're seeing is in gastric cancer impacting the U.S. where we launched last year. We're seeing use with the majority of the sales coming from use in combination with taxitaxil [ph] as we expected. We did see in Q1, though, a proportion of sales coming from the lung launch. It's early days yet on lung. But what we're seeing uptake there and the feedback so far is positive from physicians in the use of Cyramza in lung cancer indications. And clearly in Europe, we just launched, beginning of this year, in Europe and where we're seeing access, for example, in countries like Germany, again early days, but the uptake in the gastric indication there is positive. Enrique Conterno : Yes. Just I did not answer the question on what impact would Glyxambi have on both Trajenta and Jardiance. We're not really thinking about the cannibalization aspects when introducing this product. We think this product is a very unique product. And, if anything, we believe that this product is actually going to strengthen both Trajenta and Jardiance as it becomes - as it basically gains acceptance in the marketplace. Operator : We will go to the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Love to get your updated perspective on solanezumab and the Alzheimer's opportunities in light of the biogen data. Mechanistically, of course, both products target A-beta. They do it in reasonably different ways. Yesterday Roche, who had two monoclonals, suggested that they may push forward with a plaque-targeting version of their drug versus the other product that hits multiple forms of A-beta. Your product targets soluble A-beta, yet you also have in development a plaque-specific monoclonal. So given the totality of their data, what's your latest thinking here? What has the best chance of success, a drug that targets soluble or deposited plaque? And then another question, if last patient visit is October 2016, does it mean that we would only learn of results downstream of that or would we possibly learn of a topline ahead of that last patient visit? Jan Lundberg : Dave, if you'd like to take a shot at the two questions? Jan, do feel free to chime in as well, particularly on the first portion of Tim's question if you'd like. Dave? Enrique Conterno : Obviously, [Technical Difficulty] interest in Alzheimer's disease. And as you know, for a long time we've believed in solanezumab's mechanism clearing the [indiscernible] data. We're starting to have a - conclude enrollments in Expedition 3 and now we're on the clock for last patients achieve 18 months of therapy. In the past we've communicated there was a chance we may - we had allowed for an interim risk but, as I've said before, that feature of the program was only valuable in the case of a slow enrollment rate. Again at this point we haven't made a definitive decision. I would continue to guide people to focus on the end of the study as when we'll be learning about the effects of solanezumab. So to your question, that would be after the October 16 last patient visit. As you rightly point out we also have specific interest in a Phase I program in that area. We're also excited about that mechanism. Recognizing that the mechanisms may, in fact, be complementary in some sense, either sequentially or combined together, that specific antibodies to date, the ones that we had published data on, also have a safety side effect profile that's, to our eye, quite different from solanezumab from the patient inherence perspective, et cetera, that may have an impact. So we'll have to let both of these mechanisms play out. And we're excited about both of them and I think with Alzheimer's, it is truly unique moment here as we've seen these modifying effects from multiple different programs. Jan Lundberg : Let me just add that I think it's very likely that these mechanisms are complementary. And clearly solanezumab has also shown preferable safety profile, particularly in relation to ARIA, either on the brain edema dilemma that you see with this plaque-specific antibodies, at least then from competitors. So I think we now need to wait and see what happens with it in these bigger trials. Phil Johnson : Tim, just a little more color on your question about hearing results downstream from that October 2016 date. As we've been through this a number of times, as you may recall, that after last patient visit, there is time that needs to transpire for the database to actually be locked, cleaned and validated and then for us to run tables and figures and so typically, topline press releases have been after last patient visit by multiple months. So you should expect to see a topline press release downstream certainly of that October 2016 last patient visit date. Operator : We will go next to the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : I was hoping you could provide a little more color on some of the softness in the quarter for Alimta and Animal Health. You mentioned some competitive pressures there. Could you expand a bit? And then on the pipeline, Jan, on the CGRP product, are you still pursuing chronic and episodic headache as well? And when might we see data on those products? And then lastly on the glucagon receptor antagonist, can you frame for us what you're trying to accomplish there and where it might fit in to the broader spectrum of treatments? Thanks. Jan Lundberg : Sue, if you can comment on the Alimta performance in the quarter. Jeff, obviously, for Animal Health, with CGRP actually having transitioned to Dave's organization, I think from a planning perspective, Dave, why don't you take a first crack at talking about our development plans for CGRP. And then Enrique and Jan, if you want to fill in for the glucagon receptor antagonist, that would be great. Sue, we'll start with you? Sue Mahony : Sure. Alimta performance was mainly impacted by FX worldwide. We had a 1% volume decline with a 7% rate and a 1% price. If we look at it by geography, we actually increased in the U.S. by 3% and that was mainly driven by price. In Europe, we had a 2% volume increase and that was offset mainly by FX with also some price impact in ENB. We also had a volume increase, again offset half by price and half by rate. In Japan we had the same impact that was mentioned earlier with regards to the buy-in that we saw last year on the consumption tax increase. So we did have a volume decrease versus last year's quarter. But also a rate impact in Japan. Jeff Simmons : On companimals, real quick like, we've seen and really expected these headwinds with increased competition really coming in a couple areas, two new competitive entries as well as a reentry in the marketplace. We're two drivers, I would add an additional one, which has really been some distraction from the integration. We've really used a rapid pace with the integration of both companies and from this being the first and second quarter, critical to the companimal business, this also had an impact. I will note, though, on the integration, it's going better than expected. We're three months in and I do believe that both Novartis and Lohmann will be enablers to our medium- and long-term growth in the companimal segment, as well as globally. We've relaunched, as well, Interceptor. Three weeks after the closing the Management teams have both been combined. We've got a Management team that includes some Novartis executives and I believe we've now got the majority of the global sales force in place. So again we're finding far more positives than negatives at this stage with the Novartis integration. It will be an enabler for growth and as we've previously communicated, the savings level of $200 million will be our minimum expectation. Phil Johnson : Dave, on CGRP development plans? Dave Ricks : Yes. So I think your question was whether our clients were chronic or episodic headache? Remembering there's actually two types of headaches we're looking at here. What we've been talking about today is the addition to the pipeline advancement chart of moving CGRP into Phase III here in the coming months for a condition called cluster headache and we'll be studying that in both the chronic and the episodic forms. This is an orphan-type indication that we're moving into. We're also continuing the development in episodic [Technical Difficulty]. Lilly is not planning to study chronic migraine at this time and we've had impressive results from our Phase II program in episodic migraine. We'll be seeking to replicate these results in Phase III and right now we have a Phase IIb program going on to further define the dose for that larger migraine program. Phil Johnson : And then Enrique or Jan on the GRA? Enrique Conterno : Maybe I'll start and then Jan can help here. But clearly our glucagon receptor antagonist is right now in Phase II. What we basically have seen is rapid reductions in Humalog A1c. We saw it increase high posts or weight gain. The way we're thinking about this product is this product has to offer a benefit vis-a-vis a number of oral options that are available today and that in the future will be available in generic form. So we're thinking that this product could be an attractive option in the early segment for patients that have impaired renal function where beta cell health might not be great. We don't see lots of options for these types of patients and GRA could be an attractive option there. Jan? Jan Lundberg : Just complement there, the metabolism of this agent is independent of renal function. So therefore, it's suitable with patients then that have some compromise in their renal function. Operator : And that will come from the line of Tony Butler of Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler : Number one, Jan, if you could comment on restarts for tanezumab. Would the focus again be NOA or osteoarthritis? Number two, what actually led to the decision to delay the evacetrapib look? Was it just simply the DSMB making some judgments about event rates? And then finally, again, back to Alzheimer's, I think there's data supporting combination, maybe it's totally in animals, but combinations of A-beta antibody in the base inhibitor. And just trying to understand how you think about, really from a cost standpoint and also from a mechanistic standpoint, think about combinations versus solanezumab versus one or the other antibodies alone as we progress over time? So something beyond 2016. Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Dave, actually, I think I'll ask you to take a crack at these since these assets are currently sitting with your business unit. Jan, obviously feel free to supplement his response if you think it's appropriate. Dave? Dave Ricks : Good. As it relates to tanezumab, yes, we're pleased to be able to now move off of clinical hold and do plan to proceed into Phase III as soon as later this year with Pfizer. There will actually be three indications that will be pursued. Osteoarthritis, as you mentioned, Tony, we'll also be looking at chronic low back pain and then chronic pain associated with cancer. And that program is similar to what had been previously studied and then stopped at Phase III. On evacetrapib, as we mentioned earlier in the quarter, the extension of time is really not related to the evacetrapib study accelerate. It was a set of recommendations made by our academic advisors and accepted by the company based on information coming from other major long-term cardiovascular event studies where it has been noted that in mediate or recent ACS patients that the impact of lipid managements is a bit delayed in these patients. And we wanted to make sure we fully accounted for this new information in sizing the trial, thus the six-month extension into middle of 2016. Maybe just briefly on Alzheimer's and Jan perhaps can elaborate on the Lilly-generated combination data, but we have no doubt that this disease when we find and have approved these modifiers will be requiring multiple mechanisms to fully arrest its impacts. And we do think mechanisms such as plaque-targeted antibodies, such as base inhibitors and soluble A-beta antibodies and maybe even TAL-based therapies could be combined in all kinds of forms to achieve optimal results. Of course the science in this space is evolving rapidly and, frankly, pretty new. We don't have human data in combinations that I'm aware of. So that's a whole field that would need to be explored, hopefully after a positive solanezumab study in late 2016. Enrique Conterno : Let me just add a comment about tanezumab, the [indiscernible] growth factor, which I feel is highly exciting based on that the chronic-pain area is really needing a new agent. And if you consider the current dilemmas and problems that are with opioids in relation to addiction tolerance or even death due to abuse and so on and NSAIDS has a number of gastrointestinal side effects and there is an increased cardiovascular risk. So I think the opportunity for a new chronic-pain agent is a major one. In relation to the Alzheimer's combos, it's quite intriguing to think about different mechanisms again. Then if you have existing plaque, they need to be cleared and most likely by some microglial activation. And we have our N3pG plaque-specific antibody that can do that. And then you need to prevent further buildup of plaques with A-beta and that can be achieved either by a base inhibitor, or potentially by solanezumab binding them, the free AB tests. We're looking forward to making not only the preclinical experiments in a further solid way but also to test this in the clinic. But first we need to have good data with these different agents before we can combine them. Operator : We will go to the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jay Olson : Jay Olson in for Jami Rubin. On Alimta, can you help us understand, when should we expect to get news on the appeal of the German and UK court decisions regarding the Alimta method-of-use patent? And then do you expect the approval of PD1 antibodies for use in lung cancer to impact the sales of Alimta? And then just on Trulicity, any details, if you could provide, on how the launch is progressing? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Sue, the first two for you and then we'll go over to Enrique for the last question on Trulicity. Sue Mahony : Jay, with regards to the Alimta patent, in the German court, as you know, ruled in our favor last year on the infringement case. In March, that was appealed and the appeal ruled against Alimta. And so basically has ruled that the vitamin regimen patent would not be infringed by generic competitor if they intend to market post the loss of the compound patent the end of December of this year and we will seek permission to appeal this decision to the German Supreme Court. We anticipate that the appeal hearing will happen, though, after the compound patent has expired in Germany. In the UK, the High Court ruled against Lilly in the first instance in May of last year. We have appealed this ruling. The appeal was heard in March of this year. We have yet to hear the outcome of that appeal. And as a reminder, that case covered the UK but also France, Italy and Spain. So we're waiting to hear what the outcome of that appeal would be. Regarding your question on the PD1 inhibitors, on Alimta, the main use of Alimta and where we promote Alimta because we believe that's where we see the best benefit for patients is in the first-line setting and in the maintenance setting. As you are aware, the Optivo launch and the data that we're seeing in some later lines of therapy, so we do not see an impact in the near future on Alimta. Clearly there are other studies ongoing in the first-line setting. We'll need to see what those readouts are over the coming years. Additionally we do believe that combinations are going to be important going forward. And so we have a collaboration with Merck to look at combining Keytruda and Alimta in the first-line non-squamous setting, so clearly we need to see the data from all those trials over the coming months and years. Enrique Conterno : So far, I think the launch of Trulicity is going well. Let me comment first on the GLP-1 market, because we had shared that we felt that Trulicity could be an important catalyst for the overall growth in that class. And long-term for us, this is critical as we think about the prospects for this product. A year ago when we looked at Q1 of 2014, this class was growing 6% when we look at TRX growth. This year, this class is growing 10 percentage points higher, so the growth is at 16%. And importantly, the growth is still accelerating as we look at new prescriptions. So it is an important start, because we do believe that Trulicity will be a major player in this class, but we want to make sure that this class is as relevant as it basically could be. To give some details on our penetration within the class itself, Trulicity today has an 11% new to patient, neutral brand share. This is comparable to BYDUREON at 23 and Victoza at 51. We're pleased with what we see, importantly because we have to put into context that in Q1 what we've shared is that access discussions are going well. And just to provide some color in Q1, we had a 65% availability in commercial and no availability in part D. Commercial is about 75% of the overall market, so clearly, what this basically means for Trulicity, that we had access to about 50% of the market, so we need to look at 11% new to run of course, in that context. What we have shared is that we feel good about our access in commercial. We continue to advance those numbers so we're closer to 70% now. And in part D, we had shared in the past that we were expecting access most likely starting 2016. We're pleased to report that we have already some limited access in part D and we believe that access will continue to increase through Q2 and Q3. So we're getting access faster than we had expected and this I think response to the value that the payers see in this particular product. Operator : We will go next to the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. John Boris : Just back to a question for Enrique on Trulicity while you're still on it. With that kind of growth, 16% growth, can you talk about how the launch of the Primary Care is going? What percent of the business or prescriptions that are generated are being generated by endos versus Primary Care? And then you'll approach about six months post-launch, about midyear, with that kind of growth in the market, one would think a good dose of direct-to-consumer advertising might be useful in driving uptake of a product? So just commentary around that? Second question has to do with the Alimta ruling in the UK on the appellate decision. Just your thoughts around timing of that? Is that something you're expecting to happen in the second quarter? And then I noticed in your slide deck you do have outcomes coming on U.S. and Japan. Can you remind us what's going on there? And then lastly on Alzheimer's disease and TAL, you made some acquisitions of some diagnostics in 2013 on TAL. Neurofibrillary tangles are a little bit different. When might we potentially see some assets targeting the TAL area coming of your pipeline? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Enrique, we'll start with you for the Trulicity questions. And Sue, if you want to comment on Alimta and Jan for the TAL? Enrique Conterno : Sure. So providing a little more detail when we look at both endos and Primary Care, endos, which represent slightly under 30% of the overall GLP-1 market, our new to patient share, is 18%. So clearly this reflects the fact that we launched in that to endos earlier. In Primary Care, our share is still in the high single digits when it comes to new to patient share, but it's increasing fast. So we feel good in terms of where we're today. I think it's important to note that in Primary Care, we basically really have about two and a half months, basically, since we launched, so it's still very early but we're seeing week-to-week progression when it comes to our new to patient share. And clearly, the continued improved access, I think, is going to play very well for us. In terms of our plans, as we seek to build this brand, one comment, but clearly we're not ruling out direct to consumer or any of those investment. Clearly there is a lot of direct-to-consumer investments in the U.S. right now and that's something that we look very closely for all of our brands. Sue Mahony : With regard to the Alimta hearing or the Alimta patent, the UK decision will clearly depend on the timing from the court, but we do anticipate we'll hear sometime later this year on that. In Japan, the JPO hearing was heard in February. And again, we're expecting to get a determinant on that case again sometime later this year. In the U.S., as you're aware, the District Court has ruled in Lilly's favor on validity. The case has gone back to the court regarding infringement. That case is now being heard on May 28 of this year. Jan Lundberg : First, the TAL imaging agent is making intriguing progress and seems to differ in relation to what you can achieve compared to the amyloid imaging. The TAL imaging seems to correlate quite well to symptom decline in and progression then of Alzheimer's disease. It also has a regional distribution in the brain that also seems to correlate with symptoms and there is a great interest in the overall academic and pharmaceutical community for this particular agent. We're also testing whether the TAL imaging could potentially be a surrogate marker then for Alzheimer's disease progression and how you can influence that with pharmaceuticals. And there will be a subgroup in EXPEDITION 3 then for solanezumab that will have the TAL tracer before and after treatment. In relation to TAL therapeutics, we're very interested to see if we can inhibit the spread of TAL mis-folded protein in the brain which seems to happen in the prion-like fashion. And we have a monoclonal antibody in preclinical development that, if everything goes well, we should have that in Phase I next year. Operator : And we will go next to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Wendy Lin : This is Wendy Lin on for Chris. Just a couple. How are you thinking about what insights you've learned from the recent DPP4 adcom panel and any impact it might have on the DPP 4 class? And can you talk about your relative confidence in Jardiance with regard to the CV outcome study and the possibility that the study could show a net benefit to patients? And then in ontology, in light of the Pfizer I brands approval and the early stoppage of their second-line study, can you update us on your program? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Sure. Thanks for the questions, Wendy. Enrique, obviously to you for the DPP4 adcom question and our CV outcomes trial for Jardiance. And then Sue, for the [indiscernible] update? Enrique Conterno : Well, on DPP4, as I think we all have seen or heard the discussion at the advisory committee. Clearly there was a lot to focus on both CV safety but also all-cause mortality endpoints. It is difficult for me to speculate any action that the FDA may take. I think what I can basically say as far as Trajenta is concerned and we have to keep in mind that these numbers are very low, so we cannot have any type of conclusive interpretation from this data, but when we look at our randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials and when we look at the data for Trajenta, in both cases when it comes to CV mortality and when it comes to all-cause mortality, our house of ratios were below 1. So we have no signals that would indicate that linagliptin would cause - would have an issue when it comes to either all-cause mortality or CV death. When it comes to the data for dose-specific DPP4, as I think you have to ask the respective companies. As far as Jardiance is concerned, we're very excited to be able to get to see the results from our outcome trial. At this stage, I've characterized our chances as decent, but we have to wait and see. So we will be basically having a chance to look at these results over the summer and we expect to basically publish topline results when we have this data available. Sue Mahony : Regarding abemacyclic, we're very excited by this molecule and we believe that the latest news [indiscernible] validates the CDK46 class. And we believe that we could have a best-in-class molecule here with single -gent activity, continuous dosing and also our molecule crosses the blood-brain barrier. We're moving quickly on our trials. We have our two Phase III trials ongoing and enrolling, one which is our Phase II trial ongoing, as well as our Kraz [ph] lung study, so we're moving quickly. Our plan is to enroll these trials as quickly as possible so we can get data out hopefully over the next year or so on these trials. Also we have started a breast cancer study for women with brain mets. That will be - because we know that abemacyclic crosses the blood- brain barrier, we believe that that could be a good opportunity for this molecule. So we're excited and we look forward to sharing more data with you. Operator : And we will go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : So maybe you could just update us on some key data sets through the balance of this year and maybe if you could focus a little bit more on the data sets for Phase II that could actually have products entering into Phase III, that would be very helpful. As a second question, this may be for the CV team, but maybe you could talk to us a little bit about the target event rate in that study? And just update us on what your expectations are for the baseline LDL? And when you talk about that, could you confirm that the baseline LDL is on a maximized statin background? And then lastly, can you just help us better understand, in the evolving pricing environment, what do you think are the thresholds of benefit that are going to be necessary for you to show to really achieve an appropriate payment scheme for the anti-NGF therapy? Thanks a lot. Phil Johnson : Dave, I think probably the second question, the third, are up your alley. I would say, Seamus - this is Phil - we have not yet published the design paper for the accelerate trial of evacetrapib. I think we were close to doing that last year, but when the improvement data came out, as Dave mentioned earlier, we wanted to make sure that we could fully analyze that and take into consideration how that might impact, if at all, the trial design for accelerate. As you've now seen, that has impacted, resulted in an additional six-month extension of the study to accrue additional events and additional late events. So, Dave, if you could maybe start off talking about the stuff that you can, target event rates, baseline LDL and if it was on a mac statin background and then talk a bit about the pricing environment as you see it for the anti-NGF. And then we'll come back to your first question, Seamus, on, in particular, Phase II data could read out this and more broadly data readouts that you should have on your radar screen for the balance of 2015. Dave? Dave Ricks : As it relates to the target event rates and specifics about the population in the accelerate program, I know we've said this before, but we're anticipating publishing a design paper for accelerate which will include those details. So until that is published, it's probably not appropriate to comment further. I will only generally say that accelerate is a study designed to study secondary prevention in high-risk vascular disease and as a result, we're expecting a decent event rate in this population. And, in fact, that's what we're observing having enrolled it. The details of that, again, we'll be publishing in the forthcoming Journal. As relates to NGF and tanezumab in the pricing scheme, we're not going to be able to go into the detail on that here, but I think Jan touched on this earlier, that we see chronic-pain management different from acute-pain management. Chronic-pain management is a very significant unmet need, particularly in the United States. The patients that will be targeted with tanezumab will be patients who have exhausted other pain- management options. And other more significant interventions, the likely next step in their disease course and we think in this space, there's creation both for pharmaceutical but in the health system itself, not to mention the side effect and addiction issues for the current therapies [Technical Difficulty] program, pretty substantial at that size in this - we think there's clearly a place, a place where - can be reimbursed in chronic pain management. No, I wrote down the questions here, but question on baseline LDL, the baseline LDL is, just to confirm, in accelerate [Technical Difficulty] publish that number, but patients enroll on the maximum tolerated dose of the stat. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Dave. Seamus, let me start with some of the trial readouts that you should be expecting and/or detailed data presentations that we think you'd have on your radar screen. And then Jan, Sue, Enrique, or Dave if there are other Phase II readouts that you want to highlight, please do so. So as Derica mentioned at the ADA meeting this year, we would expect to have detailed data from a large number of the Phase III trials for our basal insulin peglispro. We also hope in the middle part of this year in the summer to have the first detailed Phase III data disclosures for both ixekizumab and for baricitinib, respectively in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Recall, as well, Enrique mentioned the CD outcomes trial for Jardiance that we expect around the middle part of the year and then the solanezumab extension data from the two-year data we would expect to be presented at the medical meeting this year as well. If you think about some of the additional top lines or yet to read out probably the main one or ones that I would highlight for you would be the latter part of the when we expect to have data from the remaining two of the four main pivotal trials for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. We've also talked about moving over a 2 Mab or 3G-3 into Phase III trials in soft tissue sarcoma and would hope, at an upcoming medical meeting, to have some of the detailed data presented to allow you to see our reason for optimism with that drug. Clearly ASCO would be a great venue for us to do that. With that let me turn it over to Jan or the other business unit presidents if there is additional readouts that you'd like to highlight. I think I've hit them all, but.. Sue Mahony : I think you have. Operator : We'll move on the line of Emil Devan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ari Jahja : This is Ari Jahja on behalf of Emil Devan. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a few here first on the Animal Health business. Can you talk about the pricing environment for food and companion Animal Health products and outlook longer term? And then secondly on baricitinib, we've now seen some initial Phase IIb data from [indiscernible] competing [indiscernible]. How do you see baricitinib's profile stacking up now against competitors? And when should we expect to see additional detailed data from the program? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Jeff, if you'd like to handle the first question on Animal Health pricing and then, Dave, back across the pond to you for baricitinib? Jeff Simmons : The pricing environment overall remains stable in Animal Health. We saw last year, as you know 4%, increase in our business. Industry averages have been between 2% and 3% and I believe that we've got different economic conditions across geographies and species, but a pretty stable market, so I would see it in the range of this industry average of between 2% and 3%. Dave Ricks : So baricitinib, we're right in the middle of Phase III readouts. As Phil mentioned previously, the first two studies we have toplined already. And you should expect to see some of that data presented at EBAR coming up in the middle of the year. This would be the beacon and build studies. Additionally we have an early RA study and then a first line biologic comparative study which is fully powered noninferiority against agumenubab Both of those studies, what we've said is in the second half of this year, will be topline in those. So exciting year for baricitinib and then sort shortly following all that we'll be submitting to FDA and other and other global regulators. In terms of how we compare our results to others, of course it's not appropriate to make direct - there are no direct comparison studies between topacitnin and baricitinib or the recent Galapagos data, but I think we've said all along, we'd like the Jack 1-2 signaling pathway, particularly in RA and we feel like baricitinib has the chance to be the best in class product, if you think of this as one whole class. And so far we're pleased with the results from the studies we have read out. Operator : We will go to the line of Kathy Miner of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Kathy Miner : Just two topics. First on ixekizumab, can you comment - I think on clinicaltrials.gov, it shows that the trials for ankylosing spondylitis was withdrawn. Can you comment whether you're still pursuing that indication? And also recently, we've seen some topline data from one of your competitors which had some very strong PASI 100 scores. Is that something mechanistically there's differences between these products? Or how can we look at that? And second question is just on guidance for 2015. I appreciate you've had a very strong first quarter and there were some timing issues and also you've highlighted very clearly the currency impacts going forward. But can you tell us whether Lilly has ever changed annual guidance in the first quarter historically? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Dave, if you could comment on the ixekizumab questions. And, Derica, Derica we've got one finally for you on financials. If you want to talk about the guidance? Dave? Dave Ricks : Sure. Thank you for the question on ixekizumab. To clarify, the ankylosing spondylitis study that was withdrawn was originally designed to be a supportive study for exposure through the PSA program, as we were several years ago and as we're midstream on the additional indication work for ixekizumab, we changed the strategy and that supportive evidence wasn't required anymore under the approach. So what we have with ixekizumab now is a complete set of studies in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and cover 1-2-3 studies. I'm not sure which competitor you're referring to on the PASI 100 scores, but we're pretty impressed with our PASI 100 scores, which, as you know, at the high end have achieved up to 41%. And I think that's as good as I've seen, but interested in - of course, if you have other insights on that. And [indiscernible] class, we do have differences. [indiscernible] which is now launched from Novartis in IL 17 A, antibody to the protein, so are we, whereas others have taken different approaches, notably the antigen approach which is a receptor antibody. So it would be not unexpected to have slightly different types of clinical results and safety profiles as a result of those differences. In terms of other things around ixekizumab, we recently toplined our first psoriatic arthritis study and we have another psoriatic arthritis study ongoing. And as it relates to an aspect, your original question, we remain interested in this indication and we think turning to IL 17 is a logical step and could advance care for this very debilitating condition. Derica Rice : As for our guidance this year, historically, yes, we have; it has happened. I would say it's not common. But we do look at it each and every quarter to see if there's anything meaningful enough to cause us to move our estimates. As I stated earlier in my opening remarks, we're off to a very good start to the year. Despite the FX headwinds, we're driving volume growth in those areas we had anticipated, at least versus our internal expectations. And that coupled with the good cost-containment efforts really is driving our strong bottom-line performance. And as importantly, we do expect to return to growth for the year this year in 2015. So we're very encouraged by our start to the year and we'll keep you updated as we progress through the remaining months. Operator : And we will go to the line of back to David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. David Risinger : Sorry about that earlier. So I have three questions. First, with respect to the two-year extension Sola data that's forthcoming, could you just please provide a framework for us for what data set we should be expecting? How you might carve out the mild patients? Any caveats that you would highlight before we see the data? Second, with respect to glargine, could you remind us your timing for launch in Europe and in the U.S.? And then on the Erbitux deal, Derica, maybe you could just explain some of the income statement mechanics we should be thinking about for late this year? And then the accretion from that deal in 2016? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Dave Ricks, if you could talk about the two-year extension, how people should be thinking about that? Both the general framework of what they might be expecting to see in the data or what we'd like to be seeing in the data? We'll be carving out mild patients and any caveats to be provided. Enrique, over to you for the timing for launch for glargine, both U.S. and EU. And then, Derica, if you want to comment on the Erbitux mechanics. If not, I can chime in as well. So Dave, over to you first. Dave Ricks : We said previously we'd be hoping to disclose that data middle of this year. The two-year extension from EXPEDITION 1 and 2, we have disclosed at CCAD November 14 some of the earlier data and just on limitations just a few comments. Of course this is open label data. It's a progressive and significant disease burden on the patients. So you never get 100% completing all the way through and probably most importantly, patients in EXPEDITION 1 and 2 were not deselected for lack of amyloidosis. And so we still have a mixed-cause dementia in the study which, of course, we've corrected in EXPEDITION 3. That said, I think there is two primary effects, one we would hope to see, to answer the question did you see disease modification in the controlled phase of EXPEDITION 1 and 2? And we will be focused on the mild patients. You'll see that broken out. One is that there's no catch-up, meaning that if you start later, you can get to the same point. I think one definition of disease modification is that it's a daily progression and therefore starting earlier is better. But I think then you'd also hope to see that the later-started patients would also follow a parallel curve of decay to those who are on the drug the whole time, so there is a drug effect. And, in a sense, one could say we didn't just get lucky with randomization in the first set of studies. So those are two comments and color to frame what we'll see in July. Enrique Conterno : Sure. So when it comes to glargine, we're anticipating launching in Europe late in the summer of this year. And in the U.S., as you are aware, we're subject to a 30-month stay. We do have a trial happening later this year in the month of September. Assuming, of course, that we have a favorable resolution of that trial prior to the 30-month stay, we would be launching earlier. But the 30-month stay basically takes us into Q3 of 2016. Derica Rice : Dave, on Erbitux, it might be helpful to review really quickly the current accounting. So essentially when you look at things like our investor workbook we post on the website and look at the detailed product revenue tab, you'll see that there are two different lines. One is for the net revenue that we book, which is essentially 39% of the revenue that actually is sold, for example, by Bristol, offset by some of the third-party royalty obligations that exist. And then you'll see a second line, which is the sale of bulk product to Bristol for which we've booked the cost of sales in our cost of sales as well. That sales number for the API that we produced and the cost of sales are not largely different numbers. As you think about going forward, once we transition the product back to Lilly from Bristol, we will sell to end customers and book the full sales. We will have no longer any kind of bulk sales out to them, so the full cost of bulk will hit our cost of sales and we'll also have the finished cost of sales through third parties that Bristol currently would show on their income statement. We'll also have additional selling, marketing and R&D expenses related to ongoing supportive brand. And then on a GAAP basis, we would also have amortization of intangible. And I'm not sure exactly which line that hits. I think it's likely going to be hitting our cost of sales line for our reported or GAAP results. There are likely to be some other accounting-related effects that could happen essentially as we're monitoring over time and truing up the asset that has been created as well as the liability that has been created as part of the, essentially, business combination type accounting that was applied for this particular business development deal. But the major effects, I believe, are the ones I just outlined for you. We would expect it to be accretive starting in 2016. I'm not in a position at this point in time to quantify how much. I would underscore that the basis for the deal really is value as the long-term owners for the asset [indiscernible] originally scheduled to come back to us in late 2018. We believe we're best-positioned to be the stewards of it up until that time and overall this should allow us to drive better value for the company for the life of the assets. David Risinger : So the benefits of it coming back to you - in think you said late 2018, basically, are shifting forward to 2016? Derica Rice : That's correct, but there is a different set of economics that will govern those two periods. Since Bristol had a larger economic right through the end or near the end of 2018, we'll have different economics between now and September of 2018. After September of 2018, both currently under the existing agreement as well as under the revised agreement once it's implemented, we have full North American rights with no trailing obligations to Bristol. Operator : We do have a follow-up from the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. John Boris : Just on evacetrapib, just has to do mechanistically and also in your clinical plan, you're capturing high vis data. Can you maybe address the HDL elevation component and whether you're going for a slowing of the progression or reversal of the regression or reversal of the accumulation of plaque in the arteries? And then any animal model data that potentially substantiates what you're doing on the ivis side? Crestor [ph] is one of the few molecules that have been able to get - slow up the progression in their label from using [Technical Difficulty], but just your commentary on that would be helpful. Phil Johnson : Dave, if you want to answer? And obviously, Jan, you're probably well-positioned to provide some comments as well. Dave? Dave Ricks : Sure. And, Jan, please jump in. Of course, all along we've been saying with this program we've powered it based on the LDL impacts and what you're expecting around 30%. However, we also believe that at very high levels of HDL, reduction can impact cardiovascular risk. And of note, at the recent cardiovascular meeting in San Diego in March, Dan Raider's lab presented some interesting data regarding cholesterol eflux with evacetrapib, which demonstrated a very substantial degree of eflux out of the plaque to the macrophage back to the liver of cholesterol. And this is the mechanistic underpinning for believing in the type of HDL raising we're providing being additive to that cardiovascular event reduction. Off-line we can refer you to that paper, John. Jan, do you have anything else to add? Jan Lundberg : No. Phil Johnson : And then one follow-up then for Dave's question. My counterpart over at Bristol-Myers Squibb, John Elicher, would probably want me to point out that there will be, during this period on Erbitux, from Q4 this year through late 2018, a payment that we will be making to Bristol-Myers Squibb. I believe subsequently they'll be disclosing the amount of that payment with their SEC filing and that payment for us would show up in cost of sales. Operator : We have no further questions in queue. Phil Johnson : Excellent. Thank you. Derica, if you'd like to close the call? Derica Rice : Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Please note that we'll host a call from ADA on Sunday evening, June 7, to provide an update on our diabetes business. And do keep an eye out for conference calls later this summer to discuss Phase III data for both ixekizumab and baricitinib. Finally, if you have questions we did not address during today's call, please contact our IR team and they'll be happy to help. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

Welcome to the Q2 2015 Earnings Call. At this time all participant lines are in a listen-only mode and later there will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to John Lechleiter. Please go ahead. John Lechleiter : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, who is President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling, and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team. We're also joined by Dr. Eric Siemers. Eric is a distinguished medical fellow for our Alzheimer's disease team. He is dialing in from Washington where he is attending the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Lilly's positive momentum continued in the second quarter as we delivered solid underlying business performance with productivity improvements driving bottom line leverage with double-digit operating income and EPS growth. And we again saw significant pipeline progress including multiple regulatory approvals and submissions along with positive Phase II and Phase III data readouts. As usual I will begin today's call by highlighting key events that have occurred since our first quarter earnings call in late April. We've seen advances on a number of fronts. Starting with commercial milestones. In Japan we began promotion of Cyramza for gastric cancer. The gastric cancer indication in this market represents a significant opportunity for this product. Here in U.S. we began a promotion of Cyramza for second line metastatic colorectal cancer following FDA approval of this indication day after our last earnings call. On the regulatory front we achieved a number of milestones. In diabetes we received approval in Japan for Trulicity, our once weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of Type II diabetes. We also received FDA approval for Humalog U-200 KwikPen for the treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received European commission approval for Synjardy. This is a single-pill therapy that combines empagliflozin and metformin for the treatment of adults with Type II diabetes. Here in the U.S. the FDA issued a complete response letter for Synjardy and Boehringer Ingelheim has already submitted their response. We're pleased the resubmission was granted a two-month review and we're hopeful we'll be able to bring this product to market in the U.S. yet this year. Moving to oncology as I mentioned a moment ago we received FDA approval for Cyramza in second line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also completed our submission for the same indication in Japan. In addition the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, ODAC, reviewed the data supporting our submission for necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for us increase first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We were encouraged by the constructive discussion on the benefit risk profile of necitumumab. We believe necitumumab represents a meaningful advancement in treatment. And moving to our Biomedicines business we submitted Ixekizumab in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis following our U.S. submission in the first quarter. Clearly this continues to be an exciting and busy time for our regulatory colleagues across the globe. On the clinical front we presented detailed Phase III data on three different molecules and highlighted these data on investor calls. First was the presentation of Phase III data for basal insulin PEG lispro in patients with Type I and Type II diabetes at the ADA meeting. As we've stated in the past, we decided to delay regulatory submission to generate additional safety-related data. Next was the presentation of data from the first two of our four pivotal trials for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis at the U.R. [ph] in Rome. We're are encouraged by the Phase III data we've seen to date and we look forward to the data readouts from the final two pivotal trials later this year. Last was the presentation of Phase III data for Ixekizumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at the World Congress of Dermatology meeting. We believe Ixekizumab has demonstrated a compelling risk profile in clinical work to date and that Ixekizumab could help patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis better manage their disease and improve their quality of life. Further we believe that the level of efficacy and the safety profile demonstrated by biologic agents targeting IL-17A in psoriasis represent a meaningful improvement to currently available therapeutic options and could be a catalyst for greater use of biologics in the treatment of this disease. Just yesterday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference we presented two-year extension data from the Expedition Ext trial. We believe the data are consistent with a potential disease modifying effect of solanezumab on underlying disease progression and we look forward to completion of the Expedition 3study in late 2016. Apart from these Phase III data disclosures we also had some earlier data presentations that garnered investor interest. Specifically at the ASCO meeting we presented Phase II data for Olaratumab in soft tissue sarcoma. While at the American Headache Society meeting, we presented initial Phase IIb data on our CGRP monoclonal antibody in episodic migraine. We're enthusiastic about the opportunity for both of these molecules. Derica will provide an important update Olaratumab later in the call. On the business development front we announced five oncology deals spanning collaborations with AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Sarah Cannon Research Institute and Immunocore. This is consistent with comments that we made earlier this year that you should expect to see us increase the level of our business development activity through partnerships, licensing, and acquisitions at ever earlier stages of development. In addition, we struck a deal with Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in the area of immunology and we announced a sales collaboration in Japan with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma for Trulicity. In other news we received a positive ruling from the U.K. Court of Appeal, which held that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be indirectly infringed by a generic competitor. This ruling reversed the initial U.K. court's decision granting declarations of non-infringement in France, Italy, and Spain. We announced plans to establish a new drug delivery and device innovation center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Lily Cambridge Innovation Center in Kendall Square will help attract top scientists and bioengineers as well as enhance our business development presence in the Boston area. And just this morning we announced plans to effectively double our research presence at our Lilly Biotechnology Center in San Diego, California. On the financial side we took advantage of very low European interest rates to issue \u20ac2.1 billion of debt while retiring $1.65 billion of higher coupon U.S. debt. Finally in the second quarter we repurchased $125 million of stock, leaving $3.3 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the second quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil Johnson : Thanks, John. Before I discuss our Q2 results it may be helpful to review some key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rates versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health while 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition. For our non-GAAP measures we now exclude amortization of intangibles and to provide you a better idea of the underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we had closed the acquisition on January 1 of 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we're reporting financials this year. Now let's look at our results for the quarter. Slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business please. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. Moving to slide nine you can see that Q2 revenue was nearly $5 billion. The decrease of 4% compared to Q2 2014 reflects significant foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding FX our Q2 revenue [indiscernible] on a non-GAAP basis. As we discussed before this year we will feel the negative effect of the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. This quarter sales of those two products in the U.S. declined by over $110 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue increased 6% this quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 2.5 percentage points going from 76.7% to 79.2%. This increase was driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which increased cost of sales in Q2 last year but decreased cost of sales in Q2 this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent declined by one percentage point going from 77.2% in last year's quarter to 76.2% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll see a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. We continue to drive productivity improvements across our business. Total operating expense defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A declined by 7% or over $200 million compared to Q2 2014. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 8% while R&D declined 5%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, cost reductions in the combined Animal Health organization, and ongoing cost containment efforts across Lily partially offset by marketing expenses to support recent product launches. The reduction in R&D expense was driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. As implied by our full-year guidance we do expect the level of R&D spend to be higher for the remainder of the year as we start Phase II trials for files for tonizimab [ph], our CGRP monoclonal antibody, olaratumab, and additional indications for Cyramza. Other income and expense was income of $29 million this quarter and our tax rate was 20.8%, a decrease of 2.3 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit realized this quarter. Also our tax rate in both periods did not include the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions including the R&D Tax Credit as those provisions had lapsed. At the bottom line net income increased 20% while earnings per share increased 22% reflecting the benefit of our share repurchase. Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year while slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 21. Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue. On slide 12 in the yellow box at the bottom of the page you'll see the total revenue decline of 4% on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline as you see the 8% negative effect from FX this quarter with a favorable volume effect of 3% and favorable price effect of 1%. By geography you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 3% driven by price, partially offset by volume. And international operations Australia, Canada and Europe or ACE you'll see that there was a decline in revenue of 19% that was almost entirely driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange while on a constant currency or performance basis ACE revenue decreased just 1%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales resulting from a loss of data package exclusivity. In Japan pharma revenue increased 14% in total while on a constant currency or performance basis increased 37%. The size of this increase was influenced by a weak comparison period. Recall that in Q1 2014 we experienced substantial wholesaler buying in advance of an increase in the local consumption tax, which led to corresponding reduction in wholesaler buying in Q2 2014. Consequently the performance growth of 10% for the first half of this year is more reflective of the underlying trends in Japan. Turning to emerging markets we saw a revenue decline of 15% driven by a negative foreign exchange effect of 12%. On a performance basis emerging market sales declined 4% driven by lower sales in China and the negative effect of the Brazil Humulin tender we had last year. This quarter our pharma revenue in China declined 16% driven by lower volume. On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of that year, Alanco Animal Health declined 4%. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange Alanco revenue increased 3%. Moving to slide 14 you'll see the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q2 2015 results. This quarter, as mentioned earlier, FX was a top line headwind reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by eight percentage points. In terms of cost of goods sold, however, FX provided a substantial benefit, which led to FX having essentially no impact on operating income and EPS. At the bottom of the slide you can see that our non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter grew 22% with and without FX. Slide 15 shows our pipeline as of July 20 with changes since our last earnings call highlighted, green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. In terms of advancement you'll see that our CGRP monoclonal antibody has moved into Phase III with initiation of pivotal trials in cluster headache. And we initiated Phase II testing for an oncology molecule. We also terminated element of our oral glucagon receptor antagonist for diabetes in Phase II as well as for five Phase I molecules. With that update I'll now turn the call over to Derica. Derica Rice : Thanks, Phil. As on our prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we've projected for 2015 and then review our 2015 financial guidance. Turning to slide 16 you'll see that a majority of events anticipated for 2015 have already occurred in the first six months of the year with the vast majority being positive. Since our last earnings call, we've achieved a number of additional milestones. We initiated Phase III trials for Cyramza in both first-line EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer and in second-line urothelial cancer as well as for our CGRP monocolonal antibody in cluster headache. As John mentioned earlier we had a number of detailed disclosure at medical meetings for basal insulin PEG lispro, baricitinib, ixekizumab, and solanezumab. You will also see that we updated the regulatory submissions category to reflect Japanese submission for ramucirumab for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer and European submission of ixekizumab for psoriasis. As we announced on our ixekizumab investor call we've added an event to our key event list for the simultaneous submission of ixekizumab in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Earlier John mentioned the presentation at ASCO of the Phase II for Olaratumab in soft tissue sarcoma. These data were compelling and included a 10-month overall survival benefit in patients in the treatment arm that received Olaratumab. I'm pleased to announce that based on the ongoing discussions with the FDA we intend to submit U.S. and European regulatory applications for Olaratumab in soft tissue sarcoma based on these data, or based on these Phase II data. We hope to complete the U.S. submission before the end of 2015. As a result you'll see a new item on our list of key events to reflect this positive development. In addition, the FDA has granted a Olaratumab breakthrough designation. We're pleased that Olaratumab is the third in-clone molecule following Cyramza and ixekizumab that has generated promising clinical data and that could help patients with cancer live longer. You will also see new checkmarks to reflect three approvals John discussed earlier : Japanese approval for ramucirumab in second-line gastric cancer and dulaglutide Type II diabetes. And in the U.S. approval for Humalog U-200 KwikPen. Finally in the other section you'll see the green checkmarks for the positive Alimta ruling from the U.K. Court of Appeal and we now have a date in mid, for mid-November for the appeals hearing at the European patent office. We noted in the past that 2015 is another year where we're focused on demonstrating successful execution of our innovation-based strategy. We're pleased with the progress we made in the past few years and so far this year and believe this progress solidifies our near to medium-term growth prospects. Turning to our 2015 financial guidance, we've raised the bottom end of our revenue range to reflect the solid underlying performance for the first six months of the year and the launch trajectories of Jardiance, Trulicity, and Cyramza. We've also modestly increased the range for our non-GAAP other income to reflect net gains on investments realized to date and added a new line for GAAP other income that reflects the debt repurchase charge. To reflect the discrete tax benefit booked in Q2 we've reduced our non-GAAP tax rate by about 50 basis points. And our GAAP tax rate also reflects the impact of the debt repurchase and the BioNTech charges. At the bottom line we've raised our non-GAAP EPS range by $0.10 and now forecast full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share. Our new GAAP EPS range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share has been updated for this same $0.10 increase as well as the Q2 charges we booked for the debt repurchase and the BioNTech deal. Finally I want to point out that we own shares of Receptos and you've undoubtedly seen Celgene's offer to buy receptors for $232 per share. At this time, it is not clear to us when a deal may get done and we've not made a determination of what we will do with our shares. We'll monitor this situation and we will incorporate any necessary changes into our future guidance updates. In summary, while our second quarter revenue reflects the impact of foreign exchange headwinds and the lingering effects of U.S. patent expirations for Cymbalta and Evista, we remain on track to return to growth in 2015 driven by excellent progress in our innovation-based strategy. We had solid underlying business performance and our continued focus on productivity and cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line while providing the capacity to fully invest in our new product launches and to pursue additional promising pipeline opportunities. This solid business performance was the primary driver for increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance. With tangible results from our innovation-based strategy we aim to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade. As we discussed in the past you'll see sharpen our focus on areas where we're best positioned to compete and win and we'll continue to find ways to increase productivity and do the work of pharmaceutical R&D better. This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil? Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Derica. Leah [ph], if you could provide instructions for the Q&A session we'll get started with caller's questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks for the question. So congratulations on a strong quarter. Derica, maybe you can just or overall if you guys can give us your thoughts on how you see the progression of Alimta sales outside of the U.S. going forward? Sort of if we just kind of exclude the competitive landscape and think about it independent just with the court rulings how you see that going forward and what amount of sales is actually reflected and represented by that, how durable you think that is? The second question, so as we think about the evacetrapib opportunity if you guys could give us any additional color you could provide on the number of events, the powering of the study? I know you said 15% power in the past, but historically when we've seen studies like this it's conservatively powered. So 15% at 95% or 98% reduction would imply somewhere between 1,400 and 1,600 events. So it would be really helpful to understand how conservatively powered your 15 assumption is on evacetrapib? And then lastly on all Olaratumab just in terms of the market opportunity in soft tissue sarcoma, can you just give us a quick update on your thoughts there in terms of the patient size in the U.S. and then also globally? Thanks a lot. Phil Johnson : Great, Seamus. Thank you for the questions. I'll go ahead and actually provide some context on your first question on Alimta O-U.S. and some of the exposures there. And then, Dave, if you'll talk about the second question for that evacetrapib powering? And then, Sue, if you'll handle the Olaratumab question? So, Seamus, for O-U.S. if we go back to the guidance call early January, we had mentioned that last year we had about $880 million in Alimta sales in Europe. We'd indicated that about $80 million of that amount would already be subject to loss of exclusivity in markets where we did not have the compound patent or the longer dated vitamin dose regimen patent. Of the remaining $800 million about $175 million was represented by Germany with the rest being the other European countries, of which France is the largest by far followed by Germany and then Italy and Spain with U.K. being clearly the smallest of them. So hopefully as you're thinking about rulings we've had so far in Germany and rulings out of the U.K. court that provides you some basis to understand the level of exposure that's there. For Japan I don't have last year's number but I do have this quarter's number in front of me since we also have litigation ongoing in Japan. We have $67 million in Q2. We had $57 million of Alimta revenue in Japan in Q1. The emerging markets business is a similar size to Japan where we had about $63 million in revenue this quarter and about $63 million last quarter as well. So the major exposure really is for O-U.S. the European both litigation in specific countries that's ongoing and as mentioned on the call earlier the outcome of the European patent office appeal hearing that will occur in November. Dave? David Ricks : Sure. Yeah, Seamus, thanks for the question on anacetrapib. What we've said in the past is we're powered to show the effect size on LDL alone. And so your range there is about right. I don't think we've got into the exact number of events and I would remind the investors we extended the trial by six months, which is part of our Q1 communication, which actually adds to the event total that we'll see. So in a sense that may increase the powering of the study although not markedly. So the study was designed to show an effect on LDL alone. Using the Oxford curve [ph] that we've seen play out through time we estimate about a 30% reduction in LDL so thus the mid-teens [indiscernible] outcome and that is looking at the quintuple endpoint. We also have a minimal threshold for the triple hard end points of death, MI, and stroke. And we believe we have ample events now as we look at the data coming in mid-next year. Phil Johnson : Sue? Susan Mahoney : Yeah. And with regards to Olaratumab, so the size of the market, it's about 11,900 patients who are diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in the U.S. For drug treatment there's about 5,800 and U.S. And then O-U.S. about 5,000 again. I think the important thing here is that there really hasn't been anything approved or shown an overall survival advantage in about three decades in this tumor type. So it's a big unmet need and we're very excited by the data that we have and the opportunity to bring Olaratumab hopefully to patients. So we have announced that we'll be filing based on discussions with the FDA in the U.S. and we also anticipate doing that in Europe too. We also are planning to initiate a Phase III study over the next few months in Q3 and to do some pediatric studies. So I have to say we're excited about the opportunity with this molecule. Phil Johnson : Yeah. Just a real quick add-on to that, Seamus. I think clearly and for good reason there's been a lot of interest in the investment community on immune-oncology agents that have shown durable responses for a number of patients. While this is not in that nice shiny penny of immune-oncology, the kind of benefit that we saw for overall survival is quite striking. You're talking about 25 months of overall survival compared to 15 months on the comparator arm. So while this is a smaller patient population, an orphan drug essentially type of patient population, we're very enthusiastic about the data we've shown to date. Leah, next caller please? Operator : And the next question is from the line of Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Mr. Bernstein your line is, excuse me, Mr. Anderson your line is open. Timothy Anderson : Yes. Thank you. A few questions. On solanezumab, obviously the AAIC data presented yesterday. I'm wondering if you can talk about that in the context of Expedition 3and how you will be, I should say, how or whether you will be incorporating a delayed start design into that trial. And really is that something that you would likely need for approval? Or is that something that could come later? In other words is it a regulatory necessity to show results on a delayed start design? Or is it more of a labeling matter? Second question is on Amyvid, your AD imaging agent. Kind of a rounding error commercially but it seems that PET imaging in the future could have some real value when it helps, when it comes to kind of helping rule in Alzheimer's disease. Is there an unappreciated commercial opportunity at some point in the future with the product? And then last question just on diabetes. If I look at sales levels of various products, it seemed to track below what I would've expected in different geographies and I'm wondering if that speaks to an increased level of price erosion that might've impacted results? Phil Johnson : Great, Tim. Thanks for the questions. Dave, if you can handle the solanezumab Expedition 3and Amyvid questions? And then, Enrique, the diabetes question. And obviously, Chito, if you want to make any comments on the growth in emerging markets with diabetes products, please do chime in. Dave? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Tim, for the questions. I'll try to handle these and if I get in trouble my experts also online can help. First, regarding the data we showed yesterday on the Expedition Ext or extension study, this is a very long-term set of data with the drug effect in Alzheimer's. And I think we're pleased to see that the safety of the product continues to look very good in this population. We're happy that the delayed start impact we had hoped to see was displayed and that the later patients coming on to sola after the 18-month blinded period did in fact not catch up as tested statistically but also numerically visible and that the treatment effect appeared to persist. So on the back of that though it's important to note that, that's only important if Expedition 3is positive. This does not represent a basis for submission or - because it's not a blinded assessment. But I think those are encouraging signs for us. And as you know and we've said many times on calls like this, we think included a number of features in Expedition 3, which give us a good shot to really thoroughly test the question of solanezumab in mild patients including your question on PET screening. So I'll jump to that, which is we believe it's essential to eliminate from these studies and in clinical practice to screen for amyloid in patient who have dementia to really define the underlying cause. Of course that's consistent with Alzheimer's disease versus other types of dementia. Right now Amyvid is available commercially in the U.S. and many European markets. It is not a major product for us today. As you know it's not reimbursed by CMS in the U.S. for instance. I would frame this I guess in three ways. It's useful for patients, for treators, and for our company. Why is - sales would be expected to increase of Amyvid should disease modifying agents become available including solanezumab because I expect most of those labels and/or payer requirements will force patients to have confirmed amyloidosis to be eligible. That's good news, but probably still wouldn't be a massive undertaking in terms of revenue impact for the company. But it's also important to look at the PET capabilities we have in two other frames. One is as a drug development tool. And really operationally being able to manage a clinical network a site that has ready access to the Amyvid PET has really helped us enroll studies quickly and make sure that we can scan patients in a timely way, keep them in the study, and synchronize that complicated machine that allows us to get Expedition 3done for instance, and future studies like the base program with AZ. And then finally and particularly for something like our Tau Tracer, which is in Phase II, these are very useful drug discovery and scientific tools to help us accelerate and make good decisions about earlier phase Alzheimer's programs. So these are really essential parts of our total Alzheimer's vision and we'll talk more about that in December at our Investor Meeting focused on Alzheimer's. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. So as we look at our diabetes business, there were a number of one-time events that are impacting the quarter-to-quarter results and I thought first I would say that the underlying business fundamentals are good, not just when it comes to volume. But we've not seen any significant changes when it comes to contracting or additional price pressures over and above what we're seeing before. Let me speak to Humalog for a second. In Q2 of last year, we had a significant adjustment related to, positive adjustment related to managed Medicaid. That was about five points in terms of the impact when we look at the compare of Q2 of 2015 versus Q2 of 2014. We had a little bit of de-stocking also in the U.S. as we look at Q2. But as we look at the business fundamentals, we continue to feel good about our prospects. We also have some anomalies when it comes to Tradjenta and in this particular case there were two important adjustments that have been made over the last year or so. We made an adjustment in Q3 of 2014 that basically, a negative adjustment in Q3 of 2014 for Tradjenta sales because we had not accrued enough when it comes to our rebates. We were getting more of our business coming from Medicare than we had initially estimated. And then in Q2 of 2015, in Q2 of 2015 we had a negative adjustment. In essence we had overstated some of our sales in the first half of 2014 and we have in a certain way understated our sales in the first half of 2015. To make this simpler the bottom line is if we were to normalize for some of these onetime effects and we were to reassign the accruals to the right quarter, our net sales would be growing in the case of Tradjenta in the U.S. about 15%. Clearly we have a very significant volume growth. Phil Johnson : Great. Leah, next caller, please. Operator : And the next question is from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions. With the commercial launch activity heightened in Japan can you maybe just walk us through the opportunities for Cyramza, Trulicity there and the type of pricing if you've received any innovation type pricing on Cyramza for gastric cancer there? Any relationship with Sumitomo with Trulicity and how you'll launch there? Second question on the CGRP antibody, can you maybe just walk through what the significant points of differentiation are relative to [indiscernible] who also have competitive antibodies here? And with the rollout of this earlier than anticipated in cluster headaches, just your thoughts on when you might be in a position to compete those clinicals? And then the third and final question for John Lechleiter just on the political front, can you maybe address two issues that seem to be taking center stage in Washington, most notably repatriation and your thoughts whether we're going to see something that happens their along with tax reform going forward? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great, John. Thanks for the questions. You got a good smattering of the management team involved here so let's see, Sue, if you'll start off talking about Japan Cyramza, how we'll proceed in that, any update we've got on pricing there? We'll stick with Japan and move over to Enrique for comments on Trulicity including the recently announced partnership for the commercialization of the product there. Dave, for the CG3 monoclonal antibody questions and then John for the two last questions on repatriation and tax reform. So, Sue, please start. Susan Mahoney : Yeah. Sure. Okay. With Cyramza we actually launched Cyramza on the 22 of June and we do see this as a really good opportunity for Cyramza given the unmet need there is in Japan and given the number of patients who are treated in Japan with gastric cancer. We estimate about 16,000 patients in Japan are treated in the second line gastric versus about 6,000, 4,000 to 6,000 in the U.S. So the opportunity there is great. The feedback that we've got from thought leaders is good and the initial feedback from the sales force again is very positive. So it's early days, 22nd of June launch. We did get a slight sales buy-in but clearly we'll be tracking the sales going forward. From a price perspective, yes, we have got the price. The bar price for the 500-milligram is \u00a5355,000 and for the 100-milligram is about \u00a575,000. So we'll give you the exact details on that but we feel good about the price we've got in Japan. Phil Johnson : Great. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. As we have said before when it comes to Trulicity overall expansion of the GLP-1 class is critical for us. Just to quote a few numbers in the U.S. when we look at new patient growth that number is now close to 50%, five zero, when we look at four weeks year-on-year or 13 weeks year-on-year. So we're clearly very pleased with that. When it comes to Japan, this is even more true just because in Japan the GLP-1 class has the lowest penetration in Type II diabetes of any major market. Now for us to accomplish this we have decided to partner with Dainippon Sumitomo in order to give us to have the appropriate reach when it comes to the small clinics. And this is going to be critical for us. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. Dave? David Ricks : Yeah. So on CGRP we're excited about this program. As was announced today we did initiate the cluster programs in both chronic and episodic in Q2. We don't have an exact timing at this point for the readout. It's enrollment dependent, John. But we would hope to be able to enroll those studies rapidly given the unmet need and then be able to submit those to regulators as quickly as possible. We'll give updates as we begin to see a little bit more rate on that and you can look at ClinicalTrials.gov, which we update religiously on these points. That is one of the sources of differentiation we might see for our program versus others, which is indications. At this point I just want to emphasize that there's a big market. There's about 14 million migrainers who could benefit from a preventative just in the U.S. and CGRP neutralization appears to have a very profound and so far looks relatively safe method for alleviating the suffering from this condition. So there's probably room for a number of players. Really we're going to have to wait to see the Phase III programs play out and often things like dose selection and frequency, et cetera will be different. And we'll see who comes up with the best data package at the end. Right now we're focused on execution and getting in the clinic with the Phase III program in the coming months and are excited by the recent Phase II readout we saw. Phil Johnson : Jan, do have anything to add on CGRP? Jan Lundberg : I think we are seeing several antibodies having more or less similar results, which I think is encouraging for the class as such. And the studies have been somewhat different in relation to the number of migraine headache days that has been the focus. Some studies have been episodic classical definition of 4 to 14, others have been 8 to 14 and there could potentially be a difference of the effects of these agents depending on how many migraine days you have. But I think overall we are very encouraged about this class for this large indication in all aspects. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. John? John Lechleiter : John, thanks for your question. I think speaking for Lilly in terms of the potential for tax reform, we're encouraged by many of the recent soundings that have come from Washington. We've been for as long as I've been CEO and I'm sure before that advocating for corporate tax reform. We have an uncompetitive tax system in this country. It puts American companies at a disadvantage. It actually discourages investment in the United States. So we would be very anxious to see a system that takes a territorial approach to taxation and as part of that if we enable some repatriation, obviously we would be broadly in favor of that. The devil is always the details but we're hopeful that short of comprehensive tax reform that current events the impetus for the Highway Trust Fund, et cetera might spur action here. And we're more than ready and willing to participate in a constructive discussion. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, John. Leah, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. And that is Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin : Thank you. John, just a quick question for you. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks your growing in trust in deal activity but mostly confined to partnerships, licensing deals, et cetera. Can you elaborate a little further on that? And in your mind is there - does this mean that you're not going to make acquisitions but rather focus on partnerships, licensing deals? And if you, if the answer is you're not, that you are interested in acquisition activity, is there a limit as to how big you would go? And would you consider using your equity? Just given where your multiple is I would think that, that would be something that would be advantageous to you now. And then a question for you, Derica. You've previously guided to the FX benefit on gross margin this year to unwind next year assuming exchange rates remain constant. Can you update us on what to expect in terms of the magnitude of that impact? Thanks very much. John Lechleiter : Okay. Jami, I'll start off. Thanks for the question. I think what we called out at the beginning of the year was our sentiment favoring deals done at ever earlier stages. I think this is not inconsistent with the trend you see in the industry. I think in terms of later-stage deals or maybe even larger-size deals, we're going to be guided first and foremost by the therapeutic categories where we've chosen to compete. And again I think we sort of outlined that quite distinctly at the beginning of the year. That would be diabetes, oncology, and neurodegeneration with emerging interest and presence in pain and in autoimmune disease, again depending on the outcomes of clinical studies. Obviously we filed ixekizumab. We fully intend to move into that psoriasis angle from an autoimmune perspective once we gain approval for that molecule. So if you go back and you look at the deals we've done since I became CEO in 2008, the ones that stand out obviously are ImClone. We think we can have as many as three molecules from that then existing ImClone portfolio that will eventually be on the pharmacy shelf that augmented and supplemented a presence we already had in oncology. The second biggest deal in that period of time was the Novartis Animal Health. We have been buyers, obviously, on the animal health side going back at least to the deal with Monsanto to acquire BST in the middle of the last decade. We very clearly aim to continue to build that business both through organic and inorganic means. I mean in between you have a variety of smaller deals. Abbott is a good example is a good example of a unique opportunity we saw to acquire technology that as Dave said earlier gives us a real boost and I think a competitive advantage in the Alzheimer's space. I think in terms of thinking about what the magnitude of something Lilly might consider, I think the Novartis ImClone deals kind of define that. At the same time we're not anxious to go out and pay inflated prices for the hot property of the moment. There's a bit of a, I think a bit of a bubble right now with respect to valuations on some of the smaller companies or the smaller entities in biotech. And I think it's better use of our, better for our shareholders and better use of our shareholder's equity to focus and foremost on our internal efforts, which are quite strong and I think quite robust in all these therapeutic areas and which we'll continue to augment and supplement aggressively by these earlier stage partnerships. Phil Johnson : Thanks, John. Derica? Derica Rice : Jami, in regards to gross margin we've said that each quarter we try to neutralize the impact of FX in gross margin by the additional slide that we provide that kind of shows you the normal run rate. And obviously this year we're running slightly above the mid-seventies. But we said when we - when I think towards 2016 to focus you all, you should be thinking about that 75% range of gross margin being net of FX. Phil Johnson : Great, Thanks, Derica. Leah, next call please. Operator : Next question is from the line for Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mark Schoenebaum : Hey, John. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the stock this year by the way. I was intrigued by John's comments that there's a bit of a biotech bubble since I cover biotech as well. That scared me. You ruined my day. But anyway actually I do have a question for John kind of building on John Boris' question. Just and I know you're very tuned into Washington. Just this general question, this comes up all the time but I feel like the volumes just turned up a little bit on the price point for cancer drugs given the pace of innovation there. I'd like to hear you kind of talk about your long-term view on that. Not your one or two-year kind of view but maybe put on your 10-year cap and just kind of ask the question are the current price points for cancer drugs sustainable if the current pace of innovation continues? And how you think the industry is going to react to any pricing pressure you might see? And then just on ixekizumab, the IL-17 antibody clearly the AstraZeneca Amgen announcement on - Amgen announced they were waiting for AstraZeneca. But on their decision to pull out of the partnership because the side effect profile is a big positive for you guys. I was just wondering if you could speak, if you would be willing to speak in more quantitative terms of what that might mean. Kind of how many patients you think will ultimately be on the drug, et cetera? This looks to me like it could be a multi-billion-dollar addition to your out year numbers. I just kind of want to know if I'm totally on the wrong track or not. Thank you very much. Phil Johnson : Mark, thanks for the question. So, John, if you'll start off and then we'll go to Dave for the ixekizumab question. John Lechleiter : Hi, Mark. I'm sorry if I ruined your day. I'll try to make it up in some way. Mark Schoenebaum : No problem. John Lechleiter : Okay. With respect to a lot of media attention and political kind of attention to the price point for cancer drugs, look, I think first and foremost up to the point where we have data, which does not include this year, we did a study that dates back to last year looking at the proportion of drug spend as part of total, the cost of total cancer care. It's remained remarkably consistent over a long period of time. So put another way, while today we hear a lot about the cost of cancer medicine, I'm not sure I've ever heard anybody complain about the cost of that long stay in the hospital that many of our drugs, these cancer drugs, help to minimize or to eliminate and that's because hospital stays are covered by insurance. I think the question is what's the cost to the patient and how can we ensure that more patients have access, affordable access, to cancer medicine just like they've got through their insurance policies affordable access today to other forms of care that are required for people with cancer. In terms of how we look at this in the long haul, I think we're going to have to wait and see how this plays out. We're already seeing in many of these classes two or more competitors emerging. We know in other classes of medicines, the diabetes would be one example we're familiar with, we see intense competition that has resulted in lower net effective prices based on negotiations that we must undertake with payers and insurers in that space. Obviously we haven't sort of seen that play out in quite the same way in oncology, but I think we should be encouraging innovation because innovation begets competition rather than discouraging innovation by threatening things like price cast et cetera. For a cancer patient, cancer medicines, particularly some of these new what you might call breakthrough therapies that we all know about, represent the highest quality and most medically effective approach we have in our material of any other intervention. So the calling these out for being simply based on price fails to look at the incredible value that these drugs bring, not in terms of avoiding or minimizing other system costs, but in terms of getting patients that precious additional time and quality of life that is so important. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks John. Dave? David Ricks : Yeah. So Mark, thanks for the question on Ixekizumab was mentioned in the call text we submitted in the U.S. and Europe and shortly in Japan and other major markets. We're excited about the program. In terms of our assets, that's what we're focused on, which is we see a drug here that is providing a whole new threshold of efficacy for patients suffering from moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We've reported PAZ-100 [ph] as high as 40% and PAZ-90 [ph] in sort of unprecedented range as well. So we think we've got a great asset and we had a special call in June about this and answered a number of questions about the psychiatric safety and as we said then, we don't see an imbalance numerically or statistically across arms, whether they be active comparators or the two doses of Ixekizumab. So we're proceeding through the regulatory process. Of course, we need to get through that with all the caveats. In terms of the market opportunity in psoriasis, depending on how you count it with PSA or not, I think people would say there's a $4 billion to $6 billion opportunity right now globally and I would just point out that in our estimates less than the treatment rate with biologics in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is probably less than half of RA. So there's just a huge amount of possibility for growth of biologics as a class in the space. Our vision for that is that the newer, more effective therapies will be a great way to drive interesting greater treatment in dermatology community. We think patients will demand it through time and the caveat there is of course, the normal access and regulatory processes are what stands between us and that opportunity. We don't know what will happen with the former Amgen asset. We're focused on our program and we think there's ample growth for a number of assets in psoriasis and we like our product. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Dave. Leah, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. It's the line of Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Maybe the first one on solanezumab and more broadly in Alzheimer's. I guess coming back from AIC, some of the feedback from the meeting is that the ARIA signal seen in some competitive products is largely asymptomatic and maybe be able to be treated through. I guess just being sure of your thoughts on ARIA and what that could mean for the competitive landscape. And maybe just part of that answer, if you could just talk a little bit more about you guys targeting monomer A-beta versus plaque given that you do have products going after both in the pipeline. Second question was a longer-term question on diabetes. There's been some market concern that this category only becomes more competitive over time and gets even more price pressure going forward. You guys obviously have a differentiated portfolio but how do you think about the risk of an even more conservative payer environment in this category going for forward? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Great, Chris. Thanks for the question. So first for the Alzheimer's disease, the ARIA signal and is this treatable, [indiscernible]. Jan, if you want to start out off with a few comments and, Eric, we may see if you have additional comments that you would like to add to that. Jan, certainly if you want to talk about sort of the plaque specific approach that we've got in the clinic and then Enrique for the price pressure in diabetes segment. Jan? Jan Lundberg : Yeah. Well in relation to the ARIA signal that was reported, I think first it's clear that Biogen has much more of that than solanezumab which I think is a key difference right now. Secondly, it was claimed that you can treat through it. On the other hand, Biogen also had dropouts I think to a large extent in the trial so it still needs to be seen in a larger situation than in phase 3 whether it really holds true and my view is that if you have an agent that doesn't have very much of this that, that's a competitive advantage for solanezumab. If you look at the types then of monomer AD antibodies versus plaque antibodies, we have both two selective agents then in Lily. Solanezumab targets then the monomer AD which is then a precursor in a way to the plaque. We have an agent in phase 1 called N3pG which is a pyroglutamate plaque specific antibody. And in preclinical experiments we have seen as a monotherapy for N3pG very good clearance then of amyloid deposits in transgenic models than of Alzheimer's disease in mice and it's even more efficacious if you combine it with an oral base inhibitor while you more or less have a total clearance of amyloid from these mice brains. What we also have seen in the preclinical experiments for N3pG the plaque specific antibody that did not give micro hemorrhage which is kind of related to the ARIA signal out to brain edema that the Alzheimer patients have. So we hope that we could have a plaque specific antibody with less impact then on the brain edema than what we currently see with a Biogen molecule. Phil Johnson : Great. And, Eric, do you have anything that you like to add for the discussion around the asymptomatic nature of our ability to treat, et cetera, that you feel has been adequately covered? Eric Siemers : Yeah. Well I just briefly mention that I think these are relatively early days in terms of the field sort of understanding how that may be managed. Fortunately with solanezumab we really haven't had to deal with the issue too much because it's just a half of percent in placebo treated and 1% in solanezumab treated without really any associated symptoms. But for other molecules where you do have ARIA that may be asymptomatic in two-thirds of people but it's so asymptomatic than in one-third of the people. So that's something that I think broadly in the field we'll just need to get more experience with. Phil Johnson : Great, Thanks, Eric. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. It's difficult to speculate when it comes to the payer environment on diabetes but I think it's helpful for us to be able to look back because that means, because that was the first class in diabetes that was under pressure when it comes to the narrowing of formularies. And that started sometime in 2009. Through this period from 2009 to today what we have been able to see is that Humalog, we've been able to have fairly stable net prices for Humalog over this period. If anything, they are slightly up but clearly not much. So I would say that yes it is likely that there's going to be narrowing of formularies in other segments in the diabetes space. But I do not expect a significantly different behavior when it comes to some of the net prices and Humulin insulin actually behaved. So that's basically what I would offer there. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. Leah, can we move to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. It's the line of Steve Scala with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have three questions. Even at the high end of your new EPS guidance range, it implies a slightly down second half after a very strong first half. Other than a tougher compare in Q4, what is driving the second half weakness? It seems like Lilly is setting up for a better-than-expected second half as well. Secondly, on Jardiance, the CV [ph] outcomes data in Q3, since it is Q3, is the data in house? How will it be released? And Enrique, are you anything but very confident in the data? And then lastly, what does the lowering of the ADAS-Cog delta at the end of EXPEDITION 1 and 2 from the 2.01 to the 1.83 in July tell us about the patients enrolled and or how they changed over time? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great, Steve. Thank you for the questions. So clearly, Derica, to you on the first question related to the guidance in the second half performance, Enrique for the Jardiance CV [ph] outcomes, and then Dave, if you want to kick off the response for the ADAS-Cog question we received. Derica? Derica Rice : Good morning, Steve. We've had really solid underlying performance in the first six months of this year. And we expect that that solid performance to continue for the second half of this year as well. What you should see also in the second half of the year, and I'm going to kind of reflect on some of the comments that Phil made in his remarks, where in the second half we do expect to make incremental investments in our R&D pipeline given the positive data readouts that we've seen. So we talked about the start of phase 3 trials for tanezumab, our CGRP monoclonal antibody, laratumab, as we highlighted earlier, as well as the intent to invest in additional indications for Cyramza. And as we continue to see more positive data readouts, you'll see is fully investing in our pipeline opportunities. At the same time, as you heard Sue say, we're in the midst of launching in Japan for Cyramza as well as the ongoing launches in other geographies. So we will fully invest behind that as well. So we really are expecting our top line momentum to continue. You'll see us continue to drive productivity gains, but what that does is it gives us the capacity to make these kinds of investments while still returning to growth this year and margin expansion. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Derica. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Steve, we expect to see the data this quarter, to see the data soon. As we have said, once we have the opportunity to see the data, we will issue a top line press release with the results. We are planning to showcase those results in September at EASD, but that's as much as I can share right now. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. Dave? David Ricks : Yeah. As it relates to the question of, I guess, the final endpoint displayed in the cooled mild EXPEDITION 1 and 2, two-and-a-half years ago, versus what was displayed yesterday, you're right, there is a small difference. I think that you mentioned it there. In terms of what those absolute numbers are and the difference, the reason for this, and I'll try to put this in very lay terms, is the statistical technique that is both preferred by the FDA sort of by consensus and we use in Alzheimer's studies is called MMRM. It's different from other techniques you may have seen like LOCF. What it does is it relies on all the data available to estimate the missing data. And this technique is thought to reduce type I error. That's what the FDA prefers. It's a technique we used in both assessments that you're referring to. Because the second assessment includes more data, that is the continuing patients, the number does move around slightly. The core data underneath it is identical. That data was locked in 2012, and it's the same data. What we're doing is estimating missing data using this statistical technique. So I'm not sure there's much news or read through with that but if you'd like to learn more, Steve, we could set up the background on why that occurs. The bottom line take away is I think the same that there is a meaningful difference at the end of the 18 months, and that difference persisted through the open label extension. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Dave. Leah, next caller, please. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Andrew Baum from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Okay. Thanks. Just returning to the question of building out your immuno-oncology franchise. And would you mentioned some of the deals you've done. And I know you've had these two very experienced immuno-oncologists. Some of your competitors are engaged in rather more frenetic activity in this area. So along those lines, three questions. Number one, in terms of preclinical, one wouldn't normally ask about compounds but [indiscernible] very fast in this category. Is there anything close to clinic from your preclinical portfolio within the next 6 to 12 months? Second, what is the disease [ph] interest in adoptive cell [ph] therapy given your highest individual [ph] was closely aligned in that area? And finally, should we assume that you have largely done the build out [indiscernible] ? Or as I suspect you're really just getting going in terms of building out franchise? Many thanks. Phil Johnson : Okay, great. Thank you very much for the questions. I think, Sue, you want to handle those? January, feel free to chime in if you'd like to complete any of the answer? Sue? Susan Mahoney : Yeah, sure. So as you've seen, we have had a lot of activity. I wouldn't say it's frenetic. I think that was the word you used, frantic, but we have got focused activity in three areas in our R&D portfolio and strategy. We are focused on cell signaling, the micro environment, and immuno-oncology. And we will continue to focus on those areas because we believe that it's going to be rational combinations of molecules within those three areas that's going to be important in the future. With regard to immuno-oncology, as you said, we have a number of announcements that we've made on collaborations over the past 12 months and it's really into areas. One is in partnership to combine our pipeline and marketed products with agents. In fact, we have seven trials either planned or ongoing in combinations with ROI [ph] agents with four different companies. And then we have our own clinical development where we have three agents in clinical development : our TGF-beta, small molecule inhibitor, our CXEL 4 [ph] inhibitor, and a TSF-1R [ph] antibody. And then we do have a number of agents in discovery. I don't know if January wants to comment more but we have a number of agents in discovery and we do see that we're going to be bringing some of the I-O agents out over the coming months and years. So I think on the cell therapy, yes, it's an area that we look at. It's not an area that we are driving at this point in time but I think we need to look at all areas in I-O. And we see this as - the I-O there's so many unknowns at the moment in I-O and our view is this is a long-term plan. We're going to be smart in where we focus. We've really looked at T cell [ph] redirection as an area and you can see that a number of the deals that we have done are in that area. And I think that covers the question. Anything you want to answer or add, Jan? Jan Lundberg : It's evident in immuno-oncology that we've seen the first generation of single agents then, like the PD-1 and PD-L1. And we are part of the second generation coming, when we are combining, for instance, different checkpoints inhibitors into bio-specific antibodies. And we also are very keen to activate T cells in a more specific way using the Immunocore technology. So I think we are just seeing the first door open in the immuno-oncology field and there is very much more to do. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. Leah, next caller please. Operator : Next question is from the line of Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tony Butler : Yeah, thanks very much. Three brief questions from me. I wanted to go back to Tim's question on solanezumab. [indiscernible] modification from EXPEDITION 3, is that still potentially a theme [ph] that the FDA could get you? Or are there some other statistics or clinical information that you may need to show them? Phil Johnson : Tony, I'm not sure you can hear me. We're having a real hard time making out the question. Can you repeat it? John Lechleiter : Start again. Phil Johnson : Yeah. Are you there, Tony? Operator : His line is still connected. Tony Butler : Yes, hi. Is this better? Phil Johnson : Yes, it is. Yeah, thank you. Tony Butler : My apologies. So back to Tim's question on solanezumab, I'd like to just understand, is Expedition 3 itself sufficient for a disease modification claim? Or will other clinical information be required? Second, is there any or could you elaborate on the biological rationale for JAK1/JAK2 which could be more beneficial in RA or in dropping AACR source versus an anti-TNF? And third I guess just to Sue as you think about Cyramza at least in the U.S. and we'll leave out CRC for the moment, where are you getting the best traction with respect to non-small cell lung or gastric? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great, Tony. Thanks for the questions. So Dave, if you'll talk about maybe the first two, Yon [ph] feel free to complement the answer as well and then Sue for the question on Cyramza, particularly here in the U.S. what we're seeing. Dave? David Ricks : Yeah. Good question on Expedition 3. We've designed this to be a stand-alone pivotal study to support registration of solanezumab in Alzheimer's patients. In terms of the exact claims underneath that, the FDA themselves have admitted they've been vague and it's a moving landscape because the science is moving so fast in Alzheimer's, I'm aware of two clear statements they've made and I think yesterday's data supports one of them, which would be in addition to a marked change, a clinically relevant change in ADAS-Cog and in the ADL measures, or some composite thereof to support disease modification they said they would look at supportive data in a delayed start format. And I think the speaker yesterday spoke about that. They have a very elegant trial design they proposed. No one's actually ever conducted such a thing. Our data, which is a sort of delayed start is helpful in that regard. Tony, that's how I would describe it and then they've also spent a lot of time talking about biomarkers and, of course, unlike other fields we don't yet have a validated biomarker for disease progression in Alzheimer's. And we are conducting a sub-study in Expedition 3 using our tao tracer. We see this as a very important part of not only expedition 3 program potentially to support disease modification and other claims for solanezumab but also to advance the fields understanding of how tao progression maps to cognitive decline in people with confirmed amyloid, which we don't have that data today. So we'll have to wait and see on the specific claims. Of course, we've got a lot of irons in the fire to support solanezumab in that regard but regulator in the whole field is moving rather rapidly here. So it's difficult to predict. On bemaciclib and the JAK1/JAK2 and what is I guess you're saying theoretical basis why it could be better than anti-TNF, the bottom line is we're running that experiment and we will see that experiment readout in the fall. And we're really going to have to wait to see whether bemaciclib could be better than a TNF or equal to, which is the first test we'll run. There are lots of plausible explanations why it could happen. JAK1/JAK2 signaling and we continue to point this out that JAK2 signaling is important to have an IL-6 like effect as well as GM [ph] CSF, both of which we have human data validating those targets in RA. Whether that yields better than TNF, which is a quite different target is the test we're running. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Dave. Sue? Susan Mahoney : Okay. And with Cyramza in the U.S. we're actually seeing a good uptake in both gastric and in lung. As we look at gastric, I mean, we launched the single agent indication earlier last year. So the majority we used last year with single agent, then towards the end of last year we launched the combo and we're seeing more uptake in combination. With gastric prior to the regard data there wasn't anything approved in the U.S. in the second line treatment of gastric cancer. So clearly we're seeing this as all people are seeing this as an advance and we're seeing a good uptake, good feedback so far about the experience that people are having as well. In lung, we launched earlier this year, and we again are seeing good uptake in the second line post platinum patients. We see these as very two different opportunities with the lung indication being much larger but clearly it's going to be more competitive. The feedback we're getting is positive, about 40% of our sales in Q2 came from lung indication and we continue to see a good opportunity to continue to grow in lung as well as to expanding gastric going forward. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Sue. Leah, next caller please. Operator : And the next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you. Three quick ones here. First perhaps for Dr. Siemers or perhaps Dave. How would you summarized how actual Alzheimer's treaters took the data that was presented down in D.C. if that was it all on your agenda to kind of feel out folks that are not just clinical trial gurus? Perhaps secondly, Chito can comment on what's happening in China. There's been a pretty sudden slowdown for pharma sales for the industry. Curious if you could comment on that and how long those conditions might persist. And for Derica, were there any meaningful wholesaler inventory level changes in the quarter versus last Quarter? It looks like A.R. was up a bit. Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great, Gregg. Thanks for the questions. So we'll start off with Dave on the first question. We may see if Eric has something he'd like to add since he's been out at AAIC. And then to Chito on the China question and Derica for the wholesaler inventory impact in the quarter. David Ricks : Yeah, Gregg, thanks for the question. I think the field as we talked to practitioners is obviously anxiously waiting for a disease-modifying agent in the absence of any way to slow down this horrible condition. The question of clinical meaningfulness always comes up and the research we've done would say most practitioners would say a one-third reduction over an 18-month period of time is quite meaningful. But we have Dr. Siemers on the line here who's a neurologist and I'm sure spoke to many of your colleagues. Enrique, what are your views on how the lay field is interpreting the data? Enrique Conterno : Yeah, it's a great question. I think going into the meeting, we wondered ourselves whether this would be interesting just to clinical trial gurus or geeks or whatever you want to say or whether it would have more of a broad interest and I think the interest was fairly broad and I think there's maybe two major reasons for that. One is that just by showing these delayed start results, I think it was in a sense supporting what we initially showed in the placebo-controlled period. Now, of course, that was a secondly outcome we always worry about those a little bit, but these delayed start results would actually add to the weight of evidence that those results in face, we hope will be replicated in Expedition 3. The other piece is that this whole concept of disease modification has been discussed is something where the science is evolving. There has been fairly good agreement, including by regulators, that this delayed start design can provide evidence of disease modification and I think the data were really accepted as evidence of that. Again, it's a secondary analysis from Expedition and Expedition 2, but I think it gives us some real confidence that we'll see very similar results in Expedition 3 and that's one strong piece of evidence of disease modification. Phil Johnson : Great. Thanks, Enrique. Chito? Alfonso Zulueta : Gregg, as I'm sure you've heard from other companies, there has been a pretty significant drop in the market growth in China. I think as we all recall from the mid-teen growth in the last few years, year-to-date growth is somewhere around single digit and if you look at the multinational cohort of companies, I think May was around 2% growth over the same period last year. Now, I think the primary factor that's driving the slowdown is really some government initiatives and policies that are curtailing volume growth and we're seeing more hospitals and institutions shifting to lower-priced generics. So we see this continuing at least in the short-term as there is pressure within the national government to curtail expenses. There's discussion also in curtailing pricing and linking together all types of products from the original brands to generics. So there's pressure on the volume side and moving forward I think you'll see more pressure on pricing, particularly for off patent brands. Now, we need to balance that with the medium-term opportunities and long-term positive opportunities in China. We have obviously very positive demographics and there is a sincere commitment, I believe, by the national government to expand healthcare coverage to a broader set of the Chinese population. But I think we should expect that the short-term will be challenging, again because of policies related to volume control in the hospitals and pressure for original brands. As far as Lilly's concerned, I think the better measure to look at our performance with the year-to-date performance, given the quarter-to-quarter variability of wholesaler buying patterns, and year-to-date we're below on 5%, but it's really driven by very [ph] - a decline in our growth and some of our off-patent products, primarily in neuroscience, oncology and anti-infective products, again because of volume control but also because of the generics. However, if you look at the - our patented products, we're very pleased to see strong performance from Cialis growing at 23%, Forteo growing at over 50%. And our Analog business, I know there was question earlier to Enrique, the Analog Insulin business in China is growing 12% year-to-date. Now, we're getting significant pricing pressure on the unit insulin side where local companies are beginning to win the provincial kids. But once again, we anticipate pressure in the short-term, but we're very confident that [indiscernible] the long-term prospects remain very, very positive. Phil Johnson : Great, [indiscernible]. Thanks for that color. And Derica, on the wholesaler changes in the quarter? Derica Rice : Sure. Hi, Gregg. As it pertains to wholesalers, there was really nothing unusual or unique as it pertains to wholesaler activity in the quarter. Phil Johnson : Great. Leah, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. It is the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Colin Bristow : Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. A couple of quick ones. On Trulicity, could you talk about the progress you've made in terms of access, and any additional color you could give on the launches of Trulicity and Jardiance that would be helpful. And then number two, what do you see as a potential impact on the trajectory of the SGLT-2 class and then Jardiance within that, if there was a positive CV [ph] benefit. Do you expect a heavy asymmetrical benefit for Jardiance, or do you think this would just be bled through as a benefit for everyone? And [indiscernible] , just a third quick one on saler [ph]. Any additional updates we should expect prior to the Expedition 3 readout? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. Obviously we'll go to Enrique for the first two on some of the access and uptake we're seeing for Trulicity and Jardiance, as well as then, what the impact might be a positive CV [ph] outcomes trial for Jardiance, and then over to you, Dave, for the solanezumab question and either [ph] updates we've got on that program going forward. So, Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. So we are pleased with the progress that we've made with both Trulicity and Jardiance. We now have about 70% access when we look at commercial access in the U.S., and about 30% being Part B with Trulicity. As I shared earlier, I think for us, a key to be able to get long-term value for this product is to ensure the GLP-1 class is growing, and we clearly see a significant acceleration of the GLP-1 class. In the case of Jardiance, the situation is similar. When it comes to - continue to basically get asked this. I would say that we have, differently from the GLP-1 class, we have seen a slowdown, significant slowdown when it comes to the HCLT-2 [ph] class, when it comes to new patient starts this year, so that's something that we're watching of course very closely. And it is difficult to speculate on what relative share of the benefit, disproportionate benefit will we get on, if we were to have a positive CV [ph] outcomes result. Clearly this is going to provide a lift to the entire class, and we do expect that we're going to get a disproportionate share of that benefit, how much I think is difficult to say. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave? David Ricks : Yeah, on - so on what we will expect to - starting with yesterday and until the end of the Expedition 3 study is, there will be some scholarly articles and other data coming out on the original Expedition 1 and 2, including the Pool of Mild's [ph] paper we do expect to come out. Also I had a - there was an interesting presentation yesterday, looking at the amyloid changes using a more modern and accepted method, which did show a difference between active and placebo, so these types of reanalysis and additional data filling out the picture from 1 and 2 will continue. But the big data readout, Expedition 3, which we guide people to really focus on won't happen until after the last patient visit and data analysis, last patient visit we project Q4 of 2016. And we have made the decision just to communicate it formally that we will not conduct an interim analysis for EXPEDITION 3 so we will run the trial to completion. Enrollment went so quickly in that trial. There's very little time and benefit for us to go ahead and garner from doing the early read. We'll look the trial play out and preserve all the powering for the final readout at the end. Colin Bristow : Sure. Phil Johnson : I know were getting close to the bottom of the hour but I believe we've got one more caller. We're happy to take that question before wrapping up the call. Operator : Certainly. And that is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for sneaking me in here. So just a couple of quick things I could, maybe some different topics and we focus on so far. One, just on the Animal Health side. You kind of close the Novartis deal. Just kind of if we can get a sense from Jeff for how he's viewing that business kind of going forward and kind of the growth we should expect going forward. There's 2% constant currency growth this quarter or year-to-date so just want to see how - what you think there. Second, just on the PCSK9 obviously a lot of interest and excitement around the industry on that because the first ones, most of the market, you guys still got yours in phase 2. And if you can just give an update on how you view that opportunity for Lily? And then third maybe it's a little bit early for this but just around the dividend with all the news you've been having on the pipeline in the kind of return to growth you're seeing, how should we think about your view on the dividend going forward? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great. Fantastic. Thanks, Vamil. So, Jeff, you'll start us off and we'll shift over to Dave for the PCSK9 question and finish up with Derica. Jeffrey Simmons : Yeah. The overall Animal Health business Cylanco [ph] is tracking to our plans and expectations. This year has been focused on integration after coming out of an era of a lot of growth. We're planning to return to that but this year's big focus is on the integration. Our previously committed savings level on the integration of $200 million by 2017, 2018. What I would say is we see that as a minimum expectation and we'll have an Animal Health investor conference in December in Boston where we'll get into more detail what we would say is today we're seeing ourselves meeting and exceeding all the key milestones on Novartis and that'll be a key driver in returning to growth. So yes, we saw 3% growth this quarter but what we would say is we see the combination of the integration as well as our pipeline and innovation returning us back to top-tier industry growth once we come to the integration. We'll articulate more of these details again in Boston at the end of the year. Thanks. Phil Johnson : Dave? David Ricks : Yeah. On PCSK9 there's really no update from the last call where we have the question. We have our phase 2 data complete, we're looking at our strategic options for this program recognizing there's three competitors ahead of us and we would want to see differentiation or perhaps look for other options to have them all move forward. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Dave. Derica? Derica Rice : In regards to the dividend, we're very encouraged and excited about the current performance of the business and as we've seen us kind of turning the tide and returning to the spirit of growth and margin expansion it really is giving us the capacity if you've seen this year to return to more regular cadence of dividend increases and we see that going forward over time. And then likewise you'll see us continue also to look to supplement that with returning additional excess cash to shareholders via our share repurchase program. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Derica. John, would you like to go ahead and conclude the call for us? John Lechleiter : Sure, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. We've received a positive feedback on the recent calls we hosted to discuss our diabetes business and late stage data from two key molecules in our Biomedicines business. They're sitting there [indiscernible]. So building on that experience, we plan to host an investor event in Boston, as Jeff mentioned, on Tuesday, December 8 to highlight to other areas of our business that obviously are generating significant investor interest and that's Alzheimer's and Animal Health. So we hope the information we share at this upcoming events will be likewise helpful you. Finally, if you have questions we didn't address in today's call, please contact our IR team. I can tell you that they are standing by and would be happy to help. So have a great day and thanks again for joining us.

Welcome to the Q3 2015 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to John Lechleiter. Please go ahead. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's third quarter 2015 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter; I'm Lilly's Chairman, President, and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling, and Phil Johnson of the Lilly Investor Relations team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. So let me begin by providing an overview of Lilly's third quarter. Again this quarter, we posted strong non-GAAP financial performance. With our continued focus on expanding margins, we leveraged constant currency revenue growth of 5% into operating income growth of 27%. Year to date, we've leveraged 3% constant currency revenue growth into 16% operating income growth. Along with this strong financial performance, our focus on innovation continues to pay off. Just since our last call, in Diabetes, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we presented results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study with Jardiance. This is the first time a diabetes medication showed a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcome study. We anticipate that our colleagues at BI will submit these data to U.S. and European regulators before the end of this year. In Bio-Medicines, we announced results from two Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis studies evaluating baricitinib head to head against two of the most widely used RA treatments. In one study, baricitinib showed superior efficacy to methotrexate in treatment-na\u00efve patients. And in the second study it showed superior efficacy to adalimumab, the market-leading biologic in patients with inadequate response to conventional DMARDs. These are outstanding results. Our team is now squarely focused on global regulatory submissions. And in Oncology, the U.S. FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to our CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, for the treatment of patients with refractory hormone-receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This is our second oncology molecule to receive breakthrough therapy designation, following olaratumab for soft-tissue sarcoma. As you know, the FDA may grant this designation in certain circumstances where there is preliminary clinical evidence that a drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. These are all excellent examples of the progress we're making in delivering innovation that is valued by patients, physicians, and payers. Also, since our last call, we were reminded of just how vexing the pursuit of pharmaceutical innovation can be. Despite demonstrating HDL and LDL changes consistent with our Phase 2 study, our CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib, did not demonstrate a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the Phase 3 ACCELERATE trial. Lilly and its academic collaborators decided to terminate development of evacetrapib based on this new information. This was an unexpected and a disappointing development for patients with high-risk vascular disease and for Lilly. Despite this setback, our pipeline is strong and our future growth prospects are bright. We continue to look forward to revenue growth and margin expansion throughout the balance of this decade, and we believe we've built a sustainable R&D engine for the long term. Now, let me highlight additional key events that have occurred since our second quarter earning call in late July. On the commercial front, in diabetes, we launched a number of products in major markets. We launched our weekly GLP-1 agonist Trulicity in Japan. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we launched our insulin glargine product in Japan, as well as the UK, Germany, and a number of other European markets. And, here in the U.S., we received approval for and launched Synjardy, a twice-daily combination pill containing the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and Metformin. Also in the U.S., we launched Humalog U-200 KwikPen, the first concentrated mealtime analog insulin in the U.S. market. On the regulatory front, our colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim completed the FDA submission of Jentadueto XR, a once-daily combination pill containing linagliptin and Metformin. In Japan, we submitted ramucirumab for second-line non-small cell lung cancer and ixekizumab for both moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. In the U.S., we submitted Humulin Regular U-500 in the KwikPen delivery device to the FDA. The product is already marketed in the U.S. in a vial and syringe format. As I mentioned earlier, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib, based on data from our Phase 1b cohort expansions in breast cancer. On the clinical front, we had a number of noteworthy disclosures. As Enrique discussed on our investor call a few weeks ago, along with our colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim, we at Lilly are thrilled that Jardiance is the only diabetes medication to show a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcomes trial \u2013 in this case, in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events. Roughly one in two deaths in people with type 2 diabetes is due to cardiovascular disease, despite the use of statins, blood pressure medicines, and antiplatelet therapy. Clearly a significant unmet need remains for further reducing cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes to help them live longer and healthier lives. Highlights from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study included a 14% reduction in the primary outcome measure of the three-point MACE endpoint, comprised of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, or non-fatal stroke; a 35% reduction in hospitalization due to heart failure; a 38% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes; and a 32% reduction in death from all causes. This is great news for patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. As I mentioned earlier, the positive clinical data readouts didn't stop there. Along with Incyte, we were extremely pleased that baricitinib demonstrated superior efficacy to methotrexate in treatment-na\u00efve patients with RA and adalimumab in RA patients with inadequate response to conventional DMARDs. We'll present detailed data from these trials at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco in November, and we will host an investor call on November 11 to review the results with you. Finally, in clinical news, we terminated the development of evacetrapib for the treatment of high-risk cardiovascular disease, as I stated in my opening comments. We expect to disclose detailed findings from this study at a medical conference next year. On the business development front, earlier this month, as planned, we took back North American rights to erbitux from Bristol-Myers Squibb. We announced the acquisition of worldwide rights to a Phase 3 intranasal glucagon from Locemia. This product could be the first needle-free rescue treatment for severe hypoglycemia. We expanded our collaboration with Innovent, based in Suzhou, China, to include the development and potential commercialization of up to three anti-PD-1 based bispecific antibodies. We entered into a preclinical research collaboration with ImaginAb centered on T-cell based immuno-oncology therapies. And we announced an expansion of our immuno-oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca to include a range of additional combinations across both companies' complementary portfolios. In other news, we entered into a settlement agreement with Sanofi to resolve insulin glargine patent litigation. Under this agreement, Sanofi granted Lilly a royalty-bearing license so that Lilly can manufacture and sell Basaglar in the KwikPen device globally. Also, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim will be able to launch Basaglar in the U.S. in December 2016. The Japan Patent Office issued a notice of closure in the trial regarding the validity of Lilly's vitamin regimen patent for Alimta. We expect a written decision upholding the validity of the patent in the coming weeks. This is the first of two decisions pending. If the patents are ultimately upheld through all challenges and appeals, they would provide intellectual property protection for Alimta in Japan until June 2021. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled that our Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by generic challengers' proposed products. The court had previously upheld the validity of this patent, which provides intellectual property protection for Alimta until May 2022. The generics have appealed these rulings, but a date for the appeal has not yet been set. We announced plans to expand our New York City research and development site. This investment will enhance our immuno-oncology capabilities, as well as facilitate academic collaborations. And, finally, in the third quarter, we repurchased $61 million of stock, leaving $3.2 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the third quarter, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil? Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you, John. Before I discuss our Q3 results, it may be helpful to review key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rates versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health, while 2015 includes the operating results of this business, as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition. For our non-GAAP measures, we now exclude amortization of intangibles. And, to provide you a better idea of the underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we'd closed the transaction on January 1, 2014. This should place 2014 on the exact same basis upon which we are reporting our financials this year. Now let's look at our results for the quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our underlying non-GAAP measures to provide insights into the trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter reported or GAAP results. Moving to slide 10, you can see that Q3 revenue was just under $5 billion. The decrease of 4% compared to Q3 2014 reflects significant FX headwinds. Excluding FX, our Q3 revenue increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis. As we discussed on prior calls, this year we're still feeling a negative effect from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista. As we move through 2015, however, this effect is diminishing. This quarter, U.S. Cymbalta and Evista trimmed about 150 basis points off of our worldwide revenue growth rate. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 3 percentage points, going from 74.8% to 77.8%. This increase was driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, which increased cost of sales in Q3 last year but decreased cost of sales in Q3 this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 74.9% in last year's quarter to 75.2% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. We continue to drive productivity improvements across our business. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, declined by 7% or over $200 million compared to Q3 of 2014. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses declined 5%, while R&D declined 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and continued expense control, partially offset by expenses to support recent product launches. The reduction R&D expense was driven primarily by the 2014 charge associated with the termination of tabalumab development and, to a lesser extent, by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Other income and expense was income of $87 million this quarter and included a gain on liquidation of our Receptos holdings that was partially offset by other investment losses and writedowns. Our tax rate was 24.9%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is due to a catch-up for the first nine months of this year to reflect an increased percentage of forecasted earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions. Also, our tax rate in both periods did not include the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit, as those provisions had lapsed. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share both increased 22%. Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first nine months of the year. I would point out that, year to date, our non-GAAP operating expenses \u2013 again, the sum of SG&A and R&D \u2013 is 54.7% of revenue. This is more than 140 basis points lower than the same period last year and reflects clear progress toward our goal of 50% or lower in 2018. Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 22. Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue. On slide 13, in the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the total revenue decline of 4% on a non-GAAP basis that I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline, as you see the 8% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 5%, with volume driving 7 percentage points of growth, partially offset by a negative price effect of 2%. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. Pharma revenue increased 13%, driven by volume, partially offset by price. Late-lifecycle revenue for Evista and Cymbalta did influence individual components of U.S. growth, but not the overall increase. In fact, excluding Evista and Cymbalta, the rest of our U.S. revenue grew 17%, with 9% from price and 8% from volume, with new products like Trulicity and Cyramza making significant contributions. Moving to our international operations, we're now reporting Australia and New Zealand along with our emerging markets, so Australia, Canada and Europe, or ACE in the past, is now EuCan, which stand for Europe and Canada. The decline in EuCan revenue of 17% was almost entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 3%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in the European Cymbalta sales, resulting from a loss of data package exclusivity. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 3% in constant currency terms. In Japan, Pharma revenue decreased 4% in total, driven by adverse currency movements, while on a constant currency or performance basis, Japan revenue increased 14%. This performance growth was attributable to many products, chief among them Cymbalta and Cyramza. Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline of 18%, driven primarily by negative FX effect of 14%. On a performance basis, emerging market sales declined 4%. This 4% performance decline was driven almost entirely by the negative effect of the Brazil Humulin tender that we had last year but not this year. Also, this quarter our Pharma revenue in China declined 2%, with 1% driven by FX and the other 1% driven by lower volume. On a non-GAAP basis, which adjusts 2014 as if we'd completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of last year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 9%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue decreased 2%. This performance decrease was primarily driven by OUS companion animal products, and to a lesser extent by U.S. companion animal products, partially offset by growth in U.S. food animal products. Moving to slide 15, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q3 2015 results. This quarter FX was a significant top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by eight percentage points. In terms of cost of goods sold, however, FX provided a substantial benefit, as non-GAAP cost of goods sold decreased 15% including FX but increased 5% excluding FX. With both revenue and cost of sales increasing 5% in performance terms, we saw similar growth in gross margin. Our continued expense discipline is evident in our operating expense results, as even when backing out the favorable effect of FX on our expenses, OpEx still declined 3%. This allowed us to leverage mid-single-digit growth in revenue and gross margin into 27% performance growth in operating income and 25% performance growth in net income and EPS. These are outstanding results. Moving to our pipeline update on slide 16, you'll see the pipeline as of October 16. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression, red arrows showing attrition, and stars showing additions. In terms of advancement, you'll see that we began Phase 3 testing of olaratumab in soft-tissue sarcoma, as well as of our tau imaging agent for Alzheimer's disease. And through our recent agreement with Locemia Solutions, we added the intranasal glucagon molecule. You'll see we began Phase 2 testing for an ultra-rapid-acting insulin in collaboration with Adocia, and we began Phase 1 testing of two molecules, one for cancer and the other for diabetes. Since our last update, we've also terminated development of a number of molecules, including evacetrapib in Phase 3, two molecules in Phase 2, as well as five in Phase 1. The early-phase terminations you've seen in recent quarters reflect a concerted effort to raise the bar for taking molecules forward and to focus our efforts on the highest priority opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Thanks, Phil. As on prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2015 and then review our 2015 financial guidance. Turning to slide 17, we're pleased with the positive progress we've made on the key events we laid out for the year. This progress is represented by the large number of green checkmarks that you see. We've highlighted in yellow the key events that have occurred since our last earnings call. They include initiation of Phase 3 trials for olaratumab in soft-tissue sarcoma, ramucirumab in second-line liver cancer, and along with Pfizer for tanezumab in both osteoarthritis pain and chronic lower back pain. As mentioned earlier, we issued a top line press release and presented detailed data at EASD for the Jardiance EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We also issued top line press releases for two positive Phase 3 studies of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis, RA-BEGIN in September and RA-BEAM earlier this month. And we terminated the Phase 3 ACCELERATE trial with evacetrapib. You'll also see that we've updated the regulatory submissions category to reflect Japanese submission of ixekizumab for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Separately, you'll now see on ClinTrials.gov (sic) [ClinicalTrials.gov] that we are running a new psoriasis trial comparing ixekizumab head to head with Stelara. In the other section, you'll see green checkmarks for the positive Alimta ruling from the U.S. District Court on the issue of infringement and for the similar ruling received in Japan. Key events remaining this year include : regulatory submission of baricitinib for RA; initiation of a rolling submission for olaratumab for soft-tissue sarcoma, with the completion of the submission expected during the first half of next year; FDA action on necitumumab for first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer; and legal rulings on Alimta litigation in Europe. The progress we've made in the past few years and again this year in executing our innovation-based strategy solidifies our near to medium-term growth prospects, and it gives us confidence that our strategy is the right one for Lilly to create value for our various stakeholders, including our shareholders. Turning to our 2015 financial guidance, let me start with the punchline. We raised and narrowed our non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect solid underlying performance for the first nine months of the year as well as higher other income. Looking by line item, you'll see that our revenue and gross margin percent guidance is unchanged. We've reduced our guidance for both marketing, selling, and administrative expense and R&D and development expense. This is driven by our continued focus on expense management. I would note that this lower R&D range includes an anticipated Q4 charge of up to $90 million related to stopping the evacetrapib clinical trials. We've increased the expected range for other income, largely due to the gain on the sale of our Receptos stock holdings. To reflect an increased percentage of earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions, we've increased our non-GAAP tax rate to 21.5% and our GAAP tax rate to 16.5%. Please note that both tax rates assume the R&D tax credit and other international tax provisions will be extended before year-end, retroactive for the full year. At the bottom line, you'll see we've raised and narrowed our non-GAAP EPS range and now forecast full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.45 per share. Our new GAAP EPS range of $2.40 to $2.45 per share reflect this same upward adjustment. Finally, we've lowered our estimate for full-year capital expenditures to $1.1 billion. In summary, we again posted solid underlying business performance in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year. Excluding the negative effect of FX, we drove mid-single-digit revenue growth, with strong contributions coming from recently launched products. Our continued focus on productivity and cost controls drove strong leverage at the bottom line. And the current pace of margin expansion puts us on track to meet our midterm margin expansion goals. While we did experience a setback with evacetrapib, news from our pipeline has on balance been exceedingly positive. The string of positive results we've had over the last couple of years represents tangible results from our innovation-based strategy, and we still have an exciting period ahead of us. We expect FDA action on two molecules presently under regulatory review, necitumumab before the end of this year and ixekizumab in the first half of next year. And over the next 18 months, we could submit six additional new molecular entities for regulatory review, baricitinib, olaratumab, abemaciclib, intranasal glucagon, our CGRP monoclonal antibody, and solanezumab. The success of our pipeline positions us to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade. So as it has been our stated intent, we have returned to revenue growth on a performance basis. We are reducing OpEx as a percent of revenue, helping to expand our operating margins. We are advancing our pipeline with positive results, and we have built a sustainable R&D engine that can produce additional and exciting new medicines to help people have longer, healthier lives. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. Linda, if you could, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then go to the first caller on the line, please. Operator : We'll begin with the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys, can you hear me? Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: We sure can, Mark. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks so much for letting me having the first question. I really appreciate it. John, I have two questions for you, please, if I may, and I hope you're well. Last quarter you said in the 2Q call that you thought SMID-cap biotech stocks in general were in a bit of a valuation bubble. You have proven to be a better stock analyst than me and my competitors. Now that we're 25% lower than your comments, I'd just love to hear kind of what you think. And of course from a Lilly perspective, are you asking your BD folks to kind of speed up the pace of their calls? Or do you want to let this settle out for a while, or do you want to see it go lower? Number two, I know you're very involved in Washington and what goes on there with the bio and the pharma lobbying groups and industry. I'd love to hear your thoughts on drug pricing but more specifically \u2013 obviously, given the Hillary Clinton tweet, the Marco Rubio comments \u2013 but more specifically, I'd love to know, when do you think the industry is just going to begin defending itself to the public more aggressively, which is going to cost some money? You know that we're only 10% of overall healthcare spending, and the other 90%, and these other costs, et cetera. When is the industry going to begin to spend the money to try to change the image and teach Americans that it's probably worth it? And I'll leave my questions at that. Thanks, Phil, for calling on me. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: You're welcome, Mark. John? John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Mark. Thanks a lot. I did make the comment about the bubble, I guess, at the last call. Although I think the hit that the industry has taken may have come from sort of another direction, with the noise around pricing. I think there's no question that valuations are lower. Does that change our fundamental posture with respect to business development? It doesn't, I think we've said all along that we're really not interested in sort of large-scale M&A, but we're going to continue to look at opportunities, particularly earlier in development, even at the preclinical stage, to acquire assets or acquire companies as the case may be. We're very excited about the opportunity we have with Locemia, this intranasal glucagon that we announced just a few days ago. I don't know how good of a \u2013 I don't think I'd want to change jobs with you right now, though, Mark. I think you do what you do well, and I'll continue to try to do what I do - Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : I'd take that trade. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, good. Now, on drug pricing, I think if you go back through successive presidential campaigns, with some bit of variability, drug pricing sort of tends to rear its head, because I think it's something that politicians have found resonates with voters. Having said that, I think the facts tell a different story. Someone showed me some information the other day \u2013 in the second quarter of this year, the net effective price increase for the market basket of medicines in this country rose 0.7%. Well, I mean, that reflects \u2013 not necessarily these things that get called out in the media, these individual huge drug price increases. It reflects the fact that many of our medicines are going generic still. I'm talking about the industry here, Lilly's sort of been through its own situation with that. It reflects the deep discount that we're mandated by the government to provide but increasingly must provide to commercial insurers and payers in order to get onto formularies and to be able to compete for the business. I think with respect to telling the story, I think you can expect to see more coming from the industry. I think we've got to be careful and thoughtful here. I don't think there's a way you can spend enough money to sort of all the sudden change people's minds, because so much of the criticism comes in the form of earned media. No one's out there spending money, per se; they're just picking up quotes and amplifying those. We've got a great story to tell. We've got medicines \u2013 and if you look at the hepatitis space, if you look at cancer, if you look at diabetes. I mean, huge advances in recent years. Obviously lots of risks, our evacetrapib trial calls that out. At the same time, I've never been as optimistic as I am about the chances we have as an industry to really make a difference for patients. We've got to keep telling the story, reminding people that the medicines as a percentage of total healthcare spend have remained remarkably constant for a long period of time, which suggests that our medicines are helping to hold the line or even reduce other costs in the system that none of us want to incur : hospital stays, being off of work, disability, et cetera. So we're not tone-deaf, Mark, in terms of the criticism that's being leveled at us. At the same time, I think that we've got more work to do here, and I think you can expect to see more. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, John. Linda, if we could, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Yes, next we'll go to the line of Chris Scott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much for the questions. First one is on expense management. You guys are obviously doing a great job on that front, but just a qualitative question as I look out to 2016. You've had a lot of incremental product flows when we think about next year and to 2017, between Jardiance's expanded label, the IL-17, baricitinib, et cetera. Should we think about 2016 as an investment year for the company where we could see SG&A growth kind of resume here, or do you still have enough flexibility with some of your initiatives to absorb some of these launches in the existing infrastructure? The second question was on baricitinib. Just wanted to get some of your perspective on how you see the superiority data versus Humira playing out in the commercial RA market. I guess is this an area that you think you could take share quickly, or is this going to be a much more gradual story, just given how entrenched some of these TNFs are with the long-term safety, et cetera? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Chris. Thank you for the questions. Derica, we'll go to you for the first question on the expenses and particularly some of the pushes and pulls as we head into 2016, and then, Dave, for your comments on baricitinib. Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Good morning, Chris. It's too early to give specific guidance on 2016 as it relates to our expense management. We'll provide that on our January call the first week of 2016. But what I can say is that we expect to be consistent with what we stated all along, which is that we believe we can expand margins throughout the balance of this decade, and that's also including revenue growth. And clearly to expand margins, that means we either \u2013 we're growing our top line faster than we're growing our expense base. And what ultimately happens to our expense base, we will share the specifics around that in that first week in 2016. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Derica, Dave? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Thanks for the question, Chris, on bari. We're very excited now that we have the full set of data in hand. Recall we have four separate Phase 3 programs, which really span the whole spectrum of rheumatoid arthritis, from refractory patients to biologics. Recall that was the first study we read out, and our study has, I think, a unique feature in it's a very real-world assessment. Many patients had failed on two or three or more biologics before entering that study, and still baricitinib showed very strong, robust efficacy. We then read out a study in conventional DMARD refractory patients. Again, baricitinib really helped patients who had been refractory to methotrexate and other conventional DMARDs. We then demonstrated superiority to really the established standard of care for disease modification, which is methotrexate, in the RA-BEGIN study, and most recently a superiority to adalimumab in DMARD-refractory patients, sort of this first-line biologic space. So I think we've gotten what we wanted when we started the program. And, to your question on safety, so far, through clinical trial observations, we're very reassured by the safety profile we see. So we're now onto submission. In terms of what to expect in the market, I think the RA market has some features where one would say this will not be sort of an overweight phenomena of share gain. You mentioned one, which is a natural caution on safety in any new drug where you're suppressing the immune system. We're very confident in the data we've produced on that dimension through our clinical trials, but understandably physicians like to see that play out over time, and I think that's been sort of the normal pattern in this market. As more reassuring safety data from a real-world setting is produced, doctors become more comfortable. It's also a very competitive space. We understand that, and we're prepared to compete in that. On the other hand, baricitinib I think offers a new choice, which is when I'm failing on inexpensive generic conventional DMARDs, rather than step two, a TNF, I have another alternative now, and that alternative appears to be superior to the standard of care in that setting. And there are a number of patients in that situation have not made that step two, anti-TNFs, for all kinds of reasons, and we'll be competing aggressively in that space. And so we like our hand. We obviously will have baricitinib for a while to come. We're stepping into a new market for Lilly; we want to do it right. And my view is I think we'll see good uptake. It won't be some overnight phenomena, but on the other hand, we do expect to make incremental gains as we enter the market. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have three questions. On EMPA-REG OUTCOME, is it possible that those results will actually trigger price competition as J&J tries to hold on to its market-leading formulary positioning with Invokana? And Lilly, like most other sellers of SGLT2s, also sells a DPP-4. What's your messaging to physicians on how they should think about those two different classes of drugs? On Alimta, U.S. performance was down year on year. You mentioned competitive pressures. I'm assuming that is the PD-1s. So is that the trajectory we should think about going forward? And then lastly on evacetrapib, knowing what you do about the data at this point, do you think your drug failed because of the way you ran your particular clinical trial? Or do you think it failed because CETP inhibition is just not a viable mechanism? I realize full results have not yet been presented. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Tim, thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, if we can go to you for the first couple of questions on EMPA-REG OUTCOME and messaging around DPP-4 Tradjenta. Sue, to you, then, for the Alimta U.S. dynamics that we're seeing. And then, Dave, on evacetrapib. Jan, also feel free to chime in if you would like, as well. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Sure. Tim, thank you for your question. It's difficult, really, to speculate when it comes to price competition. If anything, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results create differentiation in the marketplace. So, from that perspective, we feel very confident in the value proposition that Jardiance offers today, which is I think very significant. I would point out that the access that we already have with Jardiance for 2016 is indeed very strong. We will have over 85% commercial access and over 55% Part D access. Could those numbers improve a bit with some of these results? It is likely, but as you know that takes time, and there's a process when it comes to formularies. At this point in time, there's no promotion of these data. We are clearly seeing an uptick when it comes to new-to-brand prescriptions. Just to frame, we were, before the top line, when we look at EMPA, including both Jardiance and glyxambi, our new-to-brand share was 15%. That creeped up to 17% by the time at EASD. And now we're at 21%. Probably most relevant is the share shift that we've seen post-EASD with endocrinologies going from 21% to 31% new-to-brand share despite the fact that there's no promotion. As John shared in his prepared remarks, we are planning to have the submission before the end of the year. Now, in terms of our positioning, in terms of promotion, that's something that we do not discuss prior to basically launching our promotion campaign and our messages in this particular case for EMPA. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, and any thoughts at all on Tradjenta moving forward now that we have SGLT2 data and how we'll be competing with that drug? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Nothing really changes when it comes to Tradjenta. We have, I think, a unique product that is uniquely differentiated in the DPP-4 class. Tradjenta, I think it's important to note, is the fastest grower in that class. So growth is very, very strong. We are planning no changes at this stage. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Sure. Tim, with regard to Alimta, we saw a couple of things this quarter. Firstly, we saw a buying pattern where we had a buy-in this time last year that we didn't see this year. And, secondly, we have seen some softening on Alimta in later lines of therapy, in second line and beyond, which we had anticipated. I mean, we just launched Cyramza in the second-line setting, and clearly the I-O agents are also in second line. So we are seeing some softening there and in areas that we're not promoting. Where we are promoting, i.e., the first-line setting and continuation maintenance, we continue to see good usage and continue to believe that we will continue to see good usage in those areas. As you know, we are also doing combination studies with I-O agents. We anticipate getting some data next year on that. So I wouldn't read too much into this quarter's trend. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Dave? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Yeah, as relates to evacetrapib, Tim, obviously we're disappointed in the outcome, but I guess your question is did we run the right experiment. And our answer is yes. We sought to test the hypothesis, whether robust CETP inhibition, which dramatically raised HDL and reduced LDL, would lead to a reduction in major cardiovascular events. We ran that experiment, I think, exceedingly well in a population of interest, which was high-risk vascular disease. And after three years of observation, the answer is robust CETP inhibition does not change major cardiovascular events with evacetrapib. We really can't say whether that would apply to other CETP inhibitors, but I think we're pretty confident that the experiment we ran was a good one. And we have a definitive answer, thus the discontinuation of development. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: One thing \u2013 this is Phil \u2013 real quick. Because we had a number of questions, as you would imagine, after the announcement that we were stopping the development of evacetrapib. Just to clarify the kinds of robust increases we saw in HDL and decreases in LDL. If you look at the Phase 2 study, you'll notice that we essentially had two main doses, a 100-milligram dose and a 500-milligram dose. It was very clear that the 500-milligram dose produced both greater increases in HDL and greater decreases in LDL than the 100-milligram dose. The 130-milligram dose we took into Phase 3 had been reformulated to be more bioavailable and give effects that would be more potent than the prior formulation. In effect, what we saw from the initial data we've seen in our Phase 3 study would have been as we had expected and talked about in the past, additional HDL raising of roughly 120% plus, 130% kind of numbers and greater than a 30% reduction on top of statins on LDLs. So very robust changes that for whatever reasons and unfortunately did not translate into a reduction in MACE events in this particular trial. So more to come on that likely next year, as Dave mentioned. So, Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I just had two questions if I could. So one just around the pricing discussion from before, just found it interesting on slide 13 when you break down the pushes and pulls on the revenues. I think this was the first quarter in a few that we've seen the impact on price in the U.S. be negative. And so I was wondering if you maybe just could provide a little bit more color, if I'm correct, on what exactly drove that result relative to the last several quarters. And then second one is just we've received a few questions around \u2013 you've got obviously a lot of news, positive and negative, for the pipeline. And you've kind of generally endorsed sort of the margin expansion story you've talked about before. You've given pretty specific comments in the past around the ranges you expect for SG&A and R&D, sort of in that 2018-2019 timeframe in terms of percentage of sales. Can you just talk, I guess \u2013 do you still feel comfortable with those numbers you gave before? And maybe more broadly, just how much are you factoring in from drugs that are still in the pipeline in terms of delivering actual revenues in that 2018 \u2013 2019 timeframe as you think about hitting the margin targets that you've outlined before? Thanks. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Vamil, for the questions. On your first question, this is the first quarter in a while that we had a negative price effect for our U.S. Pharma business. If you do go back to some prior years, I think there were some similar effects as we've gone through loss of exclusivity for products, particularly when we have engaged in helping to supply the market with generic forms of our product. And that's what happened essentially this quarter, in particular with Evista, where we had higher volumes than in last year's quarter for shipments of generic Evista, or raloxifene, and that influenced the price calculation. Again, this is something that is particular to late lifecycle, as John mentioned at the very beginning. This is one of the benefits essentially that the industry provides with our innovation, is that eventually you do lose patent protection, and patient and payers benefit from significantly reduced prices on those innovations. Derica, on the forward-looking ranges for SG&A and R&D? Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Sure. What we've said is we will get our operating expenses, and that's defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A combined, to a level of 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And we feel that given results we've seen here in the quarter and really thus far through the first nine months of this year, we're very much on track to achieve that goal. And we've also stated that we believe we can achieve that goal regardless of the pipeline output scenario that we're in. So we've never known exactly which molecules would succeed and which ones would fail, but whatever the mix were, we were confident that we could still achieve that margin expansion goal. And we believe that with the payout that we've seen thus far over the last couple years, we're even more confident that we will achieve that and also that we will be able to expand the margins throughout the remainder of this decade. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Derica. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next. we'll go to the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Enrique, going back to diabetes, I'm not asking you to show your future strategic cards here. But what is Lilly doing to help shape the diabetes treatment guidelines post the EMPA results? Perhaps if you could, share what you think a realistic, responsible goal would be for Lilly as a company in terms of how to frame the importance of that outcomes benefit for treating physicians. And then my second question is on the Alzheimer's front. Is Lilly exploring compounds that treat the symptoms of the disease, or are you focused only on disease modification as a goal? A policy question as you approach R&D in that area beyond the later-stage assets. Thanks. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, on the first question, and, Dave, if you'd like to take the second one. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Sure. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Jan, obviously feel free to chime in as well if you'd like. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : We have the great fortune that we count within our ranks a number of people that have either participated in developing and writing some of these guidelines in the past both in Europe and in the U.S., or people that have actually called for some of those committees. We have to understand that those committees act in an independent manner. For us, I think our role is to ensure that these bodies, whether it's the ADA or others, basically have full access to all of our data. And we believe that data speaks by itself. I think it's very compelling. And when it comes to the overall benefit, we do expect that the data is such that it would trigger some of these reviews. I'm not going to speak later on the outcome of that. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Enrique, Dave? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: We're going to \u2013 I'll just give a quick commercial. On December 8 I'll have a chance to talk a lot to talk about our Alzheimer's strategy, Gregg, so you're welcome to join us then. But in brief, we believe Lilly is very well positioned to capitalize on the emerging science in Alzheimer's. That is primarily focused right now on disease-modifying agents but not exclusively. And as you know, we have disease-modifying agents at every stage of development. But we also have important preclinical efforts on symptomatic agents because people, even with the best-case scenario on disease modification, will live with this disease for a long time. They will suffer from the symptoms of Alzheimer's, and we believe there is space there. We have some expertise there, and we'll exploit it. Our main focus is disease modification, but we're interested in agents that could also help patients just live more comfortably or more safely with the disease. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology : I can add that we have a compound in Phase 1, which it said Parkinson's as the heading, but that's also a potential symptomatic treatment for Alzheimer's disease. And in the preclinical space, we also have some efforts that actually build on Lilly's very long experience in the field of psychiatry. So I think we are well positioned, realizing though that it is an uphill battle to understand exactly what mechanist could work then for novel symptomatic treatments in Alzheimer's, but we are also very much involved in new ideas then to learn how the brain is functioning in psychiatry. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Jan. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much for taking the question, so just a couple of quick questions, first off for Enrique. Enrique, can you talk to us a little bit about the importance of Basaglar and the decision to settle on this? Was the settlement specifically applied only to the device, or does it apply more broadly such that other competitors seeking to enter the market would have to go through the same legal process that Lilly would? And then in terms of \u2013 again, more of a guidelines follow-up question. As we think about maybe just the guidelines and timing of guidelines around EMPA-REG, can you just update us on which guidelines are the most important? As we've talked to payers and surveyed payers, the feedback that they have provided is that guidelines could be what really changes their willingness to place Jardiance in a preferred position onto formularies. And then just as a final question, the performance of the insulin business particularly looks really challenged internationally. Can you talk in a little bit more detail about that trend and how you see that going forward? Thanks a lot. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thanks, Seamus. Enrique, it's all yours. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Very good, let me start with the last question on insulin overall. There is a trend that has not been discussed much. But one of the impacts that we see broadly when we look at the macro diabetes market is that insulin growth has basically slowed down. We see that, of course, for mealtime insulins. We believe that both ACOT2 growth and GLP-1 growth is partly the cause of that. Now having said that, when we look at our own performance, we grew Humalog 6% in the U.S. and also 6% outside of the U.S., different regions with different growth, emerging markets of course much higher than that. When we look at our human insulin, Humulin, we were basically flat. We were at minus 1%. The U.S. did have positive growth, driven by the Humulin U-500. But we did have a decline in emerging markets as a result of no longer participating in the Brazil tender. So all in all, not big changes when it comes to our overall performance, but we do see a slowdown when it comes to the overall insulin market. You asked about Basaglar. Clearly, this is a very important product for us. I'm pleased to report that so far our launches I think are going well. Uptake is very good, maybe slightly ahead of our expectations, whether it's Japan or Slovakia or the Czech Republic, which are the first three markets where we launched the product. When we look at our performance with Basaglar, we look at the entire basal market. We don't only look at Lantus. And in Japan, when we look at the entire basal analog market, we are now at 5.5% two months post-launch. So very pleased in particular with that performance in very important markets. Now clearly, the settlement that we have with Sanofi gives us certainty, which we value very highly. What the settlement calls for is for us to \u2013 we won't be able to sell product until December 15, 2016. That means basically placing our product with a third party from a commercial perspective. But in the meantime, we can indeed contract, and we are of course submitting in order to be able to get final approval for this. You asked specifically about the settlement. And yes, the settlement allows us to basically market and commercialize Basaglar in the KwikPen on a global basis. Just to remind you, the KwikPen is the product that we utilize for Humalog as well, and there is a royalty-bearing license specific to the U.S. when it comes to Basaglar sales in this particular device. At this point and time, we've settled, so that's water under the bridge, and we are now \u2013 have a certainty when it comes to the launch date, and we're preparing for that. You asked about the guidelines and how important this would be and which bodies could issue guidelines. Of course, the American Diabetes Association is a key organization and is one that has issued these type of guidelines. AACE, A-A-C-E, which is comprised of endocrinologists, also issues guidelines. I'm not going to comment on the most important guidelines other than to say that we expect that a number of different bodies will be conducting some of these reviews. There's no question that a change in the guidelines would have a huge impact on the overall performance of Jardiance. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for taking the questions, and nice work on the quarter. So, in light of the breakthrough designation received for abemaciclib, could you just talk about the key points of differentiation in the clinical profile of this assets versus palbociclib? And any anticipated timing for the data readouts would helpful. And another question on the Basaglar : Could you just comment on the pricing relative to Lantus in the launch territories? And, acknowledging that it is early, are you seeing any switching from Lantus patients, or is this purely new patient acquisition? And then just lastly on your PCSK9, can you talk about potential points of differentiation versus the competition and when we would expect any updates on Phase 3 progression? Thanks. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. So we'll go to Sue for the breakthrough designation question on abemaciclib differentiation versus the other marketed drug in the class and also timing for data readouts. Enrique with what we're seeing in terms of relative pricing to Lantus. And then, Dave and Jan, if you'll provide the answer on the PCSK9, that would be great. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, sure. Clearly we're very excited to have our second breakthrough therapy designation now for abemaciclib. This designation was based on the Phase 1b cohort expansion that we presented at San Antonio Breast last year. And this showed single-agent activity, a robust response rate, acceptable safety profile, durability, so we have a Phase 2 study that's ongoing. We hope to replicate that data in that study, and we should hear next year and see data on that and hope to present that data at a scientific meeting next year. We also have, as you're aware, two Phase 3 studies in breast cancer ongoing. Again, we hope to have data readout on those in 2017, although we do have some interims. And we have a lung cancer study specifically in KRAS. With regards to our CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, we do we believe we have a potential to have a best-in-class inhibitor. As I said, we have single-agent activity. We are also able to continuously dose this agent, which we believe is important given that the whole point of it is to inhibit the cell's cycle, so you'd want to continuously do that. So we believe that that could be an important differentiator for us. So we look forward to seeing the data and to seeing, as I say, the single-agent data next year and the Phase 3 data readouts after that. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Sue. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : So on Abasaglar or Basaglar, in the three countries where we've launched \u2013 and I'll briefly just highlight what our share is. When we look at the entire market, in Japan, as I mentioned, we are at 5.5%. In the Czech Republic, at 3%, and in Slovakia it's a small market but I bring it up because we are at 11%. We've also launched in Germany, the UK, Sweden, Poland, so we are really in full launch mode. I think it's fair to say that the dynamics when it comes to pricing, they vary from country to country. In some cases, there is a very formulaic path in terms of what's going to be the pricing that we will receive as a result of launching a biosimiliar. And that determines the pricing. Some cases we have discretion in terms of where we price. It is too early to basically say that \u2013 where are these patients coming from. It is likely that in Slovakia, some of these patients are switches, because the reimbursement level in Slovakia was lowered when we launched. And, in this particular case, patients that are on Lantus, my understanding is that they have to the pay the out-of-pocket on some of the difference relative to the Lantus price. We have to see this story evolve, but I think it's fair to say that so far we are pleased with our launch. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you, Enrique. And, Dave, on the PCSK9? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Yeah, I think we've talked about this on prior calls, so I'll be brief. We have our Phase 2 program complete. We believe there are key elements of differentiation for the molecule, but as we've evaluated our options as a company, we've said we're looking at our strategic options for further development of the product. We haven't completed that review, and so there's no real update on progression or other alternatives at this point. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you, Dave. Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology : Yeah, and the addition I can make then is this antibody has a longer durability of the LDL-lowering effect than compared to competitors. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, thank you, Jan. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Three questions. When in 2016 are the interim looks for abemaciclib's Phase 3 trials? Maybe you can narrow it down to a half, first half/second half. Secondly, what is going on with peglispro and potential further studies? It seems as though we are on a path toward Lilly dropping the drug, but maybe you can tell us why that is not the case. And then, thirdly, on evacetrapib's ACCELERATE trial, what is the explanation for, in July, the study being deemed not futile, and in October the study stated to have no chance of success? Were the analyses done using different criteria, or did something bad happen in those three months? Thank you. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks for the questions, Steve. So we'll start off with you, Sue, for the abemaciclib interim timing question, to you, Enrique, on the peglispro question, and then over to Dave on the evacetrapib question from Steve. So, Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, Steve, obviously these are all event-driven, so things can change. But as we look at the Phase 2 data, we'd anticipate that we'd get the interim data the first half of the year. And then for the Phase 3, probably the second half of the year. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Sue. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Sure, so just to remind everyone, we had, of course, unprecedented efficacy when it comes to basal insulin peglispro, but we had some risks that we felt needed to be discharged with additional clinical trials prior to us being able to make a submission. What we have shared is that we're engaged in discussion with regulatory authorities, as well as our advisers. Those discussions are ongoing. We've had some of those discussions with both the FDA and EMEA and are still having some of the discussions with our advisers. So it is something that I cannot make a comment on right now. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Enrique. Dave? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Yeah, as it relates to evacetrapib and the ACCELERATE study and how we're monitoring that and the interim futility, as we said before, the study called for a single interim futility analysis. That was the instructions we gave the independent data monitoring committee. They conducted that analysis in July, and per their charter instructed us to continue the study as planned. We don't know what their analysis or conclusions were in July, other than what they instructed us to do. A few weeks prior to October, first week in October, they informed us they were planning to meet again, and then shortly thereafter they communicated a new recommendation, which was to stop the study for lack of drug effect. We then looked at their analysis, and we agreed with that conclusion. If you're wondering if there was some big surprise between those dates, the data doesn't seem to indicate that. The independent data monitoring committee's job is to monitor the study on behalf of the patients for safety and making sure we're not subjecting people to study burden when it's unnecessary. It was their judgment to continue during those two periods, and we respect their judgment. And they need to keep the company blinded to their analysis, which they did very well in July. So that's really all we know, and as we look at the data now, we agree with their recommendation. So I think the positive thing is we did call for the interim look, and we got to that answer, albeit it a few months after we originally specified it. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please? Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes, thanks very much, two brief questions, one again to Sue. It's on ramucirumab, and the question really is around, much like Alimta, what has been the primary focus of sales today? Where are you getting traction? Does it continue to be in gastric? What's occurring in colorectal cancer? And the second question is, silently, Lilly has put together a number of assets outside of TGF-beta in the immuno-oncology space, be it bispecifics, et cetera. I'd be interested if you, perhaps, Jan, could frame the overall strategy for what you think you're going to be doing in this space? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you, Tony, for the questions. Sue, we'll start off with you for the first question for sure, if you want to comment on the second as well. And then we'll go over to Jan for additional commentary. Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Sure. So, Tony, with regards to the Cyramza launch, as you know, we've now launched in gastric lung and colorectal in the U.S. and in gastric in Europe and in Japan. In the U.S., we're seeing a use actually in all areas, with gastric use in about 40% of patients actually are getting treated now with Cyramza in second-line and beyond. Opportunity we believe is to continue to grow that in the second line, but also we're getting third-line usage, and we want to move that up to the second line. We're seeing about 40% now of the patients that are treated in the U.S. with Cyramza being in lung cancer, in both squamous and in non-squamous. Clearly lung cancer is getting much more competitive in the second-line setting. We're continuing to see use and believe and hear that there is a good place for Cyramza in lung cancer going forward. And we are seeing some usage in colorectal cancer, although that isn't our focus. Our focus is on lung and gastric. We are seeing some uptake in the U.S., though, in colorectal cancer. In Europe, we have launched in what we call the wave one countries, the ones that you get access to, and again in gastric cancer we're getting good feedback and good uptake there. We continue to work through a succession of launches in gastric cancer in Europe. And, in Japan, we launched the end of June and feel very good about the uptake in our first quarter in this market. It is a big opportunity and an unmet need in Japan; there are two to three times the incidence of gastric cancer there versus the U.S. And the feedback there so far is very good. Clearly, we have a succession of other hopeful approvals and launches in both lung and colorectal around the world to look forward to too. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you, Sue. Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : With regards to I-O, Jan, do you want to comment on... Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology : It's a very exciting area. And I think the situation today is that it can still be improved. I think we have seen the beginning here with the response rates up to 20% or somewhat higher, but many patients don't really respond very well still. But what we are doing in this space is to combine our expertise in cell signaling and microenvironment, together with other companies' PD-1 axis agent. And there are numerous clinical trials ongoing, which actually you don't see on our pipeline chart, but I know Sue and others have been communicated from the oncology business unit. So I think it's very important to see also then other novel agents. How can they interact then with the checkpoint axis? In relation to checkpoints, we're also very interested in our doing then bispecific antibodies, since there are several other checkpoints that haven't been tested yet, and having then the PD-1 as one anchor. And you have seen the recent communication around that. We're also \u2013 want to change the microenvironment with the oral agents, and TGF-beta is one of them, which is very interesting. Both potentially as a monotherapy, but also then in combination with PD-1s. We also want to test other microenvironment oral agents, which we have in the preclinical space. And, finally, it's not only important to activate these cells in the tumor, but you need to direct the T cells to the tumor, because if you don't have them there, checkpoint inhibitors are unlikely to respond. So we have new activities as we also have communicated with key partners such as Immunocore to actively direct T cells then to tumor-specific antigens, which I think represents also a new avenue in immuno-oncology treatments. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Jan. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. So I have a number of questions. I guess first is on sola, please. So with respect to the DSMB looks at sola, do they assess futility, or is it impossible for the study to be halted early on futility? The second question is with respect to the U.S. price slide, slide 13, I was just hoping that you could explain the few points in a little more detail. First how it's calculated, and then, second, since the negative impact of generics started at the beginning of the year, it wasn't quite clear why the year-to-date pricing is up 3% yet the third quarter pricing is down 4% for the U.S. business. I just didn't understand what the inflection was in the third quarter, when the negative impact from generics started to be felt quarters ago. And then third, with respect to the BACE Phase 3 decision, it seems like you'll be rolling that into Phase 3, but if you could just discuss the variables and timing of that decision, that would be helpful. Thank you. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. Dave Ricks, actually since you've got evacetrapib and BACE and also the product that had the dynamic with the shipping to authorized generics, if you want to take the lead on answering all three of them, then we can complement, that would be great. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Okay, so let me start with the sola question. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Right, that was the first one? And make sure I hit all these, Phil, as we go through it. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Or David. So on sola, we have a more standard Data Safety Monitoring Board, like we do with many large studies. Their mission is really one of monitoring safety. We have, I think, communicated on prior calls, we have not chosen to go for an option to have an interim look specified by the company. And we would not instruct them to conduct such a review. I will say that Data Safety Monitoring Boards, as we set them up, they are independent. Their mission is to look at study data on behalf of the patients. And it's not unprecedented that they may call us and say, \"Well, we think you should stop the study.\" But we have not asked them to do that, and we're under no obligation to follow their recommendation. Based on our observations from EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2, and you would note that it took till about 40 weeks to see a drug effect, and based on the enrollment curve we have for this, we don't see a lot of value in looking at an interim look, because we enrolled the study very rapidly, and most of the benefit will come in the final months if the study behaves like EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2. So unfortunately we will be waiting until late next year, the latest part of next year, before we have the answer. And I would expect the study to run until that time. On U.S. pricing, you were correct to point out our year-to-date is 3%. I think that's more indicative of the underlying trend we see, which is list price gains, net of gross-to-net reductions for all the various mandated and commercial reasons. The one-time event in Q3, which Phil tried to answer earlier, was a shipment to our authorized generics partner. It's a large shipment. The way that deal is set up is we book revenue under the terms of that deal for the bulk product that they then distribute, creating another option for patients, a low-cost option for generic raloxifene. There's clearly demand for that in the market, and we're happy to supply Lilly-made raloxifene with our authorized generic partner. The way that deal is set you up, those shipments happen periodically. It just happened one occurred in Q3, and it was substantive enough to shift down the Q3 reported price below our ongoing trend. But I think the year-to-date numbers are more indicative of our trend. I think your next question was on the BACE inhibitor and what would trigger that into Phase 3. We've previously communicated that as well with our partner AstraZeneca. We designed this as a Phase 2/3 program. We're actively enrolling into the Phase 2 components. The primary objective of the first interim analysis, which we expect to happen in Q1 of 2016, will be a look at safety. BACE inhibitors, while very promising in terms of genetic validation and their pharmacokinetics and dynamics, many have gone down on off-target safety. And so this is a first look at sustained dosing in a reasonably large cohort of people with Alzheimer's. And that will then trigger expansion of that study and perhaps triggering another study and movement into the Phase 3 component of Lilly's pipeline and advancing to patients. Was there another question? David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Okay, great. Okay. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well done. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Linda, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: I have two questions. First, (1:20:50) Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Hey, Andrew, we're having a hard time hearing you. I'm not sure if you can do anything on your end to improve... Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Sorry about that. Is it any better? Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, it is. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Terrific. Number one, what was the baseline for the LDL within ACCELERATE? Apologies if you already disclosed it. Second, I noted that you recently lost your fairly recently appointed head of immuno-oncology. In terms of replacements and how you're thinking about that, I would be interested. And then finally, do you view our CSF1R monoclonal as competitive with others? In particular, does it block dimerization, and how relevant is that in terms of potential efficacy? Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Andrew, thank you for the questions. At this point in time we have not disclosed \u2013 actually maybe we have, Dave. In the paper that was recently published, did we have the baseline? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: The benign paper, I do not believe we did. I think we have commented that the study designed for ACCELERATE to have people come in on a variety of statins that they may have already been on, on the maximum tolerated dose. I'll just qualitatively say that patients who entered the study had LDLs in line with guidelines, and they were really already on best standard-of-care statin. We further reduced LDL, as Phil mentioned, in the mid-30% on top of that. That's quite surprising to us and I'm sure the field, lack of MACE effect. We'll be disclosing more data about ACCELERATE, everything we've learned, and probably more data disclosures after that, sometime in 2016 in a major cardiovascular meeting. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Great, thanks, Dave. And then, Sue, on the question on I-O staffing and then the CSF1R molecule? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yes, you'll have to remind me on the CSF1R question. With regards to I-O staffing, we actually have a really, really good team of people in New York and in New Jersey who are focused on I-O. Michael Kalos heads our research group there. He came from UPenn. We've also recently brought in some I-O experience in the medical and the development area. And we have in our I-O hub that we announced in New York and New Jersey recently moved one of our very experienced drug developers from Lilly. So we feel very good about the expertise we've got there, and we're going to continue to build that internal expertise as well as through the partnerships. I think we announced over the last year nine different partnerships related to I-O. So our view is that we will use the external expertise and the internal expertise to continue to drive our I-O experience. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: And then, Andrew, on your question for CSF1R, were you asking whether we're competitive with other agents and if we downregulate something that I did not catch it when you said it. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: So my question was whether your monoclonal prevents dimerization of the two receptors, and to what extent is that an important competitive element versus other CSF1Rs in development? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Jan, I don't know if you can comment on that. I can't comment on that. From a timing perspective, we have completed our Phase 1 dose study and now have a dose of CSF1R. We've just announced actually a collaboration with AstraZeneca to do a combination of their PDL1 with our CSF1R. So we think from a timing and from a development perspective, we're as competitive if not more competitive than other companies. The specifics around the dimerization, we're going to have get back to you on, okay? Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: That's okay. Thank you. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Andrew. I think we have time for at least one more question, Linda, if you can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Sure. Next we'll go to the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the CGRP program. And I was curious your thoughts about oral therapy given that there was a trade there and a company actually acquired one and is considering moving forward with that. And then if you could, just give us a little bit more detail on the diabetes product that moved in the pipeline there, the URI. Thanks. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you for the questions, Marc. So, Dave, if you can, comment on the CGPR update, and then, Dave and/or Jan, on the oral approaches for modifying CGRP as well, and then to Enrique on the diabetes compound. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Sure, yes. We're excited about our CGRP antibody for two different conditions we're studying or plan to study. First for cluster headache, we announced earlier in the year, we've proceeded into Phase 3, and those studies are enrolling as we speak for both chronic and episodic cluster. And then on migraine, we finished our Phase 2b study in the first half of the year, and actually read out the results in June. We saw robust reduction in headache days, et cetera, and we will be proceeding into Phase 3 imminently. We're excited about this program. We think we have a very competitive molecule in a largely underserved space. In terms of the oral products, there has been a long history of researching and attempting to create an oral CGRP inhibitor. That's proved to be difficult, I think, for many of our competitors. We are in the list of people who also have our own program in this area. We don't have anything to say about that today. We observed the trade that happened and of course wish them all the luck in the world. But right now all the data, in terms of what looks like druggable CGRP inhibition, are antibodies. Those are the late-stage projects, and of course we have one of those. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Good. Thanks, Dave. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : You are right that it's listed on the pipeline is the BioChaperone that we licensed from Adocia. So far, I think the program is progressing extremely well. We're very pleased with the results. And as we continue to get results, we'll be sharing them. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Linda, let's try to squeeze in one more question, if we can, before John closes the call for us. Operator : Sure, and there was only one more question, so perfect. It's from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks very much for squeezing me in. I know we're ahead of guidance in January. But previously, you have talked about this gross margin line and how there can be some reversal of the benefit we've had this year if we see FX going forward. So I wonder if, Derica, if you could just give us a little bit of a hint there. If we saw FX rates, the major rates, stay flat going forward into next year, just how we might think about that gross margin into next year, just so we don't get any big surprises early next year. Thank you. Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Okay. If you notice, on each of our quarterly calls, we provide the absolute gross margin, but then we also provide a slide in the packet where we illustrate what our gross margin would be without the effect of FX. And if you're trying to get a sense of what the underlying run rate is, our gross margins are really running in that mid-70% range. And so once all of the FX noise is cleared out, which we expect to exhaust that once we move into 2016, you should expect that we're going to be somewhere around that natural run rate of mid-70%. Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC : That's great, thanks very much. Phil Johnson - Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. And I also like the fact the IR team doesn't have any homework assignments out of the call. So great, we got through the queue this time. John, if you'd like to, close the call for us, please. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thanks Phil. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's call and your continuing interest in our company. We hope you'll take part on your call on November 11 to discuss the baricitinib data that will be presented at ACR, as well as our investor event in Boston on Tuesday, December 8, where we'll discuss in detail our Animal Health business and provide a comprehensive overview of our efforts in Alzheimer's disease. We hope these updates allow you to more fully appreciate the myriad of opportunities before us and why we're bullish on our future. Finally, if you have questions we didn't discuss during today's call, please contact our IR team. They will be standing by. Thank you and have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President, and CEO. Joining me here on the call today are : Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling, and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. So let me begin by recapping key events since our last earnings call in October. On the commercial front, we have received approval for and launched Portrazza in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the United States for first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. On the regulatory front, just last week, along with Incyte, we announced FDA submission of once-daily baricitinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. We also submitted baricitinib to the European Medicines Agency for the same indication. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received final U.S. approval for our insulin glargine product, Basaglar, with launch set for December 15 this year. We also submitted an 80-unit Basaglar pen for FDA review. We announced that FDA accepted the filing of data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the Jardiance cardiovascular outcomes trial. The data were also submitted to European regulators. As you may recall, Jardiance is the only diabetes medicine to have demonstrated a significant reduction in both cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular death in a dedicated outcomes trial. And finally, we submitted the fixed-dose combination tablet containing empagliflozin and linagliptin to European regulators. We also received FDA approval for the Humulin Regular U-500 KwikPen. We received European Commission approval following positive CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] recommendations for Cyramza for both second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. And Europe's CHMP issued a positive recommendation for approval of Portrazza in first-line EGFR-expressing squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. On the clinical front, we had a number of notable developments. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we presented additional data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study. At the American Society of Nephrology, initial renal outcomes data were presented that showed empagliflozin, when used in addition to standard of care, significantly improved renal outcomes compared to standard of care alone. And we expect more comprehensive renal results to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal this year. And at the American Heart Association, further data related to the reduction of heart failure and cardiovascular death were presented. And earlier this week, European Heart Journal published comprehensive heart failure results. At the World Diabetes Congress, we presented data from the AWARD-8 study showing that treatment with Trulicity plus a sulfonylurea produced greater reductions in HbA1c than treatment with a sulfonylurea alone. Along with Incyte, we presented data at the ACR [American College of Rheumatology] meeting from the baricitinib Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis program, including data from the RA-BEGIN study that showed baricitinib was superior to methotrexate in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in treatment-naive patients, and data from the RA-BEAM study that showed baricitinib was superior to adalimumab in improving multiple measures of the signs and symptoms of RA in patients who had an inadequate response to methotrexate. At the ACR annual meeting, we presented data from the Phase 3 SPIRIT-P1 ixekizumab study showing that patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with ixekizumab for 24 weeks achieved significant improvements in signs and symptoms of their disease when compared to placebo. They also experienced significantly less progression of radiographic structural joint damage, reduced disability when performing certain physical functions, and improved skin clearance of plaque psoriasis. Finally, we terminated the development of basal insulin peglispro. On the business development front, we extended our agreement with Merck to evaluate Alimta in combination with Keytruda in a Phase 3 study in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We also announced a collaboration with Merck to evaluate our CDK-4 and CDK-6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in combination with Keytruda in multiple tumor types. And we announced an agreement with Roche Diagnostics related to Roche's ongoing development of a commercially scalable cerebralspinal fluid assay for amyloid-beta 1-42. In other news, we announced an expansion of our R&D facilities here in Indianapolis. We also announced that we will close our Animal Health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Manufacturing operations and commercialization activity will conclude this quarter, with full closure targeted by year-end. As a result of this decision, the company will recognize a charge in the first quarter of approximately $100 million. In addition, we decided to exit ownership of our Animal Health manufacturing site in Dundee, Scotland. In the fourth quarter we repurchased roughly $250 million of stock, leaving $2.95 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. In addition, during the fourth quarter we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. And in December we announced a 2% increase in the dividend for 2016. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders via share repurchase. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil? Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, John. Before I discuss our Q4 results, it may be helpful to review key features of our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. When interpreting our GAAP results and the growth rates versus 2014, keep in mind that 2014 does not include Novartis Animal Health, while 2015 includes the operating results of this business as well as all the costs associated with the acquisition. For our non-GAAP measures, we now exclude amortization of intangibles. And to provide you a better idea of underlying trends in our business, we've adjusted our non-GAAP measures for 2014 to exclude the expense associated with amortization of intangibles and to include Novartis Animal Health as if we had closed the acquisition on January 1, 2014. This places 2014 on the same basis upon which we are reporting our financials this year. Now let's look at our results for the quarter. Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter reported results. Moving to slide 10, you can see that Q4 2015 revenue was relatively flat compared to Q4 of 2014 at just under $5.4 billion. FX continued to provide a significant top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q4 revenue increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis, driven by higher volume for Trulicity, Cyramza, Humalog, and Trajenta, the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux, and U.S. prices. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 1 percentage point to 77.3%. This increase was driven by productivity improvements from our diabetes manufacturing technical agenda, efficiencies in other manufacturing processes, and increased prices in the U.S. This quarter the gross margin percent was not affected by changes in foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, as the benefit realized in this year's Q4 was very similar to that realized in Q4 last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 1 percentage point, going from 74.7% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter. As on prior calls, you'll find a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last 10 quarters with and without this FX effect. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased 5% compared to Q4 of 2014. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3%, while research and development expenses increased 19%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and continued expense control, partially offset by expenses to support recent product launches. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by charges associated with the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro and by higher late-stage clinical development costs. Excluding the termination charges, R&D expense increased 8%. Other income and expense was income of $45 million this quarter. This represents an improvement of $33 million compared to Q4 2014, primarily due to lower net interest expense. Our tax rate was 13.5%, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Also, our tax rate in both periods included the full-year benefit of the extension of certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit. At the bottom line, net income decreased 6% and earnings per share decreased 5%. As I'll discuss in a few moments, net income and EPS actually increased when excluding the effect of FX. And R&D termination charges mentioned earlier were also a headwind. Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the full year. At a high level, you'll see that full-year revenue decreased 4%, as did operating expenses, and the gross margin percent grew substantially, leading to a double-digit EPS growth. As with the quarter, FX was a big factor on a number of line items. In a few moments I'll cover our full-year results on a performance basis excluding the effect of foreign exchange. Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 24 and 25. Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on Q4 revenue growth. On slide 13 in the yellow box at the bottom of the page, you'll see the flat non-GAAP revenue I mentioned earlier. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies drove this decline, as you see the 6% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 5% this quarter, with price growth of 3 percentage points and volume growth of 2 percentage points. By geography, you'll note that U.S. pharma revenue increased 14%, driven by price and to a lesser extent volume. Humalog, Trulicity, Cialis, Cyramza, and Strattera all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma revenue growth. Having completed the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux. The decline in EuCan revenue of 17% was primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange, while on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven by a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales resulting from the loss of data-package exclusivity late in 2014. Excluding European Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased about 3.5% in constant currency terms. In Japan, pharma revenue increased 8% in total, driven by mid-teens volume growth, while on a constant currency or performance basis, Japan revenue increased 16%. This performance growth is attributable to a number of products, chief among them Cyramza and Cymbalta. Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 12%, driven entirely by the negative effect of FX. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 1%, or 4% when adjusting for the Brazil Humulin tender that we had in 2014 but not in 2015. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 2%, with a volume increase of 5%, partially offset by FX. On a non-GAAP basis, again, which adjusts 2014 as if we had completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 of that year, Elanco Animal Health revenue declined 11%. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, Elanco revenue decreased 5%. This performance decrease was primarily driven by OUS products. Turning to slide 14, you can see that FX trimmed full-year non-GAAP revenue growth by 7 percentage points, or nearly $1.5 billion. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by volume, with significant contributions from the U.S. and Japan. Moving to slide 15, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q4 and full-year 2015 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter FX was a top line headwind, reducing revenue in U.S. dollars by over five percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew nearly 5.5% on a non-GAAP basis. In performance terms, we saw slightly slower growth in cost of sales, resulting in somewhat faster growth in gross margin. Unlike prior quarters this year, operating expenses grew a bit faster than revenue on a performance basis this quarter. Much of the OpEx increase is due to the R&D charges for the termination of evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro. Excluding these charges, on a performance basis, non-GAAP OpEx grew about 4%, or roughly 125 basis points slower than revenue. Excluding FX, operating income declined 2%, while slightly higher other income and a slightly lower tax rate led to non-GAAP EPS increasing 5%. Turning to the full year, we delivered strong leverage on an operating basis. Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, revenue grew 4% on a non-GAAP basis, while our operating expenses were flat, and EPS increased 14%. These are outstanding results. And with that, now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Thanks, Phil. Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 16 shows our pipeline as of January 25. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. In terms of advancement, you'll see that necitumumab was approved by the U.S. FDA for first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Baricitinib was submitted in both the U.S. and Europe for RA, and we advanced two biologics and one small molecule into Phase 2, and three biologics began Phase 1 testing. Since our last update, we also terminated development of basal insulin peglispro. And two Phase 2 molecules exited our portfolio, one for termination and one for out-licensing. You may also have noticed that we provided the mechanism of action for a number of our Phase 1 assets to give you better visibility into where we are focusing our early-stage development work. The positive pipeline progress we've had over the past few years has brought a number of significant opportunities for lifecycle investments in new indications and line extensions. Going forward, we'll be including a slide like slide 17 in today's presentation that details select new indications and line extensions, or NILEX, including movement and attrition as we do for our NME pipeline. We hope this provides you and the investment community with greater visibility into the future potential of our pipeline investments. As on prior calls, I'll recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2015, briefly discuss the key events you should monitor during 2016, and then review our 2016 financial guidance. Turning to slide 18, we're pleased with the positive progress we've made on the key events we laid out for 2015. This progress is represented by the large number of green checkmarks you see. In yellow boxes we've highlighted key events that have occurred since our last earnings call. We've already discussed many of these earlier in this call. So let me draw your attention to olaratumab, for which we've initiated our FDA rolling submission. We expect to complete the submission during the first half of the year. Now reflecting on 2015, it was a landmark year for our innovation efforts. Among the year's achievements, I' d highlight : the reduction in CV risk, CV death, and all-cause mortality shown by Jardiance in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study; baricitinib showing superiority to Humira and to methotrexate on many measures of the signs and symptoms of RA; and both olaratumab and abemaciclib receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. Slide 19 lists key events to watch for in 2016, and we'll update this list on each of our quarterly calls to help you monitor our progress. Since I discussed this list in detail on our January 5 call, I won't go through each item again today. However, I do want to draw your attention to those key events that occurred in the past few weeks. Specifically, we began Phase 3 testing of our CGRP monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, and we submitted baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis in both the U.S. and Europe. In the coming months, we look forward to submitting baricitinib also to the Japanese regulators. We are very pleased with the data generated in the baricitinib Phase 3 RA program. We believe baricitinib, if approved, could be best-in-class medicine and could help improve outcomes for patients living with RA. Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance, we are reconfirming the non-GAAP guidance we provided just a few weeks ago on January 5. We are, however, updating our GAAP guidance to reflect the decision to close our Animal Health manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland. Consequently, our GAAP tax rate guidance has been raised by 50 basis points to roughly 21%, and our GAAP EPS guidance range has been lowered to a range of $2.83 to $2.93. In summary, 2015 was a strong year, both for our underlying financial performance and for continued positive movement of our pipeline. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 4%, with growing contributions from recently launched products. On this same basis, our focus on improving productivity resulted in flat operating expenses compared to 2014, which drove 14% EPS growth. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to drive revenue growth and expand margins throughout the balance of this decade and make major contributions to medical progress. In 2015, we've made steady progress against our strategic objectives, driving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation, and deploying capital to create value. As reflected in our 2016 financial guidance and the key events on tap for the year, we expect to make continued progress against each of these goals this year as well. We entered this post-patent period in a position of strength, with launches underway and important science being done in our labs. And we are very optimistic about the opportunity before us to improve patient lives and create value for shareholders. Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate our Q&A session. Okay, Phil. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Derica. And based on feedback we received on the last couple of calls, those of you who are in the Q&A queue, if you could, please limit your questions to two or a single two-part question. And we'll rapidly go through as quickly as we can the questions and hopefully exhaust the queue during the Q&A time. So with that, Val, if you can, please provide the instructions to the callers for the Q&A session, and then we can go to the first caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, a couple of pipeline questions. On abemaciclib, on slide 19 you mention the Phase 2 single-arm readout underneath this category of Phase 3 readouts on the slide. I think that's the MONARCH 1 trial, Phase 2 single-arm, not likely to be a registration trial. But can you tell us how important those findings are in your opinion towards informing the future outlook for that product and how we should think about those results? And then second question on your BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's, still on track to make a go decision in Q2? And would it be safe to assume that a go decision is more likely than a no-go decision, or is it really still very much up in the air? Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Tim, thank you for the questions and thanks for limiting them to two. I appreciate that. So, Sue, if you'd like to take the question on abemaciclib, and then, Dave, on the BACE inhibitor, please. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. With regards to the MONARCH 1 trial, which as you say is the single-arm, single-agent abemaciclib study, we should get the data on that mid this year, final data with some interim data earlier. As you know, we've also got the two Phase 3 studies, the MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 as well that are in combinations, and we should get that data next year with potential interims this year. We do believe that the single-agent data is an important part. It's not the whole, of course. We'll be interested in seeing all of the data in breast as well as our lung trial, which is ongoing. But this is specifically looking at abemaciclib as a single-agent. We've seen robust single-agent activity in our early-phase data, our Phase 1 data that we presented previously. And clearly, if we replicate that, we think that this could differentiate this product from an efficacy perspective. So we're excited to see the data, and we would hope that we would be able to present that data at a scientific meeting this year. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Sue. Dave? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Yes, Tim. On the BACE inhibitor, I think it would be just pure speculation to guess on what the outcome of the interim safety readout is. Again, we're blinded to those events, and safety is a difficult thing to predict. This class has had some issues, although some molecules go forward, so we're hopeful. But one thing I can assure you is we will have an announcement in Q2. I think we have enough patients enrolled in the study, and we're looking for exposures to get to that trigger to expand to a Phase 3 for the AMARANTH study. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Dave, and then just one thing, Tim, to keep in mind. During 2015 we did get two different of our oncology drugs granted Breakthrough designation. One of those is olaratumab. The other, in fact, was abemaciclib, and that was based on the Phase 1b study that was largely monotherapy study. So again, the Phase 3 program should serve as the basis for registration. And if we do get very strong results in the Phase 2 study, as we said before, we absolutely would discuss those with the regulators and believe they would be interested in seeing those data. Val, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I'm going to make this two questions. On Jardiance sales, which I believe also included Glyxambi, sales were $15 million this quarter, actually I think a step down from the previous quarter, $60 million for the year. I'm just surprised that we haven't seen \u2013 certainly I would have expected to see some sequential improvement just given all the positive publicity. And while I understand that the label does not yet include the data from EMPA-REG, I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing out there. Are physicians looking at EMPA-REG as a class effect? Could it be that the SGLT-2 is facing class action lawsuits related to side effects? If you could, just talk about what's going on there because I'm surprised that we haven't seen a bigger pickup. And then just secondly, in terms of the label that you expect to get from the FDA, what are the scenarios that you see? What is a base case scenario? What is the best case scenario? And what do you think we need to see to drive numbers to reach consensus numbers by 2020? Thanks very much. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Jami. Enrique, those are right up your alley. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Very good. So, Jami, you are absolutely right. Our U.S. Jardiance revenue is not consistent with the sequential TRx growth that we're basically observing for the overall franchise, with just basically 30%. I had mentioned that before we disclosed the top line results for EMPA-REG OUTCOME. The franchise was capturing about 15% of the new patients in the SGLT-2 class. Right now, that is the franchise. As we look at the latest weeks, it's capturing over 26% of the new patients. The reason of the lack of consistency, we had a one-time adjustment due to changes in assumptions when it comes to the accrual for the inventory that we have in the channel. Without that accrual, you would have seen revenue growth or sequential revenue growth consistent with the TRx growth. Now as it relates to when do we expect the new label, clearly we have now shared that the FDA has designated this to be a standard review, which basically means that we would be launching in the second half of this year. I'm not in a position to speculate in terms of what the label would read like. But we clearly are bullish on our data, the consistency and the strength of the data. And we do believe that this is going to have, when the FDA takes action, this will have a very significant impact on the overall trend of Jardiance and the class in general. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just can I ask a follow-up? What are you hearing from physicians in terms of interpreting this data as a class effect or applying just to Jardiance? And is this class action lawsuit something we need to be paying attention to? We've seen these class action lawsuits having impacts on other categories of drugs. So I'm just curious about that. Thanks. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : We are not promoting the new label, so it's difficult to say what the reaction from the broad physician population would be. But we do conduct some targeted market research. And it is pretty clear to us I think based on the research that we basically have that about half of the physicians believe that this has been proved to be a class effect. Let's keep in mind, there's no evidence of that. And half believe that this might be a Jardiance type of effect. So I think the jury is clearly out for the other products, but we do have the evidence for Jardiance. And we think that is going make a huge difference when we basically have the label. We are seeing actually strength in the overall class. So I would say that probably the biggest event that we saw impacting the overall growth of the class was some of the warnings when it comes to diabetes ketoacidosis. So we saw stabilization somewhere in September \u2013 October when the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data came out. And now we're basically seeing class growth. So I do not believe in any way that \u2013 my bullishness in the overall growth of the class continues to be very, very high. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: One real quick comment. So in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study as well, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was very low and was actually consistent across the arms as well, so I think another data point to add to the discussion for that particular potential side effect. Val, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks for the questions, just two here. First, maybe a question for John, just updated thoughts on the M&A landscape. I guess specifically, do you see this market volatility as creating some opportunities for Lilly to get more aggressive and look at some assets? And just what's the focus when we think about business development? My second question was on the BACE inhibitors. And just elaborate a little bit more about how you think about the tradeoff of I guess time to market versus the level of BACE inhibition and dosing when you look at prioritizing the Astra BACE versus the internal low-dose BACE that you have as well. Thanks very much. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Chris. Thank you for the questions. John, you for the M&A. And then, Dave, do you want to take the BACE question, please? John? John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Chris, I think the current volatility and generally lower valuations in the biotech sector doesn't change our basic strategy. We continue to look for small to midsized opportunities that complement the therapeutic areas that we're already in that we know well, so I don't think that has changed. We're certainly not interested in any large-scale M&A. At the same time, there's no question that valuations are more attractive today. There are some different dynamics going on. As you know, biotech is not biotech. There's big biotech. There's medium size, and there's nascent or smaller. And so we're looking across that whole spectrum. And if opportunity presents itself based on attractive valuation and what we think would represent good value for the company, we have the wherewithal to move on that. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Dave, on the BACE? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Yeah, so I think your question is how are we thinking about the two programs and decision-making. I think you were there on December 8, Chris, and we spoke about the theoretical differences in the projects. We do know that the AZ BACE and the Lilly BACE that's in the clinic have different chemistry. We really like this target because it's rare to find a genetic validation like this in any disease, let alone Alzheimer's, which has so much unmet need. And so we're investing in two different ways to get there. At the end of the day, the decision-making, though, is going to have to be based on empirical data, because the theoretical differences need to play out in man. So we're collecting those data. A part of that is the AMARANTH Phase 2 program we're running now and the Phase 1 effort on our own BACE. And we'll have to see the data before we make a final determination. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you, Dave. Val, next caller, please. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes, thanks very much, two questions again on Jardiance. J&J made comments about changes in the ADA guidelines to include the class. And I know you've spoken in the past about changes in guidelines as I guess it relates to medical treatment guidelines overall. So I wondered if you could separate the two and how meaningful one may be over the other. And then separately on the nephrology data that we will get more readouts later, is that package included in the CV outcomes data set, or would it be potentially something that is added after regulatory action on the CV outcomes data set for EMPA-REG? Thanks very much. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Tony. Thanks for the questions. Enrique, so the two questions will be on the ADA guidelines, are there guidelines for Jardiance, and the second one is if the nephrology data that we alluded to that was presented in 2015 was part of the submission of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : So let me start with your second question first. Clearly as part of our submission, we really focused on the CV outcomes. We will be disclosing the outcomes that we saw when it comes to renal outcomes in the very near future. There is a publication that we're targeting. We think that the results are also very impressive, so we look forward for the possibilities that that may give us when it comes to the future. As far as guidelines, and I really cannot comment on other companies' statements. But what I can basically say is that we today do not see any significant changes in the treatment guidelines for Type 2 diabetes coming from any of the major societies or associations, whether it's ADA or EASD. Clearly, the AACE [American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists] issued new guidelines, but they really did not fully incorporate the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data as they were looking at those guidelines \u2013 and this package of those \u2013 some of those guidelines in early January. I am pretty confident that the different societies will have a thorough review of the different treatment guidelines. And I expect, as I have mentioned before, that that will happen once we basically have a label change in the U.S. market or in Europe. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Enrique. Val, next caller, please. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Stephen M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two questions. First, Novartis said yesterday that when comparing Cosentyx to ixekizumab, ixekizumab has higher rates of immunogenicity, more injection site reactions, and only one or two indications upon approval versus their three. I'm just wondering what Lilly's rebuttal to Novartis would be. And then secondly, Novartis also said yesterday that its Phase 3 study of ribociclib is quite likely to stop early based on modeling the company has done versus palbociclib. I imagine Lilly has done similar modeling. So I'm wondering, is Lilly willing to say that there's a good chance that MONARCH 1 stops in the first half of this year when you take the interim look? Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Steve, thanks for the questions. Dave, if you'll take the first one, please, on some of the Novartis comments around Cosentyx and ixekizumab; and then, Sue, on the ribociclib question. David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Sure. As you know, we're in the final stages of regulatory review on ixekizumab and preparing for launch later this year. I'm not surprised to hear what they said on their call, Steve, but I think we can only say for certain that the third one might be true. Clearly, we will launch with psoriasis first. And we're pursuing psoriatic arthritis, as was mentioned on this call, as well as ankylosing spondylitis. Those indications will come later. That said, I think there's really no direct comparisons between the molecules on immunogenicity. And if you study this issue, you'd learn that the assay cut points, which are proprietary to each molecule, there's really no standard for setting those. So there's no basis to compare products within a class or even outside the classes on immunogenicity. I think the most important thing is at the end of the long-term studies, how many patients develop neutralizing antibodies to the medicine. And in the case of ixekizumab, that number is around 1% after one year, which is very low relative to other immuno-therapies for conditions like psoriasis. As it relates to injection site reactions, you have a similar comparison problem. There were reported injection site reactions. It was one of the most frequent issues in our studies, but they were mostly mild, they were transient, and we have good data that shows after the second and third injection those rates drop significantly. It's important to note that ixekizumab also has far fewer injections than Cosentyx in an annual dosing regimen, so fewer opportunities to get that kind of reaction. So we're confident about our posture as we go to market. We feel good about our data, and the primary basis for that statement is the efficacy we see with ixekizumab, which we see as breakthrough and best in class. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, with regard to abemaciclib, we will see the data on MONARCH 1 by mid this year, the final data, with interim data earlier. Again, that is the single-agent data. That, as we mentioned earlier, is the data that we got Breakthrough Therapy on. And depending on what that data looks like, we will go to regulatory authorities. The other two studies are the combination studies, and I think they're more comparable. We will have \u2013 or we plan to have final data on those studies next year, but we do have interims. They're high-bar interims. And clearly depending on what we see there, we'll take action accordingly. I think it's key to note, as we see things, single-agent activity is important. We have not seen that kind of robust single-agent activity with other CDK 4/6 inhibitors. We believe that is due to the relative contribution between the activity against CDK 4 and CDK 6. The other thing is the continuous dosing. These are cell cycle inhibitors, and so you would hope that you would be able to continuously dose these. And we have seen that we are able to continuously dose this agent. So again, that's where we will see \u2013 we believe could potentially differentiate this from the other two CDK 4/6 inhibitors going forward. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. Val, next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering. if Donald Trump is elected, would that impact your long-term margin guidance, Derica? That's not a serious question. But I've enjoyed John's comments about biotech valuations. And Chris already got your thoughts on that, John, but I've also enjoyed following your comments over time on the drug pricing debate. I think on the last call, you said that the industry was preparing to begin to defend itself, and I'd just be curious to know if that effort has happened yet and how you see this playing out. What do you think will actually happen over the next call it two to four years, if anything? And then more of a housekeeping question; on Forteo, I'd love to know what your longer-term outlook on Forteo is given the dynamics in that market, assuming Amgen's sclerostin antibody launches in a year or so and the Radius's PTH-based analog launches. Should we be thinking about this as a declining asset, or are you confident you can hang on to it? And is this still an area of strategic interest for Lilly, or is this something that's more secondary? Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Mark. Thanks for the questions. So, John, on to you about the industry's actions on the pricing front and how you see this playing out in the next few years. And then, Dave, if you'd like to take the question on Forteo, please. John? John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Mark. Thanks for your question. I think yes, M&A from within our major trade organizations, so this would be pharma and bio, there have been, certainly since the last time we discussed this, I think a number of initiatives aimed at putting prices in perspective and then also providing the kind of information that policymakers and key advocacy groups need to have, we believe, to make sure that this debate remains balanced, and that this industry, which we all hope in the future can provide cures for things like Alzheimer's, cancer, and other diseases, remains strong and viable in this country. I think that when you look at it from that aspect, the old saying goes, facts are stubborn things. I think when you look at the comparison year that in many cases is being used as ammunition in this debate, 2014, as all of you know, was a breakout year in terms of pricing, driven by the launch of the hep C drugs, which in some cases cure up to 90% of the people that take those medicines, and the warehousing and in other words the inventory of patients waiting to receive those medicines. If you go back and look at 2009 to 2013, these are not Lilly's numbers. This data is from CMS, that the overall price of drugs, retail and non-retail, the price increases in that period lagged significantly overall healthcare inflation. We felt the pain, obviously, by the fact that we lost patents on four of our biggest products during that period. CMS projections out to 2024 show that, based on everything we know and everything they can see, that the rate of increase in drug prices is going to fall roughly within the same line as the rate of increases in overall healthcare. So yes, I think that's one side of the equation. The second side of the equation is the consumer aspect. It's great to talk facts and figures with policymakers. But if they're hearing from consumers that they got walloped with a huge copay or that they're not able to access medicines they need, obviously we're sympathetic and empathetic to that and tuned into that with various patient assistance programs, copay assistance, et cetera, but also I think a continuing push to ensure that everybody in this country has access to quality insurance. Medicines, after all, help prevent disease in many cases or treat disease and avoid higher downstream costs. This is well documented. I think we've got to keep that in perspective as well. In terms of what we can expect after the election, anybody that thinks they can predict the nomination, much less the election right now, I'd love to talk to them. But I think this is going to continue to be an issue or it's going continue to be on the radar screen because of demographics. And to some extent, as people get older, they're going to be more and more reliant on our medicines. I think we've got to continue to demonstrate that there's value in the medicines we bring. Yes, they can be expensive, but disease is a lot more expensive, and emphasize the fact that low-cost generics, which account for over four out of five prescriptions today, represent ultimately the legacy of these investment efforts on our part and provide the American consumer with tremendous value. So I think you can assume the industry is going to continue to maintain an active dialogue with each of the candidates and to work across party lines to make sure that the views that ultimately translate into policy \u2013 and that's what we've really got be focused on \u2013 remain balanced and factual over time. So I don't think there's \u2013 while I think we are and should be concerned about the rhetoric, I think the facts of the underlying story remain very strong. And I think in surveys of consumers that we've done, I think the interest is just as keen in what we can do to prevent or slow down the progression of diseases like Alzheimer's, how we gain more incremental \u2013 incrementally take more steps in treating and curing cancer. And even with diabetes, what can we do there to go from in essence slowing down the progression of the disease today to perhaps someday abating the complications altogether? Clearly, we're working on all of those things, and I think that's what people expect us \u2013 the research-based industry to do. And we've got to distinguish the research-based industry from other aspects of this price debate. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks, John. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Dave? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Sure. Mark, thanks for the question on Forteo, not one we always get here, but Forteo has been a great product for the company. We launched it more than 13 years ago. We're still growing this product really in every geography in the world. Notably in Asia now, we're in double-digit growth in both emerging markets and Japan, and in performance terms 5% last quarter. As we look ahead, I would say three things. First, this is a disease that has tremendous under-treatment. So today in the U.S., if you have a fracture, an osteoporotic fracture, less than one in ten women receive an anabolic therapy, which is really a problem. So there's a lot of room for new voices and new mechanisms to improve treatment for severe osteoporosis. I think sclerostins as a target is a great target. We have our own asset in the space, although moved back to Phase 1 as we look for an acceptable commercial formulation. Risk/benefit has to be borne out in the larger trials, and we'll look forward to seeing that from the competitive program. But I think there's room for more than one mechanism to build bone in people who suffer from severe osteoporosis, and frankly the patients probably need choices. That all said, as we think about our midterm, Mark, it's important to note that, as I'm sure you've already researched, the IP on Forteo in the U.S. and in other major markets really begins to expire at the end of this decade. So although we would expect continued good performance through the end of the decade, around 2019 \u2013 2020 we would expect to see some form of biosimilar or generic competition, depending on the geography we're talking about. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: You're welcome. Val, could we have the next caller, please? Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you, a couple of questions, please. So first to Sue, you indicated that you would like to discuss if positive the Phase 2 abemaciclib data. What confuses me is how the FDA could grant accelerated approval given this trial excludes patients who have had prior exposure to palbo [palbociclib]. Perhaps you can help me understand that. And then second for Enrique, a trial of Jardiance in non-diabetic heart failure patients, should we expect Lilly to initiate such a trial this year? And when is the earliest you could expect that data within that indication? Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Andrew. Thanks for the questions. First, Sue, if you would, and then we'll go to Enrique for the Jardiance question. Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Yes. Clearly, we first we need to get the data, and then we need to decide whether we go to the FDA with regards to that data. As usual, the trial was agreed with the FDA previously. And although we have seen an uptake on palbo, not all patients are getting palbo. And a lot of these patients are actually pretreated with several different agents. I think it's five to seven or five-plus. So I think it's important that it's a specific group of patients where there really is a high unmet need. And if we see good data in that patient group, we feel good that not only would it show single-agent activity and we confirm the Phase 1 data where we saw robust single-agent activity, but it also would meet a very important need for these patients. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Sue. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Clearly, the data for empagliflozin when it comes to heart failure from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was very impressive. There's not much that I can share now other than just to say that you can imagine that we are actively exploring and thinking about this very important opportunity for the brand. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Val, could we have the next caller, please? Operator : We have a question from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. First on CGRP, can you give us some more color on the trial design and the patient population and timeline? And then can you also provide some more detail on what you will explore with the Keytruda and abema [abemaciclib] program? And if you can't give us specifics, can you at least talk about where the scientific rationale is most compelling and when we might get some tangible evidence that you're barking up the right tree or not with that combination? Thanks. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Gregg. Thanks for the questions. Dave, do you want to talk about CGRP? Jan, feel free to chime in if you'd like as well. And then we'll have maybe Sue take a shot at the second question on the Keytruda-abemaciclib trial. David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Great. Thanks, Gregg. We've initiated now the Phase 3 program for the acute and the chronic migraine \u2013 episodic and chronic migraine patients. This is really not two diseases; it's one disease. There's a cut point in the way these get classified in terms of frequency of headache. I think that's similar to what other people are doing. It's important you note we actually are carrying two doses into the Phase 3 program because we think optimizing efficacy and dosing convenience in a preventative setting like this will be critical. We like our chances in doing that but want to make sure we have the optimal dose frequency and concentration to get the maximal efficacy. Those studies are enrolling now, and we expect data before the end of 2017. These are not long studies to study this condition. The only other reminder I'd throw out there is we do also have a cluster headache program, which is both episodic and chronic cluster, and that is also enrolling. We do expect data in the chronic cluster setting this year, as was indicated by Derica on the key events slide. And that will be the first Phase 3 information we have on CGRP. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Anything you wanted to add, Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology : No. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : As you know, we are doing a number of studies looking at combinations across our internal pipeline of marketed products with immuno-oncology agents. We believe that combination therapies are going to be important, specifically in three areas, in cell signaling, in the micro environment, and also in I-O. If we're looking at the abema study, that's Phase 1 data. Clearly, we're looking at early safety data and potentially efficacy, but mainly early safety data, with looking at the I-O agents for immune clearing of cells. And abema induces senescence, whether the combination of those would have a beneficial effect. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: (57:33)? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : It's across tumors. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: And we had the press release that went out last year in December that Dave had talked about. It would be likely to progress to Phase 2; that that would be in patients with metastatic breast cancer or non-small-cell lung cancer. In terms of timing, enrollment begins early 2016. So certainly, I don't think you'd be expecting to see data this year. That would be into the future, and we'll have a better feel for that as we see how enrollment accrues in the trial. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Val, next caller, please. Operator : We have a question from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. First, can you give us any more color on the three products that achieved the Phase 2 milestones? And then second, just two products, one, Alimta weakness and Humalog strength in the quarter. Can you give us some color on that? Thanks. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Marc. Thanks for the questions. Jan, if you'd like to talk through the Phase 2 entrants, and then Sue to talk about Alimta in the U.S., and Enrique, Humalog, please. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology : Okay. So let us start with the IL-23 monoclonal antibody for ulcerative colitis. The whole area of IL-17/IL-23 pathways clearly has strong interest for Lilly with our ixekizumab data in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. And we believe that IL-23 specifically then could be very useful in inflammatory bowel disease based on human genetic data and also some competitor molecule data that are emerging. So we see these as very complementary to our IL-17 activities. The BMP-6 antibody in anemia is a new target. Actually, the name is bone morphogenetic protein 6. And it's really an evolving area in our strategy to look at how can we influence and treat diabetic complications, and in this particular case then the anemia in patients with diabetic kidney disease in the advanced stage. This anemia is iron restricted and hepcidin related, and it's very common in dialysis patients. And the goal here is to potentially replace or reduce the need then for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which you know have some concerns with CV side effects. We have seen some promising data in Phase 1 on the iron sequestration and are now looking then for effects on hemoglobin. The third one is an oral agent, and that is p70S6/AKT, which is tested in some cancer indications, a cell-signaling inhibitor. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you. Sue, on Alimta in the U.S.? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Yes, we did see some competitive pressure on Alimta in Q4. As we mentioned before, Alimta is standard of care in the non-squamous setting. And with the new agents that are launching, particularly in the second-line setting, clearly we've got two immuno-oncology agents now. We've got Cyramza. We've also got the EGFR third-generation TKIs. And we are seeing significant competitive activity in the second-line setting. And we do have \u2013 and we're seeing therefore an impact on Alimta in that setting and also in some of the later lines where we're not promoting. Our focus continues to be to secure Alimta's first-line use and continuation maintenance use. That's where we'll continue to focus our efforts. We also believe that we've got actually a very nice offering to thoracic physicians across the thoracic portfolio now in the first-line setting. In the non-squamous we've got Alimta. In the squamous we've now got Portrazza with our launch just now, just recently, and of course with Cyramza across the second-line in both histologies. So our focus with our dedicated sales force now in the U.S. focused on thoracic will be to ensure that we continue to establish and secure Alimta's use in the first-line of continuation agents. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Sue. Enrique, on Humalog in the U.S.? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Yes, so we are very pleased with the performance of Humalog on a global basis. The product grew 15% in local currency in Q4. I think this is remarkable given all of the new launches that we basically have ongoing, so we are very pleased. We are gaining share in most key geographies. A key driver for that is the launch of our Humalog U-200 KwikPen, which is basically adding growth to this important brand for us. When we look specifically at the U.S., which grew 20% for the quarter, we have to keep in mind that we had a negative adjustment in Q4 of last year, so this is an easier comparison. That adjustment was about 10 points. So if we were to take that out, I think \u2013 or maybe a better way of saying it, it's probably better to look at the entire year as a better reflection of the overall growth for the product in the U.S. market. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: And that would have been about 9% growth for the full year. Val, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Thank you. We have a question from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much, just a couple of quick questions for Sue. Sue, can you just give us a reference point for what would be a potential comparator to the abemaciclib MONARCH 1 study data? So as I look at it, maybe eribulin might fit into that mix, but I think it will be helpful to know what the baseline performance of other agents is in this patient population. And then separately, can you just update us on timing for your TGF antibody and when perhaps we might see data for that combination? We're starting to hear a little bit of interest building for that program. Thanks. Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, sure. With regards to \u2013 let me take the second one first. With regards to the TGF beta, we have a number of studies ongoing in Phase 2 as well as combination studies with I-O agents, and we should be seeing data on those probably this year and next year. With regards to abemaciclib, again, from a single-agent activity, if you want to look at a comparator, you probably should be looking around eribulin. I think the key thing around that as well is to look at the other single-agent activity across the other CDKs. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Sue. Val, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Yeah. We have a question from Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So a couple of quick ones. On baricitinib, when do you expect to make and communicate the Phase 3 progression decisions for the diabetic nephropathy indication? And what's your current thinking on the potential there? And then a follow-up on ixekizumab, with the upcoming potential approval, can you comment on where you are in terms of launch preparations and give us some color on your expectations for launch performance in 2016? Thanks. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks for the questions. Dave? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Sure, yes. As you know, we have a number of interesting Phase 2 initiatives to explore future indications for baricitinib. I would say there's a high priority for the company to work through those and make lifecycle decisions this year on baricitinib. Diabetic nephropathy is one of them. The data look strong, as presented last year at the American Diabetes Association, but I would point out two things that I think are things weighing on our minds. One is the way in which these studies are conducted under the current regulatory guidance is not the simplest path to market. The studies can be long. Patient selection can be difficult, and recruitment rates historically in the industry are very low for these studies, or slow, I should say. And we need to then balance what looks like strong clinical data against other opportunities we have right now with the molecule in psoriasis. We have data in \u2013 we're studying in atopic dermatitis. We're looking at several other more immunology indications, so to be determined. I would expect, Colin, through the year, we'll exit the year with lots of clarity on the path to Phase 3 for baricitinib NILEX or line extensions. Ixekizumab, I think we're in great shape. We're anticipating approval in the world's major markets, Japan, U.S., and Europe, in this calendar year. We are prepared to rapidly or immediately after approval commercialize the product. We think we've got a great value proposition for payers. We've got a compelling efficacy for patients, and the KOLs I talked to are highly interested in the class and in ixekizumab. And we see actually the class leader doing extremely well I think relative to our expectations. I think it bodes very well for ixekizumab. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Colin. Val, if we can have the next caller, please? Operator : We have a question from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks very much. I have two questions. First, with respect to biosimilar Lantus, could you just discuss the pricing and the adoption ramp that you expect ex-U.S.? Basically, how aggressively are you competing with that to enhance your diabetes franchise commercially? And then second, with respect to the sclerostin, could you please discuss the bone-building risks in the skull that some experts have highlighted as risks to watch and your views on them? Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, if you could handle the question for ex-U.S. biosimilar Lantus. And then, Jan, if you'd like to talk about the sclerostin risk that was mentioned. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Sure. So we don't share our future expectations for our products or forecasts, but we do know what some of the pricing is in the different markets. They're public, at least the listed prices. In general, we see our biosimilar, Basaglar, our biosimilar for Lantus, Basaglar, is 10% to 20% below Lantus. It's difficult to say because there are sometimes rebates that are given that are not public, what the exact price difference might be. But what I can share is that we're pleased with our performance. Each country has its own dynamics. And we basically need to see how this all is going to unfold. We expect this is going to be an important product for us and clearly complements our overall diabetes portfolio. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology : Yeah. Well, as you know, sclerostin is actually a target that has some human validation. And yes, there is a very large and heavy skull that people have then if they have a sclerostin mutation then from start of life. In the treatment setting, clearly the ambitions are to treat the patients that haven't really had these genetic defects. So the likelihood of similar issues I think are clearly much smaller. And you have to watch though for potential changes in foramina carrying then important nerves and arteries and so on to the head, and also potentially middle ear bones which could potentially change hearing. But what we have seen in our studies with our sclerostin antibody has not involved changes then in skull bones and so on that has had any clinical impact. Clearly, we need more long-term data to see is there a risk or not. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Jan. Val, next caller, please. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: You're very welcome, David. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks so much. Maybe if I could just touch on two areas that haven't really come up in the Q&A yet. One is emerging markets and the other one Animal Health. So emerging markets, just curious for your updated thoughts there. You had 1% constant currency growth, I believe, this quarter. Just how do you see the potential for the markets overall? And has your desire or your intention to invest in these markets changed in any way given some of the volatility we've seen over the last several months? And on Animal Health, I think it was a 5% decline at constant currency this quarter, just maybe a little more color. You mentioned I think it was more on the ex-U.S. products, but maybe a little more color on what exactly drove that. And are you still comfortable with the guidance you provided back in December of seeing greater organic growth as we move through this year and getting above the industry growth levels starting next year? Thanks. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Vamil. Thank you for the questions. Chito, to you for the emerging markets question. And then, Jeff, we'll have you obviously talk about the Animal Health dynamics. Chito? Alfonso G. Zulueta - Senior Vice President & President- Emerging Markets : Sure. First on the economies for the emerging markets, there aren't many, as everybody knows, bright spots starting last year, except perhaps from Mexico given its proximity to the U.S. And as the economies go, so does the healthcare sector in many of the markets. So we've had a very, very tough year even on a constant exchange rate for many of our markets, and I think we see that for the next 18 months. Clearly, the one that has had significant decline over the previous years has been China. The prognosis is we will continue to see about a 4% to 5% market growth in China, which is what we had in 2015, and that'll continue perhaps in 2016. Now that growth could be worse depending on how the Chinese government really implements their whole pricing policies that have been pretty strong and pretty robust in terms of trying to drive prices primarily for off-patent products. And so for us, it's critical that we focus on brands that have significant growth opportunities. I think there was a question earlier on Forteo. We see Forteo, we're very bullish about Forteo in emerging markets. We grew mid-teens in 2015. We expect to accelerate that growth further. China grew 60% on Forteo. So we're very bullish, and I think there's tremendous opportunity for growth in Forteo for our business. And so we continue to invest heavily in that brand. Humalog grew 15% last year for us in the emerging markets. We expect to accelerate that growth really across the emerging markets. And then of course, you've got the rest of the diabetes portfolio. Trajenta, Jardiance should do very well as well. Now we are pressured clearly with the products that have lost exclusivity, and we've had a number of those patent losses in our key markets, primarily Alimta, and then recently the rest of our neuroscience portfolio. So for us, the key is to focus on our growth brands. We need to make sure we are efficient with the resources that we've had and drive our growth agenda and using digital channels and other channels to drive better efficiencies and be more effective in the use of our resources. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Chito. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Senior Vice President and President, Elanco Animal Health : Yes. Vamil, relative to the Animal Health business, yes, the majority of the decline came from international markets. It also was isolated to companion animals, very consistent with our last few quarters. We've seen this from increased competition with new entries in the companion animal parasiticide market as well as some distractions as we're still integrating in a couple key European markets. So those were the key drivers. I would note, though, that our U.S. companion animal business grew in the quarter. This was due to launch of a couple key new innovations, Osurnia for otitis in dogs as well as Interceptor Plus for heartworm. So as we look at returning to growth, we've said clearly in Boston at our investor conference in December, we do anticipate to return to growth in 2016 before the impact of FX. We do see some of the continuation of these trends from 2015 in the first half of 2016, and we'll return to growth at industry levels in the second half. I would note that when including the impact of FX, which will be more significant to Elanco, we anticipate 2016 revenues will be roughly flat versus 2015. I think key drivers that I want to note that will return us to growth and give us a lot of confidence in our long-term future is the successful launch of new innovations. As we noted, we have seven significant innovations that will launch this year and into 2017. We're starting to see the impact of those already, with three approvals and launches already. And then I think the other is our key growth engines, areas such as key emerging geographies, companion animal therapeutics, vaccines, enzymes, et cetera. So those will be the drivers to our launch. And then I think lastly, I'll just say that our excitement on the Novartis deal continues. We do see at a minimum the $300 million, not $200 million, but we changed our guidance there to $300 million of savings. And we saw this with our margins in Q4 go up to 19% from starting the year at 15%. And we see that moving to low to mid-20% EBIT by the end of 2016. So this gives us a lot of confidence about the strategic elements of Novartis that are really playing out in the market. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Vamil. Val, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. First on the recent arrangement with Roche Diagnostics for the commercial beta amyloid test in Alzheimer's disease, I'm curious about the timing. What led you to form this partnership now? And the second question is on Cyramza. It was below expectations, particularly in the U.S. I'm wondering if that's a function of PD-1 competition in lung cancer. Or is something going on in gastric cancer? Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Alex, thanks for the questions. Jan and Dave, if you'd like to respond to the Roche deal that was announced and timing for that and our interest in that; and then Sue, the Cyramza question, please. David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Sure. I'll start on the Roche. Jan, you can jump in. Yesterday we announced a collaboration with Roche Diagnostics, which allows the two of us to see a way for that technology to get to the marketplace. This is a methodology that runs on the Roche standard diagnostic kit, which is pretty well established around the world to measure a beta in CSF of patients in a standardized way. As we outlined at our Alzheimer's day on December 8, if we move to the mode of saying if sola [solanezumab] is successful, we do see a number of challenges in early adoption and in treatment of patients. One of them will be the detection of amyloid positivity. And although PET scanning is available in some countries, it's not widely available in others. And so in order to enable patients to have easy and the most convenient access to detect whether they have amyloid positivity, this is one step of many we're taking or have taken to expand access to detection of amyloid positivity, which is key to sola uptake, assuming success. There's nothing new we know about sola. This is just part of our market prep, which we need to do to get a running start should that be successful. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : So with regards to Cyramza, we had a really good uptake in lung when we launched last year. We have seen some flattening over the last few months, and that is based on the competitive set that we talked about previously. Of course, our course in lung is to continue to identify the patients that we see can benefit from the Cyramza-docetaxel combination. The feedback that we get from physicians is still very positive when they use Cyramza. And clearly, we need to make sure that we break through the noise in the second-line market with all the competition that's there. With gastric, we continue to have an opportunity. Clearly, gastric is a smaller market in the U.S. than lung. We continue to have an opportunity to bring usage from later lines of therapy into the second-line setting and to ensure that the combination data with paclitaxel is well known by the physicians who treat gastric cancer. And what we are finding is that because gastric cancer is not as prevalent as lung cancer, often doctors don't see as many patients, and we need to make sure that we continue to go back. We see that we have an opportunity to continue to grow there. And with colorectal, although that's not a key focus for us in the U.S., that is actually exceeding our expectations with regards to the uptake. We are also launching across the globe with Europe. We're in the second wave of launching in gastric cancer now that we got access and reimbursement. We also just got approval for lung and colorectal cancer in Europe, so we'll be launching those this year. And we launched mid-last year, at the end of June in Japan the gastric cancer indication. And that launch is going exceedingly well, and we are very pleased with both the feedback and the uptake that we're seeing in Japan. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. Thanks, Alex, for the questions. Val, if we can, go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Richard Purkiss with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.: Thanks. I had a question for Enrique. If you could, just speak to the overall level of discounting in the U.S. diabetes space going into 2016. And then a strategic question for John. Would you change your view on separating Elanco from Lilly if the EXPEDITION-3 study reads out positively? I guess I'm just thinking that there might be different investment return opportunities at that point between Elanco and Lilly's pharma business. Thanks. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Richard, thank you for the questions. Enrique, for you the question on diabetes discount as we're heading into 2016, and, John, for the Elanco question. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Yes, first, I think the best way to frame this is we really try to ensure that we have appropriate access for our products in the different formularies. The strength in our portfolio, the strength of our brands is really helping us because our payers do want to include products that are basically becoming more relevant for customers that have good outcomes. And we do have a portfolio of brands that I think is very strong and, in fact, is gaining share across every class, across every region, so a very strong performance. That allows us to basically have maybe a bit more leverage than in the past when it comes to thinking about the type of discount that we basically provide. I cannot talk about the specific discounts. But what I can basically say is that we see our pricing basically stable to slightly up in most product categories. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Enrique. John? John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Richard, I can't speculate on a hypothetical situation like the one you raised. I think you can assume that we're working hard across our entire Alzheimer's portfolio with sola in the lead. We're eagerly anticipating that data in the fourth quarter. And I think this year we'll really complete the lion's share of the integration of Novartis Animal Health within Elanco. Getting Elanco back to growth, getting us position to take full advantage of our number three global player size is going be our top priority. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, Richard. Val, next caller please? Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've got one on sola. So Biogen mentioned yesterday some Phase 3 enrollment challenges with the number of centers with PET scans and identifying prodromal patients. So obviously, you know the first step is to have a positive Phase 3 for EXPEDITION. But what commercial investments do you think really need be made to accelerate patient identification to help build the market for more active therapies in Alzheimer's? And then a second question on baricitinib, clearly you guys are \u2013 the BEAM study is part of the NDA. But down the road, how do you guys look at the value of running another head-to-head study to make a stronger claim? Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Geoff. Thank you for the questions. Dave, those are both yours. David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Okay, great. On solanezumab, as we were speaking about earlier with the diagnostic test, there's no doubt that Alzheimer's is a prevalent condition with horrible outcomes, and we need disease-modifying agents. But again, as we pointed out in our December talk, the market isn't set up to really treat en masse people with disease-modifying therapies. One barrier you're pointing out here, which is available PET scanning. Now I think Lilly is in a bit of a unique position here, and I think we've demonstrated that pretty clearly in the Phase 3 enrollment world. We feel we're best in class in the ability to identify patients, put them through PET scanning centers, and get them in our studies. EXPEDITION-3 is the most recent example. We enrolled 2,000 people in 20 months. But enrollment in a study is small by comparison to getting market acceptance of a drug. So we're working hard on that issue. A reminder, Amyvid, which is the leading mode of detection for amyloid, is a Lilly asset approved in Europe and the U.S. We have the only tau PET detecting technique in the clinic. That could also have some utility. And we need to look at the tau sub-study in the sola program. So we have those assets and I think could invest in a way that would look at the whole rather than the parts. That puts Lilly in a unique strategic position. But I do want to continue to emphasize. I think there are structural barriers to rapid adoption of the technology, payer systems, even the ability to infuse and have patients treated consistently. We're working all those thing prudently because we don't have the EXPEDITION-3 outcomes yet, but working to put ourselves in a position to maximize the opportunity should it present itself at the end of this year. And then on bari [baricitinib], I think your question is would we or are we planning to replicate the BEAM study head to head against adalimumab. At this point we have not announced such plans. Of course, we're always looking at our options, but I think the first step now is to get some regulatory feedback on likely label claims from the program we just submitted, and we don't know how strong or weak that is right now. And I think any decision like the one you're suggesting, we would want to be informed by the regulatory process. So we can tackle that one maybe later this year or early next year. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you, okay. Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: I also believe, Geoff, that some of the criticism \u2013 we had taken this into account as we designed the program for baricitinib on some other trials, particularly when they were comparing to Humira, is that they were not run on background methotrexate. We did run this study with Humira on background methotrexate to give it its best shot of performing well. We think it performed as expected, and we're very pleased with the robust result. We saw baricitinib routinely providing better relief for the signs and symptoms of RA. So we believe this is a very robust finding. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Val, can we go to the next caller, please? Operator : Yes, our last question will come from the line of Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Damien Conover - Morningstar Research : Thanks for taking the question. I know we're coming up at the end of the call here, so I'll make it pretty quick. I just wanted to ask a question regarding one of the more likely U.S. pricing reform debates coming up with dual-eligibles. I know in the past you talked about the impact being similar to potentially the Affordable Care Act reform. But I was wondering if you could characterize Lilly's maybe extra exposure given the insulin franchise, where pricing is particularly different in the Medicaid versus Medicare patient populations. And then I guess a bigger question regarding the pharma's defense against what might be a more likely potential reform coming up over the next couple years. Thank you. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Damien, thanks for the questions. John, would you like to take those? John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think what I can say I think in terms of exposure, we're significantly less exposed than we were when we had the big neuroscience psychiatric medical business here. I'm talking about Cymbalta and Zyprexa. Clearly, we have some exposure, not nearly what it was, but I think the number you're talking about in terms of the aggregate impact to my knowledge is still correct in terms of approximating the impact to the industry of the fee and the other measures that's a part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. And so I think you can assume that on our policy agenda this is at the top of the list. And we believe that it's bad policy and ultimately for the people affected would be bad medicine. And we continue to build arguments and to maintain \u2013 attempt to maintain support for this not to happen. Philip L. Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations, Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, John. That does take us to the end of the call. We do appreciate all of you listening in or listening to the replay. Your interest in Eli Lilly & Company is very much appreciated. 2015 was an outstanding year for the company both in terms of the strong financial performance as well as substantial pipeline movement and progress that we registered during the year. We believe 2016 is shaping up to be an exciting year and an important one for implementation of our innovation-based strategy. We look forward to keeping you appraised of our progress over the course of the year, and we hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to John Lechleiter. Please go ahead. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly's & Co. first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me on today's call, and some from remote locations, are Derica Rice, our CFO; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, who is President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Successful execution of our innovation-based strategy has put Lilly on a positive trajectory that became most evident in 2014 and 2015, particularly with regard to sustaining the flow of innovation. Building on that positive momentum, 2016 is off to a good start. Let me begin our call today by recapping progress we've made on our strategic objectives since our last earnings call in January. Slide four should be familiar to you, depicting the four strategic objectives for our post-patent expiration period that we first laid out in January of 2015. On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, in the first quarter we grew revenue 8% on a constant currency for-performance basis. Nearly all of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar and Portrazza drove five percentage points of this volume growth. Starting with today's call, we'll include in our earnings calls an update on the performance of new products for their first three years on the market. In addition, you'll see that we've included additional product information in our supplementary slides. Course, we welcome your feedback on this approach. Turning to our next strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue was up slightly compared to the first quarter 2015 due to the baricitinib milestone payments paid to Incyte, which totaled $55 million in the quarter. Excluding these payments, our OpEx percent was flat. We're on track to achieve our full-year guidance, which, at the midpoint of our ranges, implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue, even including the baricitinib milestones. Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, I've highlighted a few examples of the continued success we're experiencing. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that our BACE inhibitor advanced into the Phase 3 portion of the AMARANTH study in early Alzheimer's disease. Taltz, discovered here at Lilly, was approved in the U.S. for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and initial shipments left our warehouse earlier this month. And just yesterday we received European approval. Also, olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, has now been submitted to U.S. and European regulatory authorities for soft-tissue sarcoma. During this call we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last three months. Finally, on our strategic objective, deploy capital to create value, during the quarter we returned over $800 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase plan. On the business development front, we completed a number of smaller deals including the Aratana deal, to bolster our companion animal business, and we continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth projects. In summary I'm confident that we're on track and achieve each of our strategic objectives and assure you that their achievement remains a top priority of our entire management team. Now, let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, in Europe following European Commission approval in late January, we launched Cyramza for second line, non-small-cell lung cancer and for second line metastatic colorectal cancer. We also received European Commission approval for, and earlier this month launched, Portrazza for first-line EGFR expressing squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. As I just mentioned, earlier this month we launched Taltz in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis following FDA approval in the first quarter. And also here in the U.S., we launched the Humulin Regular U-500 KwikPen. It was a busy three months on the regulatory front as well. In addition to the U.S. and European approvals of Taltz and the European approval of Portrazza, in Japan we submitted baricitinib for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. This represents an outstanding achievement, as regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and Japan occurred within a span of less than 40 working days. This also demonstrates that our focus on development execution is paying off. As an update to the submission announcement we made with Incyte, here in the U.S., the FDA has now accepted our submission for baricitinib, and we look forward to regulatory action in early 2017. As I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Europe, we submitted olaratumab for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we submitted the once-daily combination tablet of empagliflozin and metformin XR to the FDA. And on the Animal Health front we received U.S. approval for Imrestor, a non-antibiotic Animal Health product for reduction of the incidents of clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Imrestor is a protein and a first-of-its-kind therapy that helps support the natural function of a dairy cow's immune system during the critical time around calving, when the risk for mastitis is heightened. On the clinical front, we announced a change to the EXPEDITION3 trial, solanezumab, in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, making the ADAS-Cog14 cognitive scale the sole primary endpoint. Functional outcomes will be evaluated as key secondary endpoints. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced that AMARANTH, a Phase 2/3 study of AZD3293, an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme or BACE inhibitor, currently in development as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's disease, will move into the Phase 3 portion of this Phase 2/3 seamless trial. This movement into Phase 3 triggers a milestone payment from Lilly to AstraZeneca which will result in a second quarter pre-tax charge of $100 million to Lilly's GAAP and non-GAAP research and development expense. As mentioned at our December 8 Investment Community Meeting, the transition of AMARANTH into Phase 3 will also trigger the start of a second Phase 3 study with AZD3293. That study, called DAYBREAK, will focus on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the third quarter this year. Similar to the EXPEDITION3 trial of solanezumab, also in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, DAYBREAK will use a single cognitive primary endpoint. In this case, ADAS-Cog13. Further, the AMARANTH trial in patients with early Alzheimer's disease will also be changed to use ADAS-Cog13 as a single primary endpoint. So we're consistently moving to a single cognitive primary endpoint across our trials in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. And following the successful results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we announced plans to conduct two outcome trials investigating Jardiance for the treatment of people with chronic heart failure. The trials are expected to begin within the next 12 months and are planned to enroll people with chronic heart failure both with and without type 2 diabetes. On the business development front, we modified our existing baricitinib agreement to provide Incyte with the right to develop ruxolitinib or Jakafi for graft versus host disease. We retain rights to develop baricitinib for this indication. As part of this deal, Lilly will receive a $35 million upfront payment that will be recognized as other income in the second quarter both in our GAAP and non-GAAP results. On the Animal Health side of the business, yesterday we announced that we licensed rights to Aratana's Galliprant, an FDA approved therapeutic for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. This deal includes an upfront payment of $45 million plus additional milestone and royalty payments upon meeting certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Galliprant will support the growth of our companion animal therapeutic segment, one of the key growth engines for our Animal Health business. In other news, the UK High Court decided the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would not presently be infringed by Actavis marketing pemetrexed trometamol in the UK, France, Italy and Spain with instructions to dilute the product only with dextrose solution. We plan to appeal this decision to the UK Court of Appeal. Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased $300 million of stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter, we also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and to returning excess cash to shareholders. And now, I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, John. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results. Of note, you will see in our GAAP other income and expense we have recognized a pre-tax charge of $204 million equivalent to $0.19 per share related to the significant deterioration of the Venezuelan economy and its impact on the bolivar. This charge represents the effect of revaluing our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities at a rate of 275. Moving to non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you can see that Q1 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q1 2015 reaching $4.865 billion. Foreign exchange rates continue to provide a top line headwind. Excluding FX, our Q1 revenue increased 8% driven by higher volume from Trulicity, Cyramza, Humalog, Jardiance, and Trajenta among others, as well as by the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux. The effective price was 1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points to 76.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold. This effect resulted in a benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 40 basis points going from 75.3% in last year's quarter to 74.9% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix and the timing of production. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q1 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 1% while R&D increased 17%. The reduction in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower litigation expenses, partially offset by expenses to support new products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including $55 million in milestone payments to Incyte triggered by regulatory submissions for baricitinib in the U.S. and Europe. These milestone payments added over 5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 2 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding these milestone payments, total operating expenses increased about 4.5% which was slightly slower than revenue growth. Other income and expense was income of $55 million this quarter and this represents a reduction of $38 million compared to Q1 2015, primarily due to lower net gains on investments. Our tax rate was 17.9%, a decrease of 5 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This decrease is due to a net discrete tax benefit of roughly $50 million this quarter and the benefit of certain U.S. tax provisions including the R&D tax credit that were in force during this year's quarter but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was partially offset by a higher percentage of earnings in higher-tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year. At the bottom line, net income decreased 4% and earnings per share decreased 5%. While I'll cover the FX effect on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP net income and EPS actually increased 5% this quarter. Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 23. Now let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on Q1 revenue growth. On slide 11 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. When compared to Q1 last year, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies was a headwind to revenue growth, as shown by the 3% negative effect from FX this quarter. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8%, driven by volume growth of 7 percentage points with price growth of 1 percentage point. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven by volume, and to a much lesser extent, price. Trulicity, Humalog, Jardiance and Humulin all made substantial contributions to U.S. pharma volume growth. Having completed the takeback of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1, we also benefited from booking a full quarter's end sales of Erbitux. The decline in EuCan revenue of 5% was entirely driven by the negative effect of FX, while on a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue increased 1%. This increase was driven by volume gains on many products, most notably Trulicity and Cyramza, but also including Basaglar, Forteo, Jardiance, Humulin, Trajenta, and Strattera that more than offset a substantial reduction in European Cymbalta sales resulting from loss of data package exclusivity. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 10% in constant currency term. In Japan, pharma revenue increased 16% in total, driven by high teens' volume growth. You'll also see a slightly larger negative impact from price as the latest round of price revisions in Japan took effect on March 1. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 14%, and this performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza but also including Strattera, Basaglar, Trajenta and Alimta, as well as by Cymbalta following a restructuring of our agreement with Shionogi last April. Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 17%, driven primarily by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, emerging markets' revenue decreased 7% due to the continued impact of generics including Cialis in Brazil and Korea and Alimta in Australia and Korea, the impact of the Brazil federal Humulin tender and stocking patterns in Russia and China. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 14%, or 9% on a constant currency basis, with the growth rate negatively affected by high customer buying in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for customer buying patterns, we see growth in our China pharma revenue. Turning to Animal Health, we completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year, so year-on-year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples-to-apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 1%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, it actually increased 5%. This performance increase was primarily driven by U.S. products, both food animal and companion animal, including contributions from recent launched products Interceptor Plus and Osurnia. As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX on worldwide revenue, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter with nearly all of that growth, 7%, coming from higher volume. Our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar and Portrazza, were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 12 shows that these products drove over 5 percentage points of volume growth. The takeback of Erbitux contributed 1.7 percentage points of volume growth while in total, Humalog, Animal Health, Trajenta, Forteo and Alimta contributed over 2 percentage points of our volume growth. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rearview mirror, still was a negative drag of over 150 basis points on our volume growth this quarter. To anticipate a couple of likely product-specific questions, on this slide you can see that Humalog contributed nearly a full percentage point to our worldwide volume growth. You'll also see in our press release, however, that our U.S. sales declined 14% this quarter. This decline is not reflective of the underlying trends. Adjustments for estimated rebates and discounts, primarily related to the fourth quarter of last year, affected our reported results for Q1 this year. We believe the underlying revenue trend for Humalog is similar to the first nine months of 2015, representing mid-single-digit growth. And for Alimta, you can see that it contributed about 30 basis points to our worldwide volume growth this quarter. I'd highlight that in the U.S., our year-on-year growth rate benefited by a few percentage points from customer buying patterns, while in Europe our sales benefited from increased clinical trial demand. We continue to be exposed to generic entry in multiple countries in Europe during 2016 that may erode sales significantly from Q1 levels. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Thanks, Phil. While Phil quantified the contribution to our worldwide volume growth coming from new products, I'd like to share some color behind the numbers. While it's too early to say much about Portrazza, I will provide a brief update on the other four new products : Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, and Basaglar. During the Q&A session, Sue and Enrique will be happy to provide more details. As you can see on the graph on slide 13, our new products generated $325 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents about 7% of our total worldwide revenue. After limited access for Trulicity in 2015 following its approval in late 2014, sales have accelerated this year. Both commercial and Part D access are now in excess of 70%, and Trulicity's total prescription share of the GLP-1 class is now 17% and growing, making Trulicity the second most prescribed GLP-1 brand. During the quarter, the class continued to grow at over 30% and we see continued upside from here. For Cyramza, this product continues to grow, driven largely by increasing sales in Japan and Europe as sales growth in the U.S. has slowed due in part to the competition from the immuno-oncology agents. Japan now makes up nearly 30% of our Cyramza global sales. We've had a strong launch in gastric cancer and we look forward to regulatory action in Japan later this year on our submissions for non-small-cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer, while in Europe, we just launched those two indications during the first quarter. With Jardiance, we've seen a substantial increase in our new-to-brand share of market with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In total, our new-to-brand share approached 30% in Q1, nearly double what it was a year ago. The overall class continues to experience significant growth with class total prescription volume up about 45% in the first quarter. We continue to see regulatory approval of EMPA-REG OUTCOME data as a catalyst for growth for both the class and for Jardiance. The other catalyst for growth is inclusion of these data in treatment guidelines. In general, we expect guideline updates to come after regulators implement label updates and we are pleased with the first treatment guideline update issued in Canada during Q1. Basaglar is early in its global launch cycle and is now marketed in a number of European countries, Japan and Canada. Early share of the total basal insulin market varies greatly by country. To provide an idea of the differences in rates of adoption, Basaglar's share of market is 17% in Slovakia, 11% in Japan and 2% in Germany. We look forward to launching Basaglar in the U.S. in mid-December this year. Finally, our newest product, Portrazza, launched in the U.S. in December and in Europe earlier this month. Moving to slide 14, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our Q1 2016 results. As mentioned earlier, this quarter, FX was a top line headwind reducing revenues in U.S. dollars by over 3 percentage points. Excluding FX, revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth due to the negative effect of product mix and to lower production volume. Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expense growth also slightly outpaced revenue growth due to the baricitinib milestone payments. Excluding these payments, non-GAAP operating expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 1% while a lower tax rate led to a 5% increase in non-GAAP EPS. Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 15 shows our pipeline as of April 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. In terms of advancement, you'll see that Taltz was approved by the U.S. FDA and by the European commission for psoriasis. Olaratumab was submitted in the U.S. and Europe. The BACE inhibitor with AstraZeneca successfully passed its safety assessment and advanced into Phase 3. And two earlier-stage molecules advanced; our Notch inhibitor for cancer moved into Phase 2 and a dyslipidemia molecule moved into Phase 1. Since our last update, we also terminated development of three Phase 2 molecules and a Phase 1 molecule for diabetic nephropathy. Slide 16 shows select new indications and line extensions. You'll see the advancement of the empagliflozin/metformin XR combination tablet into regulatory review as well as the initiation of Phase 2 work for baricitinib in both atopic dermatitis and lupus. Turning to slide 17, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green checkmarks for the transition of the BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease from phase 2 to Phase 3. A number of regulatory submissions including U.S. and European submissions of olaratumab, Japanese submission of baricitinib and U.S submission of Empa+Met XR, and regulatory approvals for Portrazza in Europe, and Taltz in the U.S. and Europe. We're off to a strong start this year and we look forward to sustaining this momentum throughout the remainder of the year and into the years to come. Now turning to our 2016 financial guidance, the first thing you may notice on slide 18 is that there is a lot of yellow highlighting changes from our last call. For our non-GAAP guidance, what this really represents, however, is just two changes. First, we lowered our full-year non-GAAP tax rate and raised our non-GAAP EPS range by a nickel to reflect a discrete tax benefit recognized this quarter. Second, we've updated our line item guidance for revenue, gross margin percent, SG&A and R&D to reflect recent foreign exchange movements. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see the major foreign exchange rates used for our revised guidance. We've also updated out GAAP guidance for other income and EPS to reflect the Venezuela charge Phil mentioned earlier, as well as charges related to the closure of a manufacturing facility and Novartis Animal Health integration costs. It's important to point out that our outlook for the underlying fundamentals of our business in 2016 has not changed since our last update in late January. To illustrate this point, let's look at an updated version of a slide we showed you when we provided our initial 2016 guidance in early January. You may recall that the version of slide 19 we showed in early January highlighted our expectation for non-GAAP EPS growth of roughly 15%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. As you can see, we continue to expect mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth on this same basis. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect robust operational growth and non-GAAP EPS driven by positive leverage as revenue growth exceeds operating expense growth. This reflects our commitment to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue and expand margin. In summary, we're off to a good start to the year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8%, with growing contributions from our recently launched products, which this quarter drove 5 percentage points of our growth. We're pleased to add Taltz to this group beginning in the second quarter. We have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Yet again, in Q1 we made significant progress advancing our pipeline. Among many others, key milestones included the approval and launch of Taltz for psoriasis, the submission of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma, and the transition of our BACE inhibitor for early Alzheimer's disease into Phase 3 testing. And as John mentioned when he kicked off the call, we continue to make steady progress against each of our strategic objectives : thriving revenue growth, expanding margins, sustaining the flow of innovation and deploying capital to create value. Continued execution of this strategy should position us to make major contributions to medical progress and create value for shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Derica. As we have on most recent calls, if you would do us a favor and your colleagues that are going to be asking questions after you, of limiting your questions to two, or a single two-part question, that would be very much appreciated. Dave, if you could give the instructions for the Q&A session and then go to the first caller please. Operator : It'll be just a moment for our first question. And the first question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. First on sola [solanezumab], how would you characterize your interaction with regulators around the decision to tweak the end point? And secondly, can you remind us on abemaciclib, update us on what you will learn and when over the course of this year? And then the updated thoughts on positioning and differentiation. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'll take the first question on regulatory interactions for solanezumab, and Jan, feel free to complement that answer if you'd like. And then Sue, if you'll give the update on what we expect for the rest of the year for abemaciclib and how we see this one fitting in to the CDK4/CDK6 landscape. Dave? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Sure. Yeah. As we said in the March press release, we have made this change and it's really a decision of the sponsor. We inform regulators but don't actively seek a formal approval step. That's really in the category of a pre-submission or submission meeting. FDA and other regulators have been consistent over the last four or five years that they would like to see co-primaries in these studies. However, I think Lilly's belief, and I don't think we're alone in the field, is that the field has moved, and that both detecting changes and function in these early patients, as well as maybe the utility of the scales we're using, is more questionable than before. However, cognition is clearly something that can be detected easily. As you know, we've moved cognition to the key secondary endpoint \u2013 or function, rather, so that we'll continue to measure this and if we hit statistical significance on that as a key secondary, we feel confident that this is not very different in the scientific sense from dual primaries. And I think it does allow us some additional degrees of freedom in submission to look at two different ways to measure function in early Alzheimer's patients. Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories : And Jan here. I can add that we will give FDA a robust analysis of the overall solanezumab's effect on cognition as well as function, including also the analysis of caregiver burden and various biomarkers including imaging of amyloid and tau as well then as safety, the way the microhemorrhage and edema, then detection using MRI. So I think we will have a comprehensive program. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Jan. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Okay. With regards to the question on abemaciclib, we continue to believe that we could have a best-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor, based on the differential potency of CDK4 and CDK6 based on the ability to continuously dose this agent and on the robust single-agent activity that we have seen. We have submitted the interim data for MONARCH 1, which is the single-agent Phase 2 single-arm study. We've submitted that to ASCO and we have a presentation at ASCO on the Friday. That is based on the eighth month interim analysis. We hope to have the final data before ASCO and to include that data in the presentation. Additionally, as you're aware, we have two Phase 3 trials ongoing, MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3. The final data on those studies should be next year, although we do have interims planned for this year, and they are based on events. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Dave, we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. John, my first question's for you is sort of generally, if you could talk about sort of the drug pricing headwinds debate. You've been obviously very proactive in defending the industry and calling attention to the big difference between list and realized price. Don't know if politicians understand that yet, but I think it's an important story to be told. Can you just talk about how \u2013 is the 4% price that you took or were able to sustain in the first quarter, how sustainable is that? What do you see with respect to realized price going forward for the industry? And if you could comment on whether or not there has been a change in gross to net in various therapeutic categories, specifically, I think we've seen some differences in diabetes, if you can comment on that. And then, too, maybe if you could comment generally on just the impact of your oncology portfolio from PD-1 antibodies. We saw a bit of the impact this quarter, but generally, if PD-1 antibodies in monotherapy work in frontline lung, what sort of impact should we see across your portfolio? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Jami. John? John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Jami. Thanks for your question. I think a bit of the irony to me is as we hear a lot of rhetoric about drug prices increasing sort of in the, I guess what you'd say the lay press, I don't think that there's ever been a time when there's been a more competitive \u2013 when this marketplace in the U.S. has ever been more competitive. And I think that means ultimately that medicines that provide clear differentiation and clear value propositions are going to fare better in the future here than medicines that can be easily commoditized, which really don't adequately differentiate themselves from lower-cost alternatives. Your question about is the 4% price, net price, we realized in the U.S. in the first quarter sustainable, well I think that's difficult to say. I mean, obviously there are different dynamics going on within different categories. For Lilly, I'd say, and for most companies, I think diabetes tends to be one of the most price-competitive parts of the business. I think we've seen that and felt that with respect to net-realized prices on our insulins, for example, over a rather prolonged period of time. I recently, I think in the Wall Street Journal piece, talked about Lilly's sort of net realized price, and clearly we get better pricing in commercial plans by far than we get from government programs where there's largely, based on the regulatory mandates, a much greater discount realized. So I think to answer your question, rather than to say there's going to be different pressure in different therapeutic areas, and I think it's going to come down more to the products that are competing against one another. And I think products really do differentiate themselves. We believe that a number of the products we're launching really do differentiate themselves and therefore while uptake, as you know, tends to be somewhat slower today based on getting listed on formularies because of the way the calendar often works, we nonetheless remain very optimistic about the prospects for those new products. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, John. Sue, on the PD-1 impact to our oncology franchise? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah. Thanks, Jami, for the question. Yeah, we are seeing an impact in the second line setting on Alimta and Cyramza from PD-1 uptake. And I think it's hard to say from a first line perspective what may or may not be the impact because there are a lot of questions that remain at this point in time. Will they be selected patients? There's a lot of combo studies ongoing, for example, with Alimta, and we have combination studies with Cyramza as well. So I think there's a lot of questions to be asked that we'll see over the coming months and years. I firmly believe that we will continue to have an important role for both Alimta and Cyramza and Portrazza in the non-mutated patient population. And what's going to be key going forward is really identifying those patients that benefit from particular agents and the role of combination therapies. Also I think of note it's important that as we're looking at our Cyramza sales, the majority of our Cyramza sales actually now are in the GI setting with both gastric and colorectal cancer. So I continue to see \u2013 although the lung space is going to continue to be increasingly competitive, we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow in the other indications as well. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Dave, we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. A couple questions. On Jardiance, obviously the product has a natural tailwind because of EMPA-REG, but other SGLT2s are presumably trying to preserve their positioning in the market. If I look at slide 38 on Jardiance new-to-brand share of the market, it suddenly seems kind of flat from the start of 2016. I'm wondering if you can talk about the dynamics in 2016 in terms of formulary shifts and possible price competition as other companies like J&J are trying to hold share here; trying to understand why slide 38 shows what it does. And then second question is on Alimta patent litigation in the U.S. Is year-end the likely timeframe when we would have an appeals court decision? And also related to Europe, what is your guidance for 2016, assume about European generic entry in the markets that were covered by that earlier UK ruling? Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Tim. Thanks for the questions. Enrique, if you'll take the first question on what we're seeing with Jardiance new-to-brand trends and what we're seeing in terms of formulary shifts, and then Sue for the patent situation for Alimta. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Very good, Phil. Well we are pretty enthusiastic about our prospects with Jardiance overall, not just in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. Probably the most significant aspect to our overall growth for this important product is going to be the overall class growth. We are pretty pleased with the type of share growth that we have seen when it comes to new patient share on total prescriptions, and there are indeed some dynamics at the beginning of the year when it comes to switching and so forth, but our overall access is very good. It's 85% plus in commercial and over 65% when it comes to Part D access. Now the one piece that we have a watch-out for is once again, when we look at the class growth, even though total prescriptions are still growing above 30%, 46% I believe year-to-date, when we look at new patient growth, that is basically in single digits. Now we may recall that last year we saw the class starting to slow its growth with some of the reports when it comes to DKA and so forth. With the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, we saw some rebound in overall class growth when it comes to, once again, new patients. So overall I think we have to wait and see. Once again I think what I have shared is that it is critical that we see both a new label and new treatment guidelines on both of them. Each of them independently will represent important inflection points. I do want to provide a little bit of color on Jardiance outside of the U.S. because we are seeing some acceleration of the overall class growth outside of the U.S. and we see our share, whether it's Germany at over 30%, Spain at 22%, Italy at over 40%, and in the UK and Canada over 10% basically a few months after launch. All of the trends are very positive and we're actually very bullish when it comes to Jardiance overall. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah. With regards to the Alimta patent, in the U.S., as a reminder, we won our infringement and validity cases at the District Court. This has been appealed but we don't have a date set yet for the appeal, although we do anticipate that a decision would be expected towards the end of this year, as you said. With regards to guidance, we continue to actively defend our patent and believe that it is valid and would be infringed by the launch of generic products. That said, as we mentioned in our guidance call, we have been prudent in our guidance and it does contemplate the entry of at least one competitor with an alternate thought form diluted indexed rows across major European countries. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Sue. Dave, next caller please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Sorry. So a couple of questions on Jardiance, please. for Enrique. So firstly, given the excitement over the EMPA-REG OUTCOME's cardiovascular benefit and the rapidity of how quickly the curves diverged in that trial, I imagine recruitment would be fast. These trials, if there is a real treatment effect in heart failure, could be completed very quickly. So in your expectations, do you think you could get a heart-failure label for Jardiance by the end of 2020 or somewhere around that timeframe? So that's the first question. Second question is do you plan to include Entresto in the control arm of the patients with reduced fraction at CHF within either of those two planned trials? Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Andrew. Thank you for the questions. Enrique, were you able to hear those fine? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : I did, yes. So, clearly, we are very excited about the opportunity to conduct both trials when it comes to heart failure for Jardiance. I'm not in a position at this stage as we're finalizing our protocols to comment on whether we're going to be looking at Entresto and so forth. As you can imagine, all of those are important considerations as we're finalizing that. Clearly, we are trying to expedite this trial as much as possible. We did see a very fast separation of the curves on EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Will that repeat itself in the heart failure trial, the hypothesis is likely yes, but we do need to conduct the trial and I don't want to speculate on what the indication will read like. We really need to conduct these trials and see what the results are, and then we can discuss more appropriately. I'm unable to provide a timing, but given what we've seen, you can expect that we're going to conduct this in an as expedited fashion as possible. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave, we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore. Please go ahead. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Couple things. Number one, hey, John and Derica, I'd just like to congratulate you for taking leadership in the mega drug biotech universe, I don't know, four or five years ago, providing long-term guidance and delivering on it. Number two, Derica, this is one of these questions that's always awkward for an analyst to answer, but I think you owe it to your shareholders to come clean here. Did you root for the Blue Devils or the Hoosiers in the NCAA tournament? And answering that you rooted for both of them is an unacceptable answer. Then I have a follow-up. Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Well, Mark, I rooted for the Hoosiers and I actually serve on the Board of Trustees, so my roots run deep. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Well, there were just nasty rumors out here on the East Coast that you were rooting for the Blue Devils. So I just wanted to clear that up. I thought you had a better ethical integrity than that, but I appreciate it. Hey, and maybe, John, on the Part \u2013 specifically back on reimbursement, kind of where Jami was probing you guys are on, on the specific proposal, the Part B, CMS's outline for the way Part B works, I'd just like to know your thoughts on those proposals. Are those good ideas, bad ideas, incomplete ideas? Do those form a structure for where things are going to go going forward in the Part B market, which of course is a relatively small part of the drug market? And number two, Enrique, I just wanted to \u2013 we've asked you about this in prior calls. Just data continues to emerge, that the oral GLPs mainly out of Novo Nordisk, those seem to look pretty good. And if they continue to look that good, could that cause some type of an existential threat to the oral GLP business like Trulicity. Just love to hear updated observations on what's going on there. Thanks a lot. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Mark. And just for the record, it was Ilissa that was rooting for the Blue Devils. John, if you'd go ahead and handle the Part B proposal question, and then Enrique, if you'll give your updated thoughts on how you see the oral GLP-1s evolving and potentially being a threat to the injectable franchise. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so, Mark, thanks for your question. This is John. So this so-called Part B is a pilot pricing scheme which has been laid out by CMMI within CMS. We believe it's bad policy, and ultimately we believe it's bad medicine. This is \u2013 the term is pilot, but it's going to be virtually cover \u2013 it's going to cover everybody and it's going to essentially I think lay out an experiment on the backs of some very sick people who we want to make sure remain able to gain access to the medicines they need and not be directed toward a certain course of treatment based on how this formula is going to, in essence, change physician or potentially change physician prescribing behavior. So we've made it very clear that we're opposed to this. We've made our elected officials very clear that we're opposed to this, and we'll continue to fight it. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, John. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Mark, first I have to say that the Blue Devils are planning to come back next year, okay? But on your question on oral GLP-1s, first just providing some context on Trulicity, because I think it's important as we look at the type of acceptance that the product is having right now. We're seeing excellent sequential growth; $74 million in Q3, $113 million in Q4 and $144 million in Q1 of 2016. Class growth is exceptional, higher than we had expected. You may recall before Trulicity launched, we were in high-single digits hovering around 10%. So we did see Trulicity as a catalyst for the growth of the overall class, and that has actually exceeded our expectations. And Derica spoke to this, about our share gains and so forth. We are now at 18% when we look at the total prescription growth. But probably the one element that I do want to share is that the feedback that we see from patients and physicians, from using the product from adopters of the product is truly exceptional. So, unprecedented rates in terms of overall satisfaction and reception of the product. Now, so what does that mean with we look at oral GLP-1s? We like where Trulicity stands. We do believe it's going to be a very important option long term for us, regardless of whether oral GLP-1s come into the market or not. Now Oral GLP-1s are going to have to show appropriate efficacy and tolerability. I think given the bio-availability of some of the options out there, you have to question what is going to be the relevance outside of the U.S from a cost of products sold; how profitable is that going to be? Now having said all of that, we do like oral GLP-1s but we are behind Novo. It is an area of interest and one that we are investing to try to catch up. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, thank you, Enrique. Dave, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: I have two questions; first, I assume Lilly has not submitted the abemaciclib interim data to FDA, but what are the FDA requirements that MONARCH 1 has to meet in order to be registrational? Is there a specific response rate or durability of response, or a median PFS that needs to be hit? And is this bar lower at the final look than it was at the eight-month interim look? That's the first question. The second question is, in the last decade, how many times has Lilly increased guidance after Q1 results? I think it's quite rare, so what gave you the confidence to do it this quarter? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : ...Steve. Sue if you'll take the abemaciclib question, and then Derica, the Q1 guidance change question. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Oncology : Steve, as I mentioned earlier, we have the interim eighth-month data. We are hoping to get that the final data and to present that at ASCO. We have breakthrough therapy designation on this, so we will work with the FDA regarding the best regulatory path forward. And of course we've got the two Phase 3 studies up and coming as well. I can't comment on specifics with regard to FDA discussions. They generally will look, as you know, at the totality of the data and we look forward to having discussions with them on this. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank, Sue. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : Steve, we continue to feel very good about the underlying fundamentals of our business. We continue to execute very well and very consistently with the guidance that we shared at the beginning of this year. So from our perspective, everything continues to be on track, and really spurred by the uptake of the new product launches that we've been talking about. In regards to the change in guidance, it really was just two things. One, we made some assumptions at the beginning of the year about the FX rate. While it's a headwind, it's been a bit less of a headwind than we had anticipated, so it has a line item impact, but not a bottom line impact. What drove the EPS change is really the discrete tax benefit that we received in the first quarter, and we're essentially saying that should carry through for the year. So that combined with the continuation of our strong underlying business fundamentals is what gave us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Derica. Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next we go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Oh, thanks a lot. I have a question for Enrique and one for Dave. Enrique, can you clarify what you've submitted to the agency with Jardiance? Specifically, are you requesting an indication and a claim or just inclusion of efficacy data in the clinical section? And just to clarify, can you just help us understand how promotion in the U.S. can differ with an indication versus just inclusion in the label and what your base-case planning assumptions are? And then my question for Dave is, can you just give us a sense of early feedback on Taltz and the label, some of the differences in the label versus the current IL-17 competitor and how you see that competitive landscape continuing to evolve? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you for the questions. Enrique and Dave, since you're both remote, if you did not hear the questions, let us know and we can repeat it. But if you heard it, we'll go ahead to you first, Enrique, and then we'll swing it over to Dave. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Very good. Well, we are requesting an indication for Jardiance and Glyxambi. We do believe we have the data to be able to request that. I'm not going to speculate in terms of what the indication would read, but if it were just adding the data on the label from an efficacy perspective and so forth, it will really fall short of the expectations that we have. Now there are differences in terms of what we can do. And in terms of the value and how payers will see that and also in terms of how we will be able to promote the product. Of course we plan for different types of scenarios, but right now our expectation is that data warrants full indication for the product. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Enrique. And before we go to Dave, just a point of clarification. You had said Jardiance and Glyxambi; I think you meant to say Jardiance and Synjardy. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : That's correct. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : As the products to be submitted to FDA. Dave? If you'd like to take the next question then, on Taltz? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Yes. Thanks, Seamus. So as was mentioned in the prepared text, we've launched in the U.S. now. Just a week and a half or so ago began shipments. At the beginning of the month we began active promotional rollout and that's happening cross-country now, as well as we're excited that EMA approved Taltz last night in Europe and promotion will begin in June in certain geographies in Europe based on the approvability of access that happens over here. So again, how will we differentiate? We're focused on the really outstanding efficacy of Taltz, which again has proven a 90% PASI 75 rate, 70% PASI 90, and 40% PASI 100; really, rates not seen in any other program with all the caveats on comparisons of these programs. The drug works very fast. It lasts a long time. This data's been published most recently in AAD. And I think we provide a really uniquely positive and easy use experience for the patient and the doctor. So we're really excited as the class of IL-17s appears to be demonstrating really the unmet need and the benefits of this new threshold of efficacy which we think Taltz has best-in-class data on. And so we'll have to see about exactly the business results that come as we execute, too. But so far so good, qualitatively. The team's excited, physicians are excited, and the rollout's under way. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : This is Phil, just to add on briefly to Dave's comment. To date we've seen relatively limited use of biologics in the treatment of psoriasis compared to something like rheumatoid arthritis, and we certainly see these higher levels of more complete clearance that this whole class offers, including Taltz, as being essentially a catalyst for significant increases in the use of biologics to help patients deal with this disease. So we very much look forward, as Dave said, to our upcoming marketing activities and believe this class can be a very significant one for the treatment of psoriasis. Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Next we go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. First question for John, obviously Japan appears to be becoming a much, much more important market as you're able to launch your products almost in line with launching in the U.S. and EU. Volume growth was 18%; however, Japan does have every-other-year price increases and are contemplating going to every-year price decreases going forward. What is the industry doing to help educate the Japanese market to potentially prevent them from going in that direction? Second question for Derica or Phil, on the gross margin benefit from the improvements made to your insulin production. Can you quantify what that benefit is in your gross margin? And then last question just for Jan on Jardiance and the two heart failure trials, have the companies been able to identify, aside from the diuretic effect, what other effect is occurring that could potentially benefit heart failure patients here pre-clinically? Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, John. Thank you for the questions. John, if you'll start off with the Japan questions, and Derica and I may tag team the insulin manufacturing, and then Jan for Jardiance. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, John. Thanks for your question. With respect to Japan, I think Lilly, first of all, I'd say Lilly is well-positioned in Japan. We've been one of the fastest-growing, if not the fastest growing company in Japan now for a number of years actually. And these recent new product launches are keeping us on a strong trajectory there. We are very concerned about the threat of annual repricing. The industry's been quite active in engaging with the policy makers in Japan. I myself have been engaged in that quite recently. Japan is seeing a more rapid uptake of generics. They're ahead of the time scale for generic adoption that was initially laid out by the government. We believe that, in combination with the current biennial price decreases, puts Japan on a trajectory to keep their drug costs essentially flat for the remainder of this decade and beyond. Now, of course there are macroeconomic considerations that the government is sort of building into the entire calculus there. They try to help the economy recover, but certainly part of that economic recovery \u2013 a key part of Abe's platform has been to actually develop and grow the indigenous biopharmaceutical industry there. So part of our messaging has also included the fact that without an opportunity to realize full value from the products that we do launch there. I think the emphasis on the discovery and development of innovative new medicines in Japan is going to suffer as well. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, John. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Chief Financial Officer & EVP- Global Services : John, in regards to your gross margin question regarding the impact of our insulin agenda or tech agenda, it's about, we anticipate about an $80 million benefit for the full year 2016. But also recall in addition to that, the fact that we can utilize our current footprint also allows us to have significant capital avoidance, meaning that we do not have to build a new bulk insulin manufacturing facility, and that would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Derica. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories : Yeah. So let me just remind you that Jardiance had an impressive reduction in hospitalization for heart failure, which was kind of an unexpected finding. We are now planning then to perform studies in both types of heart failure patients, both with a preserved injection fraction where the filling is a problem and the reduced injection fraction, where it's more contractility of the heart that is a problem. And we will do these not only in type 2 diabetics, but also in non-diabetes patients to see if we see similar benefits there. Regarding the mechanism, as you know, Jardiance has reduction in blood pressure. It causes diuresis, which together then could be an overall volume reduction benefit. There could be other vascular effects still could be characterized. And we should also emphasize that Jardiance not only has an effect on CV outcome, but also kidney benefits that I think need to be characterized further. So overall, we are very excited about this opportunity, but I think the exact mechanism, there are more to be learned. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Jan. John (sic) [Dave], if we can go to the next caller for the next question, please. Operator : The next line is Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Following up on the BACE commentary earlier, can you just elaborate a little bit about how you're thinking about end points for Alzheimer's studies going forward? I guess specifically ADAS-Cogs versus CDR Sum of Boxes? I guess what type of functional data if any do you think you're going to need for these early Alzheimer's studies? And just any comments there would be appreciated. Second was on Trulicity and how you're thinking about the Victoza CV outcome study. It clearly seems for the class, and to the extent you're studying it as well, it's a positive. But I'm more interested in the near-term dynamics as you're ramping Trulicity and as you think about a competitor with CV outcomes data, how that plays into the nearer term ramp of the drug? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks for the questions. Chris. Dave, if you'd like to start off on the question with regard to endpoints in the Alzheimer's disease studies. Jan, feel free to compliment that answer if you'd like. And then Enrique, if you'll take the Trulicity CV outcomes question that Chris had. Dave? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Yeah, thanks, Chris. And Jan, jump in as we go through this. In terms of the base announcement today, which are that we're bring coherence to the idea that early Alzheimer's studies, the primary endpoint should be cognition. We're using it as Cog14 in the sola [solanezumab] study and 13 in the two AZ BACE studies. That's just purely a function of two very similar instruments, and one we started with in AZ BACE was different than sola [solanezumab], but we expect them to yield very, very similar outcomes. And as we said before in the sola [solanezumab] announcement, we think that this is a much better way to detect changes in cognition, preclude and predict changes in function. And then measuring function anyway in early Alzheimer's is a difficult prospect, both because patients are losing function typically at a very, very slow rate early and then accelerating as they go through the disease, but also because the instruments being used really are unproven in drug trials. As you know, Chris, we've done a lot of drug trials, both placebo-controlled and active, failed, and some with some positive results. You mentioned CDR Sum of Boxes. This is a composite index that looks at both function and cognition. It's quite a complicated instrument. Training and implementation at sites is one of the more onerous ones, and although it does show coherence with disease progression across the whole continuum, we have had less of that observation in our programs and find that ADAS-Cog, and for function IADL and the FAQ and other measures of function probably are a bit better in early disease. Final comment is AMARANTH includes prodromal patients, so this is really pre-diagnosis Alzheimer's. The new study, DAYBREAK, will include mild and of course EXPEDITION3 is mild. We think the appropriate primary endpoint is all those settings is a cognitive endpoint with multiple secondaries and a measurement of function as well as biomarkers. Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories : Yeah, and I can complement by just some future then opportunities in relation to biomarkers as potential surrogate markers of efficacy. And here, as you know, we have our tau imaging agent in Phase 3 which is undergoing studies then right now to correlate on the PET imaging and be able to autopsy location of tau, and we're also following disease progression. And we are using this as a potential surrogate marker then, in EXPEDITION3 for sola [solanezumab], and also then we include this in our base studies to see then if anti-amyloid reduction can influence actually the tau signals spreading in the brain. And we also have a tau imaging in the A4 and DIAN studies, all pre-clinical Alzheimer's. So I think that's a potential next evolution that could then also reduce the time needed then to do potentially studies in the Alzheimer's space if we could have a surrogate marker, actually, of efficacy. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Jan. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President & President, Lilly Diabetes : Sure. So we view in a positive way the CV result of liraglutide. We think this is going to have a huge positive overall \u2013 it's going to be a huge catalyst for the overall GLP-1 class. And we view it with optimism because of REWIND. You may recall that we have powered REWIND, our trial, our CV trial for Trulicity, is powered for superiority. We expect to have an interim look sometime later this year and the trial is expected to be concluded sometime in late 2018. Before I can comment on any type of near-term impact, I'd like to see the data, which is going to be released in detail at ADA. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Enrique? Dave, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, again on sola [solanezumab]. Just to clarify, I think you've mentioned before the final patient for EXPEDITION3 in October and then we should get some sort of top line press release by the end of the year. I'm just curious, will that top line release also include some of the functional endpoint information? Or will it strictly stick to the primary that's on the cognition side? And then my second one also on sola [solanezumab], I'm just curious, you talked a lot about the regulatory side and kind of the change in endpoints here and how cognition may be the better way to look at this earlier group of patients. What about on the commercial side? Do you see any more challenge in terms of reimbursement for a product if it's only showing cognition benefit and maybe a very mild sort of impact on the functional side? And maybe you could comment on U.S. versus ex-U.S. dynamics there in terms of acceptance of a product that's more driven by a cognition benefit and less on the functional side. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Vamil. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to take those, feel free to flip the first one back to me if you'd like, but if you want to comment on either or both of those, please do so. David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Sure. You have the timeline correct from our previous communications in terms of what we expect; October and then sometime before Christmas, maybe just before, a top-line readout. I think it's probably premature to comment on the exact content of that, although as usual, we'll try to be transparent with our investors as we can be without jeopardizing publication. I think we've also said it's difficult to predict right now what meeting we will be presenting that data, because there isn't actually an obvious one shortly after that. So we're working on finalizing all of this, and if we can, we'd like to be as transparent as we can with the top-line results, including key secondary endpoints like function and make sure we guard against jeopardizing the publication, which hopefully will be shortly thereafter. Feel free to jump on that, Phil, if I got any of that wrong. And then in terms of commercial impact, we do believe demonstrating impact on function as well as biomarkers is important. But I think the most important thing is to establish that solanezumab is a disease-modifying agent, meaning unlike symptomatics, that if you remove the therapy, patients don't simply return to their previous state. But there's a permanent alteration in the trajectory of decline. And decline measured by whatever measure we want, whether that be function or cognition. I think we've established some important information around that with the EXPEDITION extension data presented last summer, but obviously, we need to repeat that finding in EXPEDITION3 and really demonstrate that there's a building effect through time, and that in the open-label extensions that come out of all these studies, we can again replicate that. So disease modification is the key commercial handle I think to set up a new class for really changing the outcome for patients with Alzheimer's. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Dave. And you summarized the team's plans for disclosure for the EXPEDITION3 trial perfectly well, so I have nothing to add to that. Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next one would be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. So my questions are also on sola [solanezumab]. I guess I'll start with sort of a constructive question and then transition to a more critical question. So with respect to changing the endpoint, could you just talk a little bit how making cognition the only primary endpoint makes it easier to achieve statistical significance? And explain how the statistics are now different in that function, I believe I guess will be tested as a 0.05 statistical hurdle previously as a co-primary endpoint. The statistical hurdle would have potentially been more challenging. So if you could just please explain how the statistics benefit, that would be helpful. And then, in looking at and trying to understand the lack of confidence that you have in showing a functional benefit, it's a little bit perplexing, because Aricept shows a functional benefit within six months in just a few hundred patients. Now, granted, it's a different type of drug, and their tests did include moderate patients. But since EXPEDITION3 has 2,100 patients, so it's dramatically larger than historical Alzheimer's trials, I'm just wondering how to think about a potential lack of functional benefit over 18 months, particularly since the mild patients will transition to being moderate patients over time. And I think Lilly's conclusion is that sola [solanezumab] doesn't work in moderate patients. So just I guess the question is specifically, how should we think about a potential lack of functional benefit in a 2,100-patient trial if patients are progressing towards being moderate and the general view is that sola [solanezumab] doesn't work in moderate patients? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : All right, Dave. Thanks for the questions. We'll go to the tag team again of Dave Ricks and Jan Lundberg. So, Dave, if you'd like to lead off, and Jan, feel free to fill in. David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Let me address the second question first, Dave, because I don't think, based on your question, we see things the way you characterize them. We don't have a lack of confidence that solanezumab won't affect function. In fact, if we go back to the pool of mild disclosure back in 2011 \u2013 sorry, 2012, you will see that we had a 0.001 impact on all measures of cognition that we listed, and a 0.057 on ADL, a 0.045 P-value on IADL, so it's based on that we selected ADAS-Cog14 and IADL as original endpoints. Our design both powers the study more significantly and excludes patients who lack amyloid, which we believe should give us a better signal-to-noise ratio for an anti-amyloid therapy. So I would encourage investors not to be confused that this change has any bearing on our confidence. And, again, to remind everyone, we have seen nothing as it relates to the blinded data on EXPEDITION3, and won't until the final database block later this year. So why did we do this? I guess there's three hypothetical scenarios of the outcome. On the extremes you'd have total failure to replicate the pooled mild data, meaning there is no relevant effect of solanezumab. And if that ends up being truth out of EXPEDITION3, I don't think this matters, and probably nothing would have. We don't believe that's the most probable case, but I guess critics might highlight that. On the other hand is a scenario where we hit or replicate EXPEDITION1 and 2 pooled mild data as strongly or maybe even with a better P-value than the pool of mild information previously published. In that case, this change doesn't really matter either because we will have hit the primary and hit the key secondaries; we'll go to the regulators with both of those data sets and, I believe, meet the qualifications for approval that existed previously. I think the reason to do this is a scenario where you achieve cognition, but have a close call on function. And given the measurement issues with function in mild Alzheimer's as I described in an earlier answer on the call, that is a possibility. We don't think the most probable, but it's a possibility. And we want to allow for that by being able to a) measure function two ways : FAQ is another instrument, a more tailored instrument for early Alzheimer's; and the IADL, which I've described already. Additionally, as Jan mentioned, we're measuring caregiver activity in a broad light and many, many other instruments we can draw upon. We think this will maximize the chance of both a submission and potential for approval, and that's why we made this move, just to be clear on all of that. I think it's \u2013 we already have shown data that intervening with disease-modifying agent in mild Alzheimer's disease does carry over into moderate phase. That was published last year in the EXPEDITION extension data, and we can talk about that offline if you'd like to. Finally, your first question was how do the statistics work? And I just want to highlight we have not finalized our statistical analysis plan in the finer point of detail, so I'll just talk in broad strokes here. But when you have dual primaries, you need to split your 0.05 alpha in half and allocate it to the two primaries to achieve the statistical significance on both versus just one. So in this way, there's a little wider moat on achieving ADAS-Cog14 \u2013 based on our previous finding, I'm not sure that's critical to achieve ADAS-Cog14, but it is a point to note. And then we can then divide the alpha that's left among the key secondaries, which in this case will be the FAQ as well as the IADL functional instruments. So in theory, there could be more alpha allocated to the IADL or the FAQ based on our final design. So there is an incrementally positive impact on statistical calculations at the end of the day. Again, that's not the primary reason we're doing all this. It's because we really do believe cognition matters. It predicts functional decline, and we've powered this study, as you point out, to achieve significance on both. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay, great. That's an excellent response. No further comments from the group here, so, Dave, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : We will next go to the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on the BACE and one on Taltz. So on the BACE, I know there's a safety look. Was there any efficacy hurdle at all to transform or to transition AMARANTH to Phase 3? And then how do you think about the rate of amyloid plaque reduction or cognitive decline for the BACE class in general compared to direct beta amyloid antibodies? And then on Taltz, I mean, clearly your competition has informed us, the market about the attitudes towards the IL-17 class, but as you guys prepare for the EU reimbursement discussion, what, if any, are there subtleties between the U.S. and European markets, and how much of a role do you think switching will play in the initial stages of the launch? Thanks, guys. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Geoff. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to start off on those, and then, Jan, feel free to add what you like on particularly the rate of amyloid reduction that we might expect with BACE inhibitors, what we've seen already either in pre-clinical or clinical studies. Dave? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think my part on that will be short because as we previously announced, the interim look on efficacy which triggers a move, or a safety rather, which triggers a move of the BACE inhibitor from Phase 2 to Phase 3 was predefined and really focused only on safety. We do have biomarker data on Abeta clearance. Maybe Jan can comment on here with the AZ BACE inhibitor, but we really just focused on discharging safety in a class that has had off-target safety effects. And we were pleased with the result announced earlier this month. Maybe I'll transition to Jan on the mechanistic question in Alzheimer's and then we can go back to Taltz in the EU and switching question. Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology; President, Lilly Research Laboratories : Yeah, as you know, solanezumab is an antibody that has a limited penetration to the brain, about 0.1%, and it binds free amyloid beta. BACE inhibitors, on the other hand, are oral agents that better penetrate the blood/brain barrier and prevents the formation of amyloid beta from the amyloid precursor protein. No real clinical comparisons have been made then on these agents. What actually happens with the amyloid contents overall in the brain realizing that the amyloid in the brain is probably in different forms, and yes, there is plaques which are very solid, but they're also then intermittent forms and free amyloid there. I think what we have seen in pre-clinical models is that the BACE molecules can reduce the amyloid load then in the various transgenic mice models. And the effects of solanezumab in those models have been more difficult I think to demonstrate in the same way. But you know, I think overall we will have to look at the clinical data in the end. Sola [solanezumab] has a very favorable safety profile if you look overall, even than compared to some other anti-amyloid antibodies, which are in development, whilst the safety of the BACE inhibitors, particularly in larger trials, have still to be proven. And recognizing that old-age Alzheimer's patients are fragile, and you need also very safe agents. So more to come. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Jan. Dave on Taltz in Europe? David A. Ricks - President-Bio Medicines & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So as you point out, we were quite encouraged by the early adoption of the class. I didn't read it too carefully, but I noted the Novartis antibody had strong success O-U.S. I think particularly in Germany, the early uptake. As we look at Europe, which we do expect rollouts and launches beginning this summer and then through really the end of 2018, that's the cycle for reimbursement assessment. So the full revenue picture won't be elucidated till after 2018 really. But in Germany, we will get an early read, because of the way the reimbursement works. We have a very strong and competitive label in Europe, including first-line indication for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. All of the same efficacy endpoints and maybe a few others that I mentioned from the U.S. question earlier. The drug works rapidly. That's noted in the label, and consistently with long duration of effect. Switching is an important factor in this market, but perhaps not in the sense that someone achieves success and then switches to a brand that could give them even better success. What we see is a lot of patients try and lapse treatments. And as Phil mentioned earlier, we estimate less than 1 in 10 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is currently on a biologic. But there's quite a number that have tried one in the past and are no longer using it. So in this way switching, meaning they were on something before and now can reinitiate on this promising new therapy, Taltz. And our share of label in Europe highlights that, that the drug is both durable and effective in patients independent of words, whether it's a first-line, naive biologic, a switch, a lapse biologic, or some refractory to multiple biologics. So that's an important pool of patients as we have early launch and uptake. And again, we're very optimistic for this product. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Dave. I think about the count clerk we got through about a dozen callers in the hour of Q&A that we have. I do apologize for those of you that are still in the queue, but we have reached the end of the call. The IR team will give you guys a call back and gals a call back after this call concludes. I'll now turn it over to John for some closing remarks. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, Phil. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. Now, we hope you'll take part either live or via webcast in our Investor Event on May 24 in New York City. Last December in Boston we reviewed our Animal Health business and our broad R&D program in Alzheimer's disease. At our May 24 meeting, we'll review in detail our research and development efforts in oncology, diabetes, immunology and pain. We hope these periodic updates allow you to more fully appreciate the substantial opportunities before us and why we're bullish on our future. Finally, if you have questions we didn't address, as Phil said, please contact our IR team. They will be happy to help. Thanks and have a great day.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's second quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me today in the room are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of our Elanco Animal Health business; and Ilissa Rassner, Christina Wright (1:13), Brad Robling, Chris Ogden (1:17) and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional. It is not sufficient for a prescribing decision. Before we dive into this quarter's activities and financial results, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks at a more strategic level. 18 months ago on our guidance call in January 2015, as we emerged from the series of patent expirations we referred to as the YZ period, we described refinements to our innovation based strategy as well as our key strategic objectives for the remainder of the decade. Those four strategic objectives were grow revenue, expand margins, sustain the flow of innovation and deploy capital to create value. I'd like to provide a bit more detail than we have in the past on our future expectations for each of these objectives, starting with the sustained the flow of innovation. At our meeting in Boston last December, we discussed in great detail both our animal health business and our comprehensive Alzheimer's disease R&D efforts. We followed that up at our meeting this past May, where we took an in-depth look at our R&D efforts in diabetes, oncology, immunology and pain. Between these two meetings, we hope you've gained a greater appreciation for the significant future growth opportunities we see in each of our human pharma focus areas as well as in Elanco Animal Health. As an innovation-based pharmaceutical company, our future growth prospects are determined by the flow of innovation from our pipeline. As we discussed at our R&D meeting in May, we believe we've made substantial progress building an R&D engine that can sustain a flow of innovation to support our growth aspirations. Over a 10-year period starting in 2014, we believe we could launch 20 or more new medicine. These 20 launches span the five therapeutic areas we focused on : diabetes, oncology, neurodegeneration, immunology and pain. And the revenue growth from these new product launches will be reinforced by new indications and line extensions, which on average could number two per year. So how do we see this translating into revenue growth for the balance of this decade? Having already launched six products in the past two years, with more launches possible in the next few years, we expect to generate robust revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, despite facing a number of significant patent expirations. To provide a floor for our expectations, we've analyzed a range of scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on this analysis, we expect annual revenue growth over this period to average at least 5% on a constant currency basis driven by higher volume, not price. And we certainly see scenarios for clinical, regulatory and commercial success that would drive revenue growth significantly higher than this minimum expectation. I would point out that our revenue growth expectations do assume increased price pressure in the US, but do not include any significant government action on Medicare Part D, for example, and also assume that we maintain Alimta patent exclusivity in the US throughout the period. With regard to our margins, we remain on track to achieve our goal of reducing operating expenses, sum of R&D and SG&A, to 50% of revenue or less in 2018. And when excluding foreign exchange, we expect to increase gross margin as a percent of revenue over the remainder of this decade. Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we will follow the priorities we've outlined for you since early 2015. First and foremost, we'll fund the considerable opportunities provided by our existing products and our pipeline. Second, we will actively pursue opportunities to bolster our future growth prospects through business development. You should expect these efforts to be concentrated on our existing human pharma therapeutic areas and our animal health business. Finally with the strength of our current business and pipeline, we plan to return to annual dividend increases to our shareholders beginning in December of this year, and to return excess cash via share repurchases. I hope this provides you with greater clarity on the progress we expect to make on our four strategic objectives through the end of this decade. Now let's move to this quarter's results. As I did last quarter, I'm going to use that same strategic objectives framework to summarize our progress. On our first strategic objective, grow revenue, we grew revenue 8% in the second quarter on a constant currency or performance basis. All of this performance growth was driven by volume. And in total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Portrazza and Taltz drove 6 percentage points of this volume growth. On our next strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue declined 90 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca, our non-GAAP OpEx percent decreased nearly 3 percentage points. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance, which at the midpoint of our ranges, implies an improvement of 200 to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenues. Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, Taltz was approved in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. For the PSA indication, this marks the first time I can recall that a new indication was first approved in Japan. Kudos to our Japanese regulatory colleagues on this outstanding accomplishment. Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody from our ImClone acquisition, received priority review status here in the US, and an FDA advisory committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. During the call, we'll provide a more complete list of the pipeline progress we've achieved over the last three months. Lastly, on our strategic objective deploy capital to create value, we completed a number of smaller deals to bolster both our human pharma and animal health businesses. We will continue to actively pursue additional external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. And finally during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. In summary, I'm confident that the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020. And I assure you that their achievement is a top priority for our entire management team. Now let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, earlier this month we began initial launches of Taltz in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and Elanco Animal Health launched Inteprity, a first-in-class animal use only in-feed antibiotic approved for the prevention of necrotic enteritis, a significant and costly intestinal disease in poultry. Once again, it was a busy three months on the regulatory front. In Japan, we received approval of Cyramza for two new indications, one in metastatic colorectal cancer and the other in non-small cell lung cancer. Also in Japan as I just mentioned, we received approval for Taltz for both psoriasis and for psoriatic arthritis. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received two FDA approvals for a once daily form of Jentadueto for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes and for a larger 80-unit Basaglar KwikPen, we remain on track for a mid-December launch of Basaglar. The FDA determined that we met the requirements for pediatric exclusivity for Effient. Based on this decision by the FDA, Lilly has gained an additional six months of US market exclusivity with compound patent exclusivity now expiring in October 2017. In oncology, the FDA granted priority review for olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, we expect FDA action before the end of the year, and as I mentioned earlier, an FDA advisory committee voted 12 to 11 that substantial evidence exists to establish that Jardiance reduces cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Jardiance as you know is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly. On the clinical front, at ASCO we presented results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 study of abemaciclib, our CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor in patients with hormone-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The data showed single-agent activity as measured by objective response, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer patients for whom endocrine therapy was no longer a suitable treatment option. As Sue mentioned on our recent investor call to discuss these data, the interim Phase III readout for MONARCH 2 will occur in the near future. Given the close proximity of this readout to the final MONARCH 1 data, we expect to submit MONARCH 1 data to the FDA as early as later this quarter after the interim MONARCH 2 readout. Also at ASCO, along with Merck, we presented promising early-stage clinical data on the combination of Keytruda with Alimta in frontline non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and of Keytruda with Cyramza in later lines of non-small cell lung cancer. At ACR, along with Incyte, we presented data for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis from the Phase III long-term extension study, RA-BEYOND. Among other things, these data show that baricitinib was superior to placebo at inhibiting joint damage. We continue to be pleased with the data generated on baricitinib in RA, and we look forward to regulatory action next year in the US, Europe and Japan. At the American Diabetes Association along with BI, we presented results from the Phase III MARLINA trial demonstrating that Trajenta, a DPP-4 inhibitor, reduced blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes who were at risk for kidney impairment with a renal safety profile similar to that seen in other trials. And from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, showing that Jardiance reduced the risk for new onset or worsening kidney disease by 39% versus placebo when added to standard of care in adults with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease. Also at ADA, we presented results from the AWARD-9 study, showing that Trulicity significantly reduced blood sugar and body weight as an add-on to insulin glargine compared to placebo plus insulin glargine. In other news, Lilly and BI announced a collaboration to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with BI 836845, Boehringer Ingelheim's insulin-like growth factor, ligand neutralizing antibody in patients diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. And Elanco Animal Health announced a collaboration with EnBiotix to use EnBiotix' technology to develop alternatives to traditional antibiotic therapies for animals. We were pleased that the German Federal Supreme Court granted our appeal in the Alimta patent case versus Actavis, vacating the prior decision denying infringement. This ruling supports our continuing belief that Alimta's vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by the entry of generic pemetrexed products, including alternative salt forms in Europe prior to June 2021. And the US Patent and Trademark Office granted petition seeking inter partes review, or IPR, of our Alimta vitamin regimen patent. We expect final IPR written decision in mid 2017. Finally, we did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. During the quarter however, we did distribute over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. We remain committed to providing a robust dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil? Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, John. Slide eight summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. Now let's look at our results for the second quarter. Slide nine provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments today on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year on year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. Moving to non-GAAP measures on slide 10, you can see the Q2 2016 revenue increased 9% compared to Q2 2015, reaching $5.4 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 3.2 percentage points to 76%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this quarter was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 50 basis points, going from 76.2% in last year's quarter to 75.7% this quarter, driven primarily by product mix. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 7% compared to Q2 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 1% while R&D increased 14%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products, largely offset by lower spending on late lifecycle products and lower litigation expenses. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, including the $100 million milestone payment to AstraZeneca triggered by the transition to Phase III testing for the oral-based inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, AZD3293. This milestone payment added 8.5 percentage points to R&D expense growth and over 3.5 percentage points to total operating expense growth. Excluding this milestone payment, total OpEx increased just over 3%, which was substantially less than revenue growth. Other income and expense was income of $21 million this quarter, slightly less than the $29 million reported in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 22.4%, an increase of 160 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to a net discrete tax benefit in last year's quarter of approximately $24 million, which lowered that quarter's tax rate by about 2 percentage points. In addition, this year's tax rate benefited from certain US tax provisions including the R&D tax credit that are in force in 2016, but had lapsed during last year's quarter. This was largely offset by the tax impact of an increased percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions this year compared to last year. At the bottom line, net income increased, I'm sorry, decreased 5%, and earnings per share decreased 4%. While Derica will cover the effect of FX on our income statement in a subsequent slide, I would highlight that when excluding the effect of FX, non-GAAP EPS actually increased 4% this quarter. Slide 11 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first half of the year, while slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 25 and 26. Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On slide 13 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 9% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. For the first quarter in quite a while, FX was not a headwind as a stronger yen offset weaker emerging markets currencies. As it did in Q1, on a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven entirely by volume. By geography, you'll notice that US pharma revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity and Humalog were the main drivers of US volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Cialis, Taltz, Jardiance, Humulin and Trajenta. Having completed the take-back of North American rights for Erbitux on October 1 of last year, we also benefited from booking end sales of Erbitux. The decline in EuCan revenue of 1% was driven by the negative effect of price, which was nearly offset by the positive effect of volume and to a much lesser extent FX. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 2%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower price and volume for Cymbalta following patent expiration, partially offset by the uptake of new products including Trulicity, Cyramza, Basaglar and Jardiance, and higher sales of Humalog, Trajenta and Cialis. Excluding Cymbalta, EuCan sales increased 7% in constant currency terms. In Japan, pharma revenue increased 21% in total, driven by mid teens volume growth and an 11% benefit from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 10%. This performance growth was attributable to a number of products, led by Cyramza, but also including Cymbalta, Strattera, Basaglar, Trulicity and Trajenta. Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 3% driven by the negative effect of FX which was partially offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 5% due to volume growth from a number of products, most notably Humalog and Trulicity, partially offset by continued sales erosion of off-patent brands including Alimta, Cialis, Zyprexa and Cymbalta. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China increased 15% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's growth rate did benefit from customer buying patterns in both last year's quarter and this quarter. We estimate that underlying demand for our products in China increased 5% in the second quarter. Turning to animal health, we completed the Novartis Animal Health acquisition on January 1 last year. So year on year revenue growth comparisons are now on an apples to apples basis. This quarter, Elanco Animal Health revenue increased 2%. Excluding the negative effect of FX, Elanco revenue increased 4%. This performance increase was primarily driven by the uptake of new products as well as by wholesaler buying patterns of US companion animal products. On slide 14, you'll find the same price, rate and volume analysis but on a year to date basis. As I mentioned a moment ago, excluding FX from our worldwide revenue, our growth would have been 8% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volume. Our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 15 shows that these products drove over 6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while the take-back of Erbitux contributed nearly 1 percentage point of volume growth. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista, while largely in the rear-view mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 1.7 percentage points on our volume growth. Finally, Alimta reduced our worldwide volume growth by nearly 1 percentage point this quarter. The major driver of the decline in worldwide Alimta volume was the US, where we've seen increasing competitive pressure from immuno-oncology agents, and to a lesser extent from targeted agents. Notably, Alimta volume across EuCan was relatively flat this quarter with the exception of the UK, where we have begun to see generic competition. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Phil. As I did last quarter, I'd like to start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session, both Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. As you can see on the graph on slide 16, our new products generated $428 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This now represents about 8% of our total worldwide revenue. And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 6 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan and Europe. And we look forward to continued growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications. Sales in the US declined slightly this quarter due to competition in non-small cell lung cancer, primarily from immuno-oncology agents. Sales outside of the US now account for over half of Cyramza's global sales, with Japan making up nearly a third. Trulicity continues to gain momentum globally. Here in the US, we're now capturing over 25% of new patient starts in a GLP-1 class while in many O-US markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with Victoza when it launched. Of note, in Germany, Trulicity is now the most prescribed GLP-1 brand for patients new to the class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the GLP-1 class, with the US market growing 30%. Another class that is showing rapid growth is the SGLT2 class, where we see US class growth in the 25% range. This is however below the class growth we'd expected to see. In the US, our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists continues to increase, exceeding 35% in the most recent IMS data, as shown in our supplementary slide 41. Outside the US, we've seen very strong uptake in Italy, with encouraging trends across all countries. In addition to the guideline update in Canada I mentioned last quarter, we've seen initial regulatory approvals of a CV indication for Jardiance in markets like Ecuador and Mexico, and we look forward to the FDA action later this year. We've now launched a Basaglar in a number of O-US countries. As I mentioned last quarter, in countries where local pricing authorizations have produced a copay advantage, share of market performance has been higher than our expectation. This includes markets like Japan, Poland and Slovakia. In countries like Germany and Spain, where there isn't a copay advantage, we're running on an annualized share of the total Basal insulin market of 3% to 5%. In aggregate, we are pleased with our performance. Here in the US, as John mentioned earlier, we recently gained FDA approval of an 80-unit KwikPen and look forward to launching Basaglar in mid December. It's still early days for Portrazza, with the US launch having occurred in December and the initial European launches in April. In the US, we are encouraged that the vast majority of US payers are now covering Portrazza, although we continue to see strong uptake of IO agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is affecting Portrazza's uptake. Finally, our newest product, Taltz, launched in the US in April and in Europe earlier this month. Early prescription data in the US is encouraging. Given the recent approval in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we also look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall. Moving to slide 17, you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 8%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 12% outpaced revenue growth, due primarily to the negative effect of product mix. Moving down the income statement, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating expenses grew slightly slower than revenue at 7%. Excluding the $100 million AZD3293 milestone payment, non-GAAP operating expenses grew much more slowly than revenue at just 3.5%. Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while a higher tax rate and slightly lower other income led to a 4% increase in non-GAAP EPS. Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 18 shows our pipeline as of July 19. Changes since our last earnings calls are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. In our NME pipeline, we started Phase I testing for four molecules, including a CHK1 inhibitor and a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody for cancer, a double incretin mimetic for diabetes and a tau antibody for Alzheimer's disease. I would note that increasingly, even in areas outside of oncology, we are testing our molecules in patients in Phase I, in addition to healthy volunteers. You will also see that we terminated development of two Phase II molecules in non-core areas. In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on slide 19, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the once daily version of Jentadueto as well as our first global approval for ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis which occurred in Japan, and we began Phase III testing for ixekizumab in AxSpA. You will also see that we're showing baricitinib for diabetic nephropathy and for psoriasis as attrition as we decided not to pursue these indications at this time. We will invest in additional indications for baricitinib and have trials ongoing in atopic dermatitis and lupus and you shouldn't be surprised to see more in the future. Turning to slide 20, let's recap the progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for the initiation of Phase III for ixekizumab in AxSpA; the internal data readout and subsequent presentation at ASCO of detailed results from the Phase II MONARCH 1 trial of abemaciclib as a single agent treatment for advanced breast cancer; the presentation at ACR of data from the RA-BEYOND study of baricitinib in RA; the presentation at ADA of the MARLINA study of linagliptin; the approval of Taltz in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the US approval of once daily Jentadueto XR; and the favorable German Federal Supreme Court Alimta ruling. I'd also note that we now have a date, September 7, for the CAFC appeal hearing in our US Alimta patent litigation. Given this timing, we could have a CAFC ruling before the end of the year. You will also see that we moved the ixekizumab head to head psoriasis trial versus Stelara to the potential Phase III data external disclosures section, as we now hope to present data from this trial at a scientific meeting this year. Also, two events we thought might occur in 2016 are now projected in 2017, the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab, and the Phase III start for our ultra-rapid insulin. Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on slide 21, is as straightforward a picture as you could possibly have. All GAAP and non-GAAP guide line items, including EPS, remain unchanged from what we communicated on our Q1 earnings call in April. So in summary, 2016 is shaping up to be another strong year. Excluding FX, we drove revenue growth of 8% this quarter entirely driven by volume, with growing contributions from recently launched products, which this quarter drove 6 of the 8 percentage points of our volume growth. We reduced OpEx as a percent of revenue compared to Q2 last year, and we remain on track for our full year reduction of 200 to 250 basis points. The strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy continued, with Taltz being approved in Japan, olaratumab being granted priority review here in the US and the FDA AdCom vote for Jardiance. We also completed early stage deals in oncology to build out possible abemaciclib combinations, and in animal health to bolster our R&D efforts at finding alternatives to traditional antibiotics. As John mentioned when he kicked off the call, our management team is committed to making steady progress against each of our strategic objectives in the coming years. Our success to date gives us increasing confidence in our ability to make contributions to medical progress, to meet or exceed our minimum midterm financial expectations and to create value for shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil? Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Derica. And for the callers that are in the queue, as we have done on some of the past calls, it would be greatly appreciated if you could limit your questions to two or to a single two-part question so we can get to as many of the callers in the queue as possible. Christy, if you could now go ahead and give the instructions for the Q&A session and then go to the first caller please. Operator : Thank you. And we will go directly to the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael DiFiore - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, guys. This is Mike DiFiore in for Mark Schoenebaum. Congrats on the quarter and thanks so much for taking my call. Just two questions. Sola still remains, like solanezumab still remains top mind amongst investors. So I have a question regarding its MOA and plaque removal. Clearly sola was targeting of monomeric forms of A-beta along with its peripheral sink mechanism clearly differentiates it from BIIB's aducanumab, the theory being that sola can almost potentially act like a BACE inhibitor by preventing the accumulation of plaque versus simply clearing it from the brain. So my question is, if in the event that sola does not hit its functional end point in EXPEDITION-3, but does get FDA approval, can you comment on how it could compete with aducanumab and BACE inhibitors in the marketplace? And just a totally unrelated question after that, just if you could kindly comment on the disparity between cardiologists and endocrinologists voting ways in the Jardiance AdCom and what that could potentially mean for the label change and treatment guidelines? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Mike. Thanks for the question. So for the first one on solanezumab and if we're in this scenario where we're not hitting on functional but having cognition, how we might compete with other agents that might come through, if, Jan, you want to start off and give some of your comments, and Dave, feel free to complement. And then Enrique, if you can comment on the AdCom vote that was apparently split between cardiologists and endos and what that might mean for labeling in our view. Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology, and President, Lilly Research Laboratories : Yeah. And I guess your question targets also then the different mechanists we have across the industry today to influence then the amyloid component of Alzheimer's disease. And as you said, solanezumab then binds monomeric free amyloid-beta, which has the intention then to prevent further buildups of plaque but potentially also then have a peripheral sink effect. And in the EXPEDITION trials, there is now tau, or sorry, amyloid imaging in all patients, which means then we will also be able to follow actually if there is a change in the plaque deposits of amyloid in these patients after long-term solanezumab treatment. The other antibodies then, aducanumab, are directed more towards the plaque in Alzheimer's patients. And the difference here could be both related potentially then to the clinical effect but also in particular safety, since aducanumab has shown changes then in MRI, suggesting brain edema as one of the components. And I think the early data on cognition, et cetera, for aducanumab clearly was a relatively small trial and needs be confirmed in the longer and larger trial. The BACE inhibitors prevent formation of amyloid then from the precursor protein APP, having better brain penetration but also potentially then a different safety profile which needs be established in larger and longer trials. So I think it's hard to speculate actually what's going to happen using these three agents. But I think what is clear is that it is very important to include only amyloid-positive patients. It's also very important to start very early in the disease. It's also a key, in my view, to have global studies which involve some highly trained sites that can do these trials. Another aspect of the sola trial is also that we have Tau imaging in a proportion of patients. And as you know, tau is more related to the decline than on particularly the ADAS-Cog, and here we have another way potentially of showing then if there is disease modification. I think I'll leave to Dave to talk about the cognition and functional endpoints and the potential outcomes there. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Thanks, Jan. Yeah, I think it's early days in terms of understanding mechanisms in Alzheimer's. For sola, as we described in the past, we've moved our primary endpoint to be cognition and then key secondary endpoints, which will have control for Type I error, will be primarily the functional endpoints. I won't rehash why we did that, but I would just reinforce that our base planning scenario is that we achieve both significance on cognition and function, reminding everyone that the pooled mild data, which we're trying to replicate and we've made improvements in the study in seeking to replicate, has statistical significance on both function and cognition in that pooled mild subset. So should we miss on that, look, I think we'll have to talk about that when we get there. Clinicians in my experience are interested in outcomes and they're interested in safety. And so Jan has covered the safety topic. We know solanezumab is extremely well tolerated by patients. In fact, I can share that now that we have a majority of patients in EXPEDITION 3 rolling off into the open label study, we're seeing a very similar effect from EXPEDITION 1 and 2 in that 95% of patients are electing to continue on therapy or in a blinded way switch to therapy from their placebo. I think that's a very high number for what is a fragile and elderly population, reinforcing the tolerability of the medication. We'll have to wait until December to see the results and fully answer your question. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Sure. So on the Jardiance AdCom, we had a positive 12 to 11 vote that we had substantial evidence to reduce the incidents of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. If I recall the vote, the five practicing cardiologists voted in favor. And they were, excluding pediatric endocrinology, there were five endocrinologists in the panel and they voted three against and two in favor. I think it's difficult to try to assign a particular view of whether it's cardiologists or endocrinologist based on the vote of 10 people. What I would say is we were very pleased with the overall discussion. We thought it was robust and we believe that the right discussion happened. And for that reason we feel optimistic that we have a really good chance of getting an indication come late Q3, early Q4. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Christy, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks for the questions. So just a couple of quick ones here. So can you guys update us on what's assumed for sola and the Jardiance indication in the minimum top line guidance? The second question, and this is a little bit a couple of sort of sub parts here so I apologize. But can you just remind us again the assumed timing for the interim look for abemaciclib in the MONARCH 2 study? Can you tell us whether this will be at 50%, 60% or 70% to 75% of events? And then lastly, on the same abemaciclib topic, just when we compare across the MONARCH 2 study and the PALOMA-3 study for Pfizer's palbociclib, can you just help us understand what might be the differences between those studies that would have the control arm performed differently? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Seamus, thank you for the questions. Derica, if you'll take the first question that was posed on what's included in the revenue guidance with relation to solanezumab and Jardiance. And then, Sue, if you can comment on Seamus' questions for abemaciclib specific on MONARCH 2. Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Good morning, Seamus. In regards to the minimum financial or revenue guidance that we put out there, let me state this again. We expect that we can achieve at least 5% revenue growth on average between now and the end of the decade. And of course, as we looked at that, we considered a number of different scenarios including the downside of if we were unsuccessful with solanezumab. And clearly if we are successful and we also see scenarios where we could be higher than the 5%. So we feel very good about our ability to at least achieve the 5% through the end of the decade. What it does not include, as we noted in our upfront remarks, is that any significant pricing action in the US in terms of legislative impact such as rebates and Medicare Part D. It also includes that we will maintain our IP for Alimta in the US. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Derica. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah. Okay. So with regards to abemaciclib, we should be getting the interim data on MONARCH 2 soon. And as we have said previously, our intent is to submit MONARCH 1 as early at the end of this quarter once we've seen the MONARCH 2 data. We do plan to issue a press release once the interim has happened. As a reminder on that, we have a high bar. The data we're looking at will be PFS, and the data monitoring committee, the independent data monitoring committee will look at that data and then advise us accordingly. And we have not given data with regards to the cutoff, and so we will not do that. And then with regards to the differences, there are some differences in populations with regards to having prior chemotherapy and also first line and second line patients. So I think it's fair to say that we'll have to wait and see what the control arm looks like in the MONARCH 2 data. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Sue. Christy, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. We'll now go to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hi. John, how would you handicap the likelihood of Part D rebates between now and 2020? Then my follow-up is for Jeff. Perhaps you could talk about what a normalized run rate quarter would have been without the wholesaler buying patterns? And what did you have to impair that you acquired? Thanks. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Gregg, I think the likelihood of Part D, you said Part D rebates. But I guess the extreme would be the repeal of the noninterference clause. And then there's a lot of scenarios in between, for example, moving the LSI patients or the duals to more of a Medicaid type system. I think the likelihood is low, quite honestly. I think that Part D is a rare example of a government program that comes in exceeding expectations at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars less than had been forecast at the beginning. The Congressional Budget Office has several times stated that if price controls are placed into Part D, the only way the government would save money in that event is to restrict access to drugs on the formulary. Today most seniors have access through the private plans to the whole formulary, and that's why senior satisfaction rates are so high. That doesn't sound like something a politician would want to mess with. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, John. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Senior Vice President and President, Elanco Animal Health : Yeah, Gregg, on the animal health side, we had a major SAP cut-over in the US business. So that did move about $20 million of impact into Q2. So we see when we normalize it, Q2 revenues grew at 2% year over year. And if you look at year to date, we would normalize our 4% sales growth to 3%, 3% when you take out that. And then we've seen very strong as highlighted in the results, again we've seen very strong EBIT growth of 19% year to date as well. So again we're seeing the value and the integration of Novartis come through as we had talked about in the December Investor Day. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : And Gregg, this is Phil. I'll follow up after the call. I'm not aware of anything that we impaired in the quarter that we had acquired. We did have some charges in the quarter that were related to integration and severance costs for the Novartis Animal Health acquisition, but nothing else to my knowledge. So I'll follow up and see what, if there was something else I missed that you were referring to. Christy, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. A few questions. Just to clarity on the guidance on sola. Are you saying that if sola was a zero and completely failed, that your revenue guidance would remain intact? Just a clarification question on that. And then two other questions. On Portrazza, I think I heard you say that uptake has slowed because of PD-1 usage in first-line lung. I'd be surprised if that was happening because there's no published results. There's no compendia listing and that sort of thing. So did I hear that incorrectly? And then Jardiance, naturally your product will be the only one with cardiovascular outcome data in the label in 2016 and 2017. Do you think that will lead to significant formulary coverage shifts in favor of your product in 2017? Or could that be viewed as a class effect by payers and P&T committees, and you could find incumbent products, like Invokana actually keeping a good portion of their formulary positioning? Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Hey, Tim. Thanks for the question. So, Derica, if you will handle the first question related to the revenue guidance; Sue, on what we're seeing in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer for IO uptake, and then, Enrique, to you for the Jardiance question. Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Tim, good morning. The short answer to your question is, yes. Even in a scenario where sola is a zero, we still believe we can keep a minimum of 5% average revenue growth between now and the end of the decade. Now recall, we've always been saying that when we looked at our future growth prospects for Lilly, we were never reliant on a single asset. The real thesis behind Lilly is that we've been building this broad portfolio. And the fact that we had the opportunity to launch multiple new molecules, we believe 20 in 10 years, is what gives us confidence that we've got the substrate to support that revenue guidance that we put out there. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, Tim, you did hear correctly. There is no data yet in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And yet, we are seeing quite significant use with over 20% share of market in the first-line setting of PD-1 inhibitors, mainly Opdivo. That's impacting most products in that marketplace, including the uptake on Portrazza. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Sure. There is no question that a new label with an indication for a reduction on the CV, or the incidence of cardiovascular death will be very significant from a payer perspective. Now in this particular case, we already have excellent coverage and access. We are at 85% plus when it comes to commercial and above 70% in Part D. So our access is very good, and it can only get stronger once we get the label. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Enrique. Christy, next caller please? Operator : Next we have John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line's open. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. On your slide 20, you indicated that you still have solanezumab, the prodromal Alzheimer's trial on track for rollout. Can you help us understand how you're thinking through the endpoints for that trial, how the FDA draft guidance potentially shapes that? And are you going to ask the FDA or have them review it under an SPA? And then second question on Jardiance. Obviously, you have one positive trial in EMPA-REG coming out favorable. Can you give some commentary on the design of your heart failure trials and how you think those trials might be able to capture data that could help with additional build-out of your label on Jardiance? And then lastly, just on galcanezumab, what actually contributed to the delay in migraine? Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : All right, John. Thank you for the questions. So Dave, if you want to comment on the solanezumab prodromal question, and I guess is galcanezumab also potentially faulty as far as what led to the delay. Do you want to comment on that? And then John, you can fill in. And then, Enrique, if you'll comment on the heart failure trial and how that might help to expand the labeled indications for Jardiance. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Okay. Yeah. So for the sola prodromal study, we're anticipating enrolling patients very soon. As we said in our December 8 investor conference on Alzheimer's, we fully expect to get that study up and running this year and sort of rolling into the EXPEDITION 3 rollout, have that underway. In terms of primary outcome, we've disclosed that, which is going to be cognition is the primary endpoint, with key secondary endpoints of function. Just like EXPEDITION 3. I think the general logic here is that the earlier you go in disease, the less meaningful functional changes are and frankly, the more difficult they are to detect. So moving from a mild-only study like EXPEDITION 3 to the prodromal, that's entirely logical. By the way, we've also made those changes in the BACE inhibitor programs in partnership with AZ. Your second question, just to be clear, John, we've not announced a delay in the galcanezumab migraine program but rather the cluster headache program. This was a kind of quasi-orphan speed play we announced in parallel with the migraine start. One of those studies, although enrolling well, requires episodic cluster episodes to begin before we place patients on medication. We had to predict the rate at which patients would have episodic cluster headaches. I think we estimated too high, so we're waiting for people to have those episodes before we can begin treatment, and that's slowing down that particular study, although the chronic cluster study is on track time-wise. So we'll have to make some decisions as we get closer to the end of the chronic cluster study about submission and labeling, et cetera. But the migraine study's on track time-wise, just to be clear. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Perfect. Thank you, Dave. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : John, we are not in a position right now to disclose the specific design for our heart failure trials. Just to remind everyone, we will be conducting two trials, one for reduced ejection fraction and one for preserved ejection fraction. We expect the first of those trials to start still this year and also to note that we are studying that in people with and people without diabetes. So clearly, we will be seeking an indication when it comes to heart failure with those trials. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Christy, next caller please? Operator : Thank you. We'll now move to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the questions. First one for maybe John or Derica. Can you just elaborate on some of your comments about increased pricing pressures in the US through 2020 that's reflected in the 5% minimum target? I guess how are you thinking about pricing dynamics for the next few years? Do you see the industry with less pricing power? Do you see more volume driving growth? Just any color there would be great. Second question is on 2017, just pricing and kind of coverage outlooks. Any major shifts in coverage we should be thinking about as we think out towards next year? And maybe specifically on diabetes, anything we should be keeping in mind there in terms of either coverage or pricing as you've been talking to payers about the 2017 season? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Chris. So Derica, if you want to take the first one. And then for the second one, Chris, I'd just say as a preamble, typically we comment on access much later in the year, closer to the new plan year and oftentimes need to wait to say anything until the payers themselves have announced these. But I will leave it open to any of the three, our therapeutic business unit presidents, if you want to give any general comments on what you might be seeing or expecting in trends. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Hi, Chris. When we talk about increased pricing pressure, if you look at the trends that we're seeing, one, we're seeing a decline or a decay in the net price benefit that we're receiving on kind of annual basis. And when we look to the environment going forward, we are also seeing an environment where we're seeing increased rebating or discounting going on. We've experienced that in our diabetes business, and we know that we're looking to going into some highly competitive spaces in terms of some of our new product launches. So our focus has been on driving volume-driven revenue growth, and that really gets to the clinical differentiated profile of our new products that we are in the midst of launching and that's where we've centered our attention. So that's really the thesis behind our comment as it relates to increased pricing pressures. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great thanks. Enrique? Dave? Sue? Any comments on access, or does that cover it? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : You said it well, Phil. I think it's premature right now to discuss that. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay. Great. Thanks. Christy, next caller please? Operator : Next we have David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, could you just explain why the MONARCH 1 filing is pending interim MONARCH 2 data? And then second, regarding the increased US price pressure that you expect later this decade than you're currently experiencing, Derica, could you just remind us how you report US pricing trends year over year with respect to factoring in drugs going generic? As I understand it, when a drug goes generic, even though Lilly doesn't reduce the list price of the drug, there's a negative impact on the calculation of net pricing that you report. And maybe you could tie in how the pending patent expirations of Cialis and Forteo will thus play into that greater price pressure this decade than you're currently experiencing. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. Sue, if you'd take the MONARCH 1 filing question, and then Derica, the pricing question. Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, Dave, with regards to the MONARCH 1 data, as a reminder, this is a single arm study looking at single agent abemaciclib. Given the close proximity of the MONARCH 2 interim, we announced after ASCO and on our last call that our plan would be that we would submit the MONARCH 2 data, sorry, submit the 1 data once we'd seen the interim of MONARCH 2. And we're anticipating seeing that soon, and therefore we'd be submitting MONARCH 1 as early as this quarter. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Dave. In regards to just more color on the pricing pressure and our thinking going forward, just recall if we look at our LOE products or our brands that are going off patent, we have a distinction between our original brand versus the branded generics that we have historically potentially launched into the market such as we did with Zyprexa. When you looked at our PRV slide that's captured in our call materials, that is the true realized pricing effect that we're seeing rolling across our business. So you should expect on a go-forward basis that it will still be on that same apples to apples. When you then think about the future patent expirations of Cialis and Strattera and brands like that, you will see it also parceled in the same manner. So when we again look at our business, and I think that's pretty much reflected in the results you saw here in the second quarter, even in the midst of launching, we're focused on driving a volume-driven growth profile. And the fact that we could achieve 8% volume growth this quarter and really relatively no price benefit really speaks to our commentary around increased pricing pressures going forward. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : One thing real quick, Dave. As you think about this, it is true that a number of years ago when we would have had, for example, an authorized generic, and we would have shipped out a very large amount of product in a given quarter, we would have only recognized the relatively modest sales price for that product that was shipped, not the potential share that we would have gotten in the revenues once the product was sold. That led to significant negative price impact at the time we would ship that product and we'd actually recognize the revenue later. With no units against it, it would lead to a very large price increase. It really had nothing do with price increases. What Derica's mentioned is, for a while now we've been treating our brand and an authorized generic as totally separate products, so you no longer have those aberrations in your net price calculation. And it will be a true underlying price change as Derica just mentioned. Hopefully that helps give you some context for what you might have seen in the past and what you have seen recently and will see going forward. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : You're welcome. Christy, next caller please. Operator : Next we'll go to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and for the commentary on the long-term guidance. So just a couple questions if I could. One just to follow up. I'm sorry if I missed this on the last question that Dave asked. But just, I still don't fully get why the interim for MONARCH 2 impacts the mission. You may have mentioned it before. But I'm sorry if I missed it just when you were commenting to Dave's question. But can you explain why it's exactly tied to that? Why wouldn't you just submit when you're ready to submit? And then if the FDA ever wanted to see that data during the review process, they could obviously ask for it and see it then. But my questions were actually, one was just on Jardiance. You mentioned that the year over year growth for that class is a little less than what you had expected. Can you just comment on that in terms of why you think that is? Is it some of these safety concerns we're seeing kind of across the class, or anything else that's maybe keeping that growth a little bit below where you were expecting? And then my second one was just on Taltz. I know it's still relatively early days, but if you could just give a little more color on the feedback you're getting from physicians on that product specifically relative to Cosentyx, and then on the data we should expect later this year versus secukinumab? I assume the goal of that study is to show superiority. Can you just confirm that that is the case? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Vamil. Thanks for the questions. I'm going to flip it up on our group here. I'm going to go in reverse order. So Dave, if you'd like to go ahead and handle, and with your team if you want to involve who we've got in the room here, feedback we're hearing on the launch versus Cosentyx and the head to head for Stelara later this year. Enrique, if you'll comment on the year on year growth for the overall (63:59) class and whether it'll be differing than our expectations. And then Sue, for the timing of submission relative to the MONARCH 2 interims. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Yeah, thanks, Vamil. I'll take the first part of this on Taltz and Alex Azar, my colleague who runs the US will answer the second part on what he's seeing in the early uptake. The head to head against Stelara which will read out by the end of the year is fully powered for superiority on all the standard psoriasis metrics. And this is an important study in particular for O-US access. Alex, you want to comment on what you're hearing from physicians? Alex M. Azar II - President, Lilly USA LLC, Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. You bet. Thanks, Dave. As you mentioned, it's still very early, especially with a specialty biologic like this in terms of the data flows and information that we would get. But thus far, we're very pleased with the initial performance of Taltz. If you look, for instance, at the IMF's New to Brand NPA, just dermatology specialty focused data, we're bouncing around right at the Enbrel, New to Brand level. We're closing in very closely on the Cosentyx New to Brand among derms there. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $19 million. A portion of that was wholesale stocking in there. But as I mentioned, with a specialty product going through specialty pharmacy channels, it'll take a while before we get really complete data there. So I just want to caution that we can look at IMS a bit, but really it's going to be when we see the actual script-level data coming through the specialty pharmacy data flows that we'll have much more clarity. The feedback from physicians has been very positive. We're just hearing wonderful things anecdotally about their experiences with it with their patients, in terms of their interactions with us. We think Taltz has a very attractive value proposition to our patients, to our physicians, to our payers. Including our Taltz savings card, which I think is a really important thing for folks to know about is, with this Taltz savings card that we've got out there, the patients will pay as little as $5 a month if they're commercially insured and covered by their insurance. If they're commercially insured and are not covered by their insurance and have filed a script, have that denied and filed an appeal and had it denied, they will pay no more than $25 a month. This really removes a prescribing burden and hurdle for the physician, for the patient and the doctor's office in getting people initiated on the medicine. So right now everything seems to be positive from the experience but in a wait and see mode. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks a lot. Dave, any comment on the head-to-head versus (66:26). David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: I did. I covered that already. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : I'm sorry. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Very good. So we've had over the last year or so a number of strength in warnings or new warnings when it comes to products in the issued P2 class starting with the DKA which was a warning that was added across the class. And then we've more recently have had two strengthened warnings that have not covered Jardiance. These covered other products, not Jardiance. One, when it comes to bone fractures specific to canagliflozin and then a strengthened warning on acute kidney injury that covers both dapa and canagliflozin. All of these warnings or strengthened warnings come. We saw that counterbalance where today we cannot, we're unable to promote our CV data until we basically get our label updated. So we continue to feel the benefit risk profile of the class is very strong, but that of Jardiance in particular given that our data basically speaks for itself when it comes to some of these safety assessments. And then also the benefit when it comes to CV. When we look at the class in general, the class is growing year-to-date over 30% and one can say that seems like a very good growth. But when we look a little more closely at the new patient starts and the growth of that, we basically see that completely flattening. And for that reason, we are a bit concerned and we are hopeful and optimistic that once we get both the new indication and new treatment guideline, that we will see a significant inflection. Jardiance needs to be the catalyst for the overgrowth of the class. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Enrique. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah. With regards to the MONARCH 1 submission, there really isn't that much more to say. We've made the decision that given the proximity of the MONARCH 2 interim, we'll wait for the MONARCH 2 interim. We believe that this is the fastest way of getting this medicine to patients. And also given the breakthrough therapy designation that we've got on MONARCH 1, obviously we will continue to have discussions with the FDA. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Sue. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Christy, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : We'll now move to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have a couple questions. The long-term guidance is very reassuring, but I'm wondering why it was given at this time. What perspective does Lilly have now that it didn't have at for instance your Analyst Meeting in May? Is it product related, is it industry related or is it something else? And then secondly for Jan in Alzheimer's, preclinical data suggests PD-L1 blocking could have a benefit in Alzheimer's disease. Does Lilly have any plans to explore this area? And what dose of solanezumab is being used in the prodromal trial? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Steve, thank you for the questions. We'll have Derica take the first and if, Jan, if you'll take the second question or set of questions on Alzheimer's disease. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Steve. Really, our discussion on our longer-term guidance today is really just kind of the natural next step in progression or discussions that we've been having with the investment community. Recall that back in December, we began to do a more in-depth look at our R&D prospects. We started with a deep dive on our Alzheimer's platforms as well as our animal health business. We were able to then follow that up in May with a deep dive discussion on the other four therapeutic, human pharma four therapeutic areas. And based upon the substrate we talked about, and we shared there about the potential of 20 launches in 10 years as well as combined with our market guidance, is really what's supporting our extended discussion here today about those other items that could be affected, positively in this case, by the data points we've shared in our previous discussion. So for us it's really just a continuation of the dialogue that we've been having. And again, as we see more in our business prospects, we will share more with you going forward as well. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Steve, this is Phil. Just real quick before turning over to Jan. I think we've discussed in the past having some of these days that are not the soup to nuts Lilly commercial update, R&D update, financial update is really intended to ensure that we can spend quality time talking with investors and potential investors as well as the analyst community about specific parts of our business. And we do think we achieved that both in December and in May by having that really focused on those topics and not having a particular discussion about financials at that point in time. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology, and President, Lilly Research Laboratories : Yeah, well the whole area of immunology and the importance for Alzheimer's disease is one of our recent interests in research. And I mean just to remind you, we already have a molecule in the clinic that actually most likely reduces plaques at least, and in animal models via microglia activation, the N3pG molecule, where actually we will report some data tomorrow in Toronto from the initial early studies in the clinic. We're also have an interest in other mediators then of immune activation, and I think you will see us test new then immune activating agents in various animal models initially. David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: 400 milligrams once a month. Same dose in prodromal as in the mild Alzheimer's study. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Dave. Christy, next caller please? Operator : Thank you. We'll now move to Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. Two questions please. First, could you outline your marketing plans for Jardiance assuming you get approval with the cardiovascular indication added? Expressly, are you building out your cardiovascular sales force or bolstering your primary care sales force for the product? And then second, could you remind us of the prophylactic use of loperamide? Was that included within the trial protocol for the individual abemaciclib program? And are you including it for any future ongoing trials given the GI diarrhea adverse event which has been characterized by the trials to date? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Andrew. So Enrique, we'll go to you for the first question on what we're doing with regard to cardiovascular and primary care sales reps to support Jardiance going forward, and then Sue on the use of loperamide. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Clearly we view this as a very significant opportunity, so we're going to be fully resourced. And that basically means making all of the proper investments when it comes to ensuring that we have the right reach for both primary care, cardiologists, endocrinologists. So yes, we have a very robust plan together with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Enrique. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, with regards to the diarrhea, no. We didn't have a prophylaxis loperamide in our studies. We have one study, our neoMONARCH, which is our neoadjuvant study that we have looked at that. We should have a report out of that this year. But in our MONARCH 1, 2 and 3 studies, we did not require prophylaxis, and as a reminder in our MONARCH 1, the diarrhea was manageable with over-the-counter loperamide as needed and only one patient discontinued due to diarrhea. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Sue. Christy, next caller please? Operator : We'll now go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Enrique, just a question for you, again back on Jardiance. Would you be satisfied if the CV data were included in the label but without the CV indication per se? And can you describe the guidelines process and the importance of updated guidelines and specifically what you need to see in order to see that obviously important inflection point with Jardiance? And then secondly, Sue, for you, when do you plan to file on MONARCH 2? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Jami. Thanks for the questions. So first to Enrique and then Sue. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Sure, so on the CV indication, first, we do feel optimistic. Now you asked me I would be satisfied. I will be honest. No. I would not be satisfied. We will make it work, but my view is that we basically have the appropriate data to be able to obtain a new indication when it comes to the reduction in the incidence of CV deaths on that specific population. I don't recall the second part of the question. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: The second part related to guidelines. Guidelines. And the importance of guidelines. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : They are also very important. But clearly the way we view it is, in particular in the US, we view the FDA action date coming before basically new treatment guidelines. We could have new treatment guidelines in the US sometime early next year. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks. Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, Jami, with regard to MONARCH 2, clearly it would depend on the data and if the interim data is positive, we would plan to discuss that with regulatory authorities and plan to submit it as soon as we could. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Sue. Christy, next caller please. Operator : Next we have Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. Just one brief product related or pipeline related question. I wanted to go back to CGRP, and less in cluster headache, but perhaps in overall migraine, as REGAIN and the EVOLVE studies are underway, there are other programs from other competitors which are moving forward as well. And I was just curious, Dave or Jan, if you could just provide some clarity on the advantages that Lilly's program or antibody may have versus those of other programs, and whether you think you could be first to market. Or if you're second to market, what in fact might be the attributes that your product may have over that which is first to market? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Tony. Dave? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Sure, yeah. Thanks, Tony. Well, we're excited about the galcanezumab program, which is the new name for a CGRP antibody. Putting aside the cluster, which again is a possibility to get to market earlier, although we have as was mentioned earlier, a slowdown in the episodic cluster study. As it relates to migraine, we remain excited about the profile. It is very competitive, as you mentioned. There's at least three players kind of neck and neck from our read. Execution and enrollment and getting the studies complete is important. You'll see on clintrials.gov, we've actually closed the submission gating study, the critical path study which was the long-term safety study already. So that puts us on a good path to remain on track. Ultimately, I think the product profile will need to achieve the maximum effect possible via this mechanism, with the minimally intrusive administration for patients. This will be a product used by healthy people in primary care offices, in everyday neurologists. Simple injection and dosing protocols coupled with very strong effect will win. That sounds kind of boilerplate. But I think we're testing a couple different dosing setups. Others are testing different ones. We'll just have to see who can produce the best numbers with the minimum doses. And I think that's what we'll be looking for as we read out the data sometime late next year. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Dave. Jan M. Lundberg - Executive Vice President, Science and Technology, and President, Lilly Research Laboratories : Yeah, a small addition here is that the Amgen antibodies are against the CGRP receptor, whilst the other antibodies bind the free CGRP peptide. And also the older antibodies, intravenous, the Teva and Lilly and Amgen are subcutaneous injection. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Jan. Christy, if can we go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. First for John and Derica, a follow-up regarding your long-term guidance. It is obviously reassuring but not really surprising, given that you're coming from a lower base following patent expirations and launching a number of new products. So would you be willing to provide more color regarding the different scenarios that you mentioned earlier? And the follow-up, can you comment on the approximate magnitude of dividend increases that you're committing to, and is there a specific payout ratio target that you have? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Alex, thank you for the questions. John, if you want to go ahead and take the first question and Derica the second. John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think, Alex, the long-term guidance contemplates obviously a number of scenarios. We have products like baricitinib that are under regulatory review, abemaciclib, which is headed that way, products that's still in the pipeline, the sola readout later this year. So there's still some, I guess, some big unknowns up ahead, coupled with the sure patent losses that we're going to experience with products like Cialis and Strattera, for example. So while there's still a lot of moving parts, I think similar to sort of the guidance we provided back in late 2009, we were entering this patent expiration period. We wanted to provide some floor, some minimum set of expectations for investors, recognizing that there are scenarios that could take that above that floor. Now, we did call out the fact that this does not contemplate major changes in government reimbursement policy. It does contemplate Alimta continuing to be patent protected in the US through the early 2020s. So with those caveats, I think that we feel very comfortable providing that as a framework for investors thinking about Lilly in the next five years with all these potential scenarios, a number of which could provide upside above this number and then coupled with the guidance we've given about not only our operating, our OpEx to sales, but this morning reaffirming our belief that we could also improve our gross margin as a percentage of sales over this period as well. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, John. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Alex, in regard to the magnitude of dividend increases, we're not prepared to provide any commentary on that here today. We've increased our dividend over the last two years. One could think, well, why the commentary if we're already kind of on that glide path. Well, while we've done that, we've never committed to going forward each year that we would increase our dividend. So we wanted to be more clear about that today and to set that expectation. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Yeah, I think it's probably safe to assume that you will see over time some decrease in the payout ratios since we had that spike at pretty high levels. We went through the patent expiration period. But as Derica mentioned, we can't be more specific than we'll have a slightly lower dividend increase, probably the net income increase to bring that down somewhat. Stay tuned for more as we go forward. We can go to the next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Bristow with BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just a few quick ones. So on Jardiance, the 2Q sales looked a little light versus what was implied from scripts. If you could give any more color around the impact of discounting, rebating and inventory buildup, be helpful. And second on the Trulicity REWIND trial, can you remind us if it is just a futility look or is there potential for early stoppage? And if the latter, how should we be thinking about this, given the outcome of Novo's LEADER study, and the fact that I believe you're approaching a similar duration of treatment? And then just finally on solanezumab, can you just confirm we should still expect a top line update before year end? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. We'll go to Enrique for the Jardiance and Trulicity questions and then to Dave for the solanezumab confirmation. Enrique A. Conterno - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Diabetes : Yeah. So on Jardiance, you are right. If you look at the scripts and sequential script growth, it will have implied higher revenues. There are two things that are weighing down on Jardiance. One of them, we've had some gross to net adjustments during the periods that were from prior periods, and second we also saw much higher utilization on our copay cards. We recently have changed the design of our copay card so it's less generous than it used to be. But that takes a little bit of time to basically wash out. So we should expect an improving picture when it comes to that. In terms of Trulicity, we do have an interim later this year. Clearly we've all seen the LEADER data. Probably the best way to think about the interim for Trulicity, but if we were to expect a similar, were to observe a similar hazard ratio versus what LEADER showed, we would not stop the trial. So given that we're going to have a significantly less number of events than basically Novo had at the conclusion of their own trial, now we are confident on the profile of the product and now we just really need to wait for the interim. But we'll either stop or we will \u2013 if we stop we will know; if we continue to with the trial clearly we will have to wait. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Enrique. Dave? David A. Ricks - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Bio-Medicines: Yeah, so on sola, we continue to expect top line as we announced I think in the Q1 call, we've completed enrollment on time and we're just waiting for the last patient visit. There are some variability around that but it's measured in weeks. So we expect to have a top line by end of year. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you. I know we have a number of callers still left in the queue. We're going to try and shoehorn in one more and then I apologize to those who won't have had a chance to ask a question. We will definitely call you back when we get back to our desks. So, Christy, if we can go to the last caller before we have John wrap up the call. Operator : Thank you. And due to time constraints our last question will come from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, morning. First on the gross margin comments, can you give us a sense of the push and pulls over the course of the decade where some of the products that have higher gross margin that'll be bringing it up and what'll be bringing it down? And then on abema, can you talk about what are you waiting for before starting the early breast cancer studies? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, Marc. Thank you for the questions. So Derica, if you'll handle the gross margin question, and to Sue for the early stage plans for abema. Derica W. Rice - Executive Vice President, Global Services & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Marc. In regards to gross margins, clearly when we endured the impact of the loss of many of our biggest products, but at the same time they were also small molecule. So at the gross margin line they were very highly profitable. These are products like Cymbalta, Zyprexa and Evista. Then as those products expired, those revenues were replaced with insulins becoming our biggest brands in franchise in Lilly at the moment, which obviously is coming with a lower gross margin or lower profitability. And that's where you've seen the decline in our gross margin rate over the this YZ period. Going forward, it's really going be dependent on the nature of the molecules and which ones are launching at what time. So if you look at products like Jardiance, we booked our portion of the income so it actually has a boost to our gross margin as a percent relative to our base. Likewise, when you look at the opposite, you've got baricitinib which we own, but we have a pretty high royalty rate that we also pay in the high 20s. So the mix effect is really what's going to drive or have a significant impact on what that gross margin profile looks like over time. However in aggregate, when we look at all the pushes and pulls, we still feel very confident that in total our gross margin will improve between now and the end of the decade. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Derica. Sue? Susan Mahony - Senior Vice President and President, Lilly Oncology : Yeah, with regards to the early phase breast cancer plans, as a reminder, we do have the neoMONARCH study ongoing which we plan to read out yet this year. And other plans will be informed by the data coming out. Philip Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Sue. John, can you close the call please? John C. Lechleiter - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, Phil. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. We continue to be pleased with the success we've had implementing our innovation-based strategy, and we're excited by the potential we have to make life better for people around the world and to provide substantial returns to our shareholders. Hopefully, the additional clarity we provided on our midterm financial expectations is helpful as you consider our future prospects. As always, we look forward to keeping you appraised of our progress. Also, this is the last earnings call for Ilissa Rassner, and I'd like to thank her personally for her considerable contribution to our IR efforts over the past four and a half years, and to wish Ilissa luck in her new role here at Lilly. Finally, if you have questions we weren't able to address during today's call, please contact our IR team. They'll be happy to help. Have a great day. Thanks everybody.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dr. John Lechleiter. Please go ahead, sir. John C. Lechleiter - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's third quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm John Lechleiter, Lilly's Chairman, President and CEO. Joining me here in Indianapolis on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Biomedicines; Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and Kristina Wright, Brad Robling, Chris Ogden, and Phil Johnson of Lilly's IR team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start, as usual, with a summary of our progress since the second quarter earnings call in late July and I'll use our strategic objectives framework for this discussion. Our first strategic objective, grow revenue. Q3 revenue increased 4% on a constant currency or performance basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. Consistent with previous quarters, this year our new products, Trulicity, CYRAMZA, Jardiance, Basaglar, PORTRAZZA, and Taltz accounted for nearly all of that growth. On our strategic objective, expand margins, our non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue declined 20 basis points compared to the third quarter 2015. We expect continued progress in the fourth quarter, as our full-year guidance at the midpoint of our ranges implies an improvement of about 200 basis points to 250 basis points in OpEx as a percent of revenue for the year. Under the heading of sustaining a flow of innovation, olaratumab was approved in the U.S. last week for soft tissue sarcoma and will be sold under the trade name Lartruvo. Europe's CHMP provided positive opinions, recommending approval of olaratumab for soft tissue sarcoma and of GLXAMBI for type 2 diabetes. And along with AstraZeneca, we received Fast Track designation from the U.S. FDA for AZD3293, the oral BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease. On our strategic objective deploy capital to create value, we announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim U.S. Animal Health vaccines business, filling a key strategic need in our companion animal portfolio. In both human pharma and animal health, we will continue to actively pursue external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. Finally, during the quarter, we returned over $500 million to shareholders through our dividend. In summary, the progress we're making in 2016 places us on track to achieve each of our strategic objectives through 2020. Now, let's move on to a review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front. As I just mentioned, here in the U.S., the FDA-approved Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with soft tissue sarcoma with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radio therapy or surgery. This is the first FDA-approved front-line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma in four decades. It also marks the third product from our ImClone acquisition to receive regulatory approval. This is an accelerated approval based on data from our Phase II trial. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The Phase III announced study is fully enrolled and is currently expected to complete in late 2018. In Europe, we received a pair of recommendations for approval from the CHMP. The first recommendation was for granting a conditional marketing authorization for Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with radio therapy or surgery and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin. Similar to the U.S., Lartruvo was reviewed under the EMA's Accelerated Assessment program. As part of the conditional marketing authorization, we will need to provide results from our ongoing Phase III study. Until availability of the full data, the CHMP will review the benefits and risks of Lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained. The second recommendation was for GLYXAMBI, a single tablet combining Jardiance, our SGLT-2 inhibitor, and TRADJENTA, a DPP-4 inhibitor. The specific recommendation was for use in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control when metformin and/or sulfonylurea and one of the individual components of GLYXAMBI do not provide adequate glycemic control or when a patient is already being treated with the free combination of Jardiance and TRADJENTA. GLYXAMBI, Jardiance and TRADJENTA are products of the Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly diabetes alliance. Finally, along with AstraZeneca, we received Fast Frack designation from the FDA for AZD3293, an oral Beta-secretase cleaving enzyme, or BACE inhibitor, being studied in Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease. On the clinical front, we announced that following a pre-planned interim analysis for MONARCH 2, an independent data monitoring committee provided the recommendation to continue the study without modification, as the interim efficacy criteria were not met. The MONARCH 2 trial compares abemaciclib with fulvestrant versus placebo with fulvestrant in women with hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial will continue to completion in the first half of 2017. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, early data in lung cancer were presented on the combinations of KEYTRUDA with ALIMTA and of KEYTRUDA with CYRAMZA. KEYNOTE-021, a randomized Phase II study, included Cohort G studying KEYTRUDA added to ALIMTA plus carboplatin versus in ALIMTA plus carboplatin in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The combination of KEYTRUDA and ALIMTA carbo nearly doubled the response rate compared to ALIMTA carbo alone. There's been considerable focus within the investment community on the durability of responses. In this study, we were very pleased that patients on the KEYTRUDA ALIMTA carbo arm experienced progression-free survival of 13 months. While the overall survival data were not yet mature, roughly 75% of patients on both arms were still alive at one year. This is at the top end of results we've seen for any combination trial in a broad population of first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients and we look forward to the presentation of additional data from this trial at future medical conferences. Updated data were also presented from the KEYNOTE-098 study evaluating KEYTRUDA with CYRAMZA in second- to fourth-line non-small cell lung cancer. Here, too, we observed promising clinical activity, including durable responses. 80% of patients experienced a decrease in target lesions, spanning the spectrum of PD-L1 status, while the objective response rate was 30% with responses seen in both non-squamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, the disease control rate was 85% and median progression-free survival was not yet reached. The data from both KEYNOTE-021-G and KEYNOTE-098 provide proof points for how we intend to deploy our diverse oncology portfolio across the three platforms of cell signaling, tumor micro environment and immuno-oncology to pursue a rational and differentiated combination strategy across our diverse oncology portfolio in order to improve outcomes for patients. Shifting to immunology, I'm pleased to report that we achieved the primary end point in the SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been treated with one or more conventional DMARDs as well as had an inadequate response to one or two TNF inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor. The results of SPIRIT-P2 further build on the existing benefit-risk profile Taltz obtained from a very large clinical program. With this second positive psoriatic arthritis study, we plan to submit ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. in the first half of next year followed by submissions in Europe and other geographies, and we plan to present the data at a medical meeting in 2017. Keep in mind that psoriatic arthritis has already been approved in Japan. At the EADV meeting in Vienna, we also presented initial data on our head-to-head study called IXORA-S of Taltz versus Stelara in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary endpoint of the study was met, as Taltz demonstrated superiority to Stelara on the PASI 90 score at 12 weeks. These data reinforced the strong clinical profile of Taltz and we look forward to presenting additional data from this study next year. As expected, earlier this month, we achieved last patient visit in the Expedition 3 trial of solanezumab in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we plan to issue a top-line press release before the end of the year. In other news, we announced the retirement of yours truly as President and Chief Executive Officer effective December 31 of this year. I will continue on Lilly's Board of Directors until the end of May, serving as non-Executive Chairman. Dave Ricks, currently President of Lilly Bio-Medicines will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and join the board on January 1. Dave will become Chairman of the Board on June 1. We announced an agreement to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio, as well as a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and a number of pipeline assets for approximately $885 million, including the estimated cost of acquired inventory. This innovative platform of companion animal vaccines has high brand awareness and an established loyal customer base. The addition of these assets advances our strategy of offering a balanced portfolio to both prevent and treat disease. This acquisition is subject to FTC approval and closing of the BI-Sanofi asset swap. We expect to close the deal early next year. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled against Lilly and its partner Acrux in a patent case for the testosterone treatment AXIRON, ruling that AXIRON's formulation and axilla application patents are invalid and the applicator patent, although valid, would not be infringed by generic competitors. We have appealed the ruling. The formulation patent expires in February 2017, while the axilla application and applicator patents expire in 2027. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the method of use patents for Effient are invalid. Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo, and Ube strongly disagree with the PTO's ruling regarding validity of the Effient method of use patent and have appealed the ruling. Separately, next steps are being discussed with the District Court in ongoing litigation on both the method of use patents and the compound patent. As a reminder, the method of use patents expire in 2023, while the compound patent expires in April of 2017 and we are entitled to pediatric exclusivity until October of 2017. Finally, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. During the quarter we did not repurchase any stock, leaving $2.65 billion remaining on our $5 billion plan. As we announced on our second quarter earnings call, we do expect to provide annual increases in our dividend and will continue to balance share repurchase with external opportunities to enhance our future growth prospects. And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Phil? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, John. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments this morning on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you can see the Q3 2016 revenue increased 5% compared to Q3 2015, reaching $5.2 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.4 percentage points to 76.4%. This decrease was driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. This effect resulted in a benefit to both this quarter and last year's quarter, but the benefit this year was substantially smaller than the benefit realized last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by 30 basis points, going from 75.2% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, increased by 4% compared to Q3 of 2015. Breaking this into its component parts, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D increased 8%. The slight increase in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was due to higher spending on new products largely offset by lower spending on late lifecycle products. The increase in R&D expense was driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs. Other income and expense was income of $27 million this quarter, compared to the $87 million reported in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 22%. This is a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D Tax Credit, that are in force in 2016 but had lapsed during last year's third quarter. At the bottom line, net income decreased 2% and earnings per share decreased 1%. Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for the first nine months of the year, while slide 11 contains a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 24 and 25. Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On slide 12 in the yellow highlighted row at the bottom of the table you'll see the 5% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. On a performance basis, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, driven entirely by volumes. By geography, you'll notice the U.S. pharma revenue increased 17%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog and Taltz. Having completed the takeback of North American rights for ERBITUX on October 1 last year, we also benefited from booking end sales of ERBITUX this quarter. As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we have experienced less product returns than anticipated for Cymbalta post its patent expiration, leading to a reduction in the returns reserve this quarter of approximately $145 million. Excluding this item, our U.S. pharma revenue grew 10% this quarter, with an 11% increase due to higher volume and a 1% decline due to lower realized prices. The decline in EUCAN revenue of 8% was driven by the negative effect of price and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes and unfavorable FX movements. On a constant currency or performance basis, EUCAN revenue decreased 6%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and ALIMTA following patent expirations, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Basaglar, CYRAMZA, and Jardiance, as well as higher sales of Humalog, TRADJENTA, and CIALIS. In Japan, pharma revenue increased 15% in total, driven by an 18% benefit from a stronger yen and, to a lesser extent, increased volume partially offset by a 6% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cuts. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 3%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q3 grew 6% on a constant currency basis, led by CYRAMZA, with additional contributions from Cymbalta, Strattera, Trulicity, Basaglar, and Jardiance. Turning to emerging markets, we saw revenue decline 8%, primarily driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue decreased 3% due to lower volumes for off-patent brands, including CIALIS, Zyprexa, ALIMTA, and Cymbalta, partially offset by higher volumes for Humulin, Trulicity, TRADJENTA, and CYRAMZA. Also this quarter, our pharma revenue in China decreased 7% due to foreign exchange while revenue was flat on a constant currency basis. Changes in order timing from our distributors negatively affected growth this quarter while positively affecting growth last quarter. We estimate the growth in underlying demand for our products in China this quarter was about 5%. Turning to Animal Health. This quarter, worldwide revenue decreased 9%, both in total and on a constant currency basis, including a 14% decline in companion animal and a 6% decline in food animal. Animal Health revenue was significantly impacted by distributor inventory destocking in the quarter following a changeover to SAP at the end of Q2. This inventory impact represented the majority of the decline in companion animal revenue in Q3 and has contributed to the volatility in our Animal Health results. In food animal, economic weakness in Latin America combined with market access pressures in the U.S. contributed to lower revenue in the quarter. Note that on a year-to-date basis, which includes the SAP inventory impact in both Q2 and Q3, Animal Health revenue is flat. On slide 13, you'll find the same price, rate and volume analysis, but on a year-to-date basis. As I mentioned earlier, excluding foreign exchange, our worldwide revenue grew 4% this quarter, with nearly all of that growth coming from higher volumes. In total, our new products, Trulicity, CYRAMZA, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, and PORTRAZZA were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. Slide 14 shows that these products drove 6.6 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The takeback of ERBITUX contributed nearly 2 percentage points to our volume growth, while Humalog contributed nearly 1 percentage point. You'll also see that the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta, and Evista, while largely in the rear-view mirror, still provided a drag of roughly 2 percentage points on our volume growth. Specifically on Humalog, you will see that U.S. sales this quarter are down 14%, as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices. This quarter's net realized price was negatively affected by changes in estimates for rebates and discounts. Normalizing for changes in estimates for rebates and December counts in both Q3 2016 and Q3 2015, the underlying U.S. sales trend for the quarter for Humalog was basically flat. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Phil. As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. During the Q&A session, Sue, Enrique and Dave can provide more details. As you can see on the graph on slide 15, our new products generated over $0.5 billion dollars in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and CYRAMZA. This represents about 10% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 8% last quarter. And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove over 6.5 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Trulicity. Here in the U.S., we're capturing nearly 30% of new patient starts in the GLP-1 class. In addition to our strong performance, we're benefiting from strong growth of the class itself, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%. As I mentioned last quarter, in many o-US markets, we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza. CYRAMZA continues to grow globally, driven largely by strong gastric cancer uptake in Japan. O-US markets now account for nearly 60% of our worldwide CYRAMZA sales and we look forward to continued growth in these markets, not only in gastric cancer, but also supported by the ongoing launches of the colorectal and lung cancer indications. U.S. CYRAMZA sales declined this quarter, largely as a result of competitive pressure from immuno-oncology therapies and non-small cell lung cancer, while our share of market in gastric cancer has been relatively stable. Moving to Jardiance. While less than we expected, the SGLT-2 class in the U.S. is growing over 20% and our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists is now over 35%. Along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we expect FDA action on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME submission in early December and continue to see an update of the Jardiance label to reflect the compelling CV data for EMPA-REG OUTCOME as a catalyst for the growing of the class and of Jardiance. Taltz, which launched in the U.S. in April, is off to an excellent start. We're seeing strong growth of the IL-17 class in psoriasis and are pleased that our new-to-brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, is already over 10%. While it's still early in our o-US launches, feedback has been positive and we look forward to launching Taltz in Japan this fall for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The rollout of ABASAGLAR in o-US countries continues and we are preparing for our U.S. launch in mid-December. Finally, we continue to see strong uptake of IO agents in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is clearly affecting use of PORTRAZZA. Moving to slide 16, you'll see the effective changes in foreign exchange rates on our 2016 results. This quarter, FX had a small positive impact on revenue growth. Excluding FX, worldwide revenue grew 4%. In performance terms, growth in non-GAAP cost of sales at 4% was in line with revenue growth, while non-GAAP operating expenses grew just slightly faster than revenue at 5%. Finally, excluding FX, non-GAAP operating income increased 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 1%. Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 17 shows our pipeline as of October 19. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows showing movement out of the portfolio. In our NME pipeline, you'll see the green arrow denoting FDA approval of Lartruvo in soft tissue sarcoma. We began Phase II testing of two molecules, the low-dose BACE inhibitor that we discussed at our Alzheimer's Disease meeting last December, and the BTK inhibitor in immunology we licensed with Hanmi. We also started Phase I testing for a small molecule cancer compound and we terminated development of two Phase I oncology assets and of blosozumab, a sclerostin monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis. In our NILEX pipeline, as shown on slide 18, we began a Phase III study of solanezumab in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Currently, we plan to recruit nearly 2,500 amyloid-positive patients for this study. The blinded treatment period will be 24 months, and we anticipate trial completion in mid-2021. On solanezumab, John mentioned earlier that we are on track to issue the top-line press release for EXPEDITION3 before the end of the year. I'd also note that we have a small number of investor interactions with management scheduled this quarter and all of these interactions will occur before management's sees the EXPEDITION3 study results. If we hit the most aggressive timeline for moving from last patient visit to database lock, we may be able to present the EXPEDITION3 data at the CTAD meeting in December. However, it is also quite possible that we will not present the data at a medical meeting until next year. Should we present the EXPEDITION3 data at CTAD, the presentation will be made available via a live webcast open to the investment community, so live participation will not be required to access the information in real time. Turning to slide 19. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we've added green check marks for the initiation of the Phase III study of solanezumab and prodromal Alzheimer's disease, the internal data readout that John mentioned earlier of the Phase III SPIRIT-P2 study of ixekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, the presentation at EADV of data from the IXORA-S study evaluating ixekizumab head-to-head against STELARA in psoriasis and the U.S. approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma. Also, one event we thought that might occur in 2016, which is now expected in 2017, action on Cialis pediatric exclusivity, while another is expected in 2018, the cluster headache readout for galcanezumab. Turning to our 2016 financial guidance on slide 20. At a high level, our expectations are largely unchanged. You'll see that our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is unchanged, while we've made small adjustments to our GAAP earnings per share guidance range, as well as to our line item guidance for revenue, SG&A expense, other income and capital expenditures. In summary, our Q3 financial performance places us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. In the quarter, we posted revenue growth of 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by 7% pharmaceutical volume growth. We made progress on the pipeline, with the FDA approval of Lartruvo, recommendations for approval of olaratumab and GLYXAMBI in Europe and granting of FDA Fast Track status for our BACE inhibitor, AZD3293. We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. And, as we transition to new leadership next year, our management team will remain focused on executing our strategy to create value for all stakeholders, including shareholders. We also remain firmly committed to achieving the mid-term financial goals we articulated on our earnings call in July, which included : driving a minimum of 5% compounded annual revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, even without solanezumab; reducing OPEX as a percent of revenue to 50% or less in 2018; increasing our gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2020 compared to 2015; launching 20 or more new products in the decade from 2014 through 2023 and providing annual dividend increases to our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Derica. So we've got nearly an hour for the Q&A session. We would like to get as many of the callers on the line as possible, so if you would please limit your questions to your two most important ones or one with two parts, that would be very much appreciated. Mary Beth, if you could go ahead and give the instructions for the Q&A session then go to our first caller, please. Operator : Certainly, sir. We'll go to our first question from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Wow. First time I've been asked first. Anyway, question. Couple questions on Jardiance. My first question is, why did the FDA require three more months for review? Is this a positive? Is this a negative? And, Enrique, how are you feeling about getting the superior label in Jardiance? And are what are the options? Is the option to get a superior label, i.e., an indication for CV risk reduction? Or is the other alternative to get no mention of that in the indication section but the EMPA-REG trial mentioned in the label somewhere? If you can talk about those two possible scenarios and what they mean in terms of consensus expectations. Secondly, just curious to know what's happening with pricing in diabetes because it does seem to be getting worse. You talked about rebates and discounts with Humalog, but it also seems that we're seeing some price discounting in SGLT-2 just based on INVOKANA's recent performance and their weakness due to discounting. So if you could talk about that as well. Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you for the questions, Jami. Enrique, those are all yours. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Very good. So when it comes to the Jardiance review by the FDA, we did get this three-month extension on the action date. The new action date is now December 4 of this year. It's difficult to say always what drives that, but the FDA considers some additional information analysis that we had provided, basically a major amendment, and they basically have the right to do so. I would highlight that this is not the only major amendment that has happened in the diabetes area. There have been a number of three-month extensions. But I don't think it will be appropriate to color this in any way, positive or negative. When it comes to the indication and the label, as you know, we have basically requested a separate, distinct indication for Jardiance, given the data from empiric outcome. Something along the lines of reducing the instance of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We believe that the data warrants this type of indication. Clearly, there are a number of different potential outcomes when it comes to the label that we would get. The FDA is reviewing the label. And it's probably not appropriate for me to comment more at this stage, given that the action date is getting very near. I will continue to highlight that I believe that we have the strength of the evidence to be able to have a new indication. Clearly, whether we have \u2013 in particular in the U.S., having an indication does make an important difference. So we are seeking that. Of course, if the clinical data is included in the body of the label, yes, we could still make a claim, but the strength of the claim is not the same. So we view this as important for us and for Jardiance and for Lilly and BI. Let me answer your question on pricing in diabetes. First, as it was stated as part of the remarks by Phil, when we normalize for changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts for both Q3 and Q4, we basically see, in the case of Humalog, that our normalized sales would have been minus 1% instead of minus 14%. Now, minus 1% still implies a pretty important impact. It implies lower prices because we grew volume 10% with Humalog in the U.S. So that's basically minus 11 when it comes to price. What are we seeing? Well, we are seeing two things. Increased rebates across the board. But in particular, when it comes to Part D, at least from how Lilly views this business, and we basically see a significant more business flowing through less profitable books of business, less profitable channels, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks. So as we look at those books of business, there's been an acceleration of those books of business at the expense of commercial and cash. So those impacts are pretty significant. Now, you have seen that, in the case of Humalog, we have quite a bit of volatility. We expect for this volatility, unfortunately, to continue, given that we make estimates at the end of each quarter on those rebates and discounts, but we find out where the product flows through, which books of business, afterward and, in some cases, many quarters afterward. So the last point that I would make, because it's probably important, as you look at your different models and as we think about the Humalog and what is the ongoing growth strength for this product, as we look at the normalization that I referred to, one-third of that normalization refers to Q3 of 2016. Two-thirds is really related to Q3 of 2015. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Enrique, thank you very much for the comprehensive response. Mary Beth, if we can go to next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. A couple of questions. On solanezumab, I know, obviously, everyone's expecting and watching the results of EXPEDITION3. But if that trial is a total fail, what happens to the prodromal trial? Would that completely continue unchanged? Or could it potentially get scrapped? The second question was on baricitinib. I know there's a fair amount of excitement around the upcoming launch and the profile has looked promising. But I can't help but think that it's going get meaningfully sidelined by payers in the U.S., given how crowded this market is. And if that happens, then it would be a very slow launch curve like we've seen with a lot of other products. I'm wondering if you can comment on this assessment. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Tim. Thank you for the questions. Dave, we'll move over to you for these two. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Tim. I think we've talked about the various scenarios with sola before. We continue to characterize it as a high-risk, high-reward program. The scenario you paint is what we think is the least probable, but it certainly could happen. In this scenario, sola would really not separate at all from placebo. I think we would be re-evaluating all of the sola programs, frankly, Tim. And the way we've set up the prodromal program, which we've just begun, is there's a recruitment start with a special cohort that we can also evaluate more information on. We're doing this for a couple reasons. But one of the reasons is the ability to stop the trial should EXPEDITION3 be negative. So we've gated the investment in that way. As I said, we're not counting on that as the most probable scenario, but we're prepared for that contingency. We're excited about baricitinib, too. The profile from the Phase III program, four very large studies, is extremely positive. That drug is under review at the FDA and we're anticipating a launch some time in 2017. You are identifying a key issue in that class. RA is crowded. It is heavily managed by payers. Lilly has a strategy on baricitinib to really focus on the differentiation of the product versus the standards of care of methotrexate and Humira. We want to position the product in really the pre-biologic setting. And that may take some time to achieve, as you're pointing out. However, I would say there are all kinds of payers. And those that are more clinically-focused and focused on improving outcomes for a pretty significant condition, life-long condition for young people, RA, we think we can make early headway in those settings. Others which may be more sensitive to rebate flow, et cetera, obviously that's going to be more difficult. But I think Lilly's prepared to be patient and build out the product through time. Reminding everyone that the current IP is very long and we have a long time to fulfill full value for baricitinib. Thanks for the questions. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. The next question from the line of Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners : Yes, thank you very much. Dave, a question on Taltz and the anti-IL-17 class. I understand the commentary around the growing class. And clearly, if we listen to Novartis, they'll be quite enthusiastic. I'm just wondering, though, as we look quarter-to-quarter at the U.S. sales, while the rate's nice, the absolute numbers I guess one could say it's rather anemic. And so the real question is around payers, I guess, and whether or not the full channel opportunity is being utilized by Lilly and, more importantly, how you think you might be able to address that relative to Cosentyx or others that may enter that market in psoriasis. Thank you for your time. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Tony. Thank you for the question. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, Tony. Thanks for the question. We are both excited about the uptake of the IL-17 class and Taltz within it. In fact, as we exited Q3, we're seeing Taltz new-to-brand share in dermatology, which is really our key leading indicator for performance, as peaking over 10% already, ahead of Enbrel, for instance, and at least at par with Cosentyx in that setting. So we're happy with the initial adoption and the breadth of trial and usage which are other key indicators for us. At this point in the launch cycle, I'm not sure net sales should be the absolute marker we'd be looking at, although of course we're looking forward to growing that quarter-on-quarter going forward. And you did see growth from Q2, which was, reminding everyone, just a few weeks of shipments in Q2. It wasn't a full quarter. Also, vis-a-vis Cosentyx, which enjoys three indications, we can only have the one in psoriasis, as was mentioned in the call text earlier. We do plan submissions now for PSA in the U.S. shortly. And we have an (45:40) program ongoing. So net-net, I think we're happy with where we are. Global rollouts are beginning in the second half of the year as well in Europe and Japan, which are also significant opportunities. We've got a lifecycle coming. And where we are head-to-head against the incumbents of TNF, STELARA, and even Cosentyx within the class, which is the U.S. derm market, I think the early performance indicators are quite strong. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. Next question from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have a couple. Assuming solanezumab data is tracking toward CTAD presentation, would there be a top-line release? And, if so, when would that be issued? And externally, of course, we know nothing about what was seen in EXPEDITION3. Does Lilly also know absolutely nothing about what was seen in EXPEDITION3, or is some data being analyzed or already has been analyzed? So that's the first question. Second question is, Lilly seems to have done some opportunistic spending in Q3. Companies typically do this for various reasons, one of which is anticipation of positive upcoming developments. Certainly it would not be done when delay or disappointment is expected. So how should we interpret your opportunistic spending in the third quarter? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Steve. Thanks for the questions. It's always an exciting moment waiting to hear you give them. If we can go Dave for the sola questions on the CTAD and potential timing for a top-line press release issuance, as well as whether or not people have seen anything at Lilly on EXPEDITION3 to-date. And then, Derica, if you'd like to handle the spending question, that would be great. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, let me answer the second \u2013 sola question first. Steve, we have seen nothing on EXPEDITION3. And that will remain true until literally a few days before your second question, which is a top-line press release, which we'll do with absolute urgency after management's had a chance to look at the data coming in. Reminding everyone that the period between last patient visit and that management review involves a lot of data cleansing, QA/QC effort to make sure what we're looking at is a true signal. And those are normal procedures that do need time and effort to make sure that the much anticipated readout is accurate. Following a top-line release, probably by just a few days, would be CTAD, if we can make it. This will be a slide format of a summary of the top data points which would fill out things beyond what would be anticipated in a top-line release at that time. That's just reminding everyone a best-case scenario for us right now if everything goes smoothly operationally. And just to remind everyone, you do not need to register for CTAD. They've asked us to say that. And that it will be available from the comfort of your computer to view in real-time should that presentation occur in first week in December. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Steve. Good morning. In regards to our operating expense and spending in the third quarter, there was really nothing unusual. Our lack of transparency in terms of what we're doing behind the scenes, it really is driven by the new product launches and our support of that. You've probably seen some of our new DTC ads that we've launched in quarter as well. That's driving the spend, as well as our launch prep. We talked about the recent approval of Lartruvo and we've been anticipating that for some time. In addition, you also see that we continue to invest in our pipeline. And if you look at our total operating expenses for the quarter, our biggest growth was in that realm in terms of R&D and it really is progressing \u2013 continuing to progress our pipeline, and to pursue the opportunities that we have embedded there that we believe still keeps us on track to achieving that potential of 20 launches in a 10-year span. So whether you call it opportunistic, we see it more in a sustained fashion that this is what we've been geared up to do. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Derica. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : Thank you. The line of Mr. Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one was on Basaglar. You've had a few big formula wins for 2017. Can you help us just understand the dynamics of that product in the U.S. next year? I guess specifically, what percent of market do you have access to? And how should we think about Lilly prioritizing that product relative to other assets in the diabetes portfolio? My second question was on abemaciclib. Just helping us put a little bit the continuation of the MONARCH 2 study into context. Do you still believe you can differentiate that asset from IBRANCE, even though the product didn't achieve its interim efficacy criteria? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Chris. Thank you for the questions. We'll go to Enrique for your Basaglar questions and then to Sue for abemaciclib. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So we've had a successful contracting season with Basaglar. So we feel good about our commercial access in particular. Clearly, contracting is not done yet. And just to remind everyone, we expect to launch on December 15 of this year. So I won't be able to provide specific numbers at this stage, but we are very pleased with the access that we will have. In terms of the priority that we will basically have on Basaglar, clearly is a newly launched product. And we need to make this product relevant in the basal insulin space, really a new segment for us. So from that perspective, it's important. And it's important because also it really fully completes the diabetes portfolio that we can offer our customers. We now have a complete portfolio, a full range of insulins, a GLP-1 with Trulicity, and then great oral products. As we look at our performance in the U.S. market and in other major markets, we're actually growing market share with every single product. I think as we launch Basaglar, I think it is key that we continue driving the entire portfolio and the success that we're seeing with Trulicity and the opportunity that we have with Jardiance. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, with regards to bemaciclib, we continue to be very excited by this molecule. And if we look at the interim, we as we said previously, it was a high bar. And if we look across the CDK4/6 inhibitors, about 50% of the interims have been met and 50% haven't. So I don't know we should read too much into us progressing with MONARCH 2. We're looking forward to seeing the final data next year. And, of course, we've also got the MONARCH 3 data as well expected toward the end of next year, with an interim also earlier. From a differentiation perspective, there were no head-to-heads. But if we look at abemaciclib, we've seen single-agent activity now in the MONARCH 1 trial. And also, if you saw the neoMONARCH data that was presented at ESMO, we saw single-agent activity there. We see 14 times more potency to CDK4 than CDK6 with abemaciclib. We continue to be able to dose this continuously. And it crosses blood-brain barrier, if I can say that. So we, as I said, continue to be excited by the molecule and do believe that it actually could be best-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. Next caller, please. Operator : We'll go to line of Mr. Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. First on CTAD, is there other data you plan to present there? If not, EXPEDITION3, or with or without EXPEDITION3? What longer-term strategic and financial and possibly R&D decisions are tied to the outcome of EXPEDITION3? I think you already touched on the R&D piece, but maybe strategic and financial longer term. Then, Enrique, what can you say about the launch of Basaglar in the U.S.? It's somewhat imminent. I'm sure you have a pretty good sense of demand and what price you're willing to part with the product. So whatever you can help us understand heading into that, that would be very helpful. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you could answer question on the CTAD data being presented, anything other than EXPEDITION3, and maybe at least within the overall Alzheimer's disease portfolio and (54:35) portfolio, what that might mean for investment perspective. Derica or John, feel free to chime in from a corporate perspective, if you'd like. And then we'll go over to Enrique for the Basaglar launch question. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, thanks, Gregg. Yeah, CTAD is an important Alzheimer's meeting. It's not a large meeting, but it's one where top experts who do clinical research around the globe in Alzheimer's all come. As a result, we are consistently at that meeting with posters, other presentations. As you know, Lilly's done a lot of work, whether it be in diagnosis work with our PET scanning business. We have some data reading out in that area, as well as other supportive data looking at disease modification, et cetera, in different populations. So there are other presentations. I don't have a list in front of me, but we can provide that in follow-up. The second question is really, what would change going forward if sola is positive. And I think here we've given long-term guidance without sola. But certainly we would anticipate a rapid submission and introduction to the major markets and the normal kind of go-to-market commercialization effort that would come with that, which is typically expense followed by revenue. I would also say this, we'll present two new opportunities for Lilly, I think unique ones, within the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer's. One would be to look at acceleration and full funding for other Alzheimer's products, particularly those with a beta-based mechanism. Certainly with a lead like that in sola, we would want a fast follow with other innovations we have coming. We're doing that, but we can always look at speed and voracity of that effort. And then finally, looking at combination and sequences of therapies that could be combined with solanezumab to further arrest the disease. That only makes sense if sola works. And we have those sort of queued up, but certainly not in our funding and expense base today. So there are many; we'll have to prioritize amongst those. And I think of course, qualitatively, the way sola works will have some bearing on how much of that additional investment we would trigger. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. John or Derica, any comment? No. Okay. We can go over to Enrique for the Basaglar question. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So maybe just a few additional comments on Basaglar. Clearly, we will be disclosing the list price in the near future. But I think it's fair to say that the real competition when it comes to prices really happens with the rebate levels and at the net price level. As I mentioned, we do have good access. Now, this doesn't automatically mean that Basaglar is going to be a win. We need to make this product relevant with our customers. We need to build that brand and we need to provide great experiences. Yes, in some cases, Lantus and Toujeo are excluded from formularies, but this is not the case for Treciba, Levemir. So at the end of the day, we need to make sure that Basaglar is an important compelling option for those patients and those customers. And we are working to make sure that that happens. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Mary Beth, next caller, please. Operator : We'll go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with the pricing risk and election cycle. If you look at most of the election cycles historically, it would seem as though that if investors actually owned the group coming out of an election cycle, they'd be rewarded pretty handsomely. However, you do have some things that are being tossed about, most notably Proposition 61 that'll be on the ballot November 8, on the California ballot, proposing a statute which could create a price ceiling on prescription drug costs by state programs. Just your thoughts about this election cycle and what might be different, and is there any silver lining on pricing coming out of that? The second question just has to do with Trulicity. Just an update on REWIND and thoughts around the upcoming interim analysis and stoppage of that trial? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, John. Thank you for the questions. John Lechleiter, if you'll take the first part of that question. And then we'll come over to Enrique for the REWIND question. John? John C. Lechleiter - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, John. Prop 61, we're fighting that tooth-and-nail in California. It's not only bad legislation, it's bad for your health. And we're trying to impress that on the voters. What we've found is that the more people become aware of what's at stake here and what's the likely outcomes of Proposition 61, the more they're prone to vote against it and vote it down. So we have a pretty big campaign underway in California right now to increase that level of awareness and hopefully to continue to shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons. It's difficult to say on the larger \u2013 are we going to see some price relief after the election. I think in terms of where drug pricing fits in what I'd call the rhetoric that you're always going to get in a campaign season, particularly one that's as polarized as this one. So I think there may be some acute relief. I think the bigger question is, if Hillary Clinton wins, what does she have in mind for health care? If Donald Trump wins, what's the direction going to be? It's pretty clear, whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something needs to be done if we're going to render a health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I think that's going to be the bigger focus for the industry is what happens in those probably critical first two years of the first term, which we know what happened in 2008 and 2009. And I think that's what the industry has to be prepared for. At the same time, I think that, frankly, if we're successful with sola, the outcome of sola, and there's hope for Alzheimer's \u2013 keep in mind that the top 10 causes of death in this country, I think I heard the other day, Alzheimer's is the only one where we continue to see increases in the rate of mortality. So I think if the industry can demonstrate once again, like we did with HIV/AIDS, like we did with hepatitis C and so many other diseases, that we can make an impact on something that increasingly everybody is fearful of and concerned about, I think that changes the dynamic, too. We don't know what that outcome's going be, but it's going be a very interesting mix come January 1. And I'm sure Dave Ricks is ready to jump all over it. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, John. Enrique, for the REWIND update? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So our REWIND trial with Trulicity scheduled completion date right now of July of 2018. We expect the interim later this quarter. We already had the number of events to be able to reach the interim. But the DMC will be meeting later this quarter. Clearly, we've learned a lot from both the LEADER and the SUSTAIN trials. I think it's important to remind everyone that given the number of events that we have in interim is significantly lower than what Victoza had with LEADER, so the hazard ratio for us to be significant will have to be quite impressive. We will see what the data says once we have the readout. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Mary Beth, next caller, please? Operator : Thank you. That would be the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. (1:03:00). Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hey, Marc. If you can hear us, it sounds like we lost you. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Hello? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. We can hear you know. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, Phil. Enrique, first, can you help explain why GLYXAMBI is not doing better? We look at the prescription trends, and I would have thought that this product would have taken off much better. Second question is, can we get a little more color on Animal Health and just what happened in the quarter and what's going on there? And third, you mentioned the CGRP headache cluster. Can you just talk about the timeline change there and what happened and if there's been any other timeline changes to that program? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Marc. Thank you for the questions. We'll go around the table here. We'll start with Enrique on the GLYXAMBI question. Over to Jeff for more color on what's going on with the Animal Health business. And then back over to Dave for the CGRP timeline question. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So the strategy we had for GLYXAMBI was a different one prior to the readout of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. As we see it today, we need to make sure that we are positioned in Jardiance as standard of care and we need the new indication to truly do so and really reinvigorate the growth of the SGLT2 class. We believe that GLYXAMBI will have very significant benefit once this happens. But investing today in a really big way in GLYXAMBI really doesn't make sense, whether it's access or promotional investment. GLYXAMBI has today fairly low access. We are in the 20s when we look at commercial access, and it's even lower than that in Part D. We need to retake that once we get the new label for Jardiance. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Marc, thanks for the question on Animal Health. Bottom line, our Animal Health quarterly results have been more volatile this year, as you know. Inventory destocking was a significant event in Q3 and it contributed to the revenue decline this quarter. We don't see these results as a trend. Just as we enjoyed the benefits, as you recall, of the distributor purchases in Q2 ahead of our SAP cutover in the U.S., inventories were depleted in Q3, which caused the majority of the decline in our Animal business. So I would note the SAP transition has gone very smoothly. On the companion animal side, our business is up 3% year-to-date, which really normalizes for the Q2 and the Q3 inventory impact. And what's driving this is, one, successful launches of some new innovation, as well as we believe our improved competitiveness with the combination of Novartis and Elanco. On the food animal side, food animal's down 1% year-to-date. And really, outside the U.S., we've experience weakness in Latin America. And really this region represented the entire decline for our o-US food animal in Q3. And then in the U.S., we face some market access challenges this quarter. In particular, Paylean, a product in our U.S. swine business, pork customers pursuing the China export market removed Paylean. They'll do that on and off. They'll come on and off the product depending on needing the export markets or not. So that in summary. As then as John noted, two weeks ago we announced the acquisition of BI's companion animal vaccine business, subject to the closing, again, of the BI Sanofi asset swap. We see this as a tremendous complement to our companion animal business in the U.S. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hey, Phil, just a clarification. The number I quoted for GLYXAMBI is as a preferred position, so lowest branded copay. The access is higher than that we look at overlaps. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you for the clarification, Enrique. Dave, on the CGRP timeline? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. So I think, Marc, you're asking about the push-out on cluster headache. This is for galcanezumab, reminding everyone that galcanezumab will be the first therapy in this class \u2013 actually the first therapy ever to our knowledge, to be approved with well-controlled studies in cluster, should those studies read out. We have pushed back the timeline into next year based on enrollment. And really to clarify that, it's actually the ability to have subjects have cluster headaches. Some forms of the condition are episodic. So while we recruited well the number of people in the program, we're waiting for the cluster events to start which can demonstrate the value of the product. So it goes part and parcel with pushing into a new therapy area like this where studies haven't even been done before with medicines on a large scale. But we're excited about that part of the program. Again, it would be first with that indication to our knowledge. It gives us some, I think, credit with the neurologists for tackling a tough condition and potentially some value support as we go to market. Also, I'd say the migraine program is on track. We have communicated previously that that's a mid-2017 readout with potentially a submission by the end of 2017. So we're feeling good about galcanezumab overall. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : That line will be Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So first just on the diabetes side for Trulicity, Jardiance. Can you provide a little more color in terms of how much of the sales is coming for, I guess, the classes as a whole, and also your products from specialists versus generalists? Just trying to see if they're getting better traction with the primary care physicians. And then second on Taltz, you mentioned psoriatic arthritis and also ankylosing spondylitis. Can you just give us a better sense there in terms of how you view the commercial opportunity for those two indications relative to the psoriasis indication? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Vamil. Enrique, we'll go to you for the Trulicity and Jardiance question on specialist used versus PCP prescribing. And over to Dave for the psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis opportunity. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So I don't have the numbers in front of me, but when we think about specialists versus primary care, for this product to be successful we have to be relevant when it comes to primary care. We expect long term that over 80% of the volume will basically come from primary care as we think about these two products. Now, something that is encouraging about the uptick of both of these products is that our share with specialists, it is indeed higher with endocrinologists than with primary care physicians. This is important as a leading indicator as we look at the future and a great prognosticator of what is to come ahead. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. Thanks for the question, Vamil. What I hear you asking about is as we look forward to the future indications, how do we think about the size of those markets. I would say on PSA, which would be the next one for us, based on differentiation we think we have versus standards of care like Humira, reminding everyone that IL-17s can be used without methotrexate and you get sort of the stool, skin and joint benefit that's at least as good on the joint. We're encouraged by what we see so far in our estimates. Our own estimates actually have gone up since we started the program because treatment rates for PSA appear to be quite a bit higher than psoriasis when it comes to using biologics. Just to give everyone a bit of frame on that, when you look at products that are indicated only for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, take Cosentyx, for instance, they usually have a little bit more volume coming out of non-derms than derms right now. And I think that indicates that although the incidence rate is lower for PSA, rheumatologists are more comfortable with biologics. They're treating PSA at a higher rate. Ank spo is, I would say, even more of an underdeveloped opportunity. In particular, Lilly's program will feature the potential to be indicated in non-radiographic ank spo, so this is an absence of X-ray proof of the condition. This is a recognized indication in Europe, but not yet by the FDA. Should we achieve that, I think that presents a very significant market expansion opportunity for ank spo where the biologic basis of the condition is known to be quite similar to PSA and psoriasis. So there's a lot of promise being held out for the class in ack spo. We see some early data from Cosentyx in that regard. We're using even higher doses. So I think we are optimistic on all those indications as being meaningful part of the ultimate success story of Taltz. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, next caller, please. Operator : That line of Mr. Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. The first one just very quickly on Effient. Assuming that the exclusivity wouldn't be based on the 2023 patent, could you just give us what the more conservative timeline to think about for loss of exclusivity in the U.S. would be? And then secondly, just thinking about going into next year post-election, just thinking about some of the rebating you've already mentioned on Humalog. With the LIS and duals rebating changes that have been kicked around a few times and are being kicked around again during this election cycle, could you just talk a little bit about your exposure to the LIS and dual-eligible population, what you think the probability of any rebating changes could be there and any ways the firm could potentially mitigate those? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Jeff. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to go ahead and comment first on the Effient question. And then maybe, John, if you want to comment just generally on the size of impact of the dual LIS. And then maybe, Enrique or Dave, Sue, if you want to comment on any specific impacts or mitigation that you see with your particular areas of the business that would be great. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, I'll be brief. We've been consistent through time in saying the IP that we are counting on for our own plans as sort of being quite firm is the compound patent which expires naturally in Q2 of next year and then as extended with pediatric work, which we have confirmed would take us into early Q4. The other IP, we're disappointed and we plan to continue to fight on those. But I think we've been consistent in our own planning that that's the firm date that we were counting on, and that remains true. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: John, on the overall impact of the dual LIS proposals? John C. Lechleiter - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, Jeff, I think if the low-income subsidy patients and the duals were moved out, and that's been around bandied around for quite a while and talked about, the order of magnitude of the impact it would have on the industry is akin to the overall impact of the Affordable Care Act. So we're talking something around $110 billion, $120 billion over I think a 10-year period. So it's a significant hit. And it's, again, as I said earlier, it's not just bad policy, it's bad medicine. These folks are not going to enjoy near the kind of care and access to modern therapy that they're able to benefit from under the Part D coverage. So you can bet we're going to fight any such proposal tooth and nail. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Any other comments from - David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Well, I'll let Enrique talk a little about the Inline business because we had a very significant exposure, say, five years ago in biomed with all the neuropsych products, but that's pretty well diminished in the U.S. I would say from a policy perspective that I think two other bad things will happen if that goes through. One is, it it'll create an incentive to actually price higher because you want to get the starting point above where it is today given the 23% from the beginning plus the accelerated rebate based on price increases. I think it'll have a perverse effect actually on pharma pricing. And then the second is I think it will take away an incentive long term to develop medicines for dual LIS beneficiaries, which is probably the last thing anyone in Congress would be wanting, but that will be the net effect of that change if it occurred. We're optimistic that we can fight that. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Well, clearly when it comes to diabetes, this would be a very significant impact. Now, as we look at Lilly relative to our competition, I think we're well positioned. We have stronger access generally in commercial than in Part D. And we have continued to prioritize that because clearly it is a more profitable business, a more sustainable business. And we've done this across all of our products. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you. Mary Beth, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. That will be the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks. My apologies if these were addressed. I was disconnected briefly. How should we think about pricing for Humalog? Obviously, significant impact here. I'm just wondering if we could get your longer-term thoughts there. And then on sola, have you had any updated conversations with regulators or just updated general thoughts regarding you changing your primary end points in EXPEDITION3. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Alex, thanks for the question. Enrique, if you could touch briefly on Humalog pricing as you're seeing it. And then we'll go over to Dave for any discussions we've had with regulators related to the change in end point that we announced for (1:16:55). Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So I've commented on some of the dynamics of the quarter and some of the mix changes as we look at the increases in Medicare, Medicaid chargebacks as a percentage of the overall business. Clearly, we expect some of those dynamics to continue. For the most part, now as we look at the different formularies, all of the large formularies have gone exclusive. So whether it's on the Part D side or on the commercial side, as of 2017, I think we basically have a situation where Humalog will be exclusive in a certain number of formularies and a competitor in some others. Clearly, there could be switches back and forth that would deteriorate prices even further. But we have not seen that because there's a very high disruption cost at the patient level to be able to switch 100% of the business now for more incremental gains. It's difficult to say what the pricing dynamics would be. But net prices when it comes to Humalog are pretty low already. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, like I said, really no change. We announced in March, as you know, the shift to a primary end point for cognition. Secondary will be function, sort of the key secondary. And at that time, we said we are in constant conversation with regulators around the world, but this is really a sponsor decision. Really nothing has changed with that. We're now, of course, past last patient visit waiting for the data later this fall. And we'll just have to take a look at the data when it reads out here toward the end of the year. And, again, maintain that we think in mild Alzheimer's, certainly in prodromal and absolutely in pre-Alzheimer's conditions, measuring cognitive changes is a much more sensitive and much more appropriate way to measure disease impact and disease modification. Of course, we will measure function in mild Alzheimer's. But I would point out for the mild study we started with AZ called DAYBREAK with prodromal mild combination study on our BACE inhibitor with AZ as well as our own prodromal program we just began with sola, all of those use cognition as the primary end point. This is a bet we're making across the portfolio and we think is well founded based on expert advice we have and the way science has evolved. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Dave. Mary Beth, next caller, please. Operator : Will be the line of Colin Bristow from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just on Jardiance, sales still light again versus what's implied from script volumes. Can you give color on what's driving this? I know you said last quarter it was a mix of gross to net adjustments and high use of copay cards. I'm just wondering, should we assume that the current net pricing is like a reasonable baseline or is there a negative pricing dynamic that could dissipate? And second, on Animal Health, just a follow-up, it seems like your comments suggest these are just one-time occurrences that are impacting performance. And so should we anticipate a rebound in sales strength in 4Q? And then just lastly on abema, can you confirm we should expect the MONARCH 3 interim before year end? And sorry if I missed this. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Colin. Thank you for the questions. So we'll start with Enrique for the Jardiance question. Over to you, Jeff, then for the Animal Health and what you see with dynamics heading into next quarter. And then Sue on the timing for MONARCH 3, which we did actually update back in August, but we're happy to go ahead and provide you that updated language so everyone's on the call's got that. So we start out with Enrique. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: In my view, the most relevant factor to look at when we think about Jardiance overall is class growth. And as we look at class growth, we have shared and we have been concerned with the overall growth that we are seeing in the SGLT2 class in the U.S. The class, as we look at the last four weeks relative the same four weeks of last year, is only growing about 20%. That's significantly below our expectations. We are hopeful that the inclusion of the empiric outcome data on the label will be a catalyst for the overall growth and we feel confident if we get the right language that we'll be able to make a huge value proposition for this product in the eyes of our customers. As we look at SGLT2 class growth, it is a little bit different outside of the U.S. In Europe, the class is expected to double. Same case in Japan, more than double in Japan in 2016. Yes, from a smaller base, but the growth dynamics, I think, are very encouraging. We doing fairly well when it comes to share. We now have a 30% new-to-brand share in the U.S. Our overall share in Germany is nearly 40% and above 40% in Italy, and basically growing in Spain, U.K., Canada. So I feel very good about the position that we have within the class itself. Now, on the pricing question and rebates, I did comment on some of the copay cards and some of the impact of those. I also mentioned that the impact of the copay cards is going to lessen over time because there's a duration of this copay cards. So while we have implemented some of those changes, we have patients on these copay cards already and some of them are also on the market, so we expect this to be a long-term phenomenon and we will see this decreasing over time. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, Colin, on the Animal Health business, I think overall at a high level, as we noted last December at our Investor Conference, we are going through a transition period. What I would note is, yes, the SAP cutover is complete and that volatility is completed. So we do see less volatility going forward. I think we're keeping our eyes on a few things that are absolutely critical for Animal Health business. One, our animal competitiveness, as I've shared, we feel very good about that. Some of our growth engines, like our Vaccine business and expansion of that. And then we noted seven big products that were critical for innovation, which you know drives Animal Health just like pharma, we've put five of those seven products into the market and they'll be foundational to our growth going forward. Then on the margin side, we continue to stay focused on the margins where we're moving to that low to mid-20%s and we see that happening in 2016. So overall, Elanco, our Animal Health business is well positioned in the top tier to remain competitive in this competitive, consolidated industry. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Jeff. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, with regard bemaciclib, so the MONARCH 2 data, we should have final data in the first half of next year. With regards to MONARCH 3, again, these are event-driven trials, so they could change, but our projection is that for MONARCH 3 we'll have the final data towards the end of next year. We do have an interim that we would see in first half of next year. It has a high bar. Our base plan is that we will continue through to the final data. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. We're reaching the end of the call. I'm going to try and put a little pressure on the next caller as well as whoever responds. If we could, Mary Beth, go to the last caller for a single question and a prompt response to the question, please, and then we'll have Dave wrap up the call. Operator : Certainly. That would be the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Feeling the pressure. Could you talk to the CDK4/6 category? Firstly, in relation to the competitive adverse event profiles of the particular drugs. I'm interested, obviously, in the commission feedback about the low-grade diarrhea versus the monitoring requirement that Novartis is going to face. And then second, should we expect that formularies are going to exercise pressure in this segment as well given LB-3 drugs with very similar profiles in the way they're pulled to signal off the formularies that CVS in CML as well as other small molecular drugs, such as XTANDI. Is this the way the world will work within small molecule oncology drugs going forward? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Andrew, thank you for the questions. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, okay. So with regards to abemaciclib. I can't comment on the safety profiles of the other products. But if we look at abemaciclib, I think we've seen that we've got a very tolerable drug that we can continuously dose. With regards to the diarrhea, if you again saw the newer MONARCH data, if you could give over-the-counter loperamide, we saw very little diarrhea and very manageable and feel good about the safety profile there. Again, I think formularies, it will depend what the data shows and how they differentiate it as to what happens with regards to payers and formularies. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you very much, Sue, for the quick response. Now we'll go over to Dave Ricks to close our call this morning. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Phil. For those of you listening live or to the replay, we appreciate your interest in our company and your participation in today's call. Should you have any questions we didn't address, please contact our IR team and they'd be happy to help, as usual. This is Brad Robling's last earnings call, and we thank him for his support of our investors and wish him all the best in new business development assignment. Thanks, Brad. And finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank John for his steady leadership during one of the most difficult periods of our company's 140-year history. Spurred on by John's vision and his commitment to innovation, Lilly is today in the midst of one of our most productive periods of new product launches and we've achieved great progress building an R&D engine that has the potential to launch 20 new products in 10 years, beginning in 2014. John, many analysts and portfolio managers I've met with in recent weeks have expressed their sincere appreciation for your contributions to the company and to the sector. You've earned their praise. And we all owe you a debt of attitude and we wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life. Thanks, everyone. And look forward to talking to you in the near future.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining Eli Lilly & Company's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Chito Zulueta, President of International Business; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; Dr. Tony Ware, who is the interim President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and of course Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden, and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start with a summary of our progress since the Q3 earnings call using our strategic objectives framework. Starting with Grow Revenue, in Q4 we generated worldwide revenue growth of 7%, which was driven by 9% volume growth in our pharmaceutical business, led by her new products. Prices declined 1% in Q4. On our strategic objective Expand Margins, total operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined over 400 basis points compared to Q4 of 2015, while our non-GAAP gross margin percent excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold was essentially flat. Under the heading of Sustaining the Flow of Innovation, here in the U.S. in our collaboration with BI, the FDA approved and we began promotion of a new CV [Cardiovascular] indication for Jardiance, and we launched our long-acting insulin Basaglar. And in Europe, the European Commission approved Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma. Finally, on Deploy Capital to Create Value, we completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim's U.S. Animal Health Vaccine business. We announced an agreement to acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, which will add a promising molecule for acute migraine for our late-stage pipeline. And we announced an increase of 2% in our quarterly dividend, and we repurchased $300 million of stock. We expect to make continued progress in 2017, and we remain on track to achieve our midterm goals for each of our strategic objectives. Now let's move on to slide 5 for a more detailed review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. New product launches continued. As I mentioned, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received FDA approval of the new CV indication for Jardiance in December and launched in January, right after the mid-December launch of Basaglar. Our initial sales were largely due to stocking, but we are pleased with initial feedback from customers. We also launched Lartruvo for advanced soft tissue sarcoma in both the U.S. and Europe, and the product is off to a strong start, while in Japan, we secured the price listing for Taltz in mid-November and launched the product for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We are in the process of opening accounts and completing hospital formulary reviews. While it's very early, initial feedback and IMS data are positive. In the Animal Health space, along with Aratana, we announced that Galliprant, a first-in-class product for dogs for the management of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, is now available to veterinarians here in the U.S. On the regulatory front, we made significant progress. We received conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission for Lartruvo to treat adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Also in Europe, we received a positive opinion recommending approval of baricitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received multiple regulatory actions on the Jardiance family of products. A number of these actions were related to the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. The U.S. FDA approved of a new indication of Jardiance to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. We were also pleased that the ADA [American Diabetes Association] issued updated diabetes treatment guidelines shortly after the FDA approval. In Europe, the European Commission approved an update to the Jardiance label, including data on the reduction of the risk of CV death in patients with Type 2 diabetes and established CV disease. The U.S. FDA also approved updates to the labels of Synjardy, Synjardy XR, and Glyxambi to include data on the reduction of the risk of CV death in patients with Type 2 diabetes and established CV disease when treated with empagliflozin. Similarly, Europe's CHMP recommended an update to the Synjardy label to include data on the reduction of risk of CV death in patients with Type 2 diabetes and established CV disease when treated with empagliflozin. Separate from actions related to EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the FDA approved Synjardy XR, a tablet containing empagliflozin and metformin extended release for the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes. The European Commission approved Glyxambi, a single pill combining Jardiance and Trajenta, for the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes. Finally, here in the U.S., the FDA extended the NDA review period for baricitinib, and we now expect regulatory action early in Q2. Moving to slide 6, there was one significant data readout in Q4. We were disappointed to announce that the EXPEDITION3 trial of solanezumab in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease did not meet its primary endpoint. Since the solanezumab update we provided on our guidance call, we made the decision to terminate the EXPEDITION-PRO study of solanezumab in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. After careful review of the data from the EXPEDITION3 study and given the overlap in patient populations between EXPEDITION3 and EXPEDITION-PRO, we did not find sufficient scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that solanezumab would demonstrate a meaningful benefit to patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the decision has been made to continue two ongoing public-private partnership studies in earlier stages of AD, the A4 study in pre-clinical AD and the DIAN2 study in dominantly inherited AD. In other news, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court's decision that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent is valid and would be infringed by the generic challenger's proposed products. If the patent is ultimately upheld through all remaining challenges, including intellectual property review proceedings, Alimta would maintain U.S. exclusivity until May 2022. We announced completion of the acquisition of BI Vetmedica, Inc's U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccine portfolio, which also brings a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D site and several pipeline assets. The acquisition diversifies Elanco's U.S. companion animal portfolio by adding vaccines for a range of common conditions. We also announced an agreement to acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million. When closed, this will add lasmiditan, a potential first-in-class non-vasoconstrictive migraine treatment to our pain management pipeline. We believe this potential treatment for acute migraine complements our growing pain portfolio, specifically galcanezumab, which is in development for migraine prevention. Along with AstraZeneca, we announced a worldwide agreement to co-develop MEDI1814, an antibody selective for A-beta 42, which is currently in Phase 1 trials as a potential disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease. In oncology, we announced an expansion of our existing immuno-oncology collaboration with Merck to add a new study for our Lartruvo with Merck's Keytruda patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. We also announced a partnership with Express Scripts to allow people who use Lilly insulin, in particular those who have no insurance or those who are in the deductible phase of their high-deductible insurance plans, to purchase product at a 40% discount using mobile and web platforms hosted by Blink Health. Finally, in December we announced a 2% dividend increase, bringing our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share. And during the fourth quarter, we distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend, and we paid $300 million for share repurchases. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance during the quarter. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures and provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter and full year GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you'll see that Q4 2016 revenue increased 7% compared to Q4 2015, reaching $5.8 billion. Gross margin as a percent to revenue was essentially flat at 77.4%. the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold resulted in a benefit in both this year's and last year's quarter, with the benefit being slightly larger this year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent decreased by 20 basis points, going from 75.7% in last year's quarter to 75.5% this quarter. Total operating expense was unchanged compared to Q4 of 2015. Each of the component parts of total operating expense, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and R&D expense, was also unchanged. In marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, higher spending to support new products offset lower spending from late life-cycle products. In R&D expense, recall that in Q4 2015 we had about $135 million in late-stage termination charges for basal insulin peglispro and evacetrapib, while in Q4 this year we had about $75 million in charges related to the EXPEDITION3 study. Excluding these charges, R&D expense grew 5% due to higher late-stage clinical development costs. Other income and expense was income of $16 million this quarter compared to the $45 million reported last year. Our tax rate was 17.9%, an increase of 4.4 percentage points compared with the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion in Q4 of last year of the full year 2015 benefit for certain U.S. tax provisions, including the R&D tax credit. This was partially offset by a higher net discrete tax benefit in this year's Q4, which included a tax benefit of approximately $40 million related to the early adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share both increased 22%. We achieved the significant earnings growth by delivering high single-digit volume-based revenue while keeping OpEx flat. Slide 10 contains non-GAAP adjusted information for all of 2016, while slide 11 provides a reconciliation of reported and non-GAAP EPS. You'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 25 and 26. Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. On slide 12 in the gray highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 7% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. The effect of foreign exchange on revenue growth was minimal this quarter, and our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis also rounded to 7%, and was driven entirely by volume. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 16%, driven almost entirely by volume as well. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Humalog, Taltz, and Jardiance. As cited in our press release issued earlier this morning, we benefited this quarter from a $130 million favorable adjustment related to changes in estimates, rebates, and discounts primarily related to Humalog. From a growth rate perspective, this was partially offset by the gross-to-net benefit experienced in Q4 2015. The decline in EuCan revenue of 9% was driven by the negative effect of price, and to a lesser extent unfavorable foreign exchange movements and lower volume. On a constant currency or performance basis, EuCan revenue decreased 7%. This decrease was driven primarily by lower volume and price for Cymbalta and Alimta, partially offset by the uptake of new products, including Trulicity, Cyramza, Basaglar, and Jardiance. In Japan, pharma revenue increased 9% in total, driven by a 13% benefit from a stronger yen and to a lesser extent increased volume, partially offset by a 7% negative price effect from the latest biannual price cut. On a constant currency basis, Japan pharma revenue decreased 4%. This performance decline was attributable to the entry of generic olanzapine this past June. Excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q4 grew 9% on a constant currency basis, led by Cyramza, with meaningful contributions from Cymbalta and Trulicity. Turning to emerging markets, revenue this quarter was unchanged, as the negative effect of FX was offset by higher volume. On a performance basis, emerging markets revenue increased 3%, as growth in Cialis, Humalog, Trulicity, Cyramza, Trajenta, and Jardiance, partially offset by lower sales of Alimta and (15:48). Also, this quarter our pharma revenue in China decreased 4% due to FX, while revenue increased 1% on a constant currency basis. Turning to Animal Health, this quarter worldwide revenue increased 3%, while excluding the effect of foreign exchange increased slightly higher at 4%, U.S. revenue growing 2% and OUS revenue growing 5%. The U.S. increase was driven by new companion animal product launches, while the OUS increase was primarily driven by higher food animal revenue. On slide 13, you'll find this same price, rate, and volume analysis, but for the full year. As we've done in recent quarters, let's now take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, excluding FX, our worldwide revenue grew 7% this quarter, driven by an 8% increase in volume. In total, our new products, Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, and Portrazza, were again the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 8.9 percentage points of volume. Our meal-time insulins Humalog and Humulin in total contributed nearly 2 percentage points of volume growth, while our Animal Health products contributed 40 basis points to volume. Due primarily to declines outside of the U.S. resulting from loss of exclusivity, Alimta trimmed 1.5% from volume growth, while loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta, and Evista provided a drag of just over 2 percentage points. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Phil. As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. As you can see on the graph on slide 15, our new products generated over $700 million of revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents over 12% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 10% last quarter. And, as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 8.9 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. Trulicity performance continues to be strong. Here in the U.S., we're excited that our new-to-brand share with endocrinologists, which we view as a leading indicator, is now comparable to Victoza. In addition to our strong performance, we're also benefiting from growth of the class, with the U.S. GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%. As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza. Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by Japan, where we're seeing early strong growth and early adoption in gastric cancer, and more recently have begun to see uptake in lung and colorectal cancer. OUS markets now account for nearly two-thirds of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continued growth in these markets. U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter. Moving to Jardiance, we continue to see strong uptake, with our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists at 35%, exceeding Invokana. As mentioned earlier, in December we received FDA approval of the CV indication, and the ADA also updated its diabetes treatment guidelines. As we stated in the past, we expect these two milestones to be catalysts for the growth of Jardiance and the SGLT-2 class. We continued to see rapid uptake of Talts, which launched in the U.S. in April last year and has served as a catalyst for continued growth of the IL-17A class of psoriasis. We're pleased that our new-to-brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, already exceeds that of Enbrel and Cosentyx. On Basaglar, we launched here in the U.S. in mid-December. The $16 million in U.S. sales we booked were largely due to initial stocking. Physician feedback has been positive so far, and we look forward to providing a more detailed update on our next earnings call. In the fourth quarter, we also launched Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma, with product becoming available in the U.S. in late October. Our Q4 U.S. sales of $11 million were largely driven by demand. In Europe, Lartruvo was approved in mid-November, and we booked initial sales during December in Germany and Austria. Finally, we continued to see strong uptake of I-O agents in first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer affecting use of Portrazza. Now moving to slide 16, you'll see that changes in foreign exchange rates had a minimal effect on our Q4 2016 results. Growth in non-GAAP EPS was 22% including the effect of FX and 19% in constant currency terms. For the full year, FX provided a slight drag on our financial results. Specifically, revenue grew 6% with FX and 7% in constant currency terms, while non-GAAP EPS grew 3% with FX and 7% in constant currency. Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 17 shows our NME pipeline as of January 18. Over the past three months, most of the movement has been in Phase 1. You will see the Phase 3 attrition of solanezumab for mild Alzheimer's disease with the A4 study in pre-clinical AD now reflected as the lead indication for solanezumab. You'll also see a red symbol in Phase 1 reflecting our decision to stop development of A-beta Fab PEGs. Several assets entered Phase 1, including the addition of the A-beta 1 to 42-specific antibodies from our expanded collaboration with AstraZeneca, and the entry of a BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, two diabetes molecules, and one molecule in both cancer and immunology. One other update; you may have seen Adocia's press release last Friday announcing that we decided to return the ultra-rapid insulin we'd been developing together. We have an alternative ultra-rapid insulin in development that could begin Phase 3 testing before the end of 2017, consistent with the information on our 2017 key events slide. In our NILEX pipeline on slide 18, you'll see two U.S. approvals in the Jardiance family, the CV indication for Jardiance as well as the once-daily combination of Jardiance and metformin. And as mentioned earlier, you'll see attrition of the solanezumab EXPEDITION-PRO study in patients with prodromal AD. Turning to slide 19, let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we added checkmarks for the European approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma and, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the U.S. approval of the CV indication for Jardiance, the European update of the Jardiance label to reflect the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, and the European approval of Glyxambi for Type 2 diabetes. Finally, you'll see a checkmark to reflect the EXPEDITION3 readout. Slide 20 shows potential key events for 2017. And even though we're only a few weeks into the year, we have had a number of our few key events occur already. Importantly, as Dave mentioned earlier, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent is valid and would be infringed by the generic challenger's proposed product. And early this month we closed the acquisition of BI's U.S. feline, canine, and rabies vaccines portfolio. You'll also see that we've added an entry for the CoLucid acquisition, which we hope to close this quarter, as well as an entry to reflect Merck's recent announcement that the U.S. FDA granted Priority Review with an action date in May for Merck's sBLA submission for Keytruda in combination with Alimta and carboplatin in first-line metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer based on the KEYNOTE-021G data. Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 21, our expectations for 2017 are largely unchanged from when we originally issued our financial guidance in mid-December. You'll see that our non-GAAP line item guidance remains the same. We have adjusted our GAAP financial guidance, specifically the tax rate and EPS, primarily to reflect the estimated charge related to the pending acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals. As usual, we've listed the FX rates assumed in our guidance for the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound. In aggregate, current spot rates are modestly worse. However, FX rates have not moved enough to cause us to change our 2017 guidance. We're just one month into the year, and we'll monitor rates going forward as well as underlying business trends to determine what changes, if any, are appropriate to our 2017 guidance when we provide our quarterly update. Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. As we exit 2016, our growth prospects are coming into sharper focus. We have significant opportunities to drive growth over the balance of this decade from the product launches currently underway, with three more new product launches possible before the end of 2018. This should allow us to deliver innovation to patients that fundamentally changes expectations for the outcomes they can achieve and to deliver value to the healthcare system and to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Our management team will be focused on execution to realize the potential of these opportunities. We'll be focused on : launching new products with excellence; reloading our late-stage pipeline from inside and outside our walls with assets of equal or greater value than our graduating class; driving increased productivity across our enterprise to expand our operating margins and create investment capacity; and investing in the core drivers of our business, talent, scientific capability, and technology platforms, to ensure our future growth prospects. While policy and environmental uncertainty are high, we see our innovation strategy to drive volume growth through new brands as both valuable and durable. In my 26 years with the company, I can't remember a more exciting time. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Derica. We'd like to take as many callers as possible, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two or a single question with two parts. Thank you in advance for your collaboration with this request. Kevin, can you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session? And we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. Okay, your first question is from the line of John Boris, SunTrust. Please go ahead. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. So, Dave, a lot of fanfare this morning on CNBC regarding your meeting with Donald Trump. He obviously highlighted turning down regulation, improving the tax outlook, and also obviously a focus was on price. Does, after this meeting, President Trump understand the level of discount that's going on within DOD, VA, that Medicaid is getting products for free, Medicare Part D hasn't broken the budget? And what would happen under ACA if it goes away? The greater than $100 billion that the industry is contributing out of its SG&A line as a tax, would that go away? And then the second question, you did put out a release early on reorganization, obviously cut one head to streamline decision-making, but there seemed to be a greater emphasis on China, especially in light of you having run the operations there. Will you be changing any of your reporting going forward? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Dave, those are for you. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure, thank you, John. We had a good meeting with the President this morning. It was a broad-ranging discussion. We touched on several of the issues there. And your question in terms of innovation, the President was very interested in understanding how our business works and what the opportunities are to further grow the American innovative engine in the biopharmaceutical industry. Of course, we talked about taxes and how that could be a positive catalyst for more investment and growth in the U.S. industry. We talked about regulation. I think he made some comments on camera about that. He's interested in finding ways to reduce and streamline regulation, both at the FDA side but also in healthcare markets that the government plays a role in. And then of course, we did speak about pricing. On that last point, I think we all understand the concern he's raising and of course others are that consumer out-of-pocket costs seem to be growing and growing faster than other payers in the system and how we can do a better job as an industry of getting discounts through to consumers, particularly those in high-deductible plans and government programs. We did not get into elaborate policy detail in terms of the U.S. pricing environment. But I think there will be time for that later, and I left the meeting with some confidence that the people who we'll be working with closely as legislation moves forward have a good grasp of those facts. Your second question was repeal of ACA and the taxes the industry pays. Of course, we haven't seen any specific legislation here. I think the industry said it was basically $100 billion over 10 years that would have been paid in to cover ACA. That's both in terms of the unspecified fee and other concessions in the original 2009 package. I'd be reluctant here to get into specifics on that because we haven't seen the specifics on the repeal or, for that matter, any pay-fors in the replace. But we're preparing for all those scenarios and working closely with policymakers as well as other parts of the industry on good policy that can promote consumer-driven choice and more broadly available medications in these uncovered populations or in the current ACA populations. The final question I think was on the reorganization. And of course, we did announce the reorganization, which removed actually several senior management jobs really to flatten the organization and make sure our executives are as close to the markets that matter and the launches that matter as we go ahead. And that was a primary goal was really to emphasize the importance of these new product uptakes and having our business presidents squarely focused on those and making sure that there's a clear line of sight to the customer for them. We also want to improve our proximity to China, as you mentioned, particularly for drug development, where we can do more I think to speed up our innovation into that market, which has an undeniable long-term opportunity for the sector. We also asked Enrique take on a broader scope of responsibilities, including payer and so forth, hosting responsibilities for the major markets. So that's already announced and rolling out and I think aligns clearly with our stated priorities. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore. Please go ahead. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. And first, thanks to Phil and the whole organization for helping out my team while I was gone. I really appreciate that. I'd like to ask one business question and one science question I suppose. The business question is Sanofi's biosimilar Humira, can you just give us an idea of your expectations for market entry, timing of market entry, and what your plans are to mitigate that? I thought that would be helpful as that gets a little closer. And then number two, I noticed you said on the call that, I think if I heard you right, you're halting the prodromal trials on solanezumab. And that was interesting to me because I'd be curious. Given that you guys are one of the smarter Alzheimer's companies, I'd be curious to know what your current thoughts are on the A-beta hypothesis. Was the failure of solanezumab a failure of the molecule and/or was it a failure of the A-beta hypothesis to be \u2013 is A-beta behind Alzheimer's? And with the halting of the prodromal trial, I assume no longer \u2013 you don't believe it was simply the patient population enrolled. Therefore, that leaves molecule-specific issues and the hypothesis in general. I'd love to hear you talk on that. Thank you so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks for the question, Mark. Dave, if you'd like to, take the first one. And I did get some feedback that there might have been a little bit of echoing, so we'll mute here in the room as you provide your response. And then, Jan, if you'd like to lead off answering the second question, our view of the failure of solanezumab in the mild Alzheimer's population. And, Tony, feel free to complement his answer as well. Over to you, Dave. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: I think the question related to biosimilar \u2013 I think Mark said Humira from Sanofi, but I'm not aware of a biosimilar Humira program at Sanofi, correct? Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Humulin \u2013 Humalog. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Humalog, yes, okay. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Sorry, my bad. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: So maybe Enrique can handle that one. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So we of course are prepared for that event. We had in a certain way the fortune of launching a biosimilar glargine in Europe and now a follow-on insulin glargine in the U.S. So that's great preparation in itself because now we're going to be on the other side of that. And we are thinking how to best ensure that Humalog can continue to be an extremely strong franchise for Lilly. I won't discuss our specific plans, but I would say that we're very well prepared. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.: The amyloid-beta hypothesis and the connection to Alzheimer's disease has strong evidence from genetics, where if you have too much amyloid in your brain, you get early Alzheimer's disease. And also the opposite, if you have less amyloid-beta production then by mutations in the APP in the BACE1 cleavage side, you also seem to be protected from dementia. The key question is so how do you translate then these genetics into realities of pharmacological treatment in an aged patient? And here there are a variety of approaches that have been used. And it's also a key one here to think about if you have an antibody with access to brain, 0.1% through the blood/brain barrier, how can you compare that result then to, for instance, an oral BACE inhibitor, which some of them go 100% into the brain and are I think more likely to have a marked effect than on the free amyloid beta? And the second question is clearly then how early do you have to treat? And I think we should recognize that even if you have mild Alzheimer's disease, your brain has been accumulating amyloids for decades, and you almost have maximum amyloid in your brain already. So I think there could be two components here, like I say. If solanezumab really entered the brain enough to affect amyloid beta, I think our biomarkers like amyloid PET didn't really change very much by solanezumab, nor did the actually tau then changes, which are more related to neurodegeneration change. So from that standpoint, we didn't see any objective measures I think that we changed the amyloid content in the brain, nor then neurodegeneration. Is this against or does this prove that the amyloid hypothesis is wrong? My view is it's too early to say. We need to wait for even more powerful agents. And the next in turn are the oral-based inhibitors, which are more likely I think to have an even stronger effect on the amyloid beta in the brain. And in addition then, we need to look at earlier stages of Alzheimer's. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Tony, anything to add? Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, Mark, I think our view on the prodromal trial is that when we saw the results of EXPEDITION3 in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, which of course were disappointing, when we looked at the prodromal, the patients in prodromal, these are not as distinct clinical divisions as you might think. There's a great deal of overlap between these two populations. And we felt within any given visit, a patient could be on one side of that or the other. So we felt as if that hypothesis had been tested, that those patients were close enough that the prodromal trial would be unlikely to be successful. As you point out and as per Jan's remarks, there are three differences, three potential variables here. There's the clinical stage we just talked about. There's the overall a-beta hypothesis itself, and then there are molecule-specific aspects as well. So those are the three sliders on the equation that we need to try to figure out. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Next is from the line of Tony Butler, Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes, thanks very much, a single question though for Derica, and it relates to gross margins, Derica. Certainly as the seven newer products that you call out have made an increasing contribution, as you noted, 12% in the quarter to overall revenue, one might expect gross margins to be able to move higher. I guess I'd love for you to comment on the pushes and pulls there, and more importantly, how you think about that as that contribution exceeds 12% certainly for the calendar year, even beyond 2017. Thanks very much. Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. The good news is there's no substitute for top line growth, and so having the 7% revenue growth or in the quarter the new products driving almost 9 percentage points of volume-driven growth is tremendous, and really the kudos go to the team in pulling that off. When you get to the gross margin percent, you did not see the improvement you may have been expecting. That's really driven more by mix. So in the quarter you did see, for example, on our insulin business, where you'll see as it gets more weight and we have negative pricing in that regime, that becomes a drag on our gross margin percent. And for now, insulin still is our largest product until the other new products catch up. So what you really saw in the quarter was more a mix effect. Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you, Derica. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Okay, our next question is from the line of Chris Schott, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much, just two questions here. Maybe first, can you talk about business development priorities? You recently announced an interesting but relatively small deal, but bigger picture, maybe a question for Dave. When you think about how Lilly has historically approached business development, should we think about a similar approach under your leadership, or are there any differences in how you're thinking about business development relative to your predecessor? Second question was coming back to Alzheimer's and BACE. How are you thinking about your BACE program and your molecule relative to Merck's program? Are there any important similarities or differences we should keep in mind as we consider potential read across from the Merck Phase 3 data later this year? Thanks so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Questions, Dave, if you'll answer the question on BD priorities, feel free since you're obviously very well in this space to make an initial comment on the AstraZeneca BACE program we have, and the other BACEs that we're developing and relative to the Merck program, maybe, Jan or Tony, feel free to chime in as well. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Thanks, Chris. In terms of business development, I don't see a change in our general approach, which is what we've said for a while, which is we see value in deploying capital on business development where we can really complement our core therapeutic areas, where we're looking at acquisitions or licensing transactions that can bring products into the portfolio to drive growth for the future and to do that with a lot of discipline on value. And so that's what I think we've been saying for years. I do think as we enter this phase coming up, where in our therapeutic areas there appear to be attractive alternatives for investment outside the company as well as inside, we've got a key period to make decisions on advancing assets into Phase 3 over the 1.5 years or so, as Derica mentioned. We need to look at both sources of innovation and we'll do that. The CoLucid transaction, which is one we just announced, I think is a good example of that. So I think the rate may be different based on our circumstance as we're growing the company and have perhaps more opportunities to move assets into Phase 2 and Phase 3, but the criteria really isn't different from how we've thought about this in the past. On the Alzheimer's BACE inhibitors, I think we've talked about this for a while, but the Merck program has two distinct studies. The first one is a classic first-generation type design in the sense that they have a mixed, mild, and moderate population and no requirement to have amyloid present to be in the study. And we know from prior studies like this, whether it be Lilly or other sponsors, you can end up with 20% \u2013 30% of the patients who actually don't have Alzheimer's disease. In addition, for the reasons Jan mentioned earlier, later probably not better in terms of effect size. So the Lilly program with AstraZeneca and the later Merck program have those features built in. We have two studies with AstraZeneca. So if Merck I think has a positive signal of any sort, I think we'd feel good about that in terms of BACE inhibitors as a target. If there's no signal, I think we'll have to do some thinking. That's how we're looking at that upcoming readout. Maybe Tony or Jan could add to that. Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.: No, I don't have anything additional. I think you highlighted the differences between them. We have two studies. The lead study has both patients with MCI [Mild Cognitive Impairment] and prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease, the earlier phases, in them. And then the second study that we entered Phase 3 on are patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. And in every case, we have verified the amyloid going forward. We have a single endpoint, which is a cognition endpoint, which also differs from the Merck program. They have more of a classic, as Dave says, dual or co-primary endpoint for the first study, and then they've announced that the primary is the CVR sum of boxes for the second study. Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.: And if I may add then, both the Merck and the AstraZeneca BACE are not selective for the BACE1 versus the BACE2 enzyme. And we have two other BACE compounds also in clinical development. And in Phase 2 we have our so-called BACE4 inhibitor, which is low-dose. It's highly potent, 100% brain penetration, which means that you have less peripheral overexposure in a way then to get the brain affect, and potentially functionally less active on BACE2. And we recently then also entered for the first time I think now a selective BACE1 inhibitor into clinical development, and that agent then avoids the impigmentation which you see then in experimental animals during tox studies. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Jan. Kevin, if we can, go to the next call, please. Operator : Next is from the line of Andrew Baum, Citi. Please go ahead Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Hi, a couple of questions, please. Would you care to characterize the magnitude of the financial impact from potential dual-eligible reform or alternatively provide us the delta in percentage terms between net prices for Medicare and Medicaid? And then second, you recently recruited Levi Garraway and Christi Shaw within R&D and SG&A respectively. Could you outline what their mandates are, particularly in relation to building your immuno-oncology franchise, which obviously is not where ideally you would like it? Many thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Andrew, thank you for the questions. Dave, would you like to take that second one first? And then you do you want us to answer here in the room the question on the dual-eligibles? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, that makes sense. Andrew, thanks for the question. We have brought in two senior executives recently. We're excited by both their willingness and excitement to join the company, but also what they can add probably in the very short term. Levi is joining Sue Mahony's team, really taking the role that Richard Gaynor had. So he's got all the clinical-phase oncology portfolio and obviously brings a great skill set to do that. I think in terms of immuno-oncology, he's got expertise in that field among other fields of oncology. And it's probably difficult to say too much about what we hope he'll do, but I think clearly it's a competitive field and having a new look at what we're doing, how we combine products, how we could potentially accelerate our efforts in certain areas is something that we're hoping Levi can help us with. Christi is a commercial person. She started her career at Lilly, most recently ran Novartis's U.S. business. And she's coming into the job I was in, which is a go-to-market and drug development job at running Bio-Medicines. I think she's a strong diverse talent that I think is really an industry veteran who understands the U.S. market extremely well. And so when that opportunity came to pull her onto the team, we made that move, and I think it's going to be great to have her. She starts April 1, so you'll start to see her on the road there in Q2. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: In regards to your question regarding the dual-eligibles, the best way that I could probably characterize that is that the impact of that would be on the order of magnitude on the industry of the Affordable Care Act is how you should be thinking about it. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: It's been a few years, Andrew, but probably four or so years ago, I think the Congressional Budget Office had estimated the cost of moving dual-eligible and low-income subsidy folks from the Medicare price into Medicaid, and they had estimated that at about $110 billion, $115 billion cost for the industry over a 10-year period, very similar to what the expected cost is of the ACA. We have not said if the bully (49:55) exposure to that kind of a proposal would be greater or lesser than what the ACA cost is, but we have said in the past that the ACA 2011 through 2015 was running on the order of magnitude of $500 million to $550 million a year on average as far as the cost to Lilly for greater rebates in pharma. I hope this gives you some order of magnitude. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller, please. Operator : Yes, and that's Gregg Gilbert, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. First for Enrique, in the past, Enrique, you flagged the concern about SGLT-2 new patient starts slowing. What are your latest thoughts on that subject now that you have a label and the updated guidelines? Perhaps you could give some color beyond just scripts. Then my second question is for Jeff. Can you give us some flavor around your outlook for the key parts of your business for 2017 and what some of the pros and cons were in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: We'll go to Enrique, and then go to Jeff. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure, so we are clearly very excited about the new label for Jardiance in the U.S. and the new treatment guidelines for diabetes published by the ADA. We've launched now this new indication in early January. And we are thinking, I'll be honest, pretty big about the opportunity that we have in front of us given the indication that we have. Clearly for us to be successful, the class has to grow or more specifically Jardiance has to grow. And we think of that not just as we think about what is the Jardiance share in the SGLT-2 class, but what is the overall share that Jardiance could get when we think about people with Type 2 diabetes, and in particular in the segment where Jardiance is indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction, which is in people with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular diseases. You can imagine that is as much as 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes, so very, very significant opportunity. It is too early to comment given that we have basically the first week of scripts, which is the first week that basically we launched the product. But I expect that we will see the uptick and we will see this in terms of new patient starts right away. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Gregg, on the Animal Health business, as you know, in Q4 Elanco revenue increased 4%, so we saw the growth start to come back. This was driven by companion animal growth from new product launches primarily, and also I think some expanded partnerships and distributors around the globe as we continue to increase our footprint. Operating margins also I would state expanded to 24% in Q4. That's in comparison to 19% a year ago, so we continue to make progress on integrating our recent acquisitions, and we anticipate further improvement as we go into 2017. So as you look at our strategic agenda, I think a few key things in 2017, first the completion of the BI acquisition that's integrated. We're taking orders. The teams have all been trained. We'll see 6% growth come from that in 2017. As Dave mentioned, we launched Galliprant in the U.S. in coordination with Aratana. This will expand our portfolio in companion animal therapeutics. We'll continue to see our base business expand through innovation, even on the food animal side, as well as just execution in bringing the value of the capabilities that we've gotten from the acquisitions through. And some of the external factors we see moderating and stabilizing as you look at Latin America and dairy. So in summary, I would say our margin improvement will expand to that mid-20s, as we've mentioned, and look to see our growth will return to grow in our base business to the mid-single digits, mostly in the second half of the year, and then again have the BI acquisition growth come through as well. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Jeff. Kevin, if we could, go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next questioner is David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open, sir. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Sorry, I had you on mute there. I have two questions. First, Dave, if you could, comment on how the meeting with President Trump concluded and next steps we should expect from the administration. And then second, I was hoping a member of the team could comment on the abemaciclib Phase 3 readout timings ahead. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Dave, thank you for the questions. So, Dave Ricks, if you'll answer the first part of Dave Risinger's question, then absolutely we have Sue Mahony here, who can address your second question, Dave. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. As I said earlier, we had a positive and broad ranging discussion. And I was impressed with the President's appreciation for what our industry is, which is really a crown jewel of America enterprise in the sense that we invent things, we can change lives in terms of healthcare outcomes, but also we're a great employer and source of economic growth, jobs, and exports. We touched on lots of things, tax, regulation, as well as the healthcare repeal/replace discussion. So there's a number of follow-ups that were cited that will be happening through staff and on the Hill with key members of Congress. The specifics on timing and so forth I'm not at liberty to share here, but I was encouraged overall by the sense a) that there will be changes made, likely rapidly. Most of those will involve the legislative branch. And that there will be follow-up with the White House to make sure we're making progress as we go along. But there's not too many specifics I can share in terms of exact timing. Just overall, I think it was productive to engage the President, educational for both sides, and I think we can go forward and really look at enacting policies that can both help the industry but also healthcare in the United States. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: So with regards to abemaciclib readouts, we're anticipating getting the MONARCH-2 data and having that read out this first half of year. With regards to \u2013 and that's the fulvestrant study. The MONARCH-3 Phase 3, we should have an interim the first half of this year. Our base plan, as we've said previously, is that we will continue through the final, which we could see the end of this year. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Sue. Kevin, if we could, go to the next caller, please? Operator : Our next caller, Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, a question for you, Dave. Do you see the opportunity to improve the company's operating margin goals? I think that if memory serves me right, three, four years ago you really set out a goal to achieve SG&A and R&D at 50% or lower. Again, that was set up three, four years ago, maybe even longer. I'm just wondering if you see opportunities to either update that goal you set for 2018 or where you see it going. And the reason I bring it up is yes, you had a real high-quality quarter this quarter, but you could have massively beat if expenses, came in line, even at the midpoint of your guidance. Both SG&A and R&D were at the very top of your guidance. And for the full year, your operating margins were 21.7%. I think that is the absolute bottom of the industry. So can you talk about with your \u2013 driven by your new pipeline, what the magnitude of potential improvement that you see for operating margins? Are there structural impediments such as mix effects that will keep margins below industry average? How should we think about it over the next three to five years? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, thanks, Jami. Over to you, Dave. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Thanks, Jami, great question and one we're spending a lot of time on as well. Of course right now, we're working against the prior goal you cited, which is to get our SG&A and R&D total operating expenses as a percent of sales to 50% or less in 2018. So that's the near-term goal we're very focused on. We've reiterated that again in December, and that's obviously an improvement over where we are today and what we're reporting for 2016. I would highlight, although we're at the high end of the ranges in terms of our guidance for the quarter on expenses for R&D and SG&A, year over year good progress in Q4, and we did have some one-time items in Q4 which adversely affected that. That said, I think my overall perspective on this question is we have multiple ways to improve the operating margins of the company. And as we launch new brands and grow the top line, that's clearly one. I think if we can really repurpose investment behind those priorities and maintain a lower growth rate, in some cases much lower growth rate in the middle of the income statement, we can deliver tremendous leverage on the bottom line. You can see that in Q4, putting aside the Street estimates, what kind of leverage is available in the business. And we're aware of where we stand in the industry. I think we're not a single-product company or close to it, like some of the comparables even approaching our size. So that breadth I think does have inefficiency built into it. It has other advantages. We run a global operation. We want to be a global company, not just a multi-market company. That has an implication. But by and large, I think your question is can we improve beyond what we set out in 2018. And I'm personally focused on delivering on the 2018 commitment, and then we'll likely set a goal beyond that for improved operating margins toward the balance of the decade. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Jami, this is Derica. Just to maybe add a little bit of color to Dave's comments, recall that the guidance that we provided said we get to 50% by 2018. We also on that same guidance, going back to last summer and our July earnings call, we said we would improve our gross margins between then and the end of this decade. And our starting point was around the mid-70s for gross margin. So that implies that at least at a minimum by 2018, our operating margins will be at least 25% or greater. So if OpEx is 50% of our revenue line, today our gross margin is around 75%, or said differently, our COS is around 25%, so if we get to 50%, we maintain or improve on the 25%. That implies that the floor and operating margin you should be looking at in 2018 is a minimum of 25%. And so to Dave's point is, that's what we said we will get to by 2018. We never said that we will end there, that that wasn't the end goal. That was the intermediate goal. And so there's still progress being made. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Jami, for the question. Kevin, if you can go to the next caller, please? Operator : That's Tim Anderson, Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, a couple of questions. One is a higher-level payer question. Do you think that the relationship between drug companies and PBMs will come under more government scrutiny as it relates to rebates? And kind of a thought exercise, from your perspective, would it be good or bad for drug companies to have that whole rebate process potentially go away? Second question is on Alimta. You noted that that is the chemotherapy drug used in KEYNOTE-189. How does the trajectory of Alimta change from where it is today, if that trial is positive or if the Merck regimen gets early approval in May on the Phase 2 data they filed on? What does your 2017 guidance assume, and could there be upside in 2017 and also beyond 2017? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you'd like to take the first question that we received on scrutiny of the relationship and the business relationships with PBMs and pharma companies. Then over to Sue on the question on Alimta in combination with Keytruda. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Thanks, Tim. I think a lot was written about that question. To be honest, we have good relationships with all the major PBMs. Of course, it's a business transaction and we're on opposite sides of the table. They do their job very well. They negotiate hard for rebates and discounts for their customers, most of which are large commercial plans or Part D. And we do our job, which is to sell the value and try to maintain formulary position. There are always tugs and pulls in that and products are listed and delisted, but overall I'd say we have a good relationship with the PBMs. Of course there's only one major pure-play PBM at this point. But Express Scripts and Lilly have a good relationship, and we announced this Blink Health partnership as an example of that, innovating together to try to solve some of the payment problems. I think hypothetically, if we didn't have rebates, would I worry long term about our future? My answer is no. I think we're in the business of making innovative products that help patients. We need to do that in a way that creates value in the healthcare system. How we get paid for that value, there are probably lots of ways. As you know, in international markets many, many places where we have productive and profitable businesses, we don't have PBMs or anything like it and we don't have rebates, and we do just fine. So I think because of the breadth of our portfolio because of our new product mix, because of the company's focus on volume growth across several key markets, I think as Derica said in his comments, we have a durable strategy going forward should there be some big disruption, which I'm not sure I see right now. But I think on either side of that, our model would work well. Enrique can add anything to that and then maybe the Alimta question to Sue. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: No, nothing from my side. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sue, on Alimta? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: So, Tim, let me answer the Alimta question. Clearly we can't give guidance with regards to a product. That said, we are very pleased to see the data from KEYNOTE-021G and also the fact that the FDA have accepted it for filing, with a PDUFA date, as you know, in May. And we also are looking forward to the Phase 3 data, which again we should see that in September time. I think with regards to what this means for Alimta, Alimta has been under pressure, particularly in the second-line setting with I-Os coming through in the first line setting very little at this point. This data is the first data that shows that adding an I-O agent to Alimta-carbo [carboplatin] combination shows not only a good overall response rate, which we think we saw a doubling response rate, PFS of about 13 months. But also although the survival data wasn't different between the two arms, we saw a pretty good survival both at the 12-month and the 24-month mark, which I think was 72% versus 75% of patients survived at that point. So I think we're excited by the data, and it is the first chemo combo and I would say the only chemo combo with KEYTRUDA or any I-O agent. We await to see what the other data shows this year with the other trials that are ongoing and maybe next year too with the I-O/I-O combos and the chemo combos. But clearly this, in my view, can do no harm to how people see Alimta. It is the standard of care in first-line setting, and we continue to see that this is additional data that adds to the multiple trials that we've seen with improved overall survival with Alimta. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you, Sue. Kevin, we can go to the next caller. Operator : And that's Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two questions. Can you provide any perspective on the reasons for the delay in the baricitinib PDUFA? So that's the first question. And the second question is what should we conclude about Lilly's 2017 guidance in light of the fact that I believe Lilly has exceeded the top end of the initial EPS guidance range in each of the last six years? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: All right. Steve, thank you for your questions. So we'll go to Tony Ware for the first question on the baricitinib NDA review here in the U.S., and then over to Derica for your second question on guidance. Tony? Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Steve. In any regulatory review, the FDA submits various information requests, and then we respond to those as well as we can. The FDA makes a determination once it receives any of these information requests as to whether additional analyses that we have provided, and that's what they are is new analyses of the data that they already have, are sufficiently complicated so that it would extend the time that they would require to review the application. And that determination is made entirely by them, and we don't have much insight into the rationale for that. I want to point out that they did not ask us to do more studies, which is an important point. So that's about really all I can say definitively. I would point out, of course, that this application in the wide world of applications that we send to them, it would be on the more complex side. It's five Phase 3 studies. There are different endpoints, different patient populations, different comparators, and different doses in some cases about that. So the fact that it would take them a little longer to take a look at this medicine than some of the other applications I think shouldn't be too surprising. But I'm optimistic that we will get to a good place with the FDA and that we will be able to meet the new data in April. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Tony. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Regarding your question pertaining to guidance, having been in this job for a while, it's been a wonderful ride. If you look at the last few years, we have exceeded our guidance in some of those years. However, in 2016 we actually came in on the lower end of our guidance, if you think about the range that we provided. So it's not only always true that we've exceeded. But when I think about 2016 performance, what we really are encouraged by and I am is the way we ended the year with very strong revenue performance. We're driving 8 or almost 9 full percentage points of growth from our new product launches. It's very much living up to the expectation that we had set when we provided our outlook for the YZ period. And having achieved that, then it does give us opportunities, as Jami was saying in her earlier question, to work on the middle of the income statement to improve our margins. And so given the way that we finished the year, I'm highly encouraged about our prospects for 2017. I think our guidance is very reasonable. I think our ability to achieve the range of $4.05 to $4.15 in EPS is very much within our grasp. And it implies that we're going to take those top line trends and we're going to translate that into about 300 basis points of OpEx through sales growth and achievement (1:10:41). So that's what we're going to be focused on. And I think Dave summed it up well when we were all out at the JPMorgan Conference together, launch with excellence, improve our margins through productivity, and you'll continue to hear us talking about in 2017 as well as to how we're advancing our pipeline. And so that is something I want to make sure we don't lose sight of because that's what long term continues to make this engine grow. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. Kevin, next caller, please? Operator : Next is Seamus Fernandez, Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Great, thanks for the questions, so just a couple here. For Enrique, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to continue to expand your margins within the diabetes business, particularly in the wake of or in the midst of the arms race pullback that you're seeing from competitors with regard to the field force? I think on your update conference call on the promotional efficiency of the business, you stated that no additional sales reps had been added despite the significant increase in the number of products in the portfolio. So just wondering if you see more opportunity as you continue to grow that business for additional leverage. The second question is more broadly for Dave and maybe to some degree Enrique, given your new role. Can you guys talk a little bit about the willingness to utilize your relationships with managed care, particularly in areas like IL-17 and with the Taltz portfolio? Is now the right time to start to work those relationships or accelerate them? And do you see similar opportunities for those types of interactions on the oncology side of the business? And then just one final question, Dave, can you just give us a general sense of how you're thinking about business development on a go-forward basis? Do you see it more as partnerships, or do you see it more as outright acquisitions? I ask that question more in the wake of the decision to walk away from the partnership with Adocia, which again certainly was a surprise to that company who was a partner. And we've seen some questions raised with regard to how the partnerships have been executed in the past. So it would be nice to know how you guys are thinking about the business development strategy going forward. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: So I'm not sure we understood exactly, Seamus, the middle question you had about leveraging the relationships with payers on Taltz or oncology. Can you be a little more specific on what you're looking for there? Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Just a willingness whether you'd be willing to go to exclusive formulary access or utilize more aggressive discounting despite what are areas of strong potential growth for the industry and for the company in order to participate in that growth earlier? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, thank you for that clarification. Enrique will lead off with the ability expand margins in diabetes. Dave, then if you'd like to comment on the second question on leveraging the relationship and how that might evolve with the payer group and your BD priorities, then we'll come back into the room so if there's anything you want to add to that middle question on the oncology front, please do so. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So we are indeed seeing very significant opportunity to continue to leverage the income statement when it comes to diabetes. We have very strong sales growth, which is driven by volume. As we have mentioned in the past, we're getting some of the benefits from our technical agenda when it comes to diabetes on the manufacturing side. And as we've said, that is for us several percentage points worth of benefit that we're getting, and those benefits continue to accrue and gross margins continue to improve. And finally, when it comes to SG&A, we are basically able to with the commercial footprint that we have support the broad range of products, including all of the products that we have recently launched. So we do believe we have the right infrastructure to support continued growth without us having to add additional commercial infrastructure. When we look at the number of people out there, we are a little bit below some of our competitors when it comes to diabetes, even post some of the reductions that we've seen from them. But at the end of the day, we have to do what works for us. And I think the numbers speak by themselves, not only very good revenue growth but we are basically gaining share across all of our products in all of the key geographies. So it is a pretty good run that we're having right now. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you, Enrique. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Seamus. First of all, in terms of specialty markets and leveraging our U.S. managed care presence, we have a great team. We've got strong relationships, not just with PBMs but with other managed care entities. And I think as a broad-based pharmaceutical company, it's an advantage when we're entering new spaces because we already have that payer connection both for immunology and oral oncology that that base will serve us well. You can add abema [abemaciclib] should we have positive data and be able to submit, but I think it's a strength of the company. Maybe what you're really asking is will we leverage the portfolio to drive more exclusive formulary coverage? I would just say in general, that's not our aim. I think we want to compete with as much open access as possible in as many classes as we can because, as someone launching new products, that's a policy position that makes sense for us. Of course, we have incumbent products too. But all things equal, we would prefer patients have access to as many brands as possible, and we compete based on the differentiation of our products. That's more or less what we try to do across the whole of the portfolio. On BD, I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at there. As I said earlier, it will be an important part of what we need to do going ahead to build out the portfolio and keep upgrading value within the portfolio, whether it be through licensing or M&A. We have a number of very successful licensing arrangements ongoing and in the past. To name a few, of course, the Boehringer Ingelheim arrangement, Pfizer on tanezumab, AstraZeneca on BACE, even the partnering we've done with major oncology firms in terms of combination development with some of our assets I think are all examples of Lilly's open for business on partnerships. There are some specifics around ultra-rapid insulin which I won't go into to here, but I think all partnerships require a shared sense of what the future needs to look like as well as a compelling profile of a product. And when we have those things, we've done very well. If you have information to the contrary, I'd love to hear from you about it. But partnering will be a key part of what we do along with that smaller M&A space, as I discussed, and I think it's a strength of the company. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Comments on oncology? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: No, I would just say the same as what Dave said. We will compete based on the differentiation of the product. Clearly, what the data tells us will help us to better understand what levers we pull across the whole of the marketing mix. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Sue. Kevin, next caller, please. Operator : Next is Marc Goodman, UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. First question is you had mentioned that there was $130 million adjustment, mostly Humalog. Can you tell us what was the actual number for Humalog, and what were the other products that were impacted? And then second, help us understand just the way that the revenues \u2013 I understand the partnership with BI, but Jardiance and Trajenta. And I'm just looking at the way that the U.S. numbers have progressed throughout the year, and they seem to be bouncing around. Just give us a sense here. In the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, was there anything unusual going on? Was there any stocking? Jardiance really ramped up a lot. You see Trajenta coming down a lot, probably much more than what trends would tell you on script trends. So maybe you can just help us understand some of the dynamics there. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you for the questions, Marc. We'll go to Derica for your first question, and over to Enrique. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Marc. You're correct. We did have a $130 million gross net benefit in the fourth quarter. What we've said is that a good portion, a sizable portion of that is attributable to Humalog. But we have not provided the absolute numbers behind it or any of the other products affected. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: When it comes to Jardiance and Trajenta revenue in the U.S., we do see numbers in the diabetes category move a bit based on the estimates for rebates and discounts. This is not just an item for Lilly. It's an item for any company in the diabetes space given the sizable rebates that are paid to payers. In this particular case, it is Boehringer Ingelheim that basically does the contracting and the estimation. In the case of Jardiance, we saw a slight benefit in the fourth quarter. And in the case of Trajenta, we basically saw a negative impact in the fourth quarter, the negative impact probably closer in terms of Lilly revenue nearly probably $20 million. So we expect to see that volatility when it comes to the diabetes product. What we try to look at is really longer term what are some of the trends that we basically see from a volume perspective and also from a pricing perspective. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, thank you. Kevin, if we can, go to the next caller. Operator : Next is Geoff Meacham, Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Christopher Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question, for Dave, another policy question. Was there any discussion today in your meeting with President Trump on the role of PBMs and the role they play in the pricing equation? Do you feel like this could be a bigger part of the drug pricing conversation going forward? And on then on the galcanezumab Phase 3, some data from your competitors, namely Amgen, when you look at that, what would you think is the line for a clinically meaningful benefit? And then finally, with the CoLucid deal, you'll have a range of products. What do you think in this space more broadly is still fertile ground for innovation? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Geoff, thank you for the questions. Dave, obviously the first one we'll pass over to you, and feel free if you want to comment on either of the following two. And then both Tony probably and Jan maybe will add some color here in the room as well. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Geoff. In terms of PBM specifically, that wasn't a centerpiece of the discussion with the President. Of course, pharma has recently put out some work just to put some facts into the picture in terms of what the total drug spend is in the nation and how much of that is innovative, generic, or going into the channel, if you will. I think it's available on their website if you want to look at it. That was referenced in the meeting, and I think it always does surprise people that fully one-third of spending in the U.S. is not going to manufacturers but going to other entities. I think the President was interested in that. Mostly we discussed how to get value to consumers who particularly in the ACA plans or in high-deductible plans have limited formularies. They think they bought insurance and they have limited coverage or are paying a lot of out-of-pocket costs, and how to address that situation. And so PBMs themselves weren't mentioned specifically, and we did discuss channel partners broadly, but more as an educational point. In terms of CoLucid, I'll start there. Obviously, that fits in well with our existing interest in pain and migraine specifically. It is abortive treatment, so people take that when they're experiencing or about to experience a headache. I think it has the key benefits of potentially being labeled for use in patients who have cardiovascular risk factors, which is a major issue with triptans, the major class in that setting, and will fit hand-in-glove with our promotional, commercial, and medical efforts, even future clinical efforts with our potential antibody galcanezumab, for preventing migraine. I guess the question on effect size, I can defer to Tony on that in terms of what we hope to see vis-\u00e0-vis Amgen. Anthony Ware - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi. Regarding the CoLucid or lasmiditan, we're encouraged by this as a novel mechanism. There hasn't been a new mechanism to really stop a migraine that's ongoing for many years now. Nearly 7 million people in the United States take a prescription medicine for that, and a lot of them don't get better. And as Dave points out, a lot of them could potentially benefit if they didn't have cardiovascular disease. In fact, there was a recent survey by the American Neurological Association that said 22% of the patients currently taking triptans actually have what would be considered a cardiovascular contra-indication. And I'm sure these aren't bad doctors. I'm sure it's patients that really are so desperate they're willing to take the chance. So we think that there's a lot of room for innovation for that. And of course with the novel mechanism, the Phase 3 study that was carried out by CoLucid showed that many of those patients had already had a poor response to triptan, but nonetheless responded well when they received lasmiditan. So we're encouraged, and we think that this is a significant innovation for this. For galcanezumab, if we look at our data for Phase 2, we're encouraged by the data that we've seen, and we hope to see the same thing for Phase 3. And there we saw 70% of the patients had at least a 50% reduction in migraine days. We had nearly a third of patient had no migraine days whatsoever. And these are patients, of course, that have in some cases dozens of migraines a month. This is a big difference in terms of whether people can go to work or can take care of their kids and a lot of meaningful benefits for this. So if we end up in the range that we saw in Phase 2, we'll be very pleased. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Tony. Kevin, we'll take one last caller before having Dave wrap up the call today. Operator : That's from Richard Purkiss, Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.: Thanks for taking the question. Just given Trulicity's really strong performance, could Enrique and maybe Jan just run through thoughts on how they see the upcoming competition from Novo's semaglutide, also how they view its retinopathy data and just hopes for the REWIND study? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Richard, thank you for the questions. Enrique, if you want to lead off and Jan can... Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So we are very excited about the growth of Trulicity. We're having great sequential growth, both driven by the overall strength and the health of the GLP-1 class, but also because of the share growth with Trulicity. I was just reviewing our latest data, and Trulicity now nearly has a 32% new-to-brand share in the GLP-1 class as of last week. And so it's really, really outstanding performance by the team. Overall for us, continued class growth is probably the most important factor, and we're excited. Maybe I can provide some color because we recently started reaching additional prescribers as of late last year, basically in the last quarter. And we've seen significant continued adoption by new prescribers. So that basically speaks to continued growth as we look ahead for this product. We do look at the competitive environment and we do look at semaglutide as a potential competitor in the near future. And they do have good efficacy data in a number of trials, including a head-to-head against Trulicity. But they also have reported an increasing retinopathy that was significant as part of one of their trials. So we need to see at the end of the day what the full label will be. And we are of course very prepared, but we really like our chances. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: And then thoughts on the REWIND study and a readout? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: REWIND, we recently had an interim readout. We were basically told that the study will continue as planned, which basically means that we're looking at 2019 for the readout of the cardiovascular outcomes data for that study. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. We're almost at the top of the hour, so, Dave, we'll turn it over to you to close out today's call. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Driven by new product launches, Lilly is entering a new growth period. The combination of top line growth and margin expansion over the balance of the decade provides a compelling thesis for investors. I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress, and please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we've not been able to address on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude your conference. Again, thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

And welcome to the Eli Lilly Q1 2017 Earnings Call. For the conference, all the participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now over to your host, Mr. Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Good morning. Thank you for joining Eli Lilly & Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's President and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA.; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and I'd like to extend a special welcome to Christi Shaw, who joined us earlier this month as President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide three and as outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipelines is for the benefit of the investment community; it is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start with a summary of our progress on our strategic objectives since our earnings call in January. Starting with grow revenue. Q1, we generated worldwide revenue growth of 7%, which was driven by 9% volume growth in our pharmaceutical business, led by our new products. On our strategic objective of expand margins, our non-GAAP gross margin percent, excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, increased by nearly 220 basis points compared to Q1 2016. And total operating expenses as a percent of revenue also declined by nearly 220 basis points. Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, we launched baricitinib under the trade name Olumiant in Europe for rheumatoid arthritis. While here in the U.S., we were disappointed to receive the complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib in RA. We remain confident the benefit-risk of baricitinib as a new treatment option for adults with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, and we will work with the FDA to determine a path forward to ultimately bring baricitinib to patients in the U.S. And as I'll discuss in more detail later, we had a positive Phase 3 read-out for abemaciclib, for Taltz and for Cyramza. Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we completed the acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, which adds lasmiditan for acute migraine to our late-stage pipeline. And we returned over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend. Our continued progress in 2017 keeps us on track to achieve our mid-term goals for each of our strategic objectives. Now let's go to slide five for a more detailed review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call. On the commercial front, here in the U.S. in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim we launched Synjardy XR, a once-daily combination tablet containing empagliflozin and extended-release metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched Olumiant in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, following European Commission approval earlier this year. On the regulatory front, U.S. FDA issued a complete response letter for baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis. The letter indicated that the FDA was unable to approve the application in its current form. Specifically, the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses and to further characterize safety concerns. Lilly and Incyte disagree with the Agency's conclusion, and we look forward to meeting with the FDA in the coming months to determine appropriate next steps. We'll provide you status updates after we meet with the FDA. Also here in the U.S., the FDA approved an update to the Trulicity label to include use in combination with basal insulin for adults with type 2 diabetes. And in Europe, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received European Commission approval of an update to the Synjardy label to include a change to the indication statement as well as data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial on the reduction of cardiovascular death. On the clinical front, we announced that MONARCH 2 is a Phase 3 trial of abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in women with HR+ and HER2- breast cancer met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival. We look forward to presenting data from this study at ASCO in early June. And we'll hold a call the evening of Saturday, June 3 to discuss these results with the investment community. Finally, we've decided to move the FDA submission of MONARCH 2 from the previously announced timing of Q3 up in to Q2. And just yesterday we announced that the MONARCH 3 study with abemaciclib met its primary endpoint at an interim analysis, demonstrating that women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy experienced a statistically significant improvement in PFS with treatment with abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. The improvement was also shown in a key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. We intend to begin global regulatory submissions of these results in Q3 2017. For the RAINFALL study of ramucirumab in first-line gastric cancer, the independent data monitoring committee recently met to review the primary analysis. While we remain blinded to the data, we're pleased to report that the IBMC stated that the study met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival. Consistent with our prior communications, our expectation remains that regulatory submissions could occur after we have the final overall survival data in 2018. At the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting, we presented Phase 3 data showing that patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with ixekizumab, or Taltz, demonstrated superior efficacy at 24 weeks compared to patients treated with Stelara. And along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we initiated two Phase 3 studies of Jardiance for the treatment of chronic heart failure. These trials will enroll patients with and without diabetes and with both preserved as well as reduced ejection fraction heart failure. Moving to slide six. As I mentioned earlier in business development news, we completed the addition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals. In other news, in Japan, the IP High Court ruled in our favor in the invalidation trials initiated by Sawai regarding our vitamin regimen patents for Alimta. If the patents are ultimately upheld through all the challenges, they could provide intellectual property protection for Alimta in Japan until June of 2021. To support the increased demand for our products in our pipeline, we announced plans to invest $850 million in our U.S. operations in 2017, including research laboratories, manufacturing facilities and some administrative areas. We also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first quarter GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you can see that Q1 2017 revenue increased 7% compared to Q1 2016, reaching $5.2 billion. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78.1%, an increase of 180 basis points over Q1 2016. The effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold resulted in a benefit to both this year's and last year's quarter, with the benefit being slightly larger last year. Excluding this FX effect, our gross margin percent increased by nearly 220 basis points, going from 74.9% in last year's quarter to 77.1% this quarter, driven by manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expense increased 3% compared to Q1 of 2016. This increase is lower than the increase in revenue, leading total operating expense as a percent of revenue to decline by nearly 220 basis points, to 53.2%. Looking at the component parts of total operating expense, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 5%, while R&D expenses increased just 1%. In marketing, selling and administrative expenses, higher spending to support new products is partially offset by lower spending on late lifecycle products. Other income and expense was income of $50 million this quarter compared to $55 million reported in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 21.2%, an increase of 3.3 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to the net discreet tax benefit of approximately $50 million in last year's Q1. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share both increased 18%. We achieved this significant earnings growth by delivering high-single digit volume-based revenue growth, while improving our gross margin percent and reducing our OpEx percent, creating positive leverage. Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 22. Now let's take a look at the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. On slide 11 in the gray highlighted row at the bottom of the table, you'll see the 7% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. The effect of foreign exchange on revenue growth was minimal this quarter. Excluding the slight headwind from FX, our worldwide revenue growth on our performance basis was 8% and was driven entirely by volume. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 16%, driven primarily by volume. Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth, with meaningful contributions also coming from Taltz and Lartruvo. The decline in European human pharmaceutical revenue of 5% was driven by the negative effect of price and unfavorable foreign exchange movements, partially offset by higher volume. On a constant currency or performance basis, European revenue decreased 1%. This performance decrease was driven primarily by Cymbalta and Alimta, partially offset by the uptake of new products, led by Trulicity. In Japan, despite a large negative impact from the entry of generic Zyprexa last June, pharma revenue increased 5%. This increase was driven by a 6% benefit from higher volumes and, to a lesser extent, from a stronger yen, partially offset by a 4% negative price effect from last year's biannual price cuts. On a constant-currency basis, Japan pharma revenue increased 3%. While excluding Zyprexa, Japan pharma revenue in Q1 grew 16% on a constant-currency basis, led by Cyramza, with meaningful contributions from Cymbalta and Trulicity. Turning to our pharma revenue in the Rest of World, or RoW, revenue this quarter increased 2%, as volume growth of 7% was largely offset by lower prices and the negative effect of FX. On a performance basis, RoW revenue increased 4%, as growth in Humalog, Trulicity, Trajenta, Cyramza and Jardiance was partially offset by lower sales of Cymbalta, Alimta and Cialis. Turning to Animal Health, this quarter worldwide revenue increased 2%, driven by higher volume for our acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. vaccine business. The effect of FX as well as price was minimal. Excluding the BI Vetmedica vaccines acquisition, the rest of our Animal Health revenue decreased 3%. As we've done in recent quarters, let's now take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, excluding FX, our worldwide revenue grew 8% this quarter, driven by an 8% increase in volume. In total, our new products comprised of Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, Portrazza, and now Olumiant in the EU, were again engines of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 10.1 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. Humalog contributed 50 basis points, Trajenta contributed 40 basis points and Animal Health, due to the BI Vetmedica U.S. vaccines acquisition, contributed 30 basis points of volume growth. Lower Cialis volume provided a headwind of 90 basis points, primarily due to lower volume in the U.S. as a result of a decline in the overall ED market as well as increased use of off-label generic sildenafil. Alimta trimmed 1.1 percentage points from our volume growth, due primarily to competitive pressure in the U. S., while a loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Evista provided a drag of 1.8 percentage points. Now let me turn the call over to Derica. Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Phil. As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches. As you can see on the graph on slide 13, our new products generated over $800 million in revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza. This represents over 15% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 12% last quarter. And as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 10.1 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter. Trulicity performance continues to be strong and is benefiting from the both growing market share and a rapidly expanding GLP-1 class. In the U.S., we're pleased that our new-to-brand share with endocrinologists, which we view as a key leading indicator, is comparable to Victoza. We've also recently expanded our efforts to reach primary care physicians and are encouraged by the early results. Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by Japan, where we're seeing strong adoption in gastric cancer and, more recently, have seen uptake in both lung and colorectal cancer. O-U.S. markets now account for nearly two-thirds of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continued O-U.S. growth. U.S. Cyramza sales declined this quarter, largely due to pressure from IO agents in non-small cell lung cancer. Moving to Jardiance. In the U.S., we're pleased that our new-to-therapy share with both endocrinologists and primary care physicians has increased substantially since the FDA approval of the CV indication and the update to the ADA's diabetes treatment guideline. In absolute terms, Jardiance new-to-therapy volume has increased by 75% since we began active promotion of the new CV indication. We continue to see rapid uptake of Taltz as well as continued strong growth of the IL-17A class in psoriasis. We're excited that our new-to-brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, exceeds that of Enbrel and Cosentyx. On Basaglar, we launched here in the U.S. in mid-December and are seeing strong uptake early this year, largely driven by switching in high controlled PBM formularies. U.S. new-to-brand share of market is approaching Levemir and exceeds that both Tresiba and Toujeo. In Q4, we also launched Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma in the U.S. and in early launch markets in Europe and this quarter have begun to launch in select rest of world countries. We're excited by initial physician feedback and the potential of this molecule to help patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Finally, earlier this quarter, we launched Olumiant in Europe, with this quarter's sales representing initial stocking in Germany. We are pleased with the initial customer feedback and we see great potential for this molecule in Europe. Moving to slide 14, you'll see that changes in foreign exchange rates had a modest effect on our Q1 2017 results. Growth in non-GAAP EPS was 18% including the effect of FX and 22% in constant currency terms. Moving on to our pipeline update. Slide 15 shows our NME pipeline as of April 18. We had positive movement which included : the European approval of Olumiant, the addition of Lasmitidan for acute migraine treatment via our acquisition of CoLucid; initiation of human testing for our long-acting insulin; and termination of development of a Phase 1 diabetes asset. In our NILEX pipeline on slide 16, you'll see the initiation in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim of the Phase 3 heart failure program for empagliflozin as well as the initiation of Phase 2 work with abemaciclib in pancreatic cancer. Now turning to slide 17. Let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2017. Since our last call, we've added checkmarks for : the initiation of the EMPEROR studies of empagliflozin for heart failure in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim; the positive PFS readout for the ramucirumab RAINFALL trial; the U.S. submission of ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis; the EU approval of baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis; the closing of the CoLucid acquisition; and the favorable Japanese Supreme Court ruling upholding our Alimta IP. We've also added a red checkmark for the FDA's complete response letter for baricitinib. You will also see that we've moved the MONARCH-3 data readout from the internal readouts to the external disclosure section based on the positive interim analysis that will allow us to present the data at a medical meeting in the second half of the year. We've also added potential key events for the global regulatory submissions of the abemaciclib MONARCH-3 data, the readout and likely presentation at a medical meeting later this year for the second Phase 3 trial of lasmiditan, and for the potential FDA action on the SBLA for ixekizumab for psoriatic arthritis. Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 18. Our expectations for 2017 are largely unchanged from our last update in late January. You'll see that our non-GAAP line item guidance remains the same. However, we have adjusted our GAAP EPS guidance, primarily due to the global severance charges related to actions to improve our cost structure. Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. 2017 is off to a strong start. Led by our new products, worldwide revenue grew 7%. By driving improvements in our cost structure, we leveraged that top-line growth into 18% non-GAAP EPS growth, or 22% growth when excluding FX. While we're disappointed with the delay of baricitinib here in the U.S., we continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Since our last earnings call, we've launched Olumiant in Europe and had positive Phase 3 readouts for abemaciclib, Taltz and Cyramza. We also closed the CoLucid acquisition, bolstering our Phase 3 pipeline with the addition of lasmiditan. Going forward, our management team will remain focused on : launching new products with excellence, reloading our late-stage pipeline, driving increased productivity to expand our operating margins, and investing in the core drivers of our business \u2013 talent, scientific capabilities and technology platforms to ensure our future growth prospects. Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. We would like to take as many questions from callers as we can. So I would ask that you limit your questions to two or a single two-part question. And we thank you in advance for collaborating with this request. John, if you could go ahead and provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Certainly. And first we'll go to Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. Operator : Tim Anderson, do you have a question? Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Sorry about that. My question is on abemaciclib and your latest thinking about the ability to show that your drug is more efficacious than palbo. Because your pivotal trial didn't have Palbo as a comparator, any efficacy comparisons can really only be made on the side-by-side basis. And naturally, that has certain limitations. So assume that the difference in abema would have to be quite big to really be perceived as a better product. I this something that you think is achievable? I'd like to your latest thinking on that. And then a payer question. If you could just talk about payer trends and rebating trends in SGLT2 category. If you addressed that earlier, I was on another call so I apologize. And on Cyramza, any additional color on, you I think mentioned U.S. pricing erosion, which is unusual with a medical benefit drug in the U.S. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, Tim, thank you for the questions. So, Sue, if you'll handle the first question that he had on abemaciclib and then the third one on Cyramza. Enrique, if you'd like to comment on the SGLT2 pricing. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Tim. Thanks for the question on abemaciclib. As you say, there are no comparative studies of the CDK-4 and 6 inhibitors. We believe that it's going to be important that we look at the totality of the data across multiple trials as we look at these agents. I think I've been consistently saying that we believe that we could have a best-in-class CDK-4 and 6 inhibitor. And I continue to believe that based on the attributes of the molecule as well as, as we say, look at the consistency of data across multiple trials. And that hopefully we will read out two of them this year and we will have others coming in the future. While I say that, well, as we'll mentioned before, this molecule selectively inhibits CDK-4 versus CDK-6. It's actually 14 times more potent on CDK-4 than CDK-6. It has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and we have seen therapeutic levels on brain tissue. The continuous dosing we believe is important for a self-cycling inhibitor, and not just from an efficacy perspective, but also from a convenience perspective of patients. And we have seen in our previous trials and have consistent results that the diarrhea, which is the main side effect, is manageable and actually is transient. So we now have our MONARCH-1 trial in our refractory patients. We have had multiple treatments and have seen in that trial single-agent activity with this agent. We now have two positive Phase 3 trials with the patients on our second-line MONARCH-2 trial, which had a (26:03) therapy. And we're looking forward to presenting that data at ASCO and also hopefully publishing that data this year, too. And, of course, yesterday we announced the MONARCH-3 first-line study against the aromatase inhibitors, where we saw at the interim and we mentioned previously that we had high bar interim. We saw that at the interim we achieved our PFS endpoint, which is the primary endpoint, as well as a secondary endpoint of overall response rate. And so we're excited as we look at the whole molecule here. And we encourage you to see the data in the future to look at the totality of the data across all the trials. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: On the Cyramza. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Cyramza. With regards to Cyramza, yeah, as we're looking at Cyramza performance in the U.S., Tim, we continue to see challenges in the lung cancer market, mainly due to ILs. And so we've essentially seen sort of flat to declining sales in the U.S. over the last few quarters, which, of course, is the complete opposite to Japan, where we're seeing phenomenal sales. Our focus in the U.S., it's really a gross to net adjustment that you mentioned there, so I wouldn't read too much into the pricing. Our focus is to continue to ensure that we have uptake in gastric cancer, which is a very differentiated market. A lot of doctors who treat gastric cancer in the U.S. treat one patient a year. And so really getting to them on time to ensure that they know to use Cyramza in the appropriate patient is our focus on gastric cancer. And in lung cancer, as people are getting used to knowing where to use the ILs in second-line and then if they move to front-line, we're being clear on the patient that we believe can benefit from Cyramza. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Just to complement Sue's answer, on that gross to net adjustment, it was essentially a benefit that was recognized. We trued up the estimates for rebates and discounts in Q1 of 2016. It's leading to the negative year-on-year compare. So nothing unusual that we're seeing in the actual contracting or pricing for the product. Enrique? Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So the SGLT2 class, similar to other diabetes classes, is highly managed from a formulary perspective. We are in a unique position given the data and the label that we basically have with Jardiance. And as I have previously shared, even prior to us getting the label, our formulary positioning was very strong. So just to give a sense, we have nearly 90% access on commercial plans and about 70% in Part D. And we showed that's a very strong position for us. The issue with the 2 class for the most part is being contracted as one of two type contracts, so these are not sole exclusive contracts. We, of course, we're advocates for open access and, at this point in time, we are excited about the early trends that we're seeing for our products. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : And that would be Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Mr. Fernandez, your line is open, if you have a question. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Sorry. I was on mute. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. First, on abemaciclib, can you guys talk a little bit about what you think is a differentiated response rate in the setting, whether it be for MONARCH-3? Again, my understanding is that we're seeing in combination with aromatase inhibitors response rates between 52% and 55%. So it seems like the response rate dynamic is something that you're focusing in on. Love to just better understand what you see as a uniquely meaningful response rate, or if you're really just focused on the monotherapy response rate that you see with abemaciclib and we already knew. The second question. When I look at the revenue that was generated relative to the scripts for Basaglar, it certainly came in a bit below our expectations. Just trying to get a better sense of what the dynamics are in that market, in particular, that would have the revenue come in below those expectations. And that's also factoring in the stocking that occurred in the fourth quarter, so I don't see that as a full explanation. And then lastly, in terms of the dynamics with baricitinib, some of the questions that we get from investors are the reasons why Lilly chose to incorporate the language in the press release with regard to its disagreement with the Agency. That seems to imply that Lilly will pursue all avenues before being forced to do additional clinical studies. So just trying to get a better sense of why you chose to incorporate that language into the press release. Thanks so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, Seamus. Thanks for the questions. So, Sue, we'll start with you for abemaciclib, then the question on overall response rate, Enrique for Basaglar revenue here in the U.S. relative to scripts. And then, Christi, your first question on baricitinib and the language we had in the press release. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. I think, again, I'll back to I think it's going to be really important when we look at the totality of the data as we look at the trials across multiple trials with the CDK4 and 6 inhibitors and we look at the magnitude and the depth of response, which is a key secondary endpoint that we had in our studies as well as, as we said, the PFS and the totality of the data. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So, Seamus, as I look at it, destocking does in our view basically explain the difference. Revenue for us and given the script level is basically tracking as we had expected. I think it's important as we look at this product, we are clearly right now north of 20% when it comes to NBRx share. Importantly, a big part of that is driven by switches, as we've seen different payers take or choose Basaglar as an exclusive option. But I think what we're also encouraged is when we look at basically new patients to a basal insulin, we also see our share basically improving. We're now at 7% on that specific metric. So we are very encouraged for what we see. And at this point in time, we do think that the revenue and scripts are aligned based on what we had expected. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: All right. Thank you, Enrique. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think what you read is exactly right regarding bari. We continue to believe in the risk-benefit profile of baricitinib at the four and two milligram. And what we need to do next is really get with FDA and understand specifically what their concerns are. So the answer is, yes, we disagree. But we want to meet with them and make sure that we understand completely and see if we can find a path forward quickly to allow patients that are suffering access to baricitinib. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Christi. And before we go to the next caller, Seamus, I believe the numbers that you're citing for overall response rate are, in fact, for those patients with measurable disease. Just to highlight that when you see data from our trials, make sure that you're looking at a similar patient population and cut of the data. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : That will be Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, team. One two-parter here. First, when you announced the bari delay, you reiterated your 5% revenue growth goal. My question is, since it will be harder to get there without bari and assuming that doesn't show up in that timeframe, what are the caveats that you would offer in terms of reaching that goal without bari other than the Alimta caveat you've mentioned before? So hoping for a little bit more granularity underpinning your confidence in achieving that. And secondly, on Animal Health, can you go a little bit deeper into the trends in the quarter, perhaps with and without acquisition? And, Jeff, any sort of headwinds/tailwinds you'd want us to understand in the quarter and as it relates for the rest of the year for your business? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Gregg, thank you for the questions. Derica, we'll start out with you for the long-term growth question. And over to you, Jeff, for the Animal Health question. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Good morning, Gregg. And thanks for your question. As it relates to the mid-term guidance of achieving a minimum of 5% on average revenue growth between 2016 and the end of the decade, there are no new additional caveats that I can offer, Gregg. We feel as confident about achieving that goal today as we did when we put that guidance out last year in July. Recall that we've always said that the growth prospects for Lilly did not reside or rest on a single asset. It really is about the strength across the portfolio of opportunities that we talked about. And up to now, we launched seven new products, and eight if you include Olumiant in Europe. So we feel very good about our growth prospects going forward. And we factored in that we may not always have 100% success across each molecule. But in aggregate, we are very confident we can achieve that minimum 5% goal. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Derica. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, Gregg, on Animal Health, a few comments. First of all, as we signaled earlier this year, and as Q1 indicates, we anticipate growth for the year will be back-half loaded. This is due to some one-time events in Q1 as well as our SAP 2016 implementation, which will impact Q2. As such, though, although Q1 was a little lighter than expected, we anticipate improving growth trends later this year. What will drive that, Gregg, is really few things. First of all, launches. We're seeing good uptake initially here with Galliprant, our deal with Aratana, as well as we got some launches in aquaculture. Secondly, is companion animals, some share shift, and then on the food animal side, vaccines. So that will be the drivers of our second half return to growth. We continue to be excited about the BI acquisition, and that's progressing well. I also would say, finally, we continue to progress our strategic agenda, focusing on our key growth engines, which we've talked a lot about in vaccines, nutritionals and companion animal therapeutics. The integration of BI, again, is going well and that's on track. And we've completed the scale of our Dundee, Scotland manufacturing site to Argenta as part of our broader manufacturing agenda. So overall industry, I think the things to watch, I think the fundamentals for the medium and long term are still strong with the trends with durable brands. I think the things to watch, innovation is representing an increasing amount of growth and becoming increasingly important. We're not seeing, for instance, in food animal as much innovation so that segment has not grown as much. And I think in the slower growth segments we're seeing, of course, increasing competitive pressures. So those are some things I think to watch going forward. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: We can go to our next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go to Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. A couple of questions. You obviously showed some very significant improvement in your gross margin during the quarter, (38:12) manufacturing efficiencies. Could you just separate out mix versus manufacturing? And then within manufacturing, procurement yield and so on to help us understand how far those will go here? And then second, on Jardiance. Could you just outline the rate limiting steps for this product, both in terms of class awareness and obviously the pending CANVAS data to grow the awareness of the class? And then secondly, in terms of education of physicians, the potential advantages, what can be done by you in order to break down barriers to accelerate uptake? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Andrew, thank you for the questions. Derica, we'll go to you for the question on the gross margin percent and then Enrique for the Jardiance questions. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Andrew. And this question I really have to give kudos to our manufacturing team. The gross margin improvement is really driven by lowering our per unit cost. It's not due to mix effect and that means that it should be sustainable going forward. Do recall also that in the second half of the year, you're going to see negative pressure on our gross margins because we began to feel the impact of the next round of patent expiries. So we will have lost Strattera and Effient in the U.S. So that's what brings down the drag that we expect in the second half. But, again, what's helping us to weather that is by the manufacturing team absolutely reducing our per unit costs. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Let me first provide a little bit of color on Jardiance and what we're seeing since the launch of our cardiovascular indication. As you know, we received that indication in December and we launched in mid-January. Since we've launched that indication, we have seen a significant inflection on new patient starts for Jardiance. So just in three months, we've seen a 70%, 70%, increase on new patient starts. That class overall has grown about 30%, which has driven now the class to basically reaccelerate when it comes to new patient starts. The class was actually quite flat before this indication. As we look at the four-week growth versus the previous year, we're now at 16%. So we are encouraged in terms of what we're seeing with Jardiance. Now, clearly, we are in a certain way, it is a paradigm shift when it comes to treating diabetes, in particular, the risk of death for people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. And, for us, therefore, peer-to-peer is hugely important. That's something that we've been quite focused on. We are very excited by our level of activity and interest and attendance to these peer-to-peer sessions. But all-in-all, we are pleased with our progress and we expect more. There are lots of questions when it comes to the outcomes from Canvas. We basically see, maybe, generally, three types of outcomes. Let me just outline them. But, clearly, if outcomes were to be a negative, a neutral trial when it comes to CV, that probably would be the worst outcome for us. We clearly believe that our data is highly compelling. But, clearly, we could benefit from that tailwind of having another SGLT2 basically have this similar data. If their data is positive but is not as positive as ours, that's probably the best-case scenario for us. But it's also quite positive if their data looks similar to us. We clearly have a lot of momentum with our product, so we are hoping that they have a positive trial and are waiting to see what the results are. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : And we'll go to John Boris, SunTrust. Please go ahead. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. In light of the successful launch of Basaglar across your diabetes franchise, strategically is this a consideration to partner with other companies for biosimilars across possibly oncology or possibly across your immunology franchise with a product like Humira? Second question on productivity gains. For Derica, what have you learned about YZ that makes you confident as you prepare for another loss of exclusivity in 2018 for Cialis that you're prepared to navigate through that? And any qualitative commentary you can give on the consensus earnings growth of 7% in 2018? I know you haven't given guidance there, but certainly a topical question. And then lastly, on Jardiance. Certainly the product had some pretty significant renal benefits. Are you doing anything with the Agency to further quantify the benefits for the Agency to possibly go back to them to try and secure that within the label of Jardiance? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, John. Thank you for the questions. We'll go to Dave for the question on our interest in moving more into biosimilars, Derica for the productivity question, what we learned in YZ that can help for next year with 2018. And then Enrique for the Jardiance renal question. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks. Thanks, John. Well, I think we've addressed this question before, but just to reiterate. Basaglar is a great fit for us because we already have an asset base to make the product, we have a commercial investment that can sell the product and we have devices that are world-class that the product goes in. So it's really a drop-in to a broader insulin play and rounds out an important part of the portfolio we weren't participating in, which is the innovative basal segment, which is obviously a big segment of the diabetes market. But our core strategy in diabetes is to innovate above and beyond the benefits of glargine in basal insulin as it is all other therapies. And that's really the same as our other therapy areas, oncology, immunology. Our main focus is on innovation to beat the standard of care today for something better for patients. If those same dynamics played out for a TNF biosimilar or something else, sure, we'd look at it. When you can get a lot of leverage financially and it tucks into your portfolio, that can make good sense. But we don't have a broad-based division associated with biosimilars work. We're not pursuing that at this moment. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, John. With regards to learnings from our YZ experience, the biggest difference is the fact that with this next wave of patent expiries we are able to offset that with new product launches. When we launched our four largest products during that YZ period, we did not have any new product launches during that period. So the real key is having new product launches. And then that's really contingent on our ability to sustain the flow of R&D output. So you'll see we're very committed to that. And that's why you saw us announce the CoLucid deal earlier this quarter, which is, again, another increased effort in bolstering our late-phase pipeline. And then the third learning is just having a sustained productivity agenda. That's why we came out in 2015 in saying, hey \u2013 or actually in 2012, we believe we can get to that 50% water mark in 2018 in terms of OpEx as a percent of revenue. We said that we can improve our gross margins between 2015 and 2020. And while we set the 50% water mark for 2018, we're not resting on our laurels thinking that's the end of the journey. We think we can improve beyond that. We just haven't put those statements out there at this point in time. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Derica. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So, clearly, the renal data for Jardiance is quite encouraging. As we had a number of discussions with the regulatory authorities, it is pretty clear that for us to be able to make a claim, it is quite likely that we will need to do an additional trial. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Enrique. John, if we could go to next caller, please? Operator : And that will be Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Just a few questions. This is to Dave and Derica. Is it safe to assume that in reiterating your medium-term guidance out to 2020 that you do ascribe some value to baricitinib? Or, Derica, you also just said that Lilly's not dependent on any one single product but a portfolio of products. So if you could clarify that. Secondly, just curious to know your plans for baricitinib in the other indications such as AD, lupus, psoriatic arthritis. I know those are studies that are still early, Phase 2. Are those indications on hold until pending positive resolution on RA, or is it possible that you would go ahead with those plans? Is there a scenario where you decide not to go further with that RA if FDA is requiring large trials that would be expensive and might mean being no longer the first and best-in-class drug on the market? And then just lastly, Dave, solanezumab, unfortunately, that was a very expensive setback, but that happens. Now we have the baricitinib setback. At what point can you justify to yourself a much more substantial restructuring initiative that really focuses on the company's cost structure? Yes, we acknowledge this quarter we did see good operating margin improvement. But going out and looking at where Lilly's margins are today relative to the industry average, you've got a long way to go to reach parity. So just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that and at what point you actually start to get more aggressive on the margin side. Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Jami. Thanks for your questions. So we'll have Derica address the medium-term outlook as it relates to baricitinib and clarify our thoughts there. And then, Christi, we'll have you talk about further indications for baricitinib. And then, Dave, the question we got on the longer-term outlook. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Jami. In regard to our mid-term guidance and the relevance of bari in the U.S., absolutely we are planning for success of that molecule. And we have not given up on the prospect of that opportunity. So as Christi said earlier, we're looking forward to engaging with the FDA and we'll work diligently to try to find a pathway forward to bring that molecule to patients here in the U.S. That being said, that guidance that we put out there around the 5%, that's what we believe to be the minimum performance that we thought we could achieve. What we didn't do is provide what we thought was the maximum what we could achieve. Even taking into account the impact of bari, we still believe we could stay above that 5% minimum goal that we established in terms of average growth between 2015 and 2020. So, again, our confidence is still very high in our ability to achieve that objective. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So, the first question I'll take is the one on rheumatoid arthritis. We have not contemplated a scenario in which we will not pursue baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis. We continue to believe, as I said, in the safety benefit-risk profile. Of note I think it's important to say that the submission that we had in Europe was exactly the same as that we had in the United States. And we stand behind the European decision and the label that they granted. As we look at other studies and clinical studies, we actually are continuing those. Obviously, we'll take into account our discussions with the FDA. But we are looking at continuing those studies and starting a Phase 3 trial in psoriatic arthritis by the end of this year. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Christi. And, Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Sure. Thanks. I think, Jami, your question is, if I heard it right, is would we undertake some very large cost restructuring programs and sort of make a one-time move in operating margins. Right now, under the scenario we see and per the discussion we also had with Derica today, we see a continuous top-line revenue growth driven by new products. And the kind of performance we put up in Q1, if we just compound that out I think will yield impressive margin gains. Reminding people 7% top line, 3% cost curve, yielding 18% income growth. I think if we compound that over the next several years, you'll be (51:50) top-tier financial performance out of Lilly. Ad that's where we're focused on rather than try to have some disruptive event that would perhaps set us back in terms of revenue growth and our R&D productivity. So right now that's what we're focused on. Of course, we have scenarios, as Derica described, that have different mixes of products that get us to that 5% average top line, some that get us well above it. We're very comfortable with that guidance now. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just to be clear, Dave, the improvement in operating margin is highly dependent on top-line growth and top-line mix as opposed to any cuts to operating expenses? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. It's primarily based on a topline growth, that's right. If you do the math, there are targeted cost reductions, which have been and we'll continue to undertake, to reshape the company and make it as competitive as it needs to be as well as service the R&D engine as well us the launches that are underway. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: You're welcome. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : And we'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. A few questions. First on Jardiance. Would you speak specifically to the disconnect between revenue and scripts in Q1? I'm not sure that was fully explained. Secondly, I appreciate that you have not met with FDA yet on baricitinib. But based solely on what's in the CRL and Lilly's interpretation of it, when would Lilly be in a position to answer FDA questions? Would that be a 2017 event or a 2018 event? And then lastly, would you elaborate on the dynamics around the JUNIPER trial of abemaciclib in lung cancer? The primary completion has moved a couple times now. One interpretation could be that Lilly is cutting its losses and giving up. But maybe you can clarify. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, over to you for the Jardiance question on the disconnect between TRx and revenue. Christi, for the question on the baricitinib complete response letter. And over to Sue for the JUNIPER study with abemaciclib for lung cancer. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Well, we don't think there's a disconnect between TRx and revenue. The quarter for Jardiance was pretty clean, so we didn't have changes in estimates when it comes to rebates and discounts. Let's recall, and of course, in the case of Jardiance, we share 50/50 the gross margin for the product with BI the way basically what we book as revenue. And right now I think it's fair to say that the current revenue basically is a good reflection of the underlying scripts. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. In terms of the bari timing, it's really, we can't give you an estimate on whether it's this year or next year until we meet with the FDA, which we are hoping we will do within the next 60 days. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Christi, thank you very much. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. With regards to the JUNIPER study, we are continuing with that study and very interested in the role of CDK4 and CDK6 in KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer. We have made some changes to the study to ensure enrollment and to ensure that it hits the high bar given the changes that we've seen in FDA guidance and labeling on erlotinib, but we continue that study and are actively enrolling it. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. John, next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Just had two questions here, both on diabetes. Maybe first on Humalog. With biosimilars coming to market in 2018, 2019, can you really compare and contrast some of the dynamics of the rapid-acting market versus what we're just seeing right now with the basal market where you've launched Basaglar and it's done very well from a share perspective? And the second question was more broadly just discussing longer-term, your latest longer-term views on diabetes pricing. There seems to be concerns about a market that's been in flux over the past few years. Lilly has obviously benefited from its broader portfolio, but your competitors have struggled. So, of course, just longer term, do you see the pricing dynamics continuing to erode or even get worse? Or could we see dynamics stabilize a bit here as we've gone through at least a few of these categories pretty aggressive price competition? Does that at some point stabilize, or are you preparing for an environment where things continue to be challenging? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Chris, for the questions. Enrique, they're both for you. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So the first question is an interesting one because, clearly, we are on both sides of that equation. So you can imagine, we're going to take all the learnings of the launch of Basaglar as we think about how do we ensure that we protect our Humalog franchise. It is fair to say that Humalog has slightly different make up in terms of \u2013 we think of the product, as you know, it's not just rapid-acting, but it's also the mixtures, which are about 30% of volume. Clearly, we do have a strong position when it comes to payers. And importantly, the contracting already is on exclusive status for really meal-time insulins across all of the major plans. That is different from the type of contracting when it comes to basal insulins where basically we had a number of products in formulary. So any time that you basically narrow the formulary, there's an opportunity for a payer to have an economic benefit from a larger rebate. So the dynamics are a little bit different. We clearly are preparing and thinking through that. And I won't be able to comment more on that. But I do think that our position with Humalog is quite strong. When it comes to diabetes pricing, what we basically see is a continuation of the current trends. So we don't see significant step changes. We basically see at this point in time different classes are in different stages. As I just mentioned, meal time insulins, we are basically \u2013 all major plans have made a one-on-one exclusive-type decision when it comes to a meal time insulin. But SGLT2s, there's one of two status for most plans. GLP-1s is something similar. So we basically see is a continuation of trends rather than a step change. Clearly, we are pretty well positioned given the breadth of our portfolio and really strong share and momentum that we have with our product, which is key as different payers make the formulary decisions. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : We'll go to Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. On Taltz, I wonder if you can talk about the new-to-brand share trends in the U.S., say, over the past six months. Are there many plans that you're still have don't have formulary status in? And then in Europe, can you speak to countries that you expect to come on board fully for this calendar year? And then on baricitinib. I know it's hard to say, but were extension studies for all the pivotals part of the filing? I'm just trying to figure out what data haven't yet been submitted or analysis not yet done that you could add that would be new to the CRL. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Geoff. Thank you very much. Christi, if you want to take the first question on the Taltz new-to-brand trends. And feel free if you want to try the second question, we're happy to help with that one as well. Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So, coming new to Lilly, obviously the data we saw in Taltz in these studies plays out in the marketplace. It's really remarkable, the PASI 100 data and how physicians are seeing the benefits play out with patients in their offices. And that's what's really leading to the NBRx share gains and growth. The growth continues. As you probably know, we passed Enbrel early last year. We passed Cosentyx later in the year. We continue to believe that the IL-17s are the best-in-class and a huge market opportunity for us as we close the NBRx share on Stelara. And that, in spite of not having a lot of formulary access with all of the payers. So we continue to work on that. So, yes, there is opportunity to grow in that area. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: In terms of the data that was submitted, Geoff. So there were data obviously from the four pivotal studies as well as from data (1:01:05) over the course of the review from the extension study. There is additional data that we have generated in the extension study that we have not submitted to the FDA. As Christi talked about earlier, we'll look forward to meeting with the FDA here in the next 60 days or so to see if any of the additional data that we have could be helpful to them in their consideration of the safety concerns that they raise in the complete response letter. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Sure. We'll go to Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes. Thanks very much and good morning. Two brief questions. Sue, Cyramza in Japan has been perhaps the better geographic growth driver for the product. However, in quarter-over-quarter, it does look as if it had peaked in Q4. And I'm curious if that is, in fact, the case being down in Q1? And, Enrique, again, back to I guess back to Steve Scala's question on Jardiance. Also, or similarly, the Q4 to Q1, at least Lilly's share of the growth profit is effectively flat and slightly down. Is it because demand is in a lower revenue-generating channel, for example, perhaps more Medicaid patients are being prescribed your product that maybe those from managed care? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Tony, thanks for the question. Sue for the Cyramza Japan question and then Enrique for the Jardiance follow up. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Tony. Thanks very much for the question on Cyramza in Japan. You're right, it is going very well in Japan. The quarter-on-quarter is just the timing. If you look at last year, you would have seen the same dynamics. What we are continuing to see is strong growth of Cyramza in Japan. And the gastric cancer indication right now has a market share of 57%. In fact, I think Cyramza is one of the most successful oncology launches now in Japan. We also are now seeing uptake in both the lung and the colorectal cancer indications. There's quite a high level \u2013 as you know, the prevalence in Japan of gastric cancer is a lot higher than the U.S. and we are seeing a lot of overlap between uses of Cyramza in gastric cancer and those that treat colorectal cancer. And so we see a good opportunity for uptake in that indication, too. We're currently seeing that and also in lung. So we feel very good about the continued uptake of Cyramza in Japan. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Sue. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, there's really not an issue when it comes, Tony, to segment mix. We had in Q4 of 2016 a positive benefit, roughly about $15 million worth of Lilly revenue due to changes in the estimates of rebates, discounts and co-pay cards. So that's basically why that comparison doesn't follow the script trend. If anything, we should see basically improved pricing when it comes to Jardiance just because we made some changes to our co-pay cards. So we are going to be less reliant on them as time goes through. So that should basically give us some benefit over time when it comes to the nebulized prices that we see. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : And that will be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David, your line is open, if you're on mute maybe? David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, I'm restrained, as many of my peers. And instead, Phil, I'll follow your instructions and ask two questions. First, Dave, could you please discuss near-term M&A opportunities to acquire small biotech companies with new launch prospects in order to enhance your new launch pipeline flow late decade? And then second, Enrique, I was actually surprised with Jardiance that, given its extraordinary cardiovascular benefit, which is actually better than many drugs that are solely approved for cardiovascular disease, I would have thought that Lilly would have gone to payers and said to payers, we need to reduce our rebate payments to you. Obviously, from an ethical standpoint, Jardiance has to be tier two irrespective of rebates. And so I guess I'm just hoping that you could provide a little bit more color on why Lilly has to enhance rebates for such an extraordinary drug? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Dave. Thank you for the two questions. Dave, we'll go to you for the near-term M&A question and back to Enrique for the Jardiance question. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Well, our posture on M&A really hasn't changed. It's a top priority for deployment of capital. Of course, we are very interested in targets that would enhance our position, whether it be pipeline or otherwise, in oncology, in diabetes, in immunology or in Alzheimer's or pain. When we've seen those things, we've moved quickly. I think CoLucid is an example of that. The reality in the world, though, is, I think, that there are constraints. And one of them is pricing. We're not the only company looking for these assets. The other is strategic fit. We're going to be disciplined to stick to therapeutic areas where we have an ongoing interest. We think this is where we have information advantage and we want to trade on that. And then I think the asset fit within our pipeline, when we're talking about pipeline assets, we seek to acquire things that can be producing interesting combinations or fill gaps. So we're very focused on this space. Obviously, we had one transaction in Q1. I hope we can find more like it because we see a lot of value in CoLucid as an example. It's a top priority for me and we continue to scour the planet for good opportunities to add to Lilly's growth story. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. I agree that the Jardiance is indeed compelling value for payers. I'm unable to discuss what our rebate strategy is on this forum. But I think it's important. We do have some \u2013 there's, of course, public knowledge when it comes to, for example, Germany and Japan. And in both of those cases, in the case of Germany, we have a new price, a higher price for Jardiance based on the indication. And in the case of Japan, we did not get the price cut. We got a minor \u2013 a positive price adjustment. But, yes, we do believe that this product offers compelling value to payers and to patients. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : And that would be Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask directly, do you think you need a new trial for bari, number one? And, number two, in a scenario \u2013 let's say, there is a scenario where only two milligram dose is approved, do you think bari will be able to get the head-to-head label versus Humira on label? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: What was the question, Umer? I'm not sure if you cut out or if that was two questions. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : I'm so sorry. So let me try again. First of all, I just wanted to ask directly, do you think you need a new trial on bari? And, number two, in a scenario where only two milligram dose is approved, do you think you'll be able to get the superiority language versus Humira on label? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Christi, would you like to handle this? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So we don't know what we'll need until we actually meet with the FDA. As I said before, we believe in the benefit-risk profile of the four milligrams and the two milligrams across dosage groups. And that's what we continue to see with the data. And we want to make sure that what we provide to the marketplace is something that is effective and safe for the patients that it serves. So, right now, we're looking at a four-milligram and two-milligram and open to the discussions with the FDA. And we'll see how they go and get back to you after that. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Christi. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: And just as a reminder, the R&D study just had the four milligram in it against Humira. So I think if that's your question, just remind the group that that was the only dose studied in that particular (1:10:10) analysis. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Thanks, Dave. John, next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you, folks, for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been asked. A couple more for Enrique in diabetes. First, on Humalog. How comfortable are you about the sustainability of the exclusive arrangements that you have with payers? Because the economic benefit that you mentioned from the rebates, that's obviously has come under increased scrutiny. So what are the risks there? And then following up, obviously Trulicity is doing well. What is your competitive outlook on the GLP-1 class, particularly from the oral GLP-1 in Phase 3 from Novo? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Alex, thank you very much for the questions. Enrique, again to you. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So, clearly as we contract with payers, it's not only the economic benefit, but of course all of the clinical benefits of each one of the products. In the case of Humalog, it's always difficult to say as we go through the contract in season. But I think what we can say is, as we looked at historically, once a payer has made a decision on a particular product, basically once it comes time to renew, they typically have continued with that choice that they initially made, in particular when there are not new entrants basically coming in to the mix. So we see this not only in diabetes, but I think in other therapeutic classes. As you can imagine, if we have a market where we have two major players, in this particular case maybe Lilly and Novo, and we were in dual status and we go to exclusive status, you are switching 50% of the patients. But once somebody is on exclusive status, now you basically \u2013 the disruption is significantly higher. And clearly, the economics from a benefit of the rebate perspective are really not going to be there because they are already getting basically top exclusive rights. When it comes to Trulicity, clearly the product is doing extremely well. We are very excited about the overall growth of the class. So we see significant expansion of the GLP-1 class continuing. And of course, Trulicity has superior share performance within that class. We do see additional competition coming in both \u2013 when it comes to semaglutide as well as the oral GLP-1. Of course, we need to wait for additional data. What type of label will these products get. Clearly, the efficacy of sema is, we believe, very good but they also had a signal when it comes to retinopathy. So we need to see what is the label going to look like because we do think that it's not just efficacy but the entire profile. And finally, one of the great benefits that Trulicity I think is offering is we basically feel that Trulicity is almost redefining the first injection experience because patients don't have to touch the needle or see the needle. In a certain way, the feedback that we get from the experience I think is just fantastic. We've said that we are interested in oral GLP-1, and that's something that we're actively working on. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Enrique. John, next caller, please. Operator : And that will be Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks so much. So one just follow-up on the diabetes side. Can you give us a sense of the share now for the SGLT2s and the GLP-1s that's coming from primary care physicians as opposed to specialists? I guess if you want to throw the DPP-4s in there as well, that'd be helpful. And then my second question, just on the 2017 guidance, just wanted to clarify. I believe you have not incorporated any expectations around the potential approval from KEYNOTE-021G for Alimta in combination with carbo and Keytruda. Can you just confirm that's correct and would that then be upside if that approval does come next month? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay, Vamil. Thank you very much for the questions. Enrique, if you'd like to handle the question with regard to split between PCP and specialists for SGLT2s and DPP-4s as well, if you have it. And then, Derica, any comment you have on how the KEYNOTE-021G approval, if that comes through, how it could impact our expectations for 2017. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, so when it comes to orals and SGLT2s and DPP-4s are pretty alike. We basically see primary care basically driving about 80% of the overall scripts. Now, one thing that we've been watching is basically, what about cardiologists. And what we basically see that is while cardiologists, in the case of Jardiance, are a significant source of authority. And while we have seen an increase, the base of prescribing is extremely, extremely small. I don't have the actual split for the GLP-1s, and I'm cautious about making it because that class has been evolving very, very quickly. And what we basically see is huge growth when it comes to primary care right now. But that class used to be about 50/50. And we'll provide the specifics of where we are now. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: In regards to the guidance, as you saw in our press release and in our remarks here this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2017. As it relates to the KEYNOTE data, we're excited about the data itself. We look forward to hearing the feedback and the outcome with the discussions with the FDA. Clearly, if it's positive, it would go to support that guidance. But when we put our guidance together, we contemplate, again, as I stated earlier, a number of various scenarios that we will have to contend with, whether it's over the next 12 months in terms of our annual guidance or as it relates to our mid to longer-term guidance when we're talking about the 5%. And this would be just one of those additional scenarios that's factored in. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. John, next caller, please. Operator : That will be Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Sue, can you talk about how your oncology strategy's evolved? And what are the key Phase 2 assets we should be focused on? And then second, just on Animal Health, can you tell us what was the impact of the BI sales in the quarter of the acquisition? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hey, Marc, thank you for the question. Sue, for the oncology strategy question and highlights on Phase 2 assets. And then, Jeff, back to you for a commentary on the impact of the BI Vetmedica acquisition and the results for quarter. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question. Clearly, as we're looking at our strategy, the oncology environment is changing pretty rapidly and we want to make sure that as we're looking at agents, that we're bringing through really agents that are standard of care change or have potential to be standard of care change and to be foundational agents. We believe that we have a number of those. We just launched Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma, which is the first agent that has been approved to show an overall survival advantage over standard care in 40 years, and showing an improvement of 12 months nearly in soft tissue sarcoma. So I think that is one that we can say clearly has the potential standard of care changing and foundational. We have abemaciclib data that we're excited about, too. We have a number of assets in our portfolio. We're actually currently going through a strategy review and prioritization which we are looking forward to giving you more details on over the next months. There are a number of agents that we're excited by. I think that we look at our checkpoint inhibitor, prexasertib. Data on that is pretty exciting and you should see more on that coming through over the next few months as you see how we're continuing to develop that further. With regards to our ERK inhibitor, we're pretty excited about that, too. That's in Phase 1 at the moment. And we also have a potential combination options with our PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and abemaciclib. So you're going to see more as we continue to roll out our prioritization of our portfolio. We have a number of assets in our portfolio now. What we want to do is really focus on those ones that have the potential to be foundational standard of care changing and have rapid development of those. And that's where our focus is. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Sue. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, on the impact of the BI, we sold $40.8 million in the first quarter. That's aligned with our plans. And again, as mentioned in the results, we were up 2% with the impact of BI. Without it, it was minus 3%. Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: And just, Marc, overall, if you saw from our prepared remarks, that Vetmedica added about 30 basis points of our overall 8% volume growth in the quarter. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. John, next question, please? Operator : And we'll go to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, clearly, Trulicity has been having a great launch and is expected to going forward. But I get a lot of questions from investors just around sustainability of pricing in the GLP-1 segment. So just maybe ask you to gaze into crystal ball a little bit through maybe the upcoming contracting and one or two years out, how you just see that potentially being different from the insulin markets, obviously where pricing pressure's been a bit more difficult. And then the second question, just really going back to baricitinib a little bit and the clinical trial design there. There is quite a lot of crossover in some of those clinical trials and up and down dosing. Just wanted to get any feedback that you can potentially give us on how comfortable the FDA was with that design right from the outset and whether any of this crossover and up and down dosing in the trials was potentially discussed at mid-cycle review? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hey, Jeff, thank you for the questions. Enrique, if you'll comment on Trulicity pricing question. And then, Dave, do you want to take the question for the baricitinib trial time? Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Just on Trulicity. First, our access right now is outstanding. I think it reflects the \u2013 given the clinical and business performance of the product, Trulicity is now basically added in most plans. So our access in both commercial and Part D is north of 80%. Unfortunately, I'm unable to provide forward-looking expectations in terms of pricing. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Enrique, thank you. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, and just briefly on baricitinib. You're correct in saying that the program had a number of step ups after the initial placebo-controlled phases. So many patients moved from two to four milligrams or placebo to four (1:21:50) standard in RA studies. And we also in the long-term study everyone rolled into, we had a step-down feature. So we have a lot of data about two versus four, and we look forward to talking to the FDA more about that data in the coming weeks and days. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. John, next caller, please. Operator : And we actually have no further questions in queue. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Let me just give a few seconds to see if someone wants to queue. If not, we'll go to close. So let's give a couple seconds for that, please. Did anyone queue, John? Operator : No further questions coming in. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you very much. Dave, would you like to go ahead and close out the call? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Thanks, Phil. We participate your participation in today's earnings call and interest in the Eli Lilly & Company. As we've discussed before, Lilly is entering a period of growth driven by new product launches. The diversity in our portfolio, our top-line growth prospect and the opportunity for margin expansions over the balance of the decade provide a compelling thesis for investors. I look forward to our continued interactions and keep you informed of our progress. Please follow up with our IR team if you have any questions we didn't address today. Thanks again. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

For the conference, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operation Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now over to Mr. Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's second quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA; Dr. Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Dr. Levi Garraway, Senior Vice President of Oncology Global Development and Medical Affairs; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines and Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health. We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of our IR team. Today we'll cover our usual quarterly content in an abbreviated form. That will free up time for Sue and Levi to walk you through an update on our oncology strategy. We believe the increased clarity and focus that is part of our revised strategy will make us more competitive in this key therapeutic area. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. I'll start by summarizing the quarter. In Q2 we generated worldwide revenue growth of 8%, driven by volume growth in our human pharmaceutical business, once again led by our new products. We also continue to expand our margins. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by over 90 basis points and total operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined by over 390 basis points to 50.8%. We continue to make progress with our pipeline. Highlights include the Japan approval for Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis. The FDA granted priority review to abemaciclib in advanced breast cancer and Fast Track status to tanezumab for chronic OA and low back pain. We presented detailed data from our Phase 3 studies of galcanezumab for migraine prevention, and for abemaciclib we presented detailed data from our Phase 3 MONARCH 2 study and announced initiation of a pivotal study in the adjuvant setting that has now begun. In terms of capital deployment, just yesterday we announced an alliance with Nektar Therapeutics to develop and commercialize NKTR-358, a novel immunological therapy for the potential treatment of a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions. We announced a collaboration with KeyBioscience on a potential new class of treatments for metabolic disorders which closed earlier this month. And we returned over $700 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and our dividend. In other news, we received an important ruling from the UK Supreme Court upholding our Alimta method of use patents in four major European countries and we also reached a settlement with generic companies that will provide exclusivity for Cialis until at least September 2018. Our continued progress in 2017 keeps us on track to achieve our midterm goals for each of our strategic objectives. Slides 5 and 6 contain more details on this these events as well as other events of note that occurred since our April earnings call. I'd highlight that earlier this morning we issued a press release to provide an update on our meeting with the FDA to discuss the baricitinib complete response letter. The FDA has indicated that an additional clinical study is necessary for resubmission in order to further characterize the benefit-risk across doses in light of an observed imbalance in thromboembolic events that occurred during the placebo-controlled period of the RA clinical program. We disagree with the FDA's conclusions and believe the comprehensive clinical data demonstrate there is a positive benefit-risk profile that supports baricitinib's approval as a new treatment option for people suffering from RA in the United States. In the European Union where baricitinib 2 milligrams and 4 milligrams have been approved since February of 2017, the CHMP recently agreed to update the label with a precaution for patients who have risk factors for DBT and PE. In Japan where baricitinib was also recently approved, the label includes a similar precaution. Along with Incyte, we are evaluating options for resubmitting, including further discussions with the FDA or conducting an additional clinical study. The time to resubmission will depend on which option we pursue but is expected to be a minimum of 18 months. We are disappointed that resubmission will be delayed, but we are committed to bringing baricitinib to people with RA here in the US. We're also committed to a robust life cycle plan for baricitinib as we see great potential in a number of other indications. Moving to our financial results, slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you can see revenue increase of 8% that I mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 76.7%. This increase was driven by higher realized prices and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by the negative effect of product mix and higher expenses to support new pharmaceutical products. Total operating expense was flat to Q2 2016, with marketing, selling and administrative expenses increasing 5% and R&D expenses decreasing 6%. The increase in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses was driven by higher spending to support new products, partially offset by lower spending on later life cycle products. The decrease in R&D expenses was driven by a milestone payment in last year's quarter. Excluding this milestone payment, R&D expenses increased less than 2%. Other income and expense was a $4 million expense this quarter, compared to income of $21 million in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 21.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. At the bottom line, net income increased 30%, and earnings per share increased 29%. We achieved this significant earnings growth by delivering high single-digit volume-based revenue growth while improving our gross margin percent and significantly reducing our OpEx ratio, creating positive leverage. Slide 10 details the same non-GAAP measures for June year-to-date, while slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 35 and 36. Moving to slide 12, let's take a look at the effects of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. Effective foreign exchange was minimal this quarter. Excluding the slight headwind from FX our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 9%, and was driven by volume, followed by price. It's worth noting that in our human pharma business each major geography drove volume growth this quarter. By geography, you'll notice that the U.S. pharmaceutical business increased 19%, driven by both price and volume. Price growth was primarily driven by our late life cycle products, Cialis and Forteo while Trulicity was the main driver of U.S. volume growth with meaningful contributions also coming from Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo. Excluding FX, European pharma revenue growth was 4% driven entirely by volume, despite significant headwinds on Alimta. Excluding Alimta, the rest of our European pharma revenue grew 10% on a performance basis led by Trulicity. In Japan, despite a large negative impact from the entry of generic Zyprexa last June, pharma revenue increased 2%. Excluding Zyprexa, the rest of our Japan pharma revenue grew 16% in Q2, led by Cyramza, Cymbalta and Trulicity. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% on a performance basis this quarter. Patent expirations for Cymbalta for several countries, including Canada, negatively affected RoW revenue growth. Excluding Cymbalta, rest of world pharma revenue increased 7% in performance terms, led by Humalog, Trulicity and Humulin. Turning to animal health, excluding the impact of FX, worldwide revenue decreased 8% driven by volume as price had a minimal impact. Food animal product revenue declined by 13% while companion animal product revenue increased 1%. Animal health revenue benefited from the addition of BI's U.S. vaccine business, but revenue growth was negatively affected by buying patterns ahead of an SAP cutover that increased revenue in Q2 of last year by $40 million. On a performance basis, excluding the BI vaccine acquisition and adjusting for last year's purchasing patterns, our animal health revenue decreased 13%, with similar declines in both food and companion animals. The food animal decline was primarily driven by market access pressure as well as by competitive pressures in cattle and swine. The companion animal decline was primarily driven by competitive pressures in the parasiticides market. Slide 13 outlines the same information for our June year-to-date results. As we've done in recent quarters, let's now take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on slide 14. In total, our new products comprised of Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, Portrazza and Olumiant were the engines of our worldwide volume growth. You can see these products drove 10.7 percentage points of volume growth. Lower Cialis volume provided a headwind of 120 basis points, primarily due to lower volume in the U.S. as a result of a decline in the overall ED market as well as increased use of off-label generic sildenafil, while lower animal health volume provided a headwind of 140 basis points. And the loss of exclusivity for Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista, Strattera and Axiron provided a drag of 280 basis points. Slide 15 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $1 billion in revenue this quarter, with nearly half of that by Trulicity. These products represented 18% of our total worldwide revenue in Q2, up from 15% just last quarter. Moving to slide 16, you'll see the changes in foreign exchange rates had a small effect on our Q2 2017 results. Growth in non-GAAP EPS was 29% including the effect of FX and 32% in constant currency terms. With that perspective on our Q2 financial results, I'll turn it over to Sue and Levi for an update on our oncology strategy. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Dave. As I mentioned during last quarter's earnings call Q&A, in the first half of this year we took a fresh look at our oncology R&D strategy. Having joined Lilly at the beginning of the year from Dana-Farber and Harvard, Levi played a key role in this review, providing a valuable new perspective, and we're pleased to have this opportunity today to share a summary of the output of our review. I'll start with an overview of the oncology trends that we felt we needed to address, and then I'll describe our R&D strategy at a high level and then I'll turn it over to Levi to delve into more detail. As we all know, despite many exciting advances, there remains significant unmet need in oncology, and many companies are pursuing this opportunity and the field is becoming intensely competitive. And with the financial pressures payers are facing, the pace of (14:16) innovation has increased. We recognize that we must provide drugs that deliver larger increases in survival than we've traditionally seen in the past, and we are adapting our approach to respond to these trends in order to deliver breakthrough innovation to patients. Moving to slide 19, our strategy has two pillars. The first is to build upon our key therapeutics that are already on the market or are nearing the market and that have the potential to be foundational agents. The second is to pursue new standard-of-care changing agents that clear a very high bar, and in a moment Levi will outline how we'll assess such potential. On the second pillar, I would like to highlight that we intend to pursue breakthrough molecules across a variety of mechanisms, including, but not limited to, immuno-oncology. Key to our efforts will be leveraging advances in scientific understanding to identify targets with a strong biological rationale, and we will focus on targets that attack human dependencies or overcome resistance, enriching the target population to drive a larger benefit. Let me say a few words on the first pillar of our strategy, because we have a solid base on which to build. In addition to Alimta and Erbitux, we have Cyramza, which is approved in three different tumor types and has become a standard-of-care in the treatment of gastric cancer with particularly some adoption in Japan. We hope to expand the use of Cyramza in gastric cancer (15:49) setting and to second line urothelial cancer, and we have Phase 3 trials that will read out this year and next to potentially expand Cyramza's indication into liver and first line idioform mutant (16:00) lung cancers. In addition, we've seen promising early data on the combination of Cyramza with pembrolizumab in lung cancer, which represents an interesting area for additional study. Lartruvo is a monochromal antibody that inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha. Added to doxorubicin, Lartruvo is the first medicine in more than four decades shown to help patients with soft tissue sarcoma live longer when compared to doxorubicin alone, by 11.8 months, an 80% improvement. We hope to extend the use of Lartruvo across additional lines of therapy for sarcoma, and in addition, we are studying Lartruvo in other cancer types. And lastly, abemaciclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK-4 and CDK-6. Abemaciclib was purposely developed to be given on a continuous dosing schedule to induce tumor shrinkage. We are encouraged by the single agent activity we've seen in heavily pretreated patients across multiple tumor types, and I'm pleased to have received priority review here in the US for our NDA submission of the MONARCH 1 and MONARCH 2 data in metastatic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, the latter being in combination with fulvestrant. We also look forward to presenting interim results from the MONARCH 3 study of abemaciclib in combination with aromatase inhibitors as initial treatment in endocrine-sensitive breast cancer patients at ESMO in September. We continue to believe that abemaciclib could represent a potential best-in-class CDK-4 and 6 inhibitor based on the totality of the data, including magnitude and depth of response as well as progression-free survival and that it will become an important new treatment option for patients with breast cancer. We aim to establish a broad presence for abemaciclib in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, not only in HER2-negative but also in HER2-positive disease. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we recently announced initiation of a study in the adjuvant setting, which we see as a significant opportunity. Based on the biology of CDK-4, Ras-dependent tumors are also a priority, including our ongoing trial in KRAS mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we see multiple opportunities to combine abemaciclib with novel molecules to enhance efficacy and address resistant mechanisms. These assets, along with Alimta and Erbitux, represent a strong base from which to grow our oncology business. Now I'll turn it over to Levi. Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Sue. First, let me emphasize how remarkable the opportunity is in oncology these days, and it's particularly exciting here at Lilly Oncology R&D. Our team has the track record, the capabilities and the passion to make a difference for cancer patients, and I'm confident we'll do so. Earlier, Sue pointed out that the competitive intensity in oncology requires that we raise the bar for clinical impact and innovation. I'll start by describing how we'll set that bar high in order to compete and win in this exciting field. Sue mentioned the term foundational agent. As shown on the left side of slide 21, we think of foundational agents as having certain important characteristics. Principally, they inhibit a key dependency within the tumor. That is, a target or pathway essential to the viability of the malignant cells themselves or their ability to fend off the immune system. Ideally, we can enrich for such dependencies using genetic or molecular biomarkers, but we must have strong evidence that the target is essential for the biology of the cancer cells. At the same time, we recognize that changing the standard-of-care in oncology usually requires combinations. Such foundational regimens should be similarly rooted in biology, leading to rational combinations that drive meaningful clinical benefit in multiple malignancies. From a practical perspective, it becomes essential to employ rigorous and standardized criteria to determine whether a drug candidate could be a future foundational agent. To accomplish this, we've developed a set of criteria that we can apply across the board to assets already in clinical development, assets we want to advance into the clinic and those we may want to bring in from the outside. First, we must have a clear hypothesis. What is the dependency we're attacking? And how do we know this dependency is operant? Second, we need a clear path to enrich the relevant cancer patient population based on genetic or molecular criteria. This patient enrichment doesn't have to be perfect, but we need one or more biomarkers that tell us we're likely oversampling for patients in whom the dependency is operant during clinical development. The biomarker discovery process really starts in the preclinical stages well before we even begin testing the regimen in patients. Third, we must optimize the treatment early in development. How do we know we've hit the target hard enough? Can we obtain serial biopsies to look at pharmacodynamics and assess the extent of target engagement or inhibition? How do we engineer a dosing regimen that minimizes off-target toxicities? The fourth and fifth criteria address key clinical and commercial hurdles we have to clear. Is it looking like we're headed for an incremental or a substantial clinical effect? If it's the former, we either need a better patient enrichment strategy to drive a larger effect size, or we should stop developing. And finally, we always need to ask ourselves, do we have an opportunity to win? Do we have a path to gain reasonable market share? This is where being first-in-class or best-in-class comes into play. Given the environmental trend Sue mentioned, we expect that fewer assets will clear the high bar set through this decision framework. However, we should be in a position to drive those assets that do clear the bar more aggressively. We simply can't afford to spread ourselves so thin that we lack the speed and focus required to accelerate potential breakthrough agents and regimens that do meet these criteria. Now, we've applied this decision framework to our current portfolio, and as we did so it became clear to us that there were a number of molecules that have the potential, depending on the clinical data, of course, to achieve the high bar we have set for standard-of-care changing foundational assets. You can see on slide 22 that in addition to abemaciclib, which is under priority review at the FDA, we have identified six early to mid-stage assets that potentially meet the decision criteria that I just outlined. These are the assets where we're now focusing the vast majority of our internal R&D dollars. These include agents targeting CHK1, ERK 1/2, the TGF-beta receptor and TIM-3. I'll say more about these in a moment. You can see that we've also included our PD-L1 inhibitor and PI3-Kinase/mTOR inhibitor which we intend to use primarily in combinations that boost other marketed or promising portfolio assets. Together, these assets have the potential to be foundational agents or to anchor foundational regimens. We currently have three assets where we're awaiting data from ongoing trials before deciding if they will move into our priority internal pipeline, external partnership or out of our portfolio altogether. For example, merestinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor currently in a registrational Phase 2 study, together with Cyramza in biliary tract cancer. If this trial meets its primary endpoint, it will become a priority asset for future life cycle development, potentially across multiple indications. If not, we may pursue external partnerships to develop merestinib. The CSF-1 antibody is in exploratory clinical studies where the magnitude of efficacy will similarly dictate the path forward. For our Ang2 antibody we are currently evaluating potential patient enrichment strategies that could guide its development. Thus, we expect clarifying data to emerge for each of these assets over the next several months. Finally you'll see a number of assets where we've already engaged or will be seeking external partners to advance clinical development. In some cases, such as the CBC 7 inhibitor, Aurora kinase inhibitor and a novel CHK1 inhibitor, these assets are currently owned by third parties and Lilly retains rights to bring them back in-house if key milestones are met. In most other cases we remain excited about the quality of our compounds, but believe that the optimal development paths will be best implemented in partnership with external entities that have specific or niche biological expertise. In the case of galunisertib, which inhibits the TGF-beta receptor, we have two ongoing studies in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (25:14). The result of these studies will inform the development of our entire TGF-beta platform, which remains a priority focus. By prioritizing our assets in this way, we are giving ourselves flexibility to bet more aggressively on portfolio assets with the highest foundational potential while de-risking others externally and importantly making room to bring external innovation into our oncology portfolio, and we'll talk more about that later. Now I'll highlight three of our priority internal assets briefly to illustrate why we are focusing in this way. First, we have a highly selective ERK 1/2 inhibitor in Phase 1 studies. ERK is a key oncogenic driver in many cancers, including a large proportion of Ras mutant cancers, nearly all BRAF mutant cancers and mini tumors driven by receptor tyrosine kinase aberrations. The upper left panel shows that the preclinical activity of our ERK inhibitor correlates strongly with alteration in the Ras pathway. The lower left panel show that combinations of our ERK inhibitor with abemaciclib yields superior anti-tumor effects in KRAS mutant xenograph studies, including tumor regression. This molecule is currently in the fourth dose cohort of the ongoing Phase 1 trial and we're encouraged by the early safety and PK/PD data. Within the next year we expect to both achieve our maximum tolerated dose and begin a series of combination studies with abemaciclib and other assets. These studies will be conducted in tumor types where an ERK dependency is pertinent such as KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer, advanced lung cancer and others. Next is prexasertib, a potent small molecule inhibitor of the CHK1 kinase. CHK1 has emerged as an interesting target in cancers with DNA repair defects or a so-called replicated stress in effect. Prexasertib is a first-in-class agent and the left panel shows that we have seen objective responses with prexasertib monotherapy in both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We have a molecular enrichment plan in place to explore monotherapy use in ovarian cancer and we see possibilities for prexasertib in other tumors as well. We look forward to continued development of prexasertib in ovarian and other cancer types. Moving to our TIM-3 monoclonal antibody that just recently entered the clinic, TIM-3 is a PD1-like immune checkpoint. It resides on the surface of T cells and tends to be activated at later cell of a factor T cell function than PD1 in what are often called exhausted T cells. Targeting TIM-3 may therefore help overcome resistance to PD1 therapies and may also enhance PD1 activity when used in combination. Our approach is to take our TIM-3 antibody, which we believe may have a distinct inhibitory mechanism, and expedite its clinical evaluation. This antibody will be developed as a combination with our PD-L1 antibody in patients whose cancers are no longer responsive to existing checkpoint-based immunotherapy regimens. Now, TIM-3 is just one of several IO assets in our pipeline. For example, we intend to speed development of two bispecific monoclonal antibodies designed against IO targets. The promise of bispecifics is that you not only inhibit two targets present on distinct cell types within a single therapy, but you can also use the arms of the antibody to bring those two different cell types together \u2013 for example, a tumor cell and a cytotoxic T cell \u2013 and that potentially drives greater efficacy. Together with our other preclinical IO assets and an active business development agenda, which Sue will now say more about, we believe that these R&D efforts will position us well to bring new value to patients in this exciting arena. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Levi. In addition to the opportunities in our pipeline and our strong research capability, we will actively look to the external market to help us bring the best innovation to patients. Over the last few years we've undertaken a number of clinical partnerships and preclinical collaborations to build on our IO capability. Moving forward, you will see us being more aggressive on the business development front, especially regarding early phase and pre-clinical assets. Specifically we will actively pursue assets that can combine rationally with our existing products, serve as new potential foundational agents and enable new IO breakthroughs. The good news is that there is a lot of external innovation in oncology and we intend to be much more active in this space to ensure we have a competitive pipeline going forward. So to conclude, we already have a solid base to build upon with Alimta hopefully enjoying exclusivity in the US after 2022 and in Europe and Japan after 2021. And with Erbitux, Cyramza, Lartruvo and soon abemaciclib is approved. By rigorously employing the framework that Levi described earlier, we'll focus on innovation that can deliver meaningful improvements in survival with a balance toward first-in-class and best-in-class assets. We'll maintain a competitive pipeline by accessing more external innovation, particularly at earlier stages of clinical development. We'll focus only on assets that meet the high bar that we've described and move quickly to capitalize on promising early data. And finally, we'll invest more heavily behind the bets we do make to drive robust life cycle plans that maximize the value that patients and investors can derive from our innovation. So again, we have a strong base to build from, but we need to and we will make changes to be more competitive and to deliver innovation that is highly valued by patients and physicians. This is a time of unprecedented growth and opportunity in oncology and it's an exciting time to be at Lilly where we have an opportunity to make major impacts on the lives of patients that suffer from the most deadly cancers. Levi and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have during the Q&A session. But now I'll turn the call over to Derica for a review of our overall corporate pipeline, progress on our potential key events and an update on our financial guidance for 2017. Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Sue. Slide 28 shows our NME pipeline as of July 21. Similar to what Levi showed you for the oncology NME pipeline and similar to what we've been doing for our NILEX pipeline, this shows select NMEs, highlighting those on which we think investors should focus. Should you need or want it, our IR team can provide you a list of the additional clinical stage assets in our portfolio that aren't shown in this view of select assets. Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the US submission of abemaciclib for advanced breast cancer based on both MONARCH 1 and MONARCH 2, the movement of an endocrine mimetic for diabetes into Phase 2 and initiation of Phase 1 for a molecule to treat cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, the addition of two assets from our recent collaboration with KeyBioscience and termination of development of a Phase 1 asset. Our select NILEX pipeline as shown on slide 29 reflects the initiation of the abemaciclib adjuvant breast cancer study. Now, turning to slide 30, you can see the considerable progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2017. Dave already mentioned most of the key events that have occurred since our last earnings call so I'll simply comment on two changes. First, we now expect to begin the Phase 3 study for baricitinib and psoriatic arthritis next year. Second, we've added a line in the Phase 3 internal readout section for the final analysis of the RAINFALL study for ramucirumab in the first line gastric cancer as we now expect that event before the end of the year. Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 31, you'll see that we've raised the range for revenue by $200 million primarily due to the uptake trends we're seeing for our new pharmaceutical products that offset headwinds in our animal health business. Moving to the gross margin percent, we have reduced our guidance by a percentage point due to the effect of foreign exchange movement. On R&D expense, we've increased the range by $100 million with the major drivers being the CoLucid acquisition and our decision to start the abemaciclib adjuvant trial which we've gotten up and running in record time. We've decreased our GAAP tax rate and EPS primarily to reflect the Nektar deal. Finally, we've increased our non-GAAP EPS range by a nickel to $4.10 to $4.20 per share, and we've reduced our estimate for full year capital expenditures by $100 million to reflect updated project timing. Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. We've had another strong quarter. Led by a new product, worldwide revenue grew 8%. By making disciplined investments in our business, we've leveraged that top line growth into 29% non-GAAP EPS growth, or 32% growth when excluding FX. While we're disappointed with the delay of baricitinib here in the U.S., we continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Since our last earnings call, we received approval for Olumiant in Japan, we've received priority review for abemaciclib, and we've bolstered our pipeline with the KeyBioscience deal. We also completed an important strategic review of oncology and are confident that execution of this more focused strategy will position us to make significant contributions in this important therapeutic area. Going forward, our management team will remain focused on launching new products with excellence, reloading our late-stage pipeline, driving increased productivity to expand our operating margins, and investing in our core drivers of our business : talent, scientific capability, and technology platforms to ensure our future growth prospects. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Derica. We would like to take as many questions as possible from the callers on the line, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two or to one two-part question. John, if you can please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Certainly. [Operation Instructions] First we'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. First coming on baricitinib, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what a trial addressing DBT and PE would look like here? It seems like it ought to be a very, very large or very long-term study given the low event rate. So along those lines, should we think about something significantly longer than 18 months delay if you have to run a study with baricitinib? Second question for me is on diabetes. Any initial look or commentary on the 2018 kind of access or pricing as we go through this contracting season? I guess, should we think about any major changes to your access or price? I know you're not going to give 2018 guidance, but just kind of directionally, how should we think about the portfolios heading into next year? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Chris, for the questions. So Christi, we'll go to you for the first question on baricitinib, and then over to you, Enrique, for the question on 2018 access for diabetes products. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you very much for the question. As you probably saw in the press release this morning, we remain very disappointed, especially for the many rheumatoid arthritis patients in the United States who don't have access to bari in spite of its access in other countries and regions. In terms of the clinical trial and how long that will take, we know that in exploring all of our options, the minimum amount for resubmission will be 18 months. We don't yet have clarity with the FDA. That will be discussions we have with them, exactly what kind of trial will help define better the benefit-risk profile of baricitinib. But we are committed to a path forward working with the FDA on that. And I'll summarize by saying in the end, all of these patients who are living with rheumatoid arthritis in spite of all of the great treatments that are available continue to suffer, and Americans deserve access to this treatment and we will continue to pursue not only rheumatoid arthritis but other indications with bari. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Thank you, Christi. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Chris, so we do have, as you're aware, good access when we look across our brands, and we have a strong performance which helps our competitive position as we look at 2018. The negotiations at this stage are not finalized. It would be premature for me to comment. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. And Chris, we do typically allow the payers to actually make their announcements before we would comment on changes. I don't think we'll begin to hear any of those until August, September timeframe, likely. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : And we'll go to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much for the questions. So, just a couple here. In terms of the situation with baricitinib, you do mention other opportunities and indications. I think about a year ago at your Analyst Day you mentioned expectation for your atopic dermatitis study to wrap up with baricitinib. We haven't seen those data yet. Just wondering when we might see those data? And if that is one of the indications that you're interested in pursuing? Just as a follow-up to that, given the DBT PE dynamics, can you just help us understand if RA patients are uniquely at higher risk of DBT and PE such that FDA would be a little more balanced when considering other indications? And then just a final question, as we look at sort of the opportunity for leverage, I know this question continues to get asked of Dave on a repeated basis, but as we continue to look at the leverage opportunity in the operating expense line, just wanted to get a better sense of if this is still viewed as a purely sales-driven opportunity or if you can work to control costs. And just wanted to say thanks, Derica, for all of your efforts over the years. It's been a real pleasure. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Seamus. Thank you for the questions. Chris, we'll go to you for the first two on baricitinib. Derica, if you want to comment on the third one? Obviously, Dave, feel free to chime in. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Thank you for the question, Seamus. We are pursuing other indications and continue our studies in atopic dermatitis as well as lupus, and we're also going to begin the psoriatic arthritis trial next year. In specific terms of atopic dermatitis, the Phase 2 data you will see presented at a scientific forum before the end of the year. And then in terms of DBT and PE, yeah, there was one placebo-controlled trial in the RA study that showed an imbalance of DBT versus placebo. The overall rate, if you look at the multiple Phase 3 trial, in 3,000 patients, the overall rate of DBT on patients treated with baricitinib was the same as what is published in patients on the overall background rate in rheumatoid arthritis in general. So hopefully that answers your question and gives you a rationale as to why we disagree with the FDA, and why we feel very positive about pursuing other indications with baricitinib and continuing to find a path forward in RA with the FDA. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Christi. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks for your question, Seamus, and for your comment. In regards to our margin goals, as we stated, 50% was the goal for 2018. We think we'll go beyond that as we think about the remainder of the decade and beyond. In regards to how we get there, it's both. It is attributed to us driving a strong revenue growth profile that you've seen here for the first six months of the year \u2013 8% in Q2 alone. But it also is contingent on us continuing to drive a very deliberate productivity and cost containment agenda inside Lilly. So when you look at our margin, if you look at just gross margin, you see the over 90 basis points of improvement, that was a combination of prices but also manufacturing efficiencies, and we saw that in Q1. And if you look at our OpEx, we improved our OpEx ratio by over 390 basis points alone in just the Q2. So you will continue to see us executing on both profiles, launching with excellence, but then, yes, also driving a very deliberate cost containment and productivity agenda inside Lilly going forward. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: And Seamus, just to put a little bit of numbers on your prior question. To our knowledge the published rates of DBT and PE for patients with RA do range from approximately 0.3 to 0.8 per 100 patient years, and the rate reported for all RA patients receiving baricitinib during our development program was 0.46 per 100 patient years. John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : And that will be John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the results. So, question for Dave on the pricing front. Obviously, there continues to be some bantering that continues on the pricing front, but the industry has done a relatively good job to shift that to discussing, certainly high coinsurance, high deductibles. It seems as though Lilly does give up a significant portion as a pass-through on rebates. How can the industry help to shed additional light on that 50%, I think, that Lilly gives back in terms of rebates to give that back to customers for coinsurance, dependency in plans? Is there any thought about how you can do that through contracting with PBMs going forward to get better control over where that's going? The second question just for Levi, really appreciate the internal review that you gave but when you look externally, and if you had a wish list, are there certain things that you don't have within your portfolio that might be at the top of the list that you would like to bring in to Lilly's oncology portfolio? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. John, thank you for the questions. Pretty straightforward. Dave, for the first one. And then over to you, Levi, for your wish list on your external innovation. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, John. On the pricing debate in the U.S., of course, the battle will never be over. I think we need to continue to explain the value proposition we offer and defend the business model. But I agree with you. We have staved off, I think, some of the worst ideas and continue to remain focused in Washington and the states on advocating for strategies that can actually bring down out-of-pocket cost for consumers. As you point out, we published earlier this year that 50% of our list price is discounted on average, and patients rarely receive any of that benefit at the pharmacy counter. One big lever we've advocated for aggressively along with our pharma colleagues is through the Part D program, passing through rebates in the donut hole in some form. That's still on the table. In commercial plans, we do see growing interest in the same idea from large employers, and if you look at the absolute inflation rate of net pricing in medications versus the out-of-pocket cost for patients, they're not close. Patient out-of-pocket costs are accelerating rapidly. Finally, I'd say we've been a leader in prodding the system, if you would, through programs that work outside of insurance both through Express Scripts in this case, but I see other PBMs active in the space providing a discount program that works outside the insurance system and provides PBM-like rebates directly to patients. We've done this in our insulin business with both Blink Health and more recently with the direct ESI program. We'll continue to do that to point out that net pricing is not something patients enjoy, but I don't expect this to go away overnight and we'll remain focused on it, John, to reduce the long-term risk to the business. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Levi? Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.: Well, thanks for the question. So as you point out, one of the most exciting areas of oncology has been just the amount of innovation that exists across the arena. And here at Lilly, Dave has really been pushing the idea of being more active in terms of bringing in external innovation so we're very pleased for that prioritization here within Lilly. To your specific question about a wish list, we don't look at this at an asset-by-asset level, but rather we think about what can boost our strategy. So what could be brought in that might combine well with some of our promising products and, just in general, what are some areas scientifically where it's been obvious that advances have been made and where, if we could leverage what we do well at Lilly in terms of clinical development, we could add value there. So I would say it's not really an asset-by-asset basis but really letting the science drive strategy and certainly that would cover the gambit of both targeted therapy and immunotherapy advances. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Levi. John, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go to Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. A couple of questions. On abemaciclib, you described this as one of your foundational assets and later this year you'll present MONARCH 3. Do you think that once those results are presented, the general takeaway from analysts and from oncologists is going to be that abema is clearly better than palbociclib when everyone does their side by side comparisons? Thus far, despite Lilly's claims of differentiation, there's not a lot of people that are convinced that it's truly a best-in-class product. Second question is on Alimta and the timing of the ruling for the IPR. In the past, Lilly was willing to give a timeline because the rules for this sort of thing are pretty clear. Most recently you've backed away from providing a timeline, and I'm wondering why the uncertainty this time around and what can we expect in terms of a timeline, if you have any updates. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Tim. Thank you for the questions. I think, Sue, those are both for you. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, Tim, thanks very much. Yeah. Well firstly, on abema we're delighted that we have the priority review for MONARCH 1 and MONARCH 2, and we anticipate getting action on those Q1 of next year. With regards to MONARCH 3, we're presenting it at ESMO. I think we've been pretty clear all the way through, Tim, that we do believe that we've got a differentiated medicine here and one that potentially could be best-in-class. We've got to look across all of the data to assess that across the different clinical data, looking at PFS response rate, et cetera, and across different trials, and we've now got the MONARCH 1 data that shows single agent activity. The MONARCH 2 data, which was in an endocrine-resistant patient population, a very homogenous patient population where we, to the best of our knowledge, have seen the highest PFS in any trial today in that population, and of course, we'll see the MONARCH 3 later this year. So we continue to be very excited by this molecule. But I would continue to encourage you to look across all the data and all the trials as we assess this medicine. With regards to the Alimta IPR, we are now anticipating that we should get a reading on the IPR by the end of this year. That's the latest that we know, okay? And if we know any more, we'll let you know, but that's our understanding. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. John, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : We'll go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. A couple of questions, please. The obvious bedfellow for prexasertib given the mechanism and the lack of overlapping top (50:41) would be a PARP inhibitor, so what's your appetite for larger and later biotech deals around, in your own words, a potentially foundational drug in the form of a PARP? Second for Levi, how does your TIM-3 differentiate itself from Novartis? I think both target hospitals (51:01) if I read your slides correctly. And then finally on the outlook statement in relation to animal health, could you break down for us how much of the competitive pressures, market slowing that you're seeing is market-specific versus merely portfolio-specific? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Andrew, thank you for the questions. So, Dave, we'll go to you for the appetite for large later-stage biotech deals. On to Levi for the question on TIM-3. And then Jeff, over to you for the drivers in animal health. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Just to \u2013 not commenting specifically on the PARP inhibitor idea, and maybe Levi if I could just chime in on that, but the frame we have on M&A and business development isn't necessarily limited by size but rather by logic, which is we're interested in things that add to our portfolio where we can create new value for patients in the health care system, maybe through combinations or through individual assets. We're not interested in business combinations that create a short term cost synergy. We've said in the past that those would include small and mid-sized M&A and so in that regard, I guess your question is would we rule out M&A, small and mid-sized? No, we wouldn't if it made sense on the first basis, which is adding to our portfolio in a way that creates new value for the health care system. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Levi? Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, just adding on prexasertib I would agree with Dave and certainly your point about PARP inhibitors, this particular combination is interesting, but there are actually several potential interesting combinations that we're pursuing with prexasertib. So what we think about this, as Dave mentioned, sort of the totality of what the science supports as opposed to a particular deal or exchange. With regard to TIM-3, our preclinical evidence suggests that our TIM-3 molecule has a distinct mechanism of TIM-3 inhibition than some of the competitor molecules, and this could be of potential importance because unlike, for example, PD1 where the relevant ligands are well understood in terms of the reason why an anti-PD1 works in cancer immunotherapy, there are actually several ligands for TIM-3 and the relative contribution to those ligands in the tumor immunology context is less clear. So obviously it's early days. We'll need to await clinical activity to determine whether that's a clinical distinction, but preclinically, that does appear to be a potentially important difference. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Levi. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, Andrew, I think I'll just put in a broader context the animal health situation, and then I'll answer the mix versus the market or portfolio. You know, as we signaled earlier this year, we did expect Q2 to be a challenging quarter. Part of this was due to the higher buy-in a year ago with the SAP cutover, but there are really three issues that Dave mentioned in his comments that have impacted our Q2 results in animal health. One, competitive pressures in comp animal parasiticides. Two, market access in food animal. That is portfolio-driven. And competitive pressures in cattle. So, on the first issue just real quickly, on the competitive pressures in comp animal parasiticides, we continue to see new entrants. We continue to see the space become more crowded. However, we do see positives for us in our comp animal business and I'll touch on two. Galliprant, our deal with Aratana, that growth is meeting expectations. And then our BI vaccine portfolio, that is also on track with our expectations. As you move to market access, this is where there's a portfolio factor. Posilac, and this is mainly the big driver here in Q2, or rbST, it's a productivity product in the dairy market. We have seen U.S. customers chosen to forego the benefits of this with the oversupply of milk and lower prices. We've seen kind of the clean food label movement, and then you combine this with the unfavorable economics in dairy. And then I think the last issue is just food animal competition primarily in U.S. beef. And this is just increased bundling activity and more aggressive pricing. That's some market-driven, but as well portfolio. But I've put our focus and where our focus is, is on this medium and long-term agenda. Accelerating innovation, changing our mix into these higher-growth product segments and improving productivity. We've recently launched or soon will be launching a number of new products. Two in aquaculture, a vaccine and a parasiticide, a salmonella vaccine in broilers, and we've recently received an approval for our flea-tick combo product in the EU. So our business mix is improving with vaccines, nutritionals in comp animals (55:40), and it's becoming a larger part of our business. Finally, I would just say that we've got many productivity streams that will improve overall operations in both manufacturing and sales efficiency. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Jeff. John, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : And that would be Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I actually wanted to focus on marketed products, if I may. And perhaps starting off on the diabetes side. I was curious what the dynamic is behind Humalog franchising pricing pressure in the U.S., but Humulin franchise has seen pricing tailwinds this quarter. So that was one. On Taltz perhaps in psoriasis, curious to how you're thinking about how IL-23 competition impacts the trajectory going forward or not. And then finally, I found it interesting that you mentioned Alimta U.S. is tracking at decreased demand, despite the Keytruda approval in KEYNOTE-021G and I was just curious what the dynamic is there. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Umer, thank you for the question. So, Enrique, we'll go to you for the Humalog and Humulin pricing dynamics. Christi, to you for the question on IL-23 impact to Taltz. Then Sue, the U.S. Alimta question. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So as we've noted during previous earning calls, we expect some volatility around our U.S. Humalog sales. We expect that to continue, given that we make estimates on rebates and discounts at the end of each quarter. We do not learn about the actual utilization until later periods. Now maybe the best way to characterize Humalog is to basically try to look at the underlying performance and try to normalize it for some of these changes that are related to prior periods. When we normalize Humalog, Humalog sales are declining about 5%. There is growth in the low single-digit when it comes to volume, but pricing is basically declining in the mid to high single-digits. Now, why is price declining if we continue to see pressure when it comes to increased rebates? Also, we basically see a continued shift towards a mix of the segments where the higher rebated segments are basically growing faster, i.e., Medicaid to point one example. In the case of Humulin, I think the situation is a bit different. So we grew in the U.S. Humulin 11%. I think we need to keep in mind that when it comes to Humulin now, 60% of our revenue in Humulin is really \u2013 almost 60% is coming from U-500 and only the rest from U-100. They have very different trends. U-100 is declining while U-500 is basically increasing right now revenue at about 20%. So different dynamics there and that's why I think is you're seeing the reported results. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hi, Umer. Yes, we're still very excited about Taltz and what we're seeing in the marketplace that the study is translating into the real world, we're seeing fast response, clear response and we think we've set a pretty high bar if you look at the NBRx growth. With the IL-23s coming to market however, we do believe it's an opportunity for patients to raise the bar on their own expectations so that the market will actually grow for the newer agents which will help all of the new agents that have higher efficacy, especially if you look at the head-to-head trials. So we expect to see the market of the newer agents grow and we're very excited. As you know, we talked at our last earnings call that we submitted for psoriatic arthritis for Taltz and we expect to hear back by the end of the year on our submission. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Christi. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. With regard to Alimta, well, we've seen a steady decline in Alimta's share of market over the year or so, really due to IL competition, as well as some of the targeted agents like the ALK inhibitors. So this has been pretty consistent and we've seen that. So we do have a decline over last year, although we did see an increase Q2 versus Q1. We think that's mainly buying patterns. The KEYNOTE-021 G data clearly is important and we're delighted that the NCCN has now listed that as a Category 2A, so we do believe that we will see a use there, although it's too early to say how much use at this point. And it's also important to note that with the combination with Alimta it's probably going to be used in the PD-L1 low patient population of which Alimta has got about a 50% market share there. So although we believe that we will see use, we don't anticipate that we're going to drive growth of Alimta through this. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. John, next caller, please. Operator : And we'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, a question for Dave on baricitinib, it seems that Lilly and FDA have a significant difference of opinion on regulatory requirements. How, in your experience, are such differences resolved and what are the mechanisms and timeframe for doing so to get the best possible outcome for Lilly? So that's the first question. And secondly, why is the baricitinib psoriatic arthritis trial initiation being delayed? Is it to clarify the landscape for the molecule overall or is it some indication-specific reason? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Your question, Dave for the first general question on the situation with FDA and then, Christi, to you for the second question on psoriatic arthritis. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Obviously, as Christi said and we noted in our remarks, we're disappointed with the outcome. I think we do have clarity on what the FDA's point of view is. It's just not our point of view and therein lies the difference. Now they're the regulator. We need to engage with them and find the best path forward. Considering time but also label quality for baricitinib and RA. The resolution of this, to me, there's a variety of tools available to us. One of those is to do new clinical work as we indicated that the FDA has requested we do that. That's something certainly we're scoping and looking at now. In addition, all of the original for FDA studies we did in the Phase 3 program continue and so we continue to pile up events, albeit on a baricitinib-only basis to compare to background rates, et cetera, and I think that's important. And then launching in Europe and Japan will quickly eclipse the number of patients treated in clinical trials with those treated in the real world and I think that's also an important set of data to help us work through what is the safety issue of low incidence, which I think Seamus asked about earlier, how do you resolve that. It's going to be a combination of those levers coupled with other tools we can use, whether it be labeling or otherwise to work through this FDA situation. We're trying to give investors a reasonable expectation as to the timeline for resubmission and then approval because we know that was a big open question. That all said, and as Christi said, we're highly committed to the asset. We've got a long IP runway. We think JAK inhibitors are a profound improvement for patients, in particular baricitinib, given its unique profile in early RA especially and we aim to get it there, along with other NILEXes which we could pursue, like atopic derm, SLE, et cetera. So it's definitely disappointing, but we're committed to move forward, and we have a variety of tools to advance this one. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Dave. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. And on the question on psoriatic arthritis, based on the fact it's the same division reviewing RA and psoriatic arthritis, we felt it was prudent for us to take a pause, ensuring that we incorporated feedback from the FDA so that as we pursued the indication we knew that we were aligned. And so that's what we've done, and that's why now we're telling you that we are going to push the go button. And in 2018, we'll be pursuing that trial for bari in psoriatic arthritis. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Christi. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: John, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : We'll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just sticking with that topic on baricitinib, at what point \u2013 or is there actually a point where you just decide it's not worth going forward, just given that there are other newer agents coming to the market and RA is a really entrenched market to begin with? I mean, is there a point that you just say it's not worth it? Or not? And then should we also assume that the atopic dermatitis and lupus indications are also put on hold until you get better clarity with FDA? And then my other question relates to SUSTAIN-7, which I believe should be reported out sometime in the third quarter. Can you remind us, Dave, your expectations for that study? I think you've said before that you would expect semaglutide to show better efficacy but maybe worse safety than Trulicity. And if SUSTAIN-7 is positive, how do you maintain market share of Trulicity? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Jami. So, Dave, let's go to you for the first question on baricitinib's procedural aspects and if we ever get to a point where we wouldn't go forward with RA. And then, Christi, if you'd comment on plans for atopic dermatitis and lupus? And then, Enrique, on our view on SUSTAIN-7. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Jami. The bottom line is we're a long way from anything like that point that you're highlighting for a couple of reasons. I think, first, rheumatoid arthritis remains both a large unmet need and the largest category in the autoinflammatory space. Baricitinib has proven profound benefit, best-in-class. We of course did the Humira head-to-head and methotrexate head-to-head, and so what we need to do is put behind us the sunk cost of this and just go forward and see how competitive is the next investment given the opportunity we have in that space and the unmet need available? We feel very strongly that that's positive, and we're going to be pushing forward. The IP runway, as I mentioned, is very long \u2013 probably through the end of the next decade. And the way the market works, as you're pointing out, is it's dense with competition. A breadth of indication strategy is probably important for any JAK inhibitor, and without RA in that mix, it probably affects the competitiveness of all of the indications. So right now we're focused on getting to the next step. We're confident we're going to get through this with the FDA. And Christi can comment on the other indications, but we're moving ahead. And of course remember, the OUS environment for baricitinib is very positive. We have a great label in Europe and Japan. Those TNF markets are also very large, and we're focused on executing the launches in those spaces. And they'll need additional indications as well. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. So the psoriatic arthritis trial was the only trial that we've paused. We've had good conversations with the derm division at FDA. Atopic dermatitis and lupus have not been paused. They are continuing as planned. And as I said before, we expect data to be released at a scientific session before the end of the year on atopic derm, and we expect data on SLE either later this year or beginning of next year. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Christi. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So, Jami, when it comes to SUSTAIN-7, of course we have to wait for the result, but based on some of the modeling that we've done, what are we expecting, which I think is your question. One is, we expect that they're going to show a difference when it comes to weight, and we believe that they're going to show a small difference when it comes to hemoglobin A1c. Clearly, we need to weigh all of that against any label that they may receive, and that is up to the regulators. But as you are likely aware, as part of SUSTAIN-6, semagluta showed a signal when it comes to (01:08:27). And the specifics of how was that defined is whether it's blindness, hemorrhaging, ocular injections and so forth. So, clearly we need to wait for the totality of the data and further discussions that Novartis will have with the FDA. We view this as an important competitor to us and we are very much prepared to continue to grow Trulicity going forward. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. John, next caller, please. Operator : We'll go to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Maybe just going back to clean up on animal health. Dave, any updated thoughts on Elanco and how it fits into the long-term value creation story you have for Lilly? I assume you've had adequate time now to really dig in on that? And then on the pipeline, is there anything you could share about what was learned in the interim analysis for the BACE inhibitor? And on the DACRA, if I could call it that, how might that be differentiated from Trulicity? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Hey, Gregg. Thank you for the questions. Dave, if you want to comment on the first animal health question? And then, Jan, if you like to maybe comment on the interim that we had for the BACE inhibitor as well as the DACRA, and Rick, absolutely feel free to comment on that one as well. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. Gregg, I think this question has come up before and I'll say the same thing which is in any case we need to constantly review our portfolio. We need to make sure all of our assets, we have a basis for holding and driving incremental value versus what anyone else can do and animal health is no different from that. Right now, as Jeff indicated in his answer in terms of the performance issues, and in my early days here, we've been very focused on operational improvements that we've put together a number of companies including Novartis combination. And in my experience, and also I think in our real experience, it takes some effort and work to get to true operational effectiveness after that kind of combination. We also have some environmental headwinds we need to reposition against. Jeff outlined a response to those. So that's really our focus right now. But your question is a good one. We'll constantly be asking ourselves that question and of course if we have a new thought about that, we'll come back to the investment community. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.: Right. In relation to the interim BACE study, this analysis looked at the safety and also assessment if there were cognitive worsening and the sample size re-estimation. And the recommendation was to continue the preferred trial as planned and not change the size of the trial. The continuation of this trial, we should remind also people that it is in amyloid-positive patients and it's the prodromal and the mild population. If we talk about the new DACRA and the calcitonin amylin receptor agonists, this is an interesting new class of agent that potentially could have a superior weight loss with a competitive glucose lowering. That's one way of describing it, potentially less nausea as well. And the key thing here could be insulin sensitization and this agent is different from the GLP-1s since it doesn't release insulin but rather enhanced sensitization for insulin which could mean even a better durability of the glucose lowering effect. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Jan. John, if we could go to the next caller? Operator : We'll go to Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just had a few. On galcanezumab, lots of data across the CGRP landscape this year. How are you guys thinking about the payer attitudes before the filing? I can't remember, have you guys \u2013 is the launch reflected in your long-term revenue growth guidance? And then a bigger picture question on biz dev, you guys provided a pretty specific strategy on oncology. How much does valuation inform the decision or the urgency and what's the relative attractiveness to other categories such as neuroscience, inflammation, et cetera? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Geoff, thank you for the question. So, Christi, if you could comment on how we view pair attitudes in the migraine space. Derica, if you can comment on whether or not galcanezumab is in our sort of midterm financial expectations. And then, Dave, you'll take the last question. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: So we're very excited, first of all, about galcanezumab. If you think about patients losing up to 50 days of their life every year and being able to cut that in half, it's just an amazing proposition. We do know we're not going to be the only product on the market, and we'll have a lot of competition but I think we have a couple of things. One, I don't \u2013 we don't see any other CGRP data that's better than our own. We look at the data and see that if you look at the response rates, about 60% of patients respond, have a greater than 50% response rate, 33% at greater than 75% response rate, and about 12% or 1 in 8 patients will have 100% response rate. So we feel like we have a very strong efficacy profile, couple that with a really good benefit risk ratio. So that's number one on galcanezumab. On the contracting piece, the great thing that we have at Lilly is a background in neuroscience, and we have a pain platform. It's not just galcanezumab, but as we go to payers soon after galcanezumab we'll be looking at lasmiditan, which already completed one Phase 3 study. The next Phase 3 study will be completed by the end of the year. And then follow that a little bit further with our partnership with Pfizer on tanezumab, we're looking at really putting a dent in the opioid crisis in the United States. And as we look at the entire platform, we feel pretty confident with our discussion \u2013 going into discussions with payers in the U.S. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Christi. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Jeff, the simple answer is yes, it is in, but on a probable-ized basis, as we do with the majority of our late-stage portfolio assets. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Perfect. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. So, I guess your broad question on BD, with any transaction, oncology is no different, we're going to look at several factors, of course, how it fits within our strategy both clinically and business-wise, the portfolio and the opportunity to combine it with other things is of course very important to oncology. And then \u2013 so that depends on the assets we're holding. And then of course we look at the valuation that we need to \u2013 any transaction needs to produce returns well above our cost of capital on a risk-adjusted basis. So when we go through all those filters, it does diminish the field of available targets. And we also, at Lilly, I think we're pretty flexible. We're not \u2013 we don't have to own things outright. I think we're happy to share risk, et cetera, and oncology is no different from that. Relative attractiveness is an interesting question. I would say in recent times we've seen the price points for oncology, particularly post PoC, are very challenging to get to a number. Our strategy, as communicated today by Sue and Levi, is to really open up that field and look at earlier projects, maybe take a little more risk, trading in front of the proof of concept, but making scientific judgments and then seeing those bear out. In that way we could probably do more transactions that might be smaller, and if we make the right judgments, have that pay off for our shareholders. Relative to other areas, oncology has a lot of targets. But I would say relatively the pricing is on the higher end. We like immunology a lot. There's also a lot of targets there and pricing, while creeping up, is still good. You saw the deal yesterday on the Nektar transaction, which we thought was an exceptional financial transaction and fits our strategy and is a compelling clinical asset. And then in other fields, like KeyBioscience, Jan was just talking about the DACRA platform, there are opportunities. So across our five TAs, oncology included, we look at everything, and we are disciplined on our financial analysis, but also strategy and clinical value. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. John, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : We'll go to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and thanks for the overview on the oncology strategy. So a couple of follow-ups just on the oncology side. CSF-1R I think is a mechanism that we've heard pretty good interest from (01:17:05). So I was a little surprised when you mentioned that's more of a Tier 2 asset now. And you said it was a magnitude of success that (01:17:11) you wanted to see. Maybe you could just give a little more detail on what you're looking for from that asset in terms of the efficacy? And then a more general question on that front, we've seen other mechanisms, like dose (01:17:22) for example, where you don't see much efficacy as a single agent, but it does seem to have value in combination. So how do you think about that when you're making your prioritization decisions sort of at early stage? And maybe putting your mechanism as a lower priority when there might be an opportunity in a different indication or in combination. And then second just on abemaciclib, following up on some of your earlier comments, we've heard for a while about some of the opportunity here for this class and this drug outside of breast cancer. And you mentioned non-small cell, I think squamous and I think pancreatic cancer on your slide. Can you just give us a sense of when we might start seeing some more data on these other tumor types to get a sense of potential for the drug and the class outside of breast cancer? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Vamil, thank you for the questions. Levi, if you'll take maybe the first two for sure, the CSF-1R and then how we view agents that might not have single-agent activity but could be useful in combos? And then Sue and Levi, maybe you can both contribute to answer the last question on timing for readouts for abema outside of breast cancer? Levi? Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Well, thanks for the question. So with CSF-1R, just going back to our decision framework, there are several considerations that we have when we're looking at whether or not an asset is going to clear the bar. In addition to the scientific rationale, we're also looking at clinical magnitude and even also the commercial landscape. And I think with CSF-1R in particular, that's an example of where it's a crowded space, and so our decision making about how aggressively we invest will be determined by the distinctive characteristics of our agent and our study, so \u2013 and we have a couple of studies ongoing that will inform that. With regard to the other question, you're absolutely correct. It is a very important point that as we build rational regimens we are increasingly seeing that key members of regimens may or may not have that impressive single activity, and IDL could be an example. One could even argue that some of the other Cetacaine (01:19:21) inhibitors were examples of that. So, this is another example of why it's so important to think about the scientific rationale; what is the biology that's operant, what are we trying to target, and is there a reason to believe that if we put a combination together we'll get a much greater effect than we might see with any individual component. So, in general, so there's not a specific answer to the question, obviously it will depend on the particular combinations and indications, but you're absolutely correct, this is increasingly something we're considering. What's the target regimen, the combination we want to put together and the aggregate biological rationale and not just the individual components. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: With abemaciclib, let me start and you may want to say more about the other indications, but the lung indication for the KRAS mutant lung, we should have that data in Q4 this year, so you should see that data then or at least we'll do a top line then and then we'll present the data at an upcoming meeting after that. And then with regards to the other studies, we are on an ongoing study in pancreatic cancer. At this present time we should see probably data on that next year sometime, and you want to comment on another? Levi Garraway - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, sure. So beyond that we also have abemaciclib in conjunction with trastuzumab and I would call the MONARCH HER study which is a HER2 positive- HR positive (01:20:47) breast cancer. That one is enrolling, and it may take a couple of years to have that readout. But then beyond that we have a number of combination studies that we are doing with abemaciclib so that's relevant to the second question. So we have \u2013 those are earlier-stage, but there are several, both portfolio assets and partnered assets, that we are looking at in combination with abemaciclib. So, we have a significant life cycle plan that we continue to add to that will read out over the coming years. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Levi. Thanks, Sue. John, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : We'll go to Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities, please go ahead. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks, thanks very much. Enrique, back to Humalog, if I may, you made a reference to volume being up, but I'm curious about the class as a whole, of rapid-acting insulins continuously down. Is that solely based on price? Or does that actually reflect some level of a decline in overall demand and what might those patients actually be moving toward or moving into as opposed to those rapid-acting agents? And then secondly very simply, Christi, when the resolution for baricitinib with the FDA, whatever it may be, another trial or some negotiation or patients who, you know, you look out in Europe and you're able to supply data to the FDA. The question really is, when you refile does the entire NDA clock restart at \u2013 the 12-month timeframe or is there some other fraction of that which we need to look forward to? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Tony, thank you for the questions. So we'll go to Enrique for the Humalog class question for the rapid-acting insulin and then, Christi, do you want to comment or I can comment on the second question on the very (01:22:40) timeframe once we resubmit. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. The main impact here when we look at the meal-time insulin class is really related to pricing. Now we do have, when we look at the growth rates of that class, the growth rates have come down, the class is still growing but it's growing less than it was growing two, three years ago and clearly this is part of basically increased utilization of both SGLT-2s and GLP-1s. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique, and Tony, and your question, when we resubmit our anticipation would be that the FDA would need to declare that a type 1 or type 2 resubmission and you would have I believe something like a 3 or 6 month timeframe then for them to have a PDUFA date and provide their answer to the resubmission. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks, Phil. Thank you, Enrique. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: John, if we could have the next caller, please? Operator : We go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. A couple on Trulicity which had a great quarter. First, on the cardiovascular outcome study, the REWIND study expected next year, how confident are you in that study given that two out of the four CV outcome studies with GLP-1s have failed to show a benefit? Is there anything in the design or patient characteristics that would basically suggest that the probability of success was more than a coin toss? And then when can we expect the results from AWARD-10 evaluating Trulicity and Jardiance? It would seem like that's a promising combination. My understanding is that the study has completed. Just wondering when we can see the results. And then finally were there any notable inventory changes for Trulicity and Taltz this quarter? Thank you very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Alex, thank you for the questions. Actually, before we go on, just to clarify the last answer that I'd given. I think a type 1 is actually a two-month turnaround, not three months. And the type 2 is in fact six months. Enrique, if we can go to you for the question on how we're viewing the chances for success of the REWIND trial for Trulicity and timing for AWARD-10 to read out. And then if you want to comment if there were any issues or changes in inventory levels for Trulicity, and, Christi, if you want to comment on Taltz. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So, it's really dangerous to speculate when it comes to how different trials are going to read out. We do have, I think, a very good experience when conducting cardiovascular trials in the diabetes space. I think Lilly probably has designed and conducted more trials than anybody else in this space, either by ourselves or with some of our partners. So, we feel confident that we've designed the trial in the right way, as we are awaiting on the results clearly. When you look at the different GLP-1s, I would say that not all GLP-1s are comparable, so we continue to like our chances. When it comes to your question on inventory for Trulicity, nothing material when it comes to inventory. We had some favorability related to changes in the estimates for revision (01:26:00) and discounts may be in the neighborhood of about $15 million out of a $380 million base, in the case of U.S. revenue. And as far as AWARD-10, we should be disclosing that at an upcoming medical conference. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: An easy answer for me, in regards to Taltz there. No \u2013 nothing unusual. We're really happy in fact to see that the volume and the demand is the reason for the uptake. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. John, we have time, I think, for one last question from the line. Operator : And we'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. So, I wanted to just ask a high level update, please. And then a couple of minor quick questions. So with respect to the outlook in Washington, it seems like the Trump administration and Congress are focused on matters other than drug pricing, but it would be great to hear your updated perspective and outlook on pharma's focus in Washington and any developments you think investors should be anticipating with respect to drug pricing in the second half of this year? And then in terms of my more minor questions, KEYNOTE-189 is listed as an internal readout on your slide but not external. Is that simply because Merck will issue the external press release? Or, do you not expect an external press release in the second half of this year? And then finally, Derica, on gross margin guidance that was reduced from 77% to 76%, can you just talk about the key franchises and specifically what drove that, whether it's mix or any other factors? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Dave. Thank you for the question. So, Dave Ricks, we'll go to you for the first question. Sue, for the KEYNOTE-189 timing question. And then Derica for gross margin percent. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Thanks, Dave. Probably, we spend a long time talking about what's happening in Washington but I'll try to be brief. Look, we've responded to the concerns as an industry and as a company, I think, pretty well, in terms of putting pro-actively aligned ideas from across the industry on the table that can leverage the power of the marketplace and competition to help consumers with their out-of-pocket costs. We talked about some of these through time, whether it be rebate pass-through and the donut hole, outcomes-based pricing, FDA speeding up the backlog of generic approvals and the like. So we put all that on the table. I think everybody, in any position of authority knows about the aligned pharma agenda. We do expect an executive order. They keep saying, soon. I would say in the second half you should expect that. We hope that it includes many of the ideas we put forward. My personal view is that won't end the discussion about drug pricing. I think we saw even yesterday, Democrats put this as a prominent feature in their \"Better Way\" paper, and we have a number of budgetary votes coming up in the fall that may include pay-forwards that include the drug industry. So we need to be \u2013 continue to be on our game. I think we've got a good team at pharma now, I think Lilly's doing our part within that, and the industry's on top of its game here. But there is still quite a bit of risk in the environment. I wouldn't want anyone to think otherwise. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Dave. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, with regards to KEYNOTE-189, remember this is outcomes-driven, so it will depend on outcomes, but our expectation is we could have a top line press release later this year, maybe early next year, with data being presented next year. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Sue. And Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Dave, it's solely attributable to the FX effect on inventories sold, and given the late movement that we've seen recently, this is what we anticipate. Underlying that, we continue to see very good operating performance of our manufacturing operations, and recall in the slide deck we provided you all and the supplemental in this call is slide 34, we always provide a look at our gross margin both with and without the FX effect. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. That puts us at the bottom of the hour. Dave, if you'd like to wrap up the call? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's call, and your interest in our company. Driven by the new pharmaceutical products through the first half of 2017, we're generating solid revenue growth, and we continue to improve our margins, leading to even faster income growth. We believe that Lilly's stock is a compelling investment given the diversity of our product portfolio and our top and bottom line growth prospects over the balance of the decade. We hope that the update shared by Sue and Levi on our oncology R&D strategy provides you with greater clarity on how we intend to up our game in this really important therapy area, to deliver new medicines that can redefine expectations for cancer patients. I look forward to your continued interactions, and keeping you informed of our progress. Please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on today's call. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, telephone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions and answers, with instructions given at that time. [Operation Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your first speaker, Dave Ricks. Please go ahead. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's third quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO. Joining me on the call today are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Smiley, currently our Treasurer and the CFO-elect; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A.; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-medicines; and Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health. We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden, and Phil Johnson of the IR team. This will be the last earnings call for two senior executives that have been instrumental in our company's success. At the end of the year, Maria Crowe, President of Manufacturing Operations; and Derica Rice, our CFO, will retire. Maria has helped Lilly earn the trust of patients we serve by making medicines with the highest levels of quality and safety. Derica played a key role in leading Lilly through the challenging period of patent expirations we called years YZ, and emerging as a much stronger company. Both have built strong organizations that will carry on their work. So beginning here, please join me in a round of applause to thank both of them for their contributions to our company. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual result could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and it's not sufficient for prescribing decisions. In Q3, we generated worldwide revenue growth of 9% driven by volume growth in our human pharmaceutical business, once again led by our newest products. I'd also highlight the outstanding performance of our diabetes product which, in total, grew 39% this quarter. We also continued to expand our margins. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by over 70 basis points, and total operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined by over 310 basis points to 50.8%. Our pipeline progress continued. Highlights include the FDA approved, and we launched, Verzenio, the US trade name for abemaciclib, for advanced breast cancer based on the MONARCH 1 and MONARCH 2 trials. We submitted the BLA for galcanezumab for migraine prevention, and we initiated the Phase 3 program for our ultra-rapid insulin. In terms of capital deployment, we entered into a global immuno-oncology collaboration with CureVac AG, focused on the development and commercialization of up to five cancer vaccine products based on CureVac's RNActive technology. And we returned over $500 million to our shareholders through our dividend. In other news, we received an important ruling upholding our Alimta method of use patent in the US IPR proceeding. If upheld, through all remaining challenges, Alimta would maintain US exclusivity until May 2022. Our performance in 2017 keeps us on track to achieve our midterm goals for each of our strategic objectives. Slides 5 and 6 contain more details on these events as well as other key events since our July earnings call. I'd highlight that we've submitted abemaciclib for advanced breast cancer in Europe and Japan, and the US FDA granted a Priority Review designation for the abemaciclib MONARCH 3 NDA. Along with Incyte, we announced that the NDA for baricitinib in RA will be resubmitted before the end of January 2018. After further discussions with the FDA, we've also submitted the sNDA to include the KEYNOTE-021G data in the Alimta label. We announced a series of actions to accelerate our efforts to focus our resources on developing new medicines and improve our cost structure. And earlier this morning, we announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives for our Elanco Animal Health business, including an IPO, a merger, sale or retaining the business. Moving to our financial results, slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insight into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for the detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you can see the revenue increase of 9% that I mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 75.1%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and negative product mix, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by over 70 basis points. Total operating expenses increased 3%, with marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreasing 1%, and R&D expenses increasing 7%. As mentioned earlier, as a percent of revenue, OpEx declined by over 310 basis points. The decrease in marketing, selling and administrative expenses was driven by lower spending on late lifecycle products, partially offset by higher spending on our new products. The increase in R&D expenses was driven by a milestone payment related to the BACE inhibitor we're developing in collaboration with AstraZeneca and to a lesser extent, higher late stage clinical development costs. Other income and expense was an expense of $14 million this quarter compared to income of $27 million in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 18.9%, a decrease of 310 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, primarily driven by a net discrete tax benefit this quarter of approximately $30 million. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share both increased 19%. We achieved this significant earnings growth by delivering high single-digit, volume-based revenue growth while significantly reducing our OpEx ratio, creating positive leverage. Slide 10 details the same non-GAAP measures for September year-to-date while slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 24 and slide 25. Moving to slide 12, let's take a look at the effects of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. The effect of foreign exchange was minimal this quarter. Excluding the slight headwind from FX, our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 9%, and was driven by volume, to a much lesser extent, by price. It's worth noting that in our human pharma business, each major geographies drove volume growth again this quarter. By geography, you'll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 10% primarily driven by volume. Trulicity, Basaglar, and Taltz were the main drivers of this growth, with recent loss of exclusivity leading to large volume declines for both Strattera and Effient. It's also worth noting that last year's third quarter included a $145 million benefit from a Cymbalta returns reserve reversal. Excluding this from the base period, our U.S. product growth was 17%. Moving to Europe, pharma revenue grew 7%, excluding FX, driven almost entirely by volume despite headwinds on Alimta due to generic erosion in certain countries as well as competitive and pricing pressures. Excluding Alimta, the rest of our European pharma revenue grew 13% on a performance basis. This was led by Trulicity. In Japan, despite a large negative impact from the entry of generic Zyprexa last June, pharma revenue increased 13%, excluding FX. Excluding Zyprexa, the rest of our Japan pharma revenue grew 17% in performance terms this quarter led by Cyramza, Cymbalta, and Trulicity. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 9% on a performance basis this quarter led by Humalog and Trulicity. Turning to animal health. Excluding the impact of FX, worldwide revenue increased 4% driven by volume. Food animal product revenue declined by 7% while companion animal product revenue increased 34%. On a performance basis, excluding the BI U.S. vaccines acquisition and adjusting for last year's purchasing pattern, our animal health revenue decreased 10%, with food animal product revenue down 7% and companion animal product revenue down 17%. The food animal decline was driven primarily by market access pressure as well as by competitive pressure in U.S. cattle. While the companion animal decline was due to competitive pressures affecting Trifexis, our flea, heartworm, and intestinal parasite product. Slide 13 outlines the same information for our September year-to-date results. Now let's look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on slide 14. In total, our new products comprised of Trulicity, Basaglar, Taltz, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Cyramza, Olumiant, and Portrazza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 13.7 percentage points of volume growth over the same quarter last year. While the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa, and Evista provided a drag of 610 basis points. Slide 15 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $1.2 billion in revenue this quarter and now represent nearly 22% of our total worldwide revenue, up from just 18% last quarter. Moving to slide 16, as I mentioned earlier, changes in foreign exchange rates had essentially no effect on our Q3 2017 revenue growth. Similarly, FX had no meaningful impact on our operating expense growth. FX did, however, have a large effect on growth in cost of sales and, consequently, in operating income and EPS. For example, growth in non-GAAP EPS was 19%, including the effects of foreign exchange, and 30% in constant currency terms. This is consistent with the 28% growth we've seen year-to-date. Now, I'll turn the call over to Derica for a review of our overall corporate pipeline, progress on potential key events, and an update on our 2017 financial guidance. Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Slide 17 shows select NMEs as of October 17. Movements since our last earning calls include the U.S. approval of abemaciclib for advanced breast cancer, the U.S. submission of galcanezumab for migraine prevention, the initiation of Phase 3 for our ultra-rapid acting insulin; the addition of a Phase 1 immunology asset from our recent collaboration with Nektar Therapeutics, and termination of development of two Phase 1 assets. Our select NILEX pipeline, shown on slide 18, reflects the 3 and 4.5-milligram dulaglutide study and the negative outcome of the abemaciclib lung cancer study, JUNIPER. Turning to slide 19, you can see the considerable progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2017. Dave and I have already mentioned many of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call, so I'll simply comment on just one change. Following the positive data presented at EADV, we now expect to begin the Phase 3 program for baricitinib in atopic dermatitis before the end of this year. Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 20, you'll see that we've raised and narrowed the range for revenue to $22.4 billion to $22.7 billion, primarily due to the uptake trends we're seeing for our new pharmaceutical products and, to a lesser extent, to a stronger euro. We've also narrowed the range for full year R&D expense to a range of $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. We've decreased our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to reflect the tax effect of this quarter's business development and restructuring charges as well as the discrete tax benefit mentioned earlier. For EPS, we've raised our non-GAAP EPS range by $0.05 to $4.15 to $4.25 per share, and we've reduced our GAAP EPS range to $1.73 to $1.83 per share. Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up. We've delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Led by our new products, worldwide revenue grew 9%. By making disciplined investments in our business, we leveraged our top line growth into 19% non-GAAP EPS growth or 30% growth when excluding FX. We continue to have strong momentum behind our innovation-based strategy. Since our last earnings call, we received U.S. approval for and launched Verzenio. We've submitted galcanezumab for migraine prevention here in the U.S. We started Phase 3 for our next-generation mealtime insulin and we bolstered our pipeline with the CureVac deal. We also announced actions to focus our resources on developing new medicines and to improve the company's cost structure, as well as the review of strategic alternatives for our Elanco Animal Health business. Going forward, our management team will remain focused on launching new products with excellence, reloading our late-stage pipeline, driving increased productivity to expand our operating margins, and investing in our core drivers for our business \u2013 talent, scientific capabilities, and technology platforms \u2013 to ensure our future growth prospects. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Derica. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two or one two-part question. Now, Alan, if you can go ahead and provide the instructions for the Q&A session. We're ready for the first caller. Operator : Absolutely. First question will come from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Go ahead, please. One moment. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. On Trulicity, an important growth driver, you guys called it out a major future growth driver. I'm wondering if you can just give us your thoughts on the curve of that product as we go into 2018 because you are facing new branded competition from Novo's weekly product. I think they had some compelling head-to-head data. I'm wondering how you think that might impact your product. And equally, importantly, they have their oral GLP-1, I think it was in several Phase 3 readouts coming in 2018, and I'm wondering if you can give us your opinion of the viability of that program. It seems that if they had a good clinical profile, that could be problematic for injectable GLP-1s. Reducing the clinical profile of that product will, in fact, be problematic. And then on Humalog, no biosimilar yet approved. You guys have I think a patent that you could potentially exert and leverage into a delay or maybe a settlement with Sanofi. Can you give us any update there? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Tim, thank you for the question. So Enrique will go to you for the questions on Trulicity heading into 2018 with new branded competition coming and thoughts on the oral GLP-1 space. And then we do have our General Counsel, Mike Harrington, with us. So, Mike, if you'd like to give the update on litigation with Sanofi. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Well, thank you for the question. And indeed, Trulicity is having a terrific year. It's a unique time when it comes to innovation in diabetes. Let me try to maybe frame some comments and provide some color as we think about Trulicity going forward. I will not provide an outlook for the product but some things to think about. The biggest opportunity for Trulicity is when we think about this class, and when we look at injectables, GLP-1 as a class still represent less than 30% of the basal insulin prescription. We see significant benefits when it comes to the GLP-1 class, so the opportunity for growth is very significant. Trulicity has an enviable position in this market by the benefit that it basically offers when it comes to the real-world efficacy of the product, of course the once-weekly dosing. And we have a single-dose pen that is ready to use and does not require basically managing or seeing the needle, which is so important for a patient that is transitioning, in many cases, from an oral medicine. Now, clearly, we do have competition, yes. But I think what we have to keep in mind too is that the competition is also going to help fuel the overall growth of the class. The class has very healthy growth and we expect that that's going to be a continued catalyst for Trulicity as we think about the growth of the class and the type of position that we have in the market. Our trends continue to be very solid for the product. Clearly, when it comes to sema, we'd like to see all of their data when it comes to SUSTAIN 7, but we feel good about the position that we basically have when we look at both the combination of our efficacy and the safety profile that our product offers. You asked about oral GLP-1s. That is an area of interest to us. We do see the innovation in the space as important, but we need to wait for all of their data to basically come out before I can make more comments. And then I believe that Mike is going to comment on Humalog. Michael J. Harrington - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Tim, for your question. The deadline under the Hatch-Waxman Act for Lilly to challenge Sanofi has expired and we have not filed suit to challenge their follow-on biosimilar. As you know, Tim, the Hatch-Waxman Act notice process provides an opportunity for a company to carefully assess whether a follow-on product infringes patents listed in the Orange Book for a particular product. The only remaining Orange Book-listed patent that we have, that is relevant to this discussion, protects our KwikPen delivery device, and we have thoroughly analyzed both the Sanofi device and our own device. Lilly's KwikPen is an innovative device that offers a number of advantages for patients. But for purposes of analyzing the patents, it's a fundamentally different device than the Sanofi pen that they intend to use with their follow-on lispro. We always vigorously defend our intellectual property, and we'll continue to do so aggressively, but we don't engage in litigation to enforce patents unless there is a factual and legal base to do so. And here, we didn't have a factual and legal basis to support litigation. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Mike, thank you for the update. Alan, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Sure. That'll be from Dave Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Mr. Risinger, your line is open. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sorry. My apologies. I had it on mute. So thanks very much for taking my questions. My first question is with respect to the animal health business. So you've announced that you're exploring strategic alternatives. Could you just provide a little bit more color on the timing? Why now? I know that this is something you've contemplated for years, but the business' organic growth hasn't been inspiring recently. And so it'd be helpful for you to just provide a little bit more color about why now and how you see the business' organic growth prospects going forward. And then second, with respect to Forteo, I believe there may potentially be generic entry in the U.S. and Europe in 2019, but it would be helpful to get your perspective on how investors should think about the generic threat to Forteo in 2019. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Dave, thank you for the questions. So Dave Ricks, if we can have you answer the question on alternatives that are being explored and timing for the Elanco Animal Health review. And then Christi, if you want to comment on the outlook for Forteo post generic entry? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. We haven't touched on the short-term operational things, and we may get other calls on that. I mean, it is true. We've had some challenges in the business this year. We don't look at the question of how we should position Elanco in the short-term; we think of it as long-term. And we've been, as you point out, asked this question for a long time; it's a natural one to ask. I think where we think we are now, why now, is over the last many years we've grown this business rather substantially through acquisition but also through our own organic actions, and we now have a global business that's highly competitive. It's a top-tier animal health business, amongst the top five globally, and we participate in all of the relevant segments of animal health. Most recently, combining BI's vaccine business in North America coupled with Novartis, and it's taken some work to fully operationalize and get those companies pulled together in a way that we think where this company is poised to compete effectively and really grow aggressively ahead. And so now is a good time having completed those acquisitions and scale the business to reflect on the best posture for Elanco Animal Health. And as we said today, we're exploring options. We expect to be able to get back to investors by mid-2018 with the results of our analysis. And the full range of options are in scope : keeping the business, IPO or spin, or perhaps some other combination that we might determine as the best way to maximize the value to Lilly shareholders. So we'll follow-up with you as that process progresses but we think this is a good time to step back and look at this question. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. On the Forteo question, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Forteo, and the data continues to support how strong it is in the fracture prevention and treatment. And so as we look at Forteo in the future, we do have the same estimate as you do, which is the expiration of the patent being in 2019, and that's across U.S., major Europe, and Japan. Obviously, it is difficult to make Forteo; it's not easy. So that will really be the question mark, but our estimates are that 2019 is when we'll lose that intellectual property protection. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Christi. Alan, if we can go to next caller? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Welcome. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Alan, next caller, please? Operator : Sure. That will come from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Go ahead, please. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thanks. A couple of questions. I'm surprised you haven't (26:45) ... Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Andrew, it's very low volume and it's cutting in and out a little bit. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Sorry about that. Is that any better? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, thank you. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Terrific. So I was saying I'm surprised that I haven't seen Lilly use their balance sheet for any more substantial business development within oncology given the reshaping of the business. Could you just maybe share a little bit of color. Is that a question of the bid-ask spread? Is it available assets? Is it a clinical base that needs to be turned over? What is potentially delaying that? And the second, the relative performance of Taltz versus your competitor, Cosentyx, especially in the last quarter would seem to disfavor Lilly. Could you outline what are the in-market dynamics that are driving this disproportionate marketing and how you're thinking about adjusting going forwards? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Andrew, thank you for the questions. Derica, if you'll address the question on using our balance sheet for business development and oncology, and then the impediments we're seeing to actioning that. And then Christi to comment on dynamics with Taltz and Cosentyx in that market. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Hi, Andrew. Good morning. We have no apprehension or reservations about using our balance sheet to pursue our therapeutic goals, whether it's in oncology or across our other therapeutic segments in which we compete. And we do continuously look at the marketplace for external asset opportunities that we'd like to pursue. Most recently, you've seen just this year, three years, three deals in the area of oncology. Now, all of those are early-stage deals, and that's by design. That's the area that we've chosen to focus on. If we can find late-stage assets like we did with CoLucid at the beginning of this year, we'll pursue that as well. In regards to market prices, oncology is still a very expensive real estate, and one of the things we have to make sure that we do in protecting our shareholders is that we do good diligence on those opportunities we look at. And sometimes, it is tough finding value in some of the assets at the market prices at which they're being touted. So that's something we've been cognizant of and that's why we've chosen to look to go earlier rather than later if we can. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Derica. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. Andrew, so on Taltz, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Taltz, especially as we see patients with clear skin. And as you look at the dermatology office, defining our competitors, really is not the IL-17 versus the IL-17. What you see is really the TNFs really not reaching that clear status. And the more we have new agents like the IL-17s and the newer agents that are coming out, the more that we'll see the expectations of both physicians and patients increase. A couple of those details for you on what you're seeing in the numbers. If you look at the data, there's a couple of things. One is Cosentyx has added free goods to their NBRx data, so IMS tells us there's a lot of volatility in that data and it will take weeks or maybe even months for that to actually level out. So what we're looking at is actually the net sales. And if you look at net sales in the U.S., in the dermatology office, we are performing the same as Cosentyx was at the same period of time, which is pretty remarkable for a second entry into the market. And usually, if you got 80% that would be great. But for us to be able to do that, so we continue to feel very good about it. The other thing to note is we do see seasonality in the summer time. So as you look at it, specifically in the dermatology office with psoriasis, that's where you'll see the seasonality. You don't see that with psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, so that is another thing that's kind of clouding the numbers as you see the seasonality more affect our numbers because we're all in the derm office right now. And then as you look into the future, we're very excited to hear from the FDA by the end of the year, which is we continue to see the breadth and depth of prescribers continue to increase. We see our early adopters increasing their number of prescriptions. We see more physicians trying Taltz. With the psoriatic arthritis launch and our entry into the rheumatology office in December and January, given FDA approval, we should see another step level increase in Taltz. So we're very confident and continue to believe in the Taltz performance. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Christi. Alan, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : That will be from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First on DowElanco. Can you remind us, Dave, what the operating margin is on that business? I seem to recall that's a lower-margin business than your base business, but your overall operating margins, at around 22% or so, are well below the industry average. So if you contemplate spinning that business or selling that business, can you talk sort of generally about what impact you would see that having on your overall margins? And then secondly, just given the opportunity to take advantage of the risk of the P/E overcharge given where Zoetis is trading, what do you think you will do with those proceeds? And just if I can ask a question about the cost-cutting announcement that you made a couple of months ago, the 3,500 physicians that you are reducing. That has generated some debate among investors regarding your confidence and your ability to hit your sort of mid-single-digit top line growth projection over the intermediate term. Can you shed a little bit of light on the reason for the additional cost-cutting program? I know that should lead to an improvement in operating margins. But should we think of this as an insurance policy against the top line growth opportunity or should we look at this as above and beyond how the company expects to perform going forward? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Jami, thank you for the question. If I can, I'm going to reorder our answers just to sort of get the flow going here. So Dave, if you wouldn't mind handling the head count reduction question, the last one Jami had first. You're going to provide any comments on Elanco margins. Then Jeff, feel free to complement that answer if you'd like. And a little bit of Derica for the question around use of proceeds if we're having a transactions-yielding proceed in the future. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Jami. You used the DowElanco name. That's harkening back to the old days, so it's just Elanco now but appreciate the question. On the cost-cutting, so we announced this in early September. This has no relation to our belief about the revenue line, just to be clear. What we're looking at is looking beyond our long held out, this 2018 target of 15% operating expense as a percent of sales, and we've said for some time, qualitatively, that that was a stepping stone on a way to a more productive, higher operating margin company. These actions put us further down that road. That's how we're thinking of them, both to become more competitive with our operating margins but also to free up cash flow and operating spend capacity to invest in R&D. We see a number of late-stage projects that have read out positively more than we expected. They're now launching but we need to invest behind those with important new indications and other uses, like Verzenio in an adjuvant setting, like Olumiant in atopic dermatitis like we spoke about today. So that's what it's for. It's about our quest to become even stronger for the future. Nothing to do with our conviction on the 5% revenue growth, which I remind investors we did 9% again this quarter. And we continue to trend above that CAGR we committed to. And although we know 2018, we'll be facing some more generic events, we're very confident on the 5% by 2020. So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff on the Elanco operating margin story. We can compare that to Lilly afterward. And Derica can comment on the balance sheet. Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. So Jami, just on our margin as we've shared pretty openly, as we've come to the integrations of Novartis as well as (35:10) and now BI, we've been hovering around 20% for the past two years. We feel good not only this assessment but our strategy going forward on our margin expansion opportunities, as we've been pretty open about. And we've got a pretty aggressive agenda. We announced two events this quarter that are a part of that agenda, that is well underway. And the first was our consolidation of our Larchwood, Iowa manufacturing facility into our Fort Dodge, the BI acquisition facility. As well as we're seeking options for rbST. The two big drivers that give us this current state is, no question, some of the forces in the lower sales and the other is product mix. And we're working aggressively not only to drive these margins closer, as we've said, to the 30% over time. That will not happen here in the short-term, but over time that'll happen by both the margin expansion productivity agenda as well as the innovation that drives our product mix change. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Derica? Derica W. Rice - Eli Lilly & Co.: Jami, in regards to potential proceeds, we haven't gotten that far in our thinking. Right now, what we're really focused on is what's the best path forward in terms of maximizing the value of the animal health asset on behalf of the Lilly shareholders. And as Dave highlighted, we'll look at that full array of options before us. That having been said, even back to the earlier question that Andrew asked, we have the balance sheet capacity today to pursue the types of opportunities that we're interested in. So while we're contemplating these strategic alternatives for Elanco, it is not inhibiting us or preventing us from moving forward with our current organic and inorganic strategy in terms of assets we want to pursue. So we're still moving full speed ahead. And as Dave highlighted earlier, back to your 5%, over the last three years, and recall when we gave the guidance in 2015, we've averaged, in terms of top line growth, somewhere between 7% to 9% in each year. And this year, as Dave said, we're tracking towards 9% growth. So we're very confident that we can meet that minimum threshold of 5% for the decade, which take us out through 2020, and we think we're actually well on track to achieve that. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Derica. Jami, thanks for the question. Alan, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Yes, sir. That will come from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on a couple of things. One, on baricitinib perhaps. Just curious what your confidence is on the 4-milligram dose in particular. And then secondly, just touching up again on lispro. Can you confirm \u2013 and I heard the prior comments \u2013 but can you confirm that there's no settlement at present between you and Sanofi on the lispro launch? And then also, how do you think about lispro launch? And in theory, how should or shouldn't it be different than Basaglar versus Lantus? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Umer, thank you for the question. I assume with the 4-milligram, you're referring to the ongoing review at the FDA for our rheumatoid arthritis application. Is that correct? Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Correct. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. So Christi, we'll go to you for the question on baricitinib 4-milligram. Mike Harrington, if you'd like to comment on whether or not there's any kind of settlement with Sanofi. And then Enrique for the dynamics that you could might think about for the launch of lispro, whenever that occurs here in the future. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: So I think it's important as we discuss the 4 milligrams of baricitinib to see, well, how is it doing, where we are commercializing the 4 milligrams. As we look at Europe, for example, specifically in Germany, the launch in Germany not only exceeds our internal expectations. But as you look at the five months in which it's been available, it has exceeded every rheumatoid arthritis launch in history, including Humira. So as we look at that uptake in the 4 milligrams is the majority of the use. And we see what the patients are seeing in coming back to their offices where they were debilitated. They've tried other agents and they've gone on baricitinib and, really, things like in Japan are now able to drive where they haven't been able to before. It's really life-changing. So as we look at the U.S. and our discussions with FDA and the ongoing conversations we continue to have, the 4 milligrams is imperative for these patients to get the benefit and the efficacy that they need to be able to go about their daily life. So it is still our strategy that we believe in the 4 milligrams. We're seeing it play out in the real world and we look forward to having the resubmission, and it is on track to happen before the end of January as we had mentioned in the past. And then after that, we'll have a six-month clock in which we'll get a read, but we're very optimistic. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Christi. Mike? Michael J. Harrington - Eli Lilly & Co.: And Umer, I can confirm there is no settlement agreement in place between Lilly and Sanofi related to their follow-on lispro. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Mike. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So there are a few things to consider when we basically compare and contrast the basal insulin situation vis-\u00e0-vis mealtime insulin, and when we enter, of course, with Basaglar and all of the learnings that we've got there and then hopefully we can apply those learnings in reverse in a certain way. So first, the basal insulin class was significantly more open at the time that Basaglar entered. So we had a number of different basal medicines in formularies, and that's relative to the mealtime insulin space where most formularies are really under exclusive status, and that leads to lower prices. So the situation today and the economics for the payers today are such that it was easier to create viable economics for the payer in the basal insulin space relative to where we are in the mealtime insulin space. Two is that in the case of Humalog, we have a full range of formulations, not just Humalog but Humalog mixtures. We have a concentrated mealtime insulin, Humalog U-200, and we recently even just launched the Humalog KwikPen Junior (sic) [Humalog Junior KwikPen] (41:41), which basically is the first half-unit pre-filled pen in the market. So we're excited by that offering and we do believe that our offering gives us some strength when it comes to a follow-on lispro just coming into the market. Of course, it's additional competition and we have to see when will they launch. It is likely that they have to resubmit, of course, to get final approval. And that's probably a question from a timing perspective for Sanofi. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Alan, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : That will be Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning. Enrique, back to Trulicity, if I may. To what degree is the growth due to switches from Victoza versus that from orals straight to Trulicity? Part B of this is does or would diabetic retinopathy actually cloud the class assuming that's part of the warning of semaglutide in the label? And then the second question is really around abemaciclib in non-small cell lung cancer. Well one trial did not show OS, and I'm curious your confidence on the other trials specifically in non-small cell lung cancer. Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Tony, thank you for the question. So Enrique, the first two for you on the source of Trulicity growth as well as if the diabetic retinopathy that was seen in one of the Novo studies might impact the overall class. And then Sue, over to you for a discussion on the other trials that are ongoing for abemaciclib in non-small cell lung cancer. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Very good. When it comes to the source of Trulicity growth, I think it's important to highlight that our strategy from the very beginning was not to focus on current GLP-1 users. So most of our strategy has been on additional adoption by specialists and then, really, the breadth in primary care. I believe the strategy has been highly successful, so the source of our business by a very significant amount. I don't have the actual figures with me but it's minimal whatever we get in terms of switching from other GLP-1s. We'd like for that to continue given the opportunity when it comes to patients on oral medicines that could benefit from better control. When it comes to retinopathy, the data for Trulicity I think is very clear. We do not have a signal when it comes to retinopathy. We have to see how a potential warning or how the labeling of retinopathy for semaglutide will basically readout. But clearly, we see significant advantages of GLP-1s in general, and we are counting on significant growth of this class as we think about Trulicity. I think that is probably one of the most important drivers of overall value for this asset. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Enrique. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, sure. Tony, with regard to the JUNIPER study which was abemaciclib in KRAS mutation-positive advanced lung cancer, we did not see an overall survival advantage. I should mention we did see though interesting singulation activity in progression-free survival and overall response rate. And this is the first study that has been prospectively looking at erlotinib in KRAS mutation-positive breast cancer. And without giving you full data, we did use historical control and had assumed basically I think about a 6.5-month overall survival with erlotinib. We saw higher than that. What we are continuing to progress though other studies in lung cancer, and we continue to be confident in those, particularly around rational combinations. We do believe, particularly with regards to KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer, which is really hard to treat, that rational combinations will be important and we've got a number of those ongoing, including IO combination with abemaciclib in combination with PI3K/mTOR, and also we've got a Phase 2 squamous lung study ongoing. In addition to that, we're looking at other tumors as well. So our lifecycle plan continues to look at progressing abemaciclib, Verzenio now, in breast cancer but also in other tumor types. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: You're very welcome. Alan, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : That will be Marc Goodman with UBS. Go ahead. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, morning. If we look in the Phase 2 pipeline there, there's eight products. I think many of us know the base but several of the others are not as well-known. Can you just talk about some of the products and where we should be focused and what kind of data we should be expecting and where there's excitement there? And then just secondly on Basaglar. It had a very strong uptick relative to the script trend, so I was just wondering if there was any stocking or anything unusual in inventory change there. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Marc, thanks for the question. So Jan, if you'd like to take the lead on the Phase 2 pipeline question. Others, feel free to augment that answer if you'd like. And then Enrique, anything unusual on the quarter on the Basaglar numbers, so if you can comment on that. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. So let me start in immunology with mirikizumab, our IL-23 P19 antibody, which is tested in psoriasis as well as the two IBD indications, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's. And we are expecting data, well, early next year. The first half for particularly psoriasis will come first. In immunology, we also have the oral BTK inhibitor, the Bruton tyrosine kinase, which we are testing in RA, with also data coming next year and we are interested clearly because it's another potential oral agent in the immunology space. For diabetes, we have two agents. The first one is GIP/GLP-1. It's a dual agonist then of two different mechanists to lower body weight and also having potentially a better glucose control. We are particularly interested in this agent since in pre-clinical models it had actually better efficacy than any other GLP-1 agent studied, including semaglutide. The DACRA is another variant then of incretin-like molecules with the amylin and also the calcitonin simulating receptor agent. And the reason here is to have not only body weight lowering but also potentially insulin sensitization activity. And clearly, these two agents are somewhat in parallel for readouts. And we also have a high-dose dulaglutide coming about the same time, and then I think we will make a choice about what is the next potential Phase 3 then in the insulin space. The BACE inhibitor we also have in Phase 2 is a very potent oral agent that has potentially less peripheral issues in relation then to targeting BACE2. And we are actually running this also as kind of a backup to lanabecestat, as you know, which is in Phase 3. And we're also considering potential combinations of this BACE inhibitor with N3pG since in pre-clinical models that has been shown to have an extraordinary clearance of not only plaques but also diffused amyloid. Perhaps Sue can talk about the oncology space. Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Well prexasertib we have in Phase 2 in ovarian cancer. We are specifically looking at developing this medicine, looking at biomarkers. So first, you look in ovarian cancer and then we will progress hopefully with a biomarker-driven registration study should the Phase 2 data warrant that. Merestinib, we are developing actually this medicine in biliary tract cancer. We have a study for both Cyramza and merestinib in biliary tract cancer. Depending on the data on the Phase 2 on that, we would progress one or either, potentially both, but probably one or either of those medicines in that indication. And PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, we're really developing that as a combination therapy and we have, as I mentioned earlier, a combination of PI3K/mTOR with abemaciclib. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you. Enrique, on Basaglar? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So we are very pleased with the performance of Basaglar and the continued adoption of Basaglar as a key basal insulin. When we look at the quarter, I think there's nothing on the stock inside but there was $12 million worth of benefit related to changes of the estimates of rebates and discounts for prior periods. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Alan, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Yes, sir. That'll be from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Partners. Go ahead, please. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Hello. Thanks for the question. So just a couple here. You guys have obviously evaluated the Elanco potential spin for quite some time. Dave, if you want to talk a little bit and just kind of get your sense of \u2013 in the current market we've seen companies make these types of announcements and then it takes a longer period of time to actually execute on the spin and then the results and disappointment. Just trying to get a sense of your commitments to offering a definitive conclusion as of the middle of 2018, as you stated in your press release. And if we could, just to get a sense, I think the spin is fairly obvious. But historically, most companies have talked about the synergies between the business. Dave, I was just hoping you could talk about if you see those synergies in the business any longer given the evolution of Lilly's business. And then my second question, we did see a few additional VTEs announced for a competitor JAK inhibitor in an ACR abstract. I wanted to know if there has been any change in the frequency or rate of VTE that you've seen in any of your clinical data or if it's still consistent, as part of the resubmission, if it's consistent with the rates that we've seen in the past which I believe you've stated are consistent with the historical rates of VTE for patients with RA. Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Seamus, thank you for the question. So Dave, we'll go to you for the first couple of questions on we'll be able to provide a definitive answer by mid-2018 on the strategy for Elanco going forward and your view on synergies with that business. And then over to Christi to talk about the rates we're seeing of VTE in our program with baricitinib. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Hi, Seamus, thanks for the questions. Of course, we came out today and said mid-2018 because that's where we believe we're going to hit, so that's our best estimate of being able to get back to investors, and we think that's ample time to evaluate the questions before us as we look at the options to maximize the value of this asset over the long-term. So that's our focus and I wouldn't wobble from that certainly today, day one. I think this is a business that has been \u2013 it does have some synergies with core Lilly but primarily is operating outside of the core business of Lilly. There is some back-office synergies we gain and, of course, we've talked through time about the R&D synergies. Although, as we look into that I think they are currently rather modest. One reason for that is the platforms used across animal health are different. We have a large vaccine portfolio that doesn't synergize with pharma R&D today. We have a feed additives assets that has really no synergy connecting to Lilly. On the companion side, therapeutics, that has some potential. But as we've looked at this, I think there's no reason to believe we couldn't maintain some of those synergies contractually if we had a different structure. So we are looking at all of this, and mid-year or next year is our deadline. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. In regards to thromboembolic events with baricitinib, we continue to monitor the real world evidence where we've launched commercially as well as accumulating data for our resubmission. As you know, the last time we submitted was January 2015, so we have much more data to resubmit. And everything that we've seen, we've seen nothing in our atopic dermatitis studies and everything is consistent, as we've said before, with normal background rates in the rheumatoid arthritis patient population. So no new news to report there. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Christi. Alan, next caller, please? Operator : That will be the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions here. Maybe first on Jardiance dynamics. You're obviously seeing very healthy share gains. But when you're thinking about overall category growth, are you happy with the trends we're seeing there, and what do you think is going to take to further expand usage of the class overall? My second question was a broader diabetes question. I know each segment is different but just as we've gotten maybe further into contracting season, et cetera, just any preliminary comments about 2018 in either pricing or access to the portfolio. Anything we should just be keeping in mind as we think out to next year? And then my follow-up question was on Elanco as we think about strategic options. Do you believe further consolidation among large animal health players is possible from an anti-trust perspective, as we think about the various kind of options that you're considering with this strategic review? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Chris, thank you for the questions. Enrique, the first couple for you on Jardiance, in particular class growth and potential catalysts with that going forward. And then the diabetes 2018 access picture, to the extent that you can comment. And Dave, if you can talk through the question on the Elanco consolidation and the animal health industry question. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So Jardiance has pretty quickly become the new standard when it comes to initiating patients on an SGLT2 therapy. Our share now when it comes to new to brand prescriptions is now north of 50%, and the overall trends when it comes to volume or share I think are very strong. Of course, when we look at the class, we do see some dynamics related to the overall leader of the class. But as we think about the long-term opportunity for this product, we need to focus much more on Jardiance than on the class and the trend that basically Jardiance can continue to have. Clearly, the opportunity is enormous. Let's keep in mind that there are 160 million prescriptions written for oral medicines in the United States, and SGLT2s have only 10 million of those. And we are basically looking at a product that has an indication to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death for people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, which we believe is about 30% or so of the people with diabetes. So (58:26-58:37) the opportunity is enormous and we are thinking of that opportunity with that lens in mind. When it comes to 2018 and as we think about pricing and access, I think clearly the different pharmaceutical benefit managers have already announced their formularies, but we do see a continuation of the trends when it comes to pricing pressures in diabetes. There was one notable exception that we saw that we were surprised, and that was the exclusion of Jardiance from the CVS health formulary. We, of course, are very disappointed with this decision and we don't believe this is in the best interest of patients given the profile of Jardiance from a safety perspective and the label when it comes to cardiovascular and the fact that a competitor has a black box related to amputation. So we'll make our case with the physicians and with the patients. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Enrique. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. So Elanco is a combination still possible in the sector. Obviously, animal health has had a lot of combinations. We've been a part of that. But to answer the question, you really have to look at the facts of the combination you might be looking at. So I guess, yes, it's possible but we need to look at the product mix that would be resulting in any combination and then determine the anti-trust risk. We do think that's an avenue but we'd have to look at the facts in each geography. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. If we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : That will be John Boris with SunTrust. Go ahead, please. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. First question just has to do with abemaciclib. Listening to the Novartis call this morning, it certainly seems as though the launch of Kisqali has certainly underwhelmed Novartis. What have you learned from the Pfizer and both the Novartis launches relative to the profile of abemaciclib as we track this product going forward here that gives you confidence that it'll have some relatively robust uptake? And then second question, just has to do with pricing in particular. Questions we get all the time are the difference between gross to net and the FDA's approval of so many innovative agents in therapeutic categories that, over time, is going to lead to an increase in the gross to net differential as discounting and rebating plays a much greater role. Dave, how do you think about the business especially your most profitable affiliate, the U.S., in managing that going forward to add some comfort to investors who take a long-term view and invest for the long-term? And then on the patient front, obviously a lot of discounts and rebates certainly aren't passed onto customers as their deductibles and their co-pays are going up. What's a potential solution? Is there one out there to potentially ensure that a greater amount of that discount and rebate gets back into the customers' pocket so they can afford the new innovative medicines that you have here going forward? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you for the questions, John. So Sue, we'll go to you for things we've learned from the Ibrance and Kisqali launch as we think about launching Verzenio. And then Dave, the questions on managing the U. S. market, particularly the dynamics who'll be brought by more branded agents being approved and causing competition as well as what solutions there might be to help with the patient side of the equation where a lot of the cost increases have been occurring. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. John, thanks for the question. Clearly it's early days. We've only been a few weeks out in the market with Verzenio but we are very pleased with what we're hearing so far and our progress to-date. We can't give you any quantitative data because of timing, but from a qualitative perspective we are seeing our milestones on access being achieved. We got the channel access ahead of plan just literally days after approval. We've seen hospitals and pharmacists stocking the product and actually patients being started. What we're trying to do is to ensure that access is as easy as possible for patients and also that the first experience that patients and physicians have with Verzenio is good. What we are hearing is that the differentiating factors for Verzenio are resonating. The single-agent activity is a differentiator for Verzenio. Also, the fact that we can continuously dose, we've been proactive. From a side effect and safety profile, people are very appreciative of that and are telling us that the diarrhea is manageable. We're providing loperamide and support around that and people are very appreciative of that and saying it's manageable. What we're hearing from physicians is that they see Kisqali in more like palbo and that we have some differentiating features that they think are important and clinically relevant. So I'm very interested in giving you an update as we get further down the launch of Verzenio in the U.S. Just on that, we've also submitted to Europe and Japan based on the MONARCH 2 and the MONARCH 3 data. The single-agent activity data will also be included in that package. And we have just recently announced that we've also got priority review for the MONARCH 3, so that's in combination with AI, which means that the FDA is looking at an 8-month review versus a 12-month. And that's, as a reminder, based on the interim data from the MONARCH 3, so we hope to have final data on that either at the end of this year or next year. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Sue. Dave? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Thanks, John, for your question. If I have it correctly, what you're saying is as we think about the whole sector through time across all therapeutic areas, what underlying trends do we see that would affect the innovative pharma business and how does that affect our thinking about growth. I mean, I don't think we've ever been more bullish about the underlying science in the therapeutic areas we operate in, and that's good news for the pricing dynamics too. So just to put that together, where we see very competitive pricing dynamics are in relatively older categories with less differentiation and in more primary care versus specialty care. And the second one is really because primary care doctors are much more time-pressured in working through and building (01:05:26) in your office to deal with the various formulary for a broader set of products and specialists is a challenge for primary care doctors. Specialists have to set that up and work through it. So the anecdote for this long-term, which affects our strategy \u2013 I can't speak to the broader sector but we see where the investment is flowing, and I think it's consistent \u2013 is to continue to focus on creating more and more differentiated assets at launch, bigger effect sizes, more difference versus standard of care. I think we see an example in our recent launches with Trulicity who is going to a weekly from a daily or Taltz by getting 40% complete clearance versus what TNFs can do, which is somewhere in the mid-teens. That's the kind of medicines we need to be working on going forward, those that make a profound change versus the standard of care. And then investing through the life cycle so that you don't find yourself less differentiated as competitors continue to launch. Those are two dynamics that affect our thinking about the business. Now, coupled with specialty care, which is an underlying global trend, that there's more innovative opportunities in areas like immunology and oncology relative to other areas of scientific inquiry, and that happens to correlate highly with where reimbursement can happen a little more easily because the hurdles that are produced by the payer system, basically patients and providers are more willing to work through them for a more serious disease. I'm not saying that's a great answer for humanity long-term. I think we need to find a way to pay for and fund innovations in conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which are still some of the largest killers in the world. But that's just I think where both innovation is flowing and where our R&D dollars have. That affects our strategy and our thinking to continue to just stay ahead of. We'll be a price effect due to competition. The ultimate antidote is differentiation. In terms of patient, you're asking a very important question. We've seen in the U.S. the structural problem for many years of the pharmacy benefit having about 20% co-pay by patients out-of-pocket versus about 4%, 5% for services like hospital services. That really hasn't changed. What has changed is the number of patients who are exposed to very high deductibles, so there's both a cash flow issue during the year as well as just over all out-of-pocket increases, particularly for brand name drugs. Generic prices remain relatively low and penetration relatively high. We think an immediate step that should be taken in all segments is to pass through rebates to patients. This provides an immediate point-of-sale discount. I will share with you that that is something commercial payers are now offering in the 2018 cycle. We, ourselves, as an employer are evaluating that and we think that's a great step to ease out-of-pocket burden. We've advocated aggressively with CMS that that should be a policy at Part D, particularly for the donut hole. That's one solution to help seniors pay for their medications. And then I think long-term we need to ask I think a broader question which we can get at through value pricing mechanisms potentially which is to really ask are medicines a better way to deliver healthcare than other parts of the healthcare system. And if so, why do we ask patients to pay more for it? And I think that's a national debate we need to continue to engage in. Again, I think we're making great strides scientifically, but the system isn't well-equipped to help patients have affordable access to these eventually. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Dave. Alan, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Yes, sir. That will be Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: With respect of animal health, Jeff, perhaps you can comment with more granularity on some of the revenue pressures you're seeing and are they Elanco issues or industry issues. And where is your atopic dermatitis pipeline given the success of Apoquel (01:09:23)? Interested to know when you could show up in that market. And then for Enrique, a higher-level question beyond the sort of tit for tat on individual diabetes compounds. In the past, when we've met, you've suggested that there could be more of a push to partner with technology companies to enhance your overall diabetes franchise and solutions-based approach. So what can you say about that strategy at this point? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Gregg, thank you for the question. So, Jeff, commentary on the revenue pressures, what's Elanco versus industry in terms of dynamics, and a little bit of the pipeline and outlook for getting into the atopic dermatitis companion animal space. And then Enrique, a question over to you on our strategy for working with devices and device companies going forward. Jeff? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Greg, real quick, like, on animal health. I think I would just come back on Elanco just kind of to anchor back. We, again, grew 4% excluding FX. We did see strong growth in global poultry, and I think that overall sector is growing well. We grew 17%. And then, of course, the U.S. companion animal vaccine. The pressures really remain and I'll kind of separate them. One is all-around market access which is driven by the clean food kind of movement with antibiotics and productivity products. I think this is an industry issue depending on the product mix. And then I think competitive pressures that are coming from a combination, again, in food animal, that's a mix of economics of the industry as well as some generic pressure. So we saw that in U.S. cattle, both with beef and dairy. The companion animal parasiticide space, let me just highlight. As Dave mentioned, Trifexis was an issue where we lost some share. No question, I think everyone has seen increased spending. Innovation is getting rewarded so the new entrants have gained share. We still feel very good about companion animals and the parasiticide space in general given the size of our portfolio, existing portfolio in our heartworm platform as well as our pipeline. The market itself is still growing on the companion animal side and parasiticides. And then I think lastly is just the channel opportunities that are coming there. So, again, I think you've got some industry dynamics with cattle, beef, and dairy, and you've got some generic pressures a little bit there where there's lacking innovation on the food animal side. But overall, again, we see sectors like poultry, aqua, and even companion animals growing in the vaccine space. I think relative to atopic dermatitis, we're actively exploring several mechanisms here related to symptom treatment as well as interruption of disease process for the canine atopic dermatitis area. We're leveraging Lilly's experience here, no question, and we'll continue to advance some novel product concepts. Both large molecules and small molecule are being studied here, so it's an active platform in our pipeline and we're focused on this. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So we are, in fact, excited about the opportunity brought by the convergence of both pharmaceuticals and technology to be able to create differentiated solutions and to be able to provide comfort. And I think for an area like diabetes, we think that this could be pretty revolutionary, so that's something that we have a high interest on. I'm not prepared to share too much more than that, but just to say that we are actively working on it. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Alan, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : Yes, sir. That will be Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC: Thank you very much. On baricitinib, I have a follow-up to Seamus' question. So you stated that DVTs are in line with the expected background rate. Would you confirm that there has been no new imbalances even if they still remain within the expected background rate? And then on the second quarter call, Dr. Mahony said that KEYNOTE-189 top line release was not expected until late this year or early next. That was a surprising statement at that time given the September primary completion, but it has turned out to be correct. So I'm wondering if Dr. Mahony has any additional updates on the KEYNOTE-189 timing? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Steve, thank you for the questions. Christi, a question on DVTs, any new imbalances. And then Sue, any update on the KEYNOTE-189 readout timing. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. I can confirm there are no new imbalances in regards to DVTs. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. And, Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: And Steve, mine will be a quick answer, too. I don't have any update. I think you need to go to ESMO for any update on 189. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Alan, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : That will be Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the question. So one, I just want ask a question about the guidance, the more midterm guidance, and you mentioned the 5%-plus sales CAGR. And as we look at the models, I think our numbers and also consensus in general is a little bit less than that. So as you review the models, are there certain products that you'd highlight where you think the extra sort of $400 million or so in revenues may come by 2020 to get to that 5% number, and are there any expectations for business development that's built into that number? And then related to that, when do you think you're maybe comfortable giving us more guidance on 2020 in terms of OpEx or margins or maybe EPS growth or something along those lines? Thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Vamil, thank you for the questions. Josh, we're going to road test you here. So if you like to comment a little bit if are there any BD transactions or placeholders built into that midterm guidance and any kind of qualitative comments you can give around where the Street may be missing something and/or confidence in those numbers, and then when we might give more details on 2020 or further out years in terms of midterm guidance. Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. Thanks. First on the business development piece. We don't have future business development sales built into our projections around the 5%. As you know, we're very active in looking at external innovation and opportunities. So if we see those, those would obviously help or add to our projections. I think as it relates to the 5% goal itself, as Derica mentioned, we're very confident given the performance, again, this period was from 2015 to 2020. And you look at how we performed since 2015 and where we are today, we think we've got really strong momentum to get us to the 5% CAGR through 2020. I think when we look at the models, we don't provide product-level guidance. But I think our collective confidence is based on the strength of the new product portfolio. As we mentioned, they contributed 14 points of growth this quarter. And you look across that portfolio of opportunities, Trulicity, Jardiance, Basaglar, Olumiant, Taltz, abemaciclib, et cetera, and with the pain portfolio coming, we see that portfolio continuing to grow and continue to drive growth. So I think it's probably the collective performance of the new products that give us the confidence that we're well on our way towards that 5% target. I think as it relates to the OpEx guidance, we'll provide 2018 guidance in December on our call and you can expect us to provide some updates on how we see the remainder of the decade performing there. I think as Dave mentioned in an earlier answer as it relates to our margin guidance, we've used 2018 just as a mile marker along the way toward being a more productive and expanded margin company. And we'll look to provide some more color on that in our 2018 call this December. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Josh, thank you very much. Alan, next caller? Operator : Yes, sir. That will be from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Go ahead. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of quick ones. On baricitinib, on the back of the recent data in atopic dermatitis, maybe just help us with the size and scope of the Phase 3 program that you're starting later this year and what you guys see as the biggest product differentiator. And on the RA side for bari, should we expect any formal updates at medical meetings coming up, just broader safety question? And then a last one on Alimta. I know overall demand trends have, in fact, negatively impacted bio but what are you guys seeing with respect to first-line lung trends just of late? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Geoff, thanks for the question. So Christi, the first two to you. Sort of the size and scope of the Phase 3 program and potential areas for differentiation. Any updates to the RA safety database coming at medical meetings. And then Sue, over to you for the trends in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer for Alimta. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: So on the atopic dermatitis front, I think just to clarify, we've got a lot of questions on our Phase 2 data which I think is relevant for the question on what our Phase 3 study design looks like. So in our Phase 2 data readout, we were very pleased with the results. Unlike our competitors, one of the things that we looked at is what is the depth of efficacy that we could achieve. And what I mean by that is we actually took the very resistant patient to corticosteroids. So we took patients, for four weeks they were on a moderate dose of topical steroids, and those patients that responded were actually taken out of pre-randomization. So only those patients that were not responding to topical steroids were actually randomized to Phase 3. And so you had, first of all, resistant patients to steroids. But second of all, you had patients that had less disease severity, so the easy scores at baseline were around 20. Where you see our competitors who did the opposite used a washout period of four weeks where patients will have an increase disease activity, their easy scores actually started at 30 and 32. So being able to show the results that we did in that patient population really gives us a lot of confidence as we move to the Phase 3 studies, and we will study Phase 3 similar to what our competitors did now that we know the depth of the efficacy. So as we look at monotherapy, we look at various doses of the 1, 2 and 4 milligrams. We'll be looking at different dosing, lower and higher. We are very confident that we'll have a robust study with robust results. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And in terms of any updates from the RA program, safety updates coming at medical meetings, are there any \u2013 my understanding was that basically we may have some repeats of things that were done earlier this year but not necessarily new data? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Correct. So we have a press release that will be coming out soon. We have 33 different scientific releases on both baricitinib and Taltz at ACR. And baricitinib will be new analysis that we've seen on safety but no new surprises in a negative way. And we look forward to showing you those, and links to those will be within the press release. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Christi. Sue? Susan Mahony - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Geoff, with regards to Alimta. As you mentioned, we have been challenged by IO of taking the frontline setting over the past few months and we've been seeing a sort of steady decline. We are pleased to see that we have seen a flattening in the frontline share. We now have a 26% share of market in frontline. We've also seen an increase in the second line share as IOs move to frontline. And interestingly, as we're looking at the new to brand, we're seeing an increase in the uptake of Alimta with Keytruda in the frontline setting. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you for the update, Sue. Alan, next caller, please? Operator : It will be Richard Purkiss with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, please. Richard J. Purkiss - Piper Jaffray Ltd.: Yeah. Thanks. I have three questions for Enrique. Two quick ones. What proportion of patients initiating GLP-1 therapy in the U.S. now have some evidence of diabetic retinopathy? And then on average, in the U.S., how frequently are type 2 diabetic patients' retinas visualized? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Enrique, I won't try to repeat. I think you heard those clearly. So we'll go to you for the... Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Not the second part. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: So the first one was the percent initiating GLP-1 that have evidence of retinopathy. And the then the second one is that the percent of patients, diabetics in the U.S., that are actually being scanned currently to look for advanced retinopathy. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So excellent questions. Unfortunately, on the last question, not enough. There's really a nominal number of patients with diabetes that actually do get screening. When we look at a patient with diabetes, I don't have the specific numbers for GLP-1. But when we look generally for patients with diabetes, they're about 30% of patients with diabetes have some degree of retinopathy. If you were to look at the more serious retinopathy, which is vision threatening, we are looking probably at a number of 3% to 5%. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Alan, next caller, please? Operator : Yes, sir. That will be from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Go ahead, please. Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I just want to dig a bit more into the JAK and bari safety. So can you just help us understand a bit better what the additional data and exposure data that you have will achieve do you think in light of the questions the FDA have around your original submission because I think, as you referred to before, there was a cluster of events there on just how additional exposure data potentially changes that. Secondly, can you just tell us exactly what is the background rate data that you referred to in terms of what you think should be there in this population? Obviously, some of these clinical trial populations have different levels of cardiovascular risks, and I don't know if you've really talked to whether your view was that some of the trials you've had have a particularly high or relatively low cardiovascular risk. And then is there anything that you're doing differently in your Phase 3 atopic dermatitis trial in terms of crossover, length of exposure? Just other things to help address this question a bit more robustly going forwards. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Right. Christi, all those are for you. So additional safety data... Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Well maybe I'll resign. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: What we think it's going to achieve, what is that background rate that we're referring to in this population and what population is that. And then if there's anything we're doing with the atopic dermatitis studies in Phase 3 that could help shed light on this particular safety issue as well? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: So in terms of what the additional data will help us with, let me start with the background rates actually, if that's okay. Background rates in the rheumatoid arthritis patient population already are 0.3 to 0.8 per 100 patient years. So in the general rheumatoid arthritis patient, if they weren't on baricitinib, that would be the incidence that they report. And so when I say that our background rates are similar to that, our specific background rates during the development programs was 0.46 per 100 patient years. And so when I also say now since we've submitted in the real world evidence in atopic dermatitis and all of the data that we've accumulated, that background rate is still within the general rate of the rheumatoid arthritis patient. So hopefully that clarifies it. Our background rate is similar to what you'd see without using baricitinib in this patient population. The additional data I think as we discussed with FDA, you have your clinical trial program. We submitted it in January 15. Since then, when typically the FDA looks at approving a drug, they say is it safe and is it effective or is what does that balance. And now that we have real world evidence, when they look at that they're trying to protect patients. Now, that we have patients actually in the real world on baricitinib, why that is important is they can actually see in the real world when you're using baricitinib how does it really play out. And now that we've had over 5,000 patients with physicians using it in clinical practice, the way that someone normally would, not in a controlled environment, we believe that that gives even more confidence that our background rate matching rheumatoid arthritis in clinical trials as well as now in the in the real world evidence is consistent. And then as we look at atopic dermatitis, I think the thing that this confirms is if you look at the patient population of patients who actually had a thromboembolic event, each one of those patients had a high risk for those before they had a thromboembolic event. So in the atopic dermatitis trials, we see a much younger patient population, which is part of the reason we probably don't see any through the Phase 2 trials we've seen so far and why we wouldn't anticipate seeing that many or a difference as we move forward with the Phase 3 trials. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Christi. We may have some time for... Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC : It's very helpful. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: You're very welcome. We have time for one more question, Alan. Operator : That will be from the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Two questions, please, and a clarification. First, why did you discontinue the N3pG antibody in Alzheimer's? If I recall correctly at your Alzheimer's R&D day, this was highlighted particularly given that it is similar to aducanumab. So what's the incremental in you there that led to discontinuation? Second, on Elanco. Unless I'm not mistaken, it's not growing organically, excluding the BI vaccine acquisitions. So does it have enough of a pipeline and R&D productivity to sustain growth in line with the market? And then finally to clarifying Humalog. Did I hear you correctly that there are no legal barriers from your side preventing Sanofi from launching their biosimilars? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you for the questions, Alex. So Jan, if you'll answer the question on the discontinuation of the N3pG asset in the pipeline. Maybe Jeff and/or Dave, if you want to comment on sort of what are the growth drivers going forward and pipeline prospects for Elanco. And then Mike, if you want to clarify on the Humalog legal situation. Jan? Jan M. Lundberg - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. If we start with the FLAG-specific antibody, N3pG, as you can see on the pipeline chart we actually have three molecules for that target, and the frontrunner molecule is still then inside the pipeline as active. And the follow-on molecule did not meet the clinical criteria that we wanted, so hence we stopped it. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Just to be fair, we took a two to get one strategy in Phase 1 here. So I wouldn't over-read (01:29:09) the plan all along. And then Jeff, on the strength of the animal health pipeline? Jeffrey N. Simmons - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Alex, good question. Yes, we feel very good about our pipeline. Also, I think we launched a series of products last year and into this year that we're going to see growth on and then we'll talk more as we get near the end of the year in our guidance call and going into next year about additional launches. So it's not just the pipeline but I think existing launches that are occurring now and ones that are right on top of us. And then I think the last thing is we're shifting our mix into these faster-growing markets. So as I mentioned, the food animal vaccines, nutritional health, companion animals, and aqua. As our mix gets higher in those spaces, that'll also drive more additional growth. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Maybe if I could just add to that. Just to be clear, we're not growing organically this year. The growth is the BI addition in companion and we described the food animal pressures. I think though we're not evaluating this business through the lens of 2017 performance. We're looking at the last 10 years and we've built a globally competitive animal health company with a nice pipeline, with good opportunities to improve margins, and grow at pace \u2013 and in some segments above industry pace. And as we look forward and do this analysis, we'll be looking, again, at those long-term trends in animal health. And because we're broadly positioned across many of these segments, and we do have innovation coming, we do expect forward trends to reflect those assumptions as we do the analysis. So this year, we've washed out some challenges. We've had some performance challenges. BI has helped us in terms of the stated growth rate, but we're looking at this decision-making through a much broader lens of time. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you. Mike? Michael J. Harrington - Eli Lilly & Co.: Alex, you're correct. We have no legal basis to preclude Sanofi from entering the market. And as Enrique described earlier, we will compete with them in the marketplace. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Mike. That concludes the Q&A session. So, Dave, if you'd like to wrap up the call, please? David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, I would. Again, I want to recognize and thank both Maria Crowe who's been with us today for many years as well as Derica Rice for the last earnings call with us, the CFO, for a great performance through your careers and many contributions to our company. So thank you, again. We appreciate all of your participation on today's earnings call and your interest in our company. Through the first nine months of 2017, we generated solid revenue growth driven by volume of our new pharmaceutical products. And we continue to improve margins, leading to even faster income growth. We believe Lilly remains a compelling investment given the strength of our product portfolio, our top and bottom line growth prospects over the balance of a decade. Please follow-up with the IR team if we've not answered any questions on the call or if you have follow-up questions. That concludes the call today. Have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. If you should require assistance during the call, please press star then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir. David Ricks : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. I\u2019m Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Josh Smiley, our CFO; Dr. Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and Jeff Simmons, President of our Elanco Animal Health business. We\u2019re also joined by Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden, Kevin Hern and Phil Johnson of the IR team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community only. It is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. We closed 2017 with another strong quarter, delivering 7% revenue growth, 20% operating income growth, and important pipeline progress. Worldwide revenue growth was once again driven by our new pharmaceutical products. In addition, we continue to expand our margins. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by roughly 130 basis points, and total expense as a percent of revenue declined by over 340 basis points to 52.8%.  We made progress advancing our pipeline. The FDA approved and we launched Taltz for active psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. The European Commission approved Taltz for active psoriatic arthritis in the EU, and the FDA accepted our submissions for galcanezumab for migraine prevention as well as the resubmission of baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis. On the clinical front, we initiated a Phase III clinical program for baricitinib in atopic dermatitis. We announced that Cyramza did not show an overall survival benefit in first line gastric cancer, and we initiated clinical work on the connected diabetes ecosystem, including a trial to evaluate our automated insulin delivery system as well as development and clinical work on our connected insulin pen technology.  In terms of capital deployment, we announced an 8% increase in the dividend, reflecting our confidence in the continued growth prospects of the company, and we repurchased $100 million of stock.  We closed 2017 with strong momentum and we are well positioned to achieve our strategic deliverables in 2018 and beyond. Slide 5 contains more details on these events as well as other key events since our October earnings call. I would also note that our analysis of strategic alternatives for Elanco is proceeding well. We\u2019re on track to communicate our decision on our Q2 earnings call in July. This quarter, we\u2019ve included a few additional back-up slides on Elanco where you\u2019ll see that recent product launches delivered $40 million of revenue in Q4 and $144 million for the year. We are proud that in January a leading industry publication announced that Galliprant, a first-in-class anti-inflammatory treatment for canine osteoarthritis pain was named 2017\u2019s Best Companion Animal Product and Clynav, a DNA vaccine for Atlantic salmon took the top honors as the Best Food Animal Product. New product launch momentum continued as Elanco\u2019s R&D organization achieved important milestones in January with Galliprant receiving EU marketing authorization and Credelio, which protects dogs against fleas and ticks, receiving approval in the United States as well as Canada. We continued to execute on our Elanco business model changes in Q4, including exploring options for the RBST business, exiting select U.S. distribution agreements, and taking steps to reduce our manufacturing footprint.  Finally, the biggest news affecting Lilly since our last call was U.S. tax reform. We\u2019re pleased that Congress and the administration enacted tax reform that places U.S.-based companies on a more level playing field with our foreign-based competitors. This reform will allow U.S. companies like Lilly to be more competitive in the global race for innovation. For U.S. headquartered multinational companies, this reform does come with an entry cost through the one-time repatriation toll tax, but it\u2019s a net positive as it will enable us to access our global cash and will lower our 2018 effective tax rates. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Josh to discuss the impact and implications of U.S. tax reform, review our Q4 and full-year results, and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018. Joshua Smiley : Thanks Dave. On Slide 6, we outline the financial impact to Lilly, and as stated in our press release, we recognized an estimated charge of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter related to U.S. tax reform. This charge is comprised of the toll tax assessed on overseas cash and earnings, which totaled approximately $3.6 billion, partially offset by the changes in deferred taxes resulting from the transition to a US. territorial pact system, including the re-measurement of deferred taxes from 35% to 21%.  The other financial impact to Lilly is the effect on our ongoing tax rate. Based on our initial assessment, we expect U.S. tax reform to lower our 2018 effective tax rate by roughly 350 basis points from our prior guidance of approximately 21.5% to about 18%. The effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the benefits of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate partially offset by other provisions of the new tax law. Our revised 2018 tax rate guidance is subject to change as we further interpret the new law and as subsequent regulations and guidance are issued. In total across both our U.S. and international operations, we estimate that we may now utilize more than $9 billion of cash and investments that won\u2019t be required for day to day operations. Essentially all of this amount is held in U.S. dollars and we do not anticipate any issues in obtaining rapid access to these funds. We do not intend to hold this $9 billion in cash and investments for the long term. Over the course of 2018 and into 2019, we\u2019ll deploy this cash thoughtfully across our capital allocation priorities. First, we\u2019ll fund our existing marketed products and pipeline, including capital investments, in line with our current strategy. Next, we\u2019ll invest in business development to bolster our future growth prospects, and then we\u2019ll return cash to shareholders via increases to the dividend and share buybacks. While tax reform does provide ready access to additional funds, it does not alter our business development priorities. We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to augment our pipeline and to bolster our commercial presence in core therapeutic areas of diabetes, oncology, immunology, neurodegeneration, and pain. This could come via in-licensing or acquisition. As we\u2019ve stated previously, much of our efforts will be focused on clinical stage assets pre-proof of concept.  Since the new tax legislation in the U.S. reduces our reliance on debt to fund U.S. cash needs, we will adjust our cash and debt levels going forward. In the near term, we\u2019ll use roughly $2 billion of our repatriated cash to reduce our gross debt level. Finally, we expect to conduct some level of share repurchases under our existing authorization, which still has $2 billion remaining. Hopefully this gives you a better understanding of the impact of tax reform and how we intend to use our global cash. Now let\u2019s move to our financial results. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while Slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I\u2019ll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today\u2019s press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter GAAP results.  Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 9, you\u2019ll see the revenue increase of 7% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 76.5%. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and product mix, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue increased roughly 130 basis points. Total operating expense remained essentially flat with marketing, selling and administrative expense decreasing 1% and R&D expense increasing 2%. As a percent of revenue, total opex declined by over 340 basis points compared to Q4 2016.  Other income and expense was income of $55 million this quarter compared to income of $15 million in last year\u2019s quarter, due primarily to higher net gain on sales of investments. Our tax rate was 20.2%, an increase of 230 basis points compared with the same quarter last year driven primarily by a lower net discrete tax benefit this quarter compared to Q4 2016.  At the bottom line, net income increased 19% and earnings per share increased 20%. We achieved significant earnings growth by delivering high single digit revenue growth while significantly reducing our opex ratio, creating positive leverage again this quarter  Slide 10 details these same non-GAAP measures for the full year, while Slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You\u2019ll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 25 and 26. Moving to Slide 12, let\u2019s take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. The effect of foreign exchange was minimal this quarter. Excluding a slight tailwind from FX, our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 6% and was primarily driven by volume growth of 4%. It\u2019s worth noting that in our human pharma business, each major geography drove volume growth again this quarter.  By geography, you\u2019ll notice that U.S. pharma revenue increased 9% driven by both price and volume. Trulicity, Basaglar and Taltz were the main drivers of this growth, offset partially by the recent losses of exclusivity for Strattera, Effient and Axiron and a decline in volume for Cialis. U.S. price growth in the fourth quarter was favorably impacted by an adjustment for rebates and discounts primarily related to lower Medicaid utilization across the portfolio. For U.S. pharma, it\u2019s also worth noting that when normalizing for the recent LOEs of Strattera, Effient and Axiron, revenue grew by approximately 20% driven by our new products. Moving to Europe, pharma revenue grew 9% excluding FX, driven entirely by volume, despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis and headwinds on Alimta due to competitive pressures, pricing and generic erosion in certain countries. Excluding Cialis and Alimta, the rest of our European pharma revenue grew 22% on a performance basis, driven by our new product launch portfolio - Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz, Jardiance and Lartruvo.  In Japan, despite the entry of generic Zyprexa last June, pharma revenue increased 9% excluding FX, led by Cymbalta, Trulicity and Cyramza. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 5% on a performance basis this quarter, led by Trulicity, Humalog and Forteo.  Turning to animal health, excluding the impact of FX, worldwide revenue decreased 7% driven by volume. Food animal revenue declined by 10% driven primarily by market access headwinds for Posilac and competitive pressures for Optiflex, while companion animal revenue was essentially flat. On a performance basis, excluding the BI U.S. vaccines acquisition, our animal health revenue decreased 11% with companion animal revenue down 15% driven primarily by a reduction in U.S distributor inventory levels as well as competitive pressures in parasiticides.  Slide 13 outlines this same information for our full year results.  Now I\u2019ll take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on Slide 14. In total, our new products, comprised of Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Lartruvo, Jardiance, Cyramza, Olumiant, Verzenio and Portrazza, were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 12.1 percentage points of volume growth. The loss of exclusivity of Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa and Evista provided a drag of 540 basis points, while Cialis and animal health accounted for 170 and 120 basis points of volume decline respectively.  Slide 15 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $1.4 billion in revenue this quarter and represented nearly 23% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 12% in Q4 2016. Moving on to Slide 16, as mentioned earlier, changes in foreign exchange rates had a minimal effect on our Q4 2017 revenue growth. Similarly, FX had no meaningful impact on our operating expense growth. FX did, however, have a large effect on cost of sales growth and consequently on operating income and EPS growth. For example, growth in non-GAAP EPS was 20%, including the effect of FX, while almost 32% in constant currency terms. This was largely consistent with the 29% growth for the full year 2017. Turning to our 2018 financial guidance on Slide 17, you will see that we\u2019ve updated our guidance to reflect the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform. This affects our estimated GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates and earnings per share while all other line items remain unchanged. Our revised GAAP and non-GAAP 2018 tax rates are both approximately 18% while our revised GAAP EPS range is $4.39 to $4.49, and our revised non-GAAP EPS range is $4.81 to $4.91. I would note the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform on our tax rate and earnings per share guidance is subject to change as we further interpret the new tax law and as subsequent regulations and guidance are issued. Also, in recent weeks we\u2019ve seen the dollar weaken substantially. If sustained, this weakness would increase the dollar value of our foreign revenue expenses, but due to the effect of FX on international inventories sold would likely have only a modest impact on EPS. I will monitor FX movements over the course of Q1 and, if appropriate, update our line item guidance on our April call. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave to review the pipeline and key future events. David Ricks : Thanks Josh. Slide 18 shows select NMEs as of January 24. Movements since our last earnings call include the initiation of Phase II testing for our D1 potentiator for dementia and our N3pG monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, both as monotherapy as well as in combination with an oral BACE inhibitor; Phase I starts for IDO1 inhibitor for cancer and IL33 for immunology, and for the automated insulin system I mentioned earlier, as well as the termination of one Phase I oncology molecule.  Our select NILEX pipeline shown on Slide 19 reflects the initiation of the Phase III program for baricitinib in atopic dermatitis and also attrition for ramucirumab for first line gastric cancer and abemaciclib for squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Turning to Slide 20, you can see the considerable progress we made on the key events we had projected for 2017, while Slide 21 highlights our expected key events for 2018, which we covered on our 2018 guidance call in December. In addition to noting the approval of Taltz for psoriatic arthritis, you will see that we\u2019ve added an event for the expected date of disclosure of the Keynote-189 study based on Merck\u2019s recent press release announcing the positive results of the Phase III study for Alimta in combination with Keytruda. 2018 will be an important year with potential Phase III initiations and data readouts for several promising new molecules and line extensions, as well as we expect regulatory actions for galcanezumab, baricitinib and abemaciclib. Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up the progress we made in 2017 and our priorities moving forward. In 2017, new products delivered nearly 20% of our total revenue, up from just 9% in 2016. Our growing portfolio of new medicines drove strong 8% top line growth for the full year. We achieved this result while maintaining relatively flat operating expenses, driving operating margin improvement of more than 450 basis points excluding FX.  We are in the early stages of a growth period driven by revenue from our recently launched products. The potential of our pipeline remains strong with new medicines in development for immunology, oncology, diabetes, and neurodegeneration complemented by a deep late-stage pain portfolio as well as additional indications for many recently launched products. Moving into 2018, we remain focused on launching with excellence and replenishing our pipeline while continuing to deliver bottom line growth and operating margin improvement.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil Johnson to moderate the Q&A session. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two, or to a single question with two parts. Operator, if you can please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we\u2019re ready to get started. Operator : [Operator instructions] We will go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you so much. Two questions - do you anticipate an FDA ad comm for baricitinib by, say, midyear, and you can you give us reassurance that there is not any safety issue beyond DVT that will be a subject of discussion? That\u2019s the first question. Second one is over the last, say, two to three decades, Lilly always had one to two big potential products in the pipeline that investors could focus on. This would appear less a dimension of Lilly today. You probably disagree, so please tell us what billion dollar-plus opportunities you have in the mid-stage pipeline, so not including lanabecestat, galcanezumab, tanezumab, or lasmiditan. Thanks so much. Phil Johnson : Great Steve, thank you for the questions. So Christi, if you\u2019ll take the question on whether or not we would expect an FDA ad comm. for baricitinib and if there are any additional safety issues beyond DVT that we think might be addressed should such an ad comm be held; and then maybe Dave and Jan, if you\u2019d like to comment on mid-stage pipeline assets that you are excited about. Christi? Christi Shaw : Sure, hi Steve. As we said before, we do expect the FDA to have an advisory committee, but the timing of that is up to the FDA and they\u2019ll make that publicly known. We won\u2019t be commenting on a date before they do. In terms of other safety, we really don\u2019t anticipate other major safety questions and issues in regard to the ad comm. and the resubmission. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Christi. Dave, Jan? David Ricks : Jan, you want to start? Dr. Jan Lundberg : Okay, I can start. Let us first look at the two new Phase II programs that we see. Clearly we are dependent on more clinical data, but we already have some clinical data from Phase Ib in both the D1 potentiator for dementia, which is an interesting molecule that could enhance cognition but potentially also somnolence, and in Parkinson\u2019s disease also motor function. The N3pG program is, as you probably remember, a plaque-removing antibody, and we have optimized the dosing regimen since it has some immunogenicity, and we are putting that now into larger Phase II trials. We are combining it also with an oral BACE inhibitor which we know then will shut off the production of amyloid beta. In fact, now in Alzheimer\u2019s, we are trying to get positive data, if at all doable, in Phase II in hundreds of patients, not in thousands of patients in Phase III, and we are addressing early disease. We really want to have a more homogenous patient population, which has been one of the problems, and we are using our imaging tools both for amyloid and [indiscernible] to make that happen, and we are also trying then to hit the target in a maximal way by not only removing amyloid but stopping the production.  The other agent I want to emphasize is a potential agent with more powerful body weight lowering effects than the current GLP-1, and that is the GIP GLP-1 co-agonist, and we have seen some interesting data on Phase I in healthy volunteers, so now we want to see them in a larger Phase II study how much can this actually reduce body weight and at the same time have a powerful blood glucose lowering effect. I also believe that our Il-23 molecule, mirikizumab has a variety of options for [indiscernible] indications, including then IBD, ulcerative colitis where we have potential to be first-in-class, but it\u2019s also an interesting option for psoriasis and potentially other indications. Phil Johnson : Do you have anything to add, or--? David Ricks : I don\u2019t. That\u2019s exactly what I would have said. Phil Johnson : Excellent, thank you. Operator, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A couple of questions. First for, I guess, Enrique and Sue, since your ascension to CEO, Dave, we\u2019ve been expecting an external move on oncology, given Levi joining the company. There has been small deals but nothing substantive. Were we wrong to assume that there was an intent to commit capital and balance sheet to accelerating your rebuild in oncology, particularly in IO, or if you could just share with us what are the barriers, be it valuation or other, which may have delayed such activity? That\u2019s the first question. Second question for Enrique, we have expressed a fair degree of excitement on the commercial potential of the SGLT2 class, including Jardiance. Perhaps you could give us your perception of where the class could go and what are the barriers to overcome and what catalysts we should be attuned to, pending cardiovascular clinical trial data, diminishing safety concerns and other, in order to get us there? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Andrew, thank you for the questions. Dave, if you\u2019d like to comment on the external business development strategy for oncology franchise, and then Enrique, the question on the potential going forward for the SGLT2 class. Dave? David Ricks : Sure. Well, I guess at a top level, Andrew, I would say your assumptions about our ambition to use balance sheet capacity as well as income statement capacity to grow our oncology business aren\u2019t wrong. We very much plan to do that. We\u2019re adding talent, as you noted, and are looking at many, many opportunities there. Of course, we\u2019re bound by pricing and value, which is something we\u2019re committed to make sure we\u2019re not doing deals just to fill strategic holes in the pipeline but that make sense for our investors over the long term, and I think we also want to think carefully about our strategy in oncology, what can complement existing assets and add to what we\u2019re doing, versus just de novo efforts to enter a space. So given the price points in oncology, we\u2019re careful about our work, but I think it would be reasonable to expect a busy year in business development for oncology for Lilly. Whether those translate into deals, that\u2019s a competitive process. We\u2019ll work through that, but I don\u2019t think directionally your assumptions are wrong. Phil Johnson : Thanks Dave. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. So I continue to be quite bullish on Jardiance, and I think the frame should be much more Jardiance than the SGLT2 class. When we look at the SGLT2 class, we do see a number of headwinds, in particular because of the updated label for Invokana. That has been a headwind for the class, but we need to look at Jardiance\u2019s growth and overall progression when we look at its use as a much better predictor for that to be a catalyst for the overall SGLT2 class. Clearly we are focused today on Type 2 diabetes, but we do have trials for heart failure and chronic [indiscernible] disease. When it comes to Type 2 diabetes, some of the challenges that we had have been some of those headwinds that I just referred to for what was the leader of the class. We do like the fact that there\u2019s going to be increased promotion by having some additional competitors enter the class. I think that actually is going to be helpful to Jardiance. Finally, it\u2019s just being able to make cardio protection a much higher priority for all physicians beyond A1C when they\u2019re thinking about patients with Type 2 diabetes. So we are encouraged by the progress that we continue to see, but much more progress is needed. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks Enrique. Operator, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks for the questions. So just a couple quick ones. First off, can you guys--I guess I\u2019m a little confused by the capital allocation discussion, so I guess I\u2019ll ask this one in two parts. You guys are reducing your debt to the tune of $2 billion and yet it would seem like--maybe you can just explain the capital allocation decision there and the need to reduce the debt, given your net cash position, so it\u2019s a little bit confusing in that regard if you\u2019re moving forward with other potential deal considerations. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the discipline there. The second part of that same question is has the board already reviewed the capital allocation dynamics and decision points, or is that coming on a go-forward basis in the wake of tax reform so you can move on debt immediately, but other capital allocation decisions and priorities are under review? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great Seamus, thank you for the questions. On capital allocation, Josh, that one\u2019s right up your alley. Joshua Smiley : Thanks Seamus. First as it relates to our overall position, we\u2019re in a very slight net cash position right now, but as I mentioned in the comments we\u2019re going to work that down over time, so we expect over time to be in a net debt position for sure. I think as it relates specifically to the $2 billion of--we have about $13.5 billion of debt, and to work that down by $2 billion is really to get at our target of 2.5 times EBITDA for our leverage ratio. Now, that just--the reason we do that, Seamus, is really just to give us the capacity to make investments when we see shareholder value opportunities, accretion opportunities ahead of us, so of course last year we raised--without the new tax reform legislation, we raised debt in the U.S. and actually increased it, so now all we\u2019ll do here is try to get back to our 2.5 leverage ratio. Again, that\u2019s not a long-term target, that\u2019s just where we\u2019d like to start. Then to your question about the board, we have--we\u2019ve been very clear, I think, for the last few years about our capital allocation priorities, and as I mentioned, we have $9 billion of cash we now have free access to that we didn\u2019t in the past, and we\u2019ll work through that cash on a pretty methodical basis and you should expect to see investments in the business, expect to see business development as Dave mentioned, and you will see dividend increases and share buybacks over time. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks Josh. Operator, next caller please. Operator : Certainly, and we\u2019ll go to the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions. First question on diabetes - sequentially it seems as though there was a higher degree of discounting and rebating going on, so some noise there. Can you maybe just give us some insights into that?  Then a question for you, Dave - I think Lilly has a self insurance model with some pretty high drug utilization. How do you anticipate, at least from your experience of having a self insurance model, how do you anticipate the administration is going to go about lowering drug pricing? It certainly seems as though there is a lot of value trapped within the system in discounts and rebates, but how would you go about unleashing some of that and getting it back into the hands of employer groups and, more importantly, into patients? Thanks. Phil Johnson : John, thank you for the questions. Enrique, if you\u2019ll comment on insights into what\u2019s going on with diabetes rebating here in the U.S., and then Dave obviously can talk about some of the drug pricing dynamics and how that might be addressed going forward. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : So we continue to see pressure on pricing across all of our diabetes products. When we look at our Q4 results, I think there was pressure from a rebating perspective on the insulin portfolio, so both Humalog and Basaglar in particular. But we are being extremely disciplined and we like our overall prospects, and the axis that we basically have with all of our top brands, we believe that Trulicity for example is extremely well positioned for \u201918 and so is Jardiance. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Enrique. Dave? David Ricks : Thanks John. I think you\u2019re right to point out what\u2019s the connection between Lilly\u2019s actions as a provider of healthcare benefits to employees as well as our policy positions. We try to make them as similar as we can. Of course, we do self insure, we own the financial risk for our beneficiaries in our programs, and I think there\u2019s two things that we do that, I think, stand out from the market. One is we have no bias in our health insurance programs for our employees toward medication, whereas you know in the general marketplace on average, patients pay four times out of pocket for medications and other health services, so we think that bias should go away, that you could actually make a good argument that medication should have a bias for them because of the efficiency of prescription drugs versus other parts of the healthcare system, but we\u2019ve eliminated that. The other thing which is new for us is rebate pass-through. We\u2019ve executed for our employee population a pass-through rebate program. We are calling for that through pharma and directly from the government, because CMS has a unique role as a market maker here in particular in the Part D program, so we would like to see rebate pass-through for Part D beneficiaries. As you know, the rebate levels probably across all of pharma are something like 30 to 40%. That could have an immediate and very positive impact on seniors who are struggling to cover their donut hole-exposed prescriptions, and we think this is a good idea that the administration should act on immediately. I would expect a busy year regulatory-wise in Washington as they look to introduce market mechanisms and lower costs at the pharmacy counter for patients, and we\u2019re for both of those things, so we\u2019ll partner closely with the administration to try to make positive progress in a pro-innovation way that actually affects patients\u2019 pocketbooks. Phil Johnson : Thanks Dave. Operator, we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Thank you, a couple of questions. An occasional bear case with Trulicity has been your Rewind cardiovascular outcomes trial and that it\u2019s higher risk because it studies the healthier populations, so the bar to showing a benefit could in principle be higher. Can we play out the scenario whereby this trial does indeed fail to show a benefit in 2018, in your view, would that have a purely negative impact on the commercial future of Trulicity, either U.S. or Europe, and if not, why not?  Then second question is on oral GLP-1 - your program and your initiatives are much earlier than Novo\u2019s, who is the nearing the conclusion of multiple Phase III trials. I\u2019m wondering why there is such a disparity in timelines - does Novo have a unique technology that Lilly\u2019s had difficulty replicating, or what\u2019s the reason exactly? Phil Johnson : Great Tim, thank you for the questions. So for you, Enrique, on potential impacts should Rewind be negative, and then our efforts on the oral GLP-1 and the timing of those. Enrique Conterno : So clearly there are a number of cardiovascular trials that are reading out this year - Rewind, but also we have trials for linagliptin in Carolina and Carmelina that are reading out. Lilly has quite a bit of experience when it comes to designing cardiovascular trials in the diabetes space, so we feel good about how we designed the trial and we continue to be optimistic about our results. I really don\u2019t want to speculate about what a negative trial would be - that\u2019s clearly not where our case is, clearly. As we think about future diabetes therapies, having a cardiovascular outcome benefit is going to be increasingly important. Phil Johnson : And on the oral GLP-1? Enrique Conterno : So we are highly interested in this space and working on pursuing oral GLP-1, and as we think about progressing to the clinical phase, I think the hurdle that we basically have is one of getting the right bio-availability for our product in order to make sure that we can make this commercially successful on a worldwide basis. Phil Johnson : Great. Did you want to add anything, Jan? Dr. Jan Lundberg : Yes. If we look at high level, the oral [indiscernible] peptides is hindered by a lot of natural mechanists, and we assume that the Novo product only has 1 or 2% bio-availability, which means that you lose most of the substance. The dilemma also remains here about the need for having fasting and not eating for some time after you take this drug, because then you have food interactions, so it\u2019s really a suboptimal oral agent. I think it would be so much better to have a more traditional small molecule for this receptor. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Jan. Operator, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin : Hi. Staying along the lines of Trulicity and potential changes to that market, obviously Ozempic will be launched very shortly if it hasn\u2019t already. What sort of changes do you expect to Trulicity\u2019s market share as a result of Ozempic, plus the fact that Victoza now has a CV claim as well? Then you touched upon your oral GLP-1, but obviously we know we\u2019re going to see a lot of oral semaglutide trials read out in 2018, and while there are concerns about the food effects and nausea, if the oral sema data are successful and essentially replicate Phase II, what impact, if any, do you see oral sema having on your overall diabetes franchise, including GLP-1? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Thanks for the questions, Jami. So back to you, Enrique, on Trulicity, the impact that you might expect from Ozempic and the Victoza CV label update, and then thoughts on the potential impact to our franchises if oral semaglutide is successful in Phase III. Enrique Conterno : So we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Trulicity. Trulicity had significant sequential quarter-on-quarter growth. Our market share for the last week is now over 40% for the first time, so we\u2019ve seen continued gains in overall share, despite the fact that, yes, Victoza has an indication for a benefit when it comes to CV events.  One of the big premises that we think about is really how underutilized the GLP-1 class is today. When we look at in the U.S. for example, GLP-1s are about 30% of the basal insulin utilization, so we think there is huge room for expansion and we believe that Trulicity is going to benefit from that. We are extremely well prepared for semaglutides launch. I feel good about the experience that we are providing patients. We believe that experience will be unmatched, so we do think that we will be able to compete very effectively. We don\u2019t provide any type of share forecasts for any of our products. Phil Johnson : And in terms of the oral semaglutide, how that may affect the dynamics within the various franchises that we have? Enrique Conterno : Yes, so first, I think it\u2019s extremely important - I think you made some reference to this, that we look at the Phase III trials and what is going to be some of the [indiscernible] between efficacy, the side effect profile, and at the end of the day also how in real life is this product going to perform given that it may require some extreme adherence when it comes to fasting and water intake and so forth, so we need to see more data. Novo has explicitly expressed this desire to price this product comparable to injectable GLP-1, but it\u2019s going to position the product very early in that treatment, continue to compete with some of the other orals, so we need to see how that is going to work given that today, SGLT2s and we look at the value proposition of a Jardiance, for example, which is going to be difficult for that product to match, so at the end of the day, how will payors view a much different price point for an oral GLP-1. So there is a lot of speculation and we need to see more data before we can provide a more educated sense of how that successful that product could be and the impact on the rest of the diabetes market. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks Enrique. Operator, next caller please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Just two questions on Taltz, if I could. One, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis? I think one of your competitors has highlighted this as maybe equal magnitude of opportunity to the original psoriasis label. I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that market as we look at the launch in \u201918. The second question on Taltz is about the pricing dynamics in \u201918. We\u2019ve had a couple data points about this being a more competitive pricing environment than we\u2019ve seen in the past, and just interested in your thoughts on how pricing is going to shake out for this market as we think about this year and longer term. Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Chris. So Christi, if you can talk about the opportunity that we see in psoriatic arthritis and the pricing dynamics as we head into this year? Christi Shaw : Absolutely. So we\u2019re very excited about the launch of Taltz in psoriatic arthritis, already approved in Japan, approved in the U.S. in December, and January in Europe. A marker for the psoriatic arthritis opportunity would be to look at Cosentyx - less than 40% of the scripts for Cosentyx are actually in the dermatology office, so we believe this is a really large opportunity in addition to the ankylosing spondylitis, and we expect that our uptake will be very similar to Cosentyx in PSA as we were in psoriasis. That market, we think will be very large and we think we\u2019re competitive. We\u2019re the only IL-17 that has in our label structure data as well as patients who have not responded well to TNF, and so being very competitive, the rheumatologists like the data, and they also like the PASI 100 scores, so we do think that that will be a great market for us. Remember - we\u2019re not going to the same customer, we\u2019re going to an entirely new office in rheumatology. Then in terms of pricing with Taltz this year versus last year and how that relates to access, our access this year will be very similar to last year. From competitive dynamics, this is a marketplace where, unlike other areas, we actually have a lot of patients that continually turn over, and so as you see with the uptake of Taltz at launch and continuing, we don\u2019t believe that that will be an issue for us to get access to patients. Phil Johnson : Thanks Christ. Operator, we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Thanks so much. I have three questions. The first is I\u2019m hoping that you can frame the animal health revenue growth prospects in coming quarters. Obviously the business was down in the fourth quarter, you expect it to flatten out and then return to growth, but if you could help us with our modeling in the next quarter or two, that would be helpful. Also as part of that commentary, if you could just remind us what the top two to three new product revenue drivers are in animal health. The second question is could you comment on the timing of Phase II Alzheimer\u2019s readouts with cognitive efficacy data, and then third, do you expect the tax rate to decline beyond 2018 as you optimize your tax structuring? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great Dave, thank you for the questions. So Jeff, we\u2019ll go to you for animal health growth prospects on the coming quarters and some of the key new product drivers. Josh, I\u2019m going to go to you next, if you don\u2019t mind, for tax rate beyond 2018; and then Jan, if you\u2019d like to comment on timing for some of the Phase II readouts in the Alzheimer\u2019s space. Jeff? Jeff Simmons : Yes, a few things, David, kind of at a higher level on animal health. I would say that our Q4 results were consistent with our expectations we set. In guidance in December, we specifically said then that we expect 2018 revenues to be flat to slightly increasing versus 2017, and the other note I would make is fourth quarter revenue decreased 7% excluding FX, and this was driven by volume, but importantly we\u2019re starting to see a return to price growth in the market and we increased 1% in the fourth quarter. So when you look to growth and look to modeling, I would say this - again, 2017 clean food and competition, we underestimated the impact of that. That\u2019s what\u2019s impacted and driven our results, and some competitive pressures in the companion animal market. So for 2018 specifically, we forecast revenue growth to be flat to slightly up, we expect 2018 to be a year of transition as we continue to evolve our product mix against headwinds, we see slightly negative growth in the first half of 2018 primarily from the continuing impact of clean food, however the second half of the year we expect our eight launches, and I\u2019ll touch on those here, will drive top line growth. So within the portfolio we expect low to mid single digit growth in companion animals offset by low to single digit decline in food animals.  As Dave noted, I think we will see Galliprant continue to grow. We\u2019re seeing close to 30% quarter-on-quarter growth in the canine pain market, we\u2019re up to 12% market share. We see that being a key growth driver. I would combine that with last year\u2019s launch of Interceptor Plus and the share that we\u2019ve taken from HeartGard would be another big driver for our business, and then we continue to see our companion animal parasiticide broader portfolio - Credelio, our first tick-flea launch, that is going on this quarter in all three major markets, Japan, Europe and the U.S., so Credelio would be the third. Then on the food animal side, we continue to see our vaccine portfolio that we acquired from Lohmann in salmonella, with vaccines being a key growth driver as well.  So hopefully that gives you a little guidance on our food and companion animal business first half, second half of the year, and again I would emphasize flat to slightly growing in \u201918. Phil Johnson : Thanks Jeff. Josh? Joshua Smiley : On tax rate, first for 2018, as we mentioned we are estimating about 18%, which is about a 350 basis point improvement from the prior outlook. Like every other company that\u2019s reported or will, I think of course we have to caveat that by saying that\u2019s based on our interpretation and read today of the law. It\u2019s very complex, we are still waiting for future guidance and regulations from the IRS, but based on that assessment, we think 18% is sustainable and we will certainly look through planning to take advantage of the incentives that are built into the law to bring that down over time. So a lot of work still to go there, but certainly assume a sustainable 18% and then opportunities to bring it down over time. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you Josh. Jan? Dr. Jan Lundberg : In relation to dementia studies, and the symptomatic one is in Parkinson\u2019s dementia, and that has a readout mid-2019. The N3pG program may take somewhat longer since there is an 18-month treatment there, so in about two years. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Jan. Operator, we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Greg Gilbert : Thank you. First in diabetes, lots of focus on GLP-1 obviously, but Enrique, was curious what you thought the impact might be, if any, when Merck enters with some combo products, or at least the combo of DPP4 and SGLT2, and what have you learned in the marketplace about the market\u2019s willingness to use that kind of combo and what are you expecting from Merck, given that they haven\u2019t launched something into this space in a while, and how that might affect you? Secondly, Dave, lots of guesswork around what you will buy, what you could buy, when it would happen - a bit hard for you to answer that, but what could you say about how the pace and focus of BD, how that has changed since you took over? Are there specific things you can point to, like changes in the team, changes in priority, changes in team focus, etc, short of predicting what you\u2019re going to do next? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Greg. Enrique, if you can comment on the potential impact of another DPP4 SGLT2 combo coming in; and then Dave, any changes in our approach to BD since you\u2019ve taken over as CEO. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Very good. So as I mentioned, we view additional competitors coming into the SGLT2 class paradoxically as a positive because we believe that\u2019s going to be an important catalyst for growth and it\u2019s going to help the class, but also given Jardiance\u2019s strong position, we will likely be the main beneficiary. Your question was specific to the combo of ertugliflozin with a DPP4. I can\u2019t comment on Merck\u2019s strategy, but when we look at current practices from physicians prescribing diabetes products, they prefer not to prescribe fixed dose combinations. We do have that experience with [indiscernible], so we view that as a long-term proposition for Merck. Now, we don\u2019t know exactly what their strategy is, but clearly for that product first of all to be successful, they\u2019re going to have to establish the benefit of ertugliflozin, so we are of course prepared. We have a number of competitors entering the diabetes space, but I feel very good in terms of where each one of our brands stands today in terms of the benefit that it provides. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Enrique. Dave? David Ricks : Yes, thanks Greg for the question, and of course we can\u2019t comment on things that haven\u2019t happened yet, but we do have ambition to step up our game in BD. In essence we\u2019ve undertaken a series of things to investigate why have we done a bit less through time, where has that occurred in the pipeline space. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear through the last year about our ambition in the Phase I, Phase II, so pre-proof of concept earlier clinical assets is the main target, and that\u2019s not just because we decided that, it\u2019s because that\u2019s where Lilly is relatively under-represented, and there\u2019s a lot more to go after at price points which we think are attractive. We have done some specific things in the company. One public thing which people know about is the realignment of the business development function nested within our Lilly Research Labs, our R&D organization. I think that\u2019s an important change, if not psychologically as we shift our attitude toward this becoming a core part of innovation in our company along with strengthening our own labs. We have also increased resources, both human and allocating balance sheet and income statement capacity for yet to be done deals, so that that\u2019s not a friction as we look at bringing things in.  The final thing I\u2019ll say is we have core metrics now we\u2019re looking at in terms of number of prospects we\u2019re evaluating, so that we have enough substrate to then execute the right deals across. What hasn\u2019t changed is the discipline we\u2019re going to undertake to make sure these are not just strategic, quote-unquote, without the financial support, but they check all the boxes - they enhance our therapeutic strategies, they can produce--have a good shot at producing strong value for shareholders through time, and they fit what we know how to do so we can execute once we do bring them in. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you Dave. Operator, next caller please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi guys, thanks so much for taking my questions. First, if I may, can you please give us some color into any DVT deaths seen with baricitinib, perhaps some visibility into how many and what happened? Secondly, I know you mentioned in passing, but would love to get your thoughts on real world usage of the carefully calibrated pre and post-dose fasting periods seen with oral sema and the specific water volumes, like how does that play out in a real-world setting based on all the diabetes experience you guys have and the concomitant meds?  Then finally on NGF, my question is from a commercial setting, how do you seek to manage concomitant NSAID usage to mitigate the Type 2 RPO risk when concomitant NSAIDS are taken? Phil Johnson : Great, thank you very much for the questions. Let me summarize. So I\u2019m going to start out with Enrique, actually, with that second question on how we see some of the oral sema dosing potential issues playing out in the real world, and then Christi, the other two would be for you - any information we can share on things we\u2019ve seen related to DVT deaths with baricitinib in our clinical trial program, and then how we intend to manage concomitant NSAID usage as we would go to market in the future with tanezumab. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Yes, that is a question probably better for Novo than for us, but as a frame, anything that introduces complexity in the lives of people with diabetes has a number of headwinds, so we look to basically develop products that can be adhered simply, that offer a number of benefits, and that is our mantra about how we think about developing our products. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Enrique. Christi? Christi Shaw : Sure, so of note, there were two reported deaths for patients with events of pulmonary embolism in the clinical trial program. One death occurred in the baricitinib group after 523 days after the first dose, and one death occurred in the methotrexate group after 234 days of methotrexate treatment. Of note as we have resubmitted and disclosed more data on our resubmission to the FDA, one of the things that we looked at is the largest pool that we have of patients exposed to baricitinib, so all of our clinical trials and also the extension study, we found that in the 2 milligram, the incidence of DVT and PE were 0.5, and in the 4 milligrams it was 0.5 as well. Remember, that\u2019s a background rate in RA of 0.3 to 0.8, so well within the background rate of RA, so that\u2019s part of our resubmission package as well as the Phase II clinical trial in atopic derm, where we didn\u2019t see any as well. Phil Johnson : And then in terms of utilization of concomitant NSAIDS with tanezumab and how that\u2019s being managed in the clinical trials and how we might envision that playing out upon commercialization? Christi Shaw : We did exclude concomitant use of NSAIDS in our trial, chronic use, and we\u2019ll see what the label looks like once the data comes out and once the FDA approves it and what the label looks like, and then we\u2019ll be able to--in the future, be able to tell you how we\u2019ll commercialize it. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Christi. Operator, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Mark Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Mark Goodman : Yes, good morning. Just a couple of product questions. Trajenta looked very strange in the fourth quarter here in the U.S. I was wondering if you could just give us a flavor for what happened there. Then second on Trulicity, obviously ramping up nicely in the U.S. I\u2019m just curious if there was anything strange with respect to pricing or inventory in the quarter, or was that just a completely clean quarter relative to the previous four quarters, just so we can understand the ramp?  Then you mentioned a little bit on Basaglar, but maybe you could also just talk to the past couple of quarters so we can really get a better understanding of what the underlying pricing is of this product, including all the rebates. Thank you. Phil Johnson : Mark, thank you for the questions. Enrique, all for you, if you\u2019d like to comment on some of the U.S. dynamics we\u2019re seeing for Trajenta, Trulicity, and Basaglar. Enrique Conterno : Very good. So let me start with Trajenta. We did have an unfavorable impact due to our changes in estimates for rebates and discounts for the quarter in the case of Trajenta, roughly $10 million as it relates to Lilly revenue. You may recall that in Q3 of 2017, so last quarter, we actually had a favorable adjustment, so sequentially it does look like an anomaly. You asked about Basaglar. We do see very strong sequential growth for Basaglar - 24% TRX quarter-on-quarter. We do have high rebates. Part of this is basically channel accrual when it comes to--given the expected increased utilization in Part D starting January 1, and by the way we\u2019ve seen excellent uptake. When we look at Basaglar today at the first few weeks, we\u2019re now basically capturing about 25% of the new patients in the basal insulin class, so excited about the growth prospects. Then when we look at Trulicity, there was some buy-in, roughly about $25 million when it comes to inventories. Outside of that, we do see a lot of movement when it comes to gross to net and so forth, but what I would say when we look at our diabetes products is to look at them really more over time and try to get a complete picture by looking at rolling quarters. But we are once again excited about the sequential growth that Trulicity is having. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Enrique. Operator, next caller. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Geoff Meecham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meecham : Morning, thanks for the questions, guys. Dave, I know you\u2019re still in the Elanco strategic review, but how does the tax policy or the new product launches change your view of its internal value, or is it still about its margin contribution? Then a couple of product questions, one for Forteo - good 4Q trends for a late cycle product. Just help us with some insight for 4Q and then going forward. Then on abemaciclib, how does a recent pricing action we saw with [indiscernible] in Europe impact either your opportunity or your investment there? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great. Jeff, thank you for the questions. So Dave, we\u2019ll start with you on the question of some of the impacts of tax policy and some other factors on our Elanco decision-making process. Sue, if I can then go to you to talk about some of the recent announcements that were made on pricing for a competitor product in the CVK4-6 space in Europe, and then Christi on the Forteo question here in the U.S. Dave? David Ricks : Yes, thanks for the question. On Elanco, more or less since we announced the strategic review in our [indiscernible], the basic assumptions and the way we\u2019re conducting the analysis haven\u2019t really changed. Of course, tax makes everything a little bit more valuable and that\u2019s been contemporized in our thinking. Elanco, I think, there\u2019s a two-part story. One is innovation on the top line, and I think we\u2019ve commented on that this quarter. I think there\u2019s been great progress, both in the introduction of new products as well as approvals recently. That\u2019s a piece of this that we\u2019re factoring in going forward as a growing company in animal health. Then the margin expansion is a significant opportunity for animal health and one the team is very focused on, so all those things are true. I think the analysis of course then must ask, what\u2019s the most valuable path forward for Lilly shareholders - to hold, to spin, to partner in some other way, and that\u2019s still ongoing. But more or less, the direction of those assumptions is the same as when we started this, and that\u2019s good news as we continue to work through that project. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks Dave. Sue? Dr. Sue Mahony : Yes, I can\u2019t comment on Pfizer\u2019s announcement. What I can say is we are ready for our launch in Europe. We submitted last year in Europe and in Japan and we are hopefully expecting approval in both those geographies later this year. We are prepared for launch and we\u2019re prepared for appropriate access and reimbursement for patients where there is a considerable unmet need in Europe. Just an update on the U.S. - the uptake so far has been very promising. We feel really good about the performance to date, and that is based on the Monarch 1 and Monarch 2 populations - that\u2019s about 30% of the patients available, and we are anticipating approval in the first half of this year based on the Monarch 3, so that\u2019s the first line indication. Again, the performance looks good so far. We feel very confident in the U.S. performance as well as the opportunity in Europe and Japan. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Sue. Christi? Christi Shaw : Our U.S. sales of Forteo in Q4 grew 32% versus the Q3 of 13%, so thank you for the question because there was some unique dynamics in Q4. One was we benefited from the net price adjustment to rebates and discounts related to Medicaid, where most quarters the rebates and discounts lower the realized benefit from list price increases. The second thing was that in terms of the volume acceleration, we had wholesaler buy-ins that led to an increase in the volume for Q4. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Christi. Operator, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Gerberry : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. Firstly on Alimta, your thoughts or expectations if you were to lose the patent suit with the alternative salt form, the 505b2 generic. Just curious your thoughts on sort of what type of market share you think a low-cost alternative salt form could capture in the oncology setting. I don\u2019t know if you have any analogs, but with the trial starting tomorrow, I was just curious your thoughts there. My second question on the diabetes front, obviously conversion of sulfonylurea to higher cost brands have been kind of value driver in the space more broadly, and just trying to get a little bit of sense for the Carolina study, if that study were positive, do you mainly see that as something that drives more conversion to DPP4 or do you see that as a broader catalyst, depending upon the cardiovascular profile for SUs, to other proprietary classes like SGLT2 or GLP-1? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you for the question. So Sue, if you can provide some thoughts on the potential impact if we were to lose the alternative salt form case starting soon, and then Enrique, your thoughts on if Carolina is positive, how that might affect both DPP4 and potentially SGLT2 utilization. Sue? Dr. Sue Mahony : Yes, with regards to the Alimta patent, as you said, we\u2019ve got the alternate salt form hearing yet this week in the District Court of Indiana, and we feel really confident with regards to our case here and we believe that we can continue to defend this patent and feel very confident in our opportunity to do that. Clearly in a case that didn\u2019t happen, we would look at revised guidance, but at this point in time we are continuing to drive Alimta performance with the Keynote 189 data being presented later this year. We think we have a great opportunity to really continue to consolidate Alimta as a standard of care in first line setting and to be the preferred chemo in combination with IO. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Sue. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : SUs still represent about 20% of the overall oral diabetes market. As a class, as a share of the market, that is declining and has been declining over time. Clearly a positive Carolina trial would significantly accelerate that. My view is that most classes will basically benefit, it would not be limited to DPP4s and Trajenta in particular, but we would also see acceleration about the SGLT2s, in particular Jardiance, and the GLP-1 class. Phil Johnson : Thanks Enrique. Operator, we\u2019ll go to our next caller. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Thanks so much for taking my questions. I had a question about these new co-pay accumulator programs that we\u2019re hearing about, some plans where the co-pay support manufacturers provide to the count towards the individual\u2019s deductible. Just wondering if you could comment on what you\u2019re seeing around this issue - is there anything you think Lilly or other pharma companies can do to offset the pressures, specifically wondering about specialty drugs like Taltz with that question?  Second one on your CGRP, I\u2019m just curious if you can share a little more in terms of the commercial presentation of that product in terms of the needle gauge, the device, some of the ways you\u2019ll be trying to differentiate that product from some of your competitors in terms of how it\u2019s delivered. Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great Vamil, thank you very much for the questions. So Dave, if you can comment on the question on co-pay accumulators, and then Christi, whatever you can share - you might not be able to fully respond, but whatever you can share on some of the commercial presentation for CGRP, galcanezumab. Dave? David Ricks : Yes, well co-pay accumulators, the idea that [indiscernible] get credited differently than in the past is actually not really a new idea. A lot of people are talking about it this year. There are in the back and forth between manufacturers and insurers ways to rebalance that. I think the overall concerning thing is the continued shift across consumers basically by implementing this program without rebate pass-through, which I think would be an important compensating measure. It just increases the exposure that patients have to their high deductible plans and that\u2019s a bad idea, in our mind, so policy-wise we\u2019re not for it. There are tactical ways through it, and you can rest assured we\u2019re implementing those on products like Taltz and others. There will be a to-ing and fro-ing around these points through time and we\u2019ll compete as we do. I think the bigger issue for the country is how do we make chronic medications patients need more affordable for them, and again we go back to the rebate pass-through issue. That increasing spread is a big issue for patients paying list price with a deductible plan. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Dave. Christi? Christi Shaw : Yes, we have a strong history obviously in the auto injector, and that will be our plan from a commercialization standpoint with galcanezumab. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you. Operator, next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Tony Butler : Yes, thanks very much. I wanted to stick with the CGRP if I may and simply ask, would you expect utilization to be principally for those who would be chronic users, a la an injection once per month, or do you think that in fact it would be a good many episodic users? That\u2019s question one. Number two is also to the extent that baricitinib has been in Europe, principally Germany, I\u2019m just curious if you have information on both the 2 and 4 milligram use; in other words, can you provide some ratio like 60/40, or some other permutation, as to the percentage of use by dose? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Thanks Tony. So Christi, if you\u2019ll comment on both these questions, the CGRP, where we expect use to be principally, if that\u2019s going to be in chronic or also episodic, and then I\u2019m not sure if you have a rabbit to pull out of the hat on the 2 and 4 milligram use in Germany or not? I don\u2019t think we have that information in the IR group, so. Christi Shaw : Okay, so we expect most of the usage to be in the preventive, obviously. There is about 4 to 5 million patients in the U.S. alone that are on preventative medicines, but we also estimate that about 15 million patients could be eligible because they have fallen off their preventative medicine for one reason or the other - efficacy or safety. So we do expect most of that use to be in chronic. The great thing about the Lilly platform is we\u2019re also studying lasmiditan for acute use, and the third thing is galcanezumab also has a study in cluster headaches, so as you look at chronic, episodic, cluster, we expect use across those two agents in all three areas. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Christi, and Tony, we\u2019ll follow up on your question in utilization in Germany that we\u2019re seeing between the 2 and the 4 milligram dose. Christi Shaw : We can tell you that the majority is in 4 milligrams, we just can\u2019t give you the split. Phil Johnson : Okay. Operator, can we go to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jeff Holford : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. There seems to be a lot of focus on Elanco, I think some concerns that the trend there is maybe unsupportive of that business standing on its own at some point this year. So wondering if you can just give a bit of your thoughts on the longer term outlook - when does this business get more to industry growth rates on the top line, the kind of 5%-plus that we\u2019re used to seeing globally for animal health, and maybe what kind of basis point opportunity you see on the margin in the midterm as the mix evolves and gets more efficient?  Second, quick question on Taltz - what kind of impact are you seeing in the market really from Tremfya, and also on some of the Cosentyx price adjustments? I think Novartis were commenting they\u2019re still being reasonably aggressive on price of that product through 2018. Thank you. Phil Johnson : Thanks for the questions, Jeff. Our Jeff, can you comment please on Elanco trends that you see going forward and outlook for longer term growth, as well as margin expansion? Dave, feel free to comment if you like, and then Christi, if you\u2019d like to comment on the impact from Tremfya and some of the pricing dynamics in the IO-17 class. Jeff? Jeff Simmons : Yes, as we\u2019ve noted Jeff - good question. We\u2019ve had really three priorities to our strategy as we go forward, and we are definitely keeping this in context as we go forward with the assessment, is one, accelerating innovation; two is changing our mix to higher growth and margin segments; and three, this margin expansion plan, those being the three. I think as Dave noted, we feel very good about our pipeline and launching products that we\u2019re in the midst of right now. That will be what will return us to, we believe, higher quality growth and higher margins going forward. So as I\u2019ve noted, it will flat to slightly growing in \u201918, and we continue to see that increasing going forward. I think the margin expansion story is a significant one. There\u2019s really a couple parts to that. One is just cost initiatives, and we\u2019ve pulled most of the key levers that we see here in the near and medium term, as well as our footprint, so we have announced two things this year - continuing to look at right-sizing our footprint after the integration, so with the large Wood consolidation as well as Augusta, and I think the BST assessment will help. We hit a billion dollars in companion animals in 2017 for the first time, and I think just the example of the contrast of BST to companion animals is a demonstration of this mix change. So we have said very clearly on margins that we do see, as we said in December 15 at the investor conference, returning to 30% operating margins, albeit it will be taking a little bit longer given some of these forces, like clean food. But we do see a path to that margin expansion, so increasing as we go forward in the short and medium term. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks Jeff. Christi? Christi Shaw : So Tremfya has had a similar launch uptake as what we\u2019ve seen with other biologics in the psoriasis space, and as we\u2019ve said before, we believe that the newer agents--and what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace is newer agents are really increasing expectations of physicians, of patients to ensure--to really switch patients more quickly from older agents to the newer ones. In fact, the last two years the market growth has been 15%, unlike the years before where it was single digits, so we think that\u2019s a good thing. Then on the Cosentyx price adjustment, we continue to look very closely at that. What we\u2019ve seen and what we saw at launch was in spite of not having great access, because patients actually cycle off routinely, go from one agent to another, we haven\u2019t had to utilize that piece, but we\u2019ll continue to keep an eye on it and ensure that we continue to get access for patients who want PASI 100 clear skin scores. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Christi. Operator, next caller please. Operator : Certainly. We\u2019ll go to the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei : Good morning folks, thank you very much for taking the questions. Three, if I may. First, could you comment on the specific milestone achieved for your N3pG antibody in Alzheimer\u2019s? Was there a specific efficacy or safety hurdle that was met? Second on Basaglar, when do you expect additional basal insulin bio-similars, and when should we expect interchangeability data for Basaglar? Is that something that you\u2019re pursuing? Then third, a follow-up on your comments on rebate pass-through to the patients, which makes a lot of sense. We\u2019re hearing similar comments from other pharma leaders. Since you seem to be involved in the policy discussions, what are your expectations of this actually happening, whether it\u2019s in Part D or the commercial setting? Thank you very much. Phil Johnson : Alex, thank you for the questions. Jan, if you\u2019d like to comment on the specific milestone that was achieved for us to be now showing the N3pG in that Phase II column, Enrique on the additional competition, when that might come in from our understanding for Basaglar and for pursuing interchangeability and producing data for that, and then Dave on the likelihood of some of those rebate pass-throughs being enacted in either the government or commercial spaces. Jan? Dr. Jan Lundberg : Without being too specific on numbers here, I can say that the N3pG studies met our criteria for reducing the amyloid imaging signal in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, and secondly we have a dose regimen that seems safe in spite of having some immunogenicity. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Jan. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Some of the additional entrants into the basal space are held up right now due to litigation. I think that is a question really for them and for Sanofi. As it relates to interchangeability, we think this will eventually happen. The right studies will need to be conducted, but I view this as years away. There\u2019s nothing imminent. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you. Dave? David Ricks : On rebate pass-through, it\u2019s good everyone is talking about it because it should happen. In fact, it already is happening in commercial plans. I know that because we\u2019re executing in our plan, and I know other larger players are as well. It\u2019s not happening in Part D - we\u2019ve got the proposal on the table. CMS put out proposed regs for comment in the fall, and I think a number of senators and others have weighed in on that. There is a push and pull there between should we allow a modest increase in premiums in Part D to support the funding of rebate pass-through? We\u2019re for that because, of course, not passing through the rebates subjects the very ill to the cost burden versus spreading that over a much larger base, and we think that\u2019s what insurance is for and therefore we advocate for it. It\u2019s difficult to speculate on the probability of that happening, but I can tell you there is strong unanimity amongst large manufacturers. It is a serious proposal being looked at on both the Hill and HHS, and to me it is one of the simplest levers to pull to actually change the cost at the pharmacy counter for drugs in America. I think the U.S. should do it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will happen, though. So we\u2019ll have to stay close to that one and we\u2019ll keep you updated. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Dave. Operator, next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Steve Scale with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. Jeff, you mentioned a few times mix change in 2018. Can you be more specific, and do you see any risks or opportunities in food animal business related to either NAFTA or TPP? Secondly, baricitinib completed a Phase II SLE study in December. Can you provide any thoughts on what you saw? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Steve, thank you for the questions. So Jeff, you can comment on the mix change for \u201918 and opportunity that some of the trade agreements could have potentially on our food animal business, and then Christi for the baricitinib questions. Jeff Simmons : Thanks Steve. Just to note, I would say that we continue to be very intentional on starting back in our pipeline, is to really focus on these higher growth areas, and we\u2019ve been very open, all of companion animals we see we can compete in the three major segments there, then vaccines, antibiotic alternatives, and nutritional health, these are the areas that we\u2019re intentionally leaning in on from our pipeline all the way through. Then when I look at accelerating our mix, I guess I would note--I mean, what really drove primarily the decline in our food animal business in the U.S. this year was BST. We did see the clean food movement hit us at an accelerated rate, but we\u2019ve got BST now representing less than 5% of our portfolio, so it gives you an idea of that change. That\u2019s all I would speak to specifically, but we are looking at antibiotic alternatives, vaccines, nutritional health on the food side, and we see some nice growth going forward there.  I don\u2019t see anything on the trade side. Trade is critical - we all know that. We\u2019ve built in our assumptions there is no trade agreements or changes that we see impacting any of our portfolio going forward. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Jeff. Christi? Christi Shaw : We\u2019re very pleased with the Phase II data in lupus. We\u2019ll be disclosing that data at a major medical meeting this year, and we\u2019re evaluating options to actually start a Phase III by the end of 2018. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you very much. That does exhaust the queue a few minutes early before the bottom of the hour here. Dave, if you\u2019d like to go ahead and close the call? David Ricks : Sure, thanks Phil, and thanks to all of you. We appreciate your participation in today\u2019s earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. In 2017, we generated strong revenue growth driven by our new human pharmaceutical products. We significantly improved margins, leading to even faster income growth. As we move into 2018, we expect to see continued growth of our new pharmaceutical products and significant additional margin expansion. We believe the Lilly stock remains a compelling investment given the strength of our product portfolio, our top and bottom line growth prospects over the balance of the decade.  Today I\u2019d also like to thank Chris Ogden - this will be his last earnings call in his current capacity, and really thank him for his considerable contributions over the last few years to the IR efforts.  Please follow up with our IR team if you have any questions we didn\u2019t address on today\u2019s call. That concludes the call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

Welcome to the Eli Lilly and Company Q1, 2018 earnings call. At this time, all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Ricks. Please go ahead. David Ricks : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings call. I\u2019m Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; and Enrique Conterno, the President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and Jeff Simmons, President of our Elanco Animal Health. We\u2019re also joined by Kristina Wright, Jim Heaney, Kevin Hern and Phil Johnson of the Investor Relations team. We also joined for the first time by Dan Skovronsky, our incoming President of Lilly Research Laboratories. Dan is succeeding Dr. Jan Lundberg who retires at the end of May. Jan has been key to our success as we navigated the years YZ and return to growth for the series of successful products. We want to thank Jan for his all contributions to our company.  During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community only. It is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. 2018 is off to a good start. With first quarter revenue growth of 9%, which we leveraged into a 29% non-GAAP operating income growth and 37% non-GAAP EPS growth. New pharmaceutical products continue to be the drivers of our worldwide revenue growth. Led by Trulicity, Basaglar, Jardiance and Taltz, with growth in both US and international markets where launches continue to scale up. New product growth more than offset revenue declines resulting from loss of exclusivity on a number of established products. In addition, we continue to expand our margins this quarter. Excluding the effect of FX, our international inventory sold non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by nearly 70 basis points over Q1 of 2017. And non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue increased by 775 basis points to 30.4%. Pipeline progress this quarter also included approval in launch of an additional indication and first line metastatic breast cancer for Verzenio based on the MONARCH 3 data. Positive Phase 3 studies of Taltz for ankylosing spondylitis, the positive Phase 3 study for Cyramza at high AFP patients with second line liver cancer. And the initiation of a Phase 3 study for Trulicity in 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses.  While we are pleased that the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee supported the efficacy of both the 2-mg and 4-mg of baricitinib in RA and 2-mg overall, we are disappointed that the committee did not recommend approval of the 4-mg dose. We are confident in the benefit-risk profile of both baricitinib 2-mg and 4-mg for the treatment of patients with RA, supported by the clinical data generated to-date, and by the experience in more than 40 countries in which both doses are approved and available. We'll continue to work with the FDA on this important application. In terms of capital deployment, we announced a strategic collaboration with Sigilon to develop encapsulated cell therapies for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. We purchased $1.1 billion of stock and returned nearly $600 million via the dividend. And we are making expected progress on Elanco strategic review and still anticipate sharing our conclusions on our Q2 earnings call this July. Slide 5 contains more detail on key events since our January earnings call. Now I would like to the turn call over to Joshua to review our Q1 results and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018. Joshua Smiley : Thanks Dave. Slide 6 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. While Slide 7 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our first-order GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 8, you'll see the revenue increase of 9% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 75.1%. This decrease was due to the effective foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold. Excluding this FX effect, gross margin as a percent of revenue actually increased roughly 70 basis points, driven by higher realized prices and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by product mix. Total operating expense decreased 5% with marketing, selling and administrative expense decreasing 4% and R&D expense decreasing 6%. Total operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined by 710 basis points compared to Q1, 2017. This significant improvement reflects our continued efforts to reduce our cost structure and increase our margins, accelerated by the restructuring actions we took late last year. Other income and expense with income of $67.5 million this quarter compared to income of $78.3 million in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 15.9 %, a decrease of 530 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of US tax reform. At the bottom line, net income increased 35%, while earnings per share increased slightly faster at 37% due to a reduction in shares outstanding from shares repurchase. We achieved a significant earnings growth by delivering high single digits revenue growth, while significantly reducing our operating expenses, creating positive leverage again this quarter. Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You'll find additional details on these adjustments on slide 20. So moving to Slide 10, let's take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter the effective foreign exchange provided a four percentage point benefit, excluding this our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 5%, driven by both price and volume. For a fifth straight quarter, our human Pharma business drove volume growth in each major geography. US Pharma revenue increased 10% driven by price into a lesser extent volume. Our diabetes portfolio led by Trulicity, Basaglar, and Jardiance was the primary driver of volume growth with growth of 30%, offset by the losses of exclusivity for Strattera and Effient and Axiron and by a decline in volume for Cialis due to the entry of generic erectile disfunction products. For US Pharma, it's also worth noting that when excluding LOEs, the rest of our US products grew by approximately 20% in total. US price growth in the quarter was favorably impacted by an adjustment for rebates and discounts, primarily related to lower Medicaid utilization than anticipated across the portfolio. While Medicaid remains a significant segment of our US business, we estimate that the growth we experienced in this segment in the past several years has plateaued in recent months.  Moving to Europe. We've been pleased with the overall performance of our new product portfolio across the region. Pharma revenue grew 2% excluding that FX, driven entirely by volume despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding the impact of the Cialis LOE volume grew nearly 17%. This volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz, Lartruvo, Jardiance and Basaglar.  In Japan, pharma revenue increased 1% excluding the FX, driven by volume of new products namely Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance, with a partial offset in price from the impact of the biannual price cuts. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 4% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth of Trulicity, Humalog and Forteo. Turning to animal health. As we noted during our Q4 earnings call, we've been expecting to return to top-line growth in the second half of this year, and our Q1 results are on track with this expectation. Excluding FX, Elanco revenue declined 4% this quarter. I highlight, however, that revenue in Q1 actually increased 1% in performance terms when excluding the impact of products we've made the strategic decision to exit. These strategic exits are the contract manufacturing activity that came with the BIUS vaccines acquisition, as well as 2 terminated legacy US distribution agreements and Posilac. You'll see that we provided a back up slide quantifying the drivers of our animal health revenue growth excluding those strategic exits. We're encouraged with the revenue trends we're seeing in our ongoing or core business. New products contribute $ 62 million in Q1, driven primarily by Credelio, INTERCEPTOR PLUS and Galliprant. These new products drove our core companion animal portfolio up 10% in the quarter. Our core food animal business decreased 4%, primarily due the U.S. buying patterns in Q1, 2017, as well as continued ractopamine competition, importantly though our poultry business continue to deliver strong growth. In Q1, poultry products grew11%, well ahead of the market and we expect to see full-year growth for our overall core food animal portfolio. Lastly, I point out this is our second consecutive quarter with overall price growth, which is a sign of solid foundations in the industry. We expect this price growth to continue through 2018. We are monitoring the trade situation closely and while we do not see immediate impact to our animal health business, we are cautious about the broader economic impact if export activity declines. Hopefully, this provides you with useful insights into our animal health revenue growth and Jeff can address questions you may have in the Q&A session. So now let's take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on Slide 11. In total, our new products including Trulicity, Basaglar, Jardiance, Taltz, Verzenio, Olumiant, Lartruvo and Cyramza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 11.1 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The loss of exclusivity of Effient, Strattera, Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista and Axiron provided a drag of 510 basis points, while Cialis and animal health accounted for 230 and 120 basis points of volume declined respectively. Slide 12 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated nearly $1.5 billion in revenue this quarter, and represented over a quarter of our total worldwide revenue. I'd like to highlight the progress in our second quarter of Verzenio launch. We are pleased with the continued new to brand shared growth which is now at 15% in the approval of the new first line metastatic breast cancer indication, giving us the broadest label in the class. Last week at AACR, we presented the final analysis of the MONARCH 3data which showed 28.2 months in progression-free survival, more than months better than placebo, as well as analysis across all patient subgroups in the MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 studies which demonstrated that patients with certain concerning clinical characteristics received substantial benefits in the addition of Verzenio to endocrine therapy. Moving to Slide 13. This quarter FX had a more significant effect on our results, largely driven by the euro. Excluding FX, you can see that revenue increased 5%, non-GAAP cost of sales increased just 2% and non-GAAP EPS increased 47%. Turning to our 2018 financial guidance on Slide 14. You will see that we've updated our guidance to reflect an additional $700 million on top line, driven by lower expected Medicaid utilization, changes in estimates to rebates and discounts, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. A slight increase in marketing, selling, admin and R&D expenses to account for FX movements, as well as for funding for additional pipeline opportunities. An increase of $25 million to the top end of our range for OID, and a decrease in our tax rate from 18% to 17% which reflects the change in expected geographic mix of income. These updates contribute to an increase in both GAAP and non- GAAP earnings per share. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $5.10 to $5.20, which is an increase of 20% over 2017 at the midpoint of the range. Now I will turn the call back over to Dave to review view the pipeline and key future bets. David Ricks : Thanks Joshua. Slide 15 shows select NME and NILEX as of April 20th movement since our last earnings call include the approval of baricitinib for the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the US. A Phase 3 starts for Trulicity in 3 mg and 4.5 mg doses. A Phase 1 starts for the IL-23 CGRP biospecific antibody for immunology. While we have attrition of the Phase 2 base inhibitor molecule as monotherapy, the trial and combination with the N3pG antibody continues, and we look forward to seeing results in this novel trial design. We also discontinued our abemaciclib pancreatic cancer study. You'll see we've combined our NME and NILEX pipeline into one view. In terms of NILEX, we have a robust set of lifecycle opportunities for recently launched products, which we expect will continue to bolster the growth prospects for important brands like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Olumiant and Jardiance. These products are well positioned in some of the largest and fastest growing categories. In our dressing areas of high unmet medical need. Key NILEX opportunities include AxSpA for Taltz, atopic dermatitis for Olumiant, adjuvant breast cancer for Verzenio. The 3 mg and 4.5 mg dose study for Trulicity and heart failure for Jardiance, which is in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. On Slide 16, we highlight expected key events for 2018. In addition to noting the US approval of Verzenio for first line metastatic breast cancer, we've indicated the data disclosure of the keynote 189 study at AACR which showed that Alimta, in combination with Keytruda plus platinum chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by half compared with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in metastatic, non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer patients. The overall survival benefit was robust regardless of PDL-1 expression status. We also announced last week that the Cyramza Phase 3 study in bladder cancer did not reach statistical significance in the secondary endpoint of overall survival. There are many events to look forward to in 2018, notably the expected regulatory action for US baricitinib, galcanezumab, Verzenio and Alimta. We also look forward to the data readout of the second phase 3 study of Taltz in ankylosing spondylitis. The readout of the rewind study for Trulicity, and the initiation of several phase 3 studies including our anti IL-23 for ramucirumab for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made this quarter. In Q1, new products accounted for 25% of total revenue, and nearly 30% of our human pharma revenue. Volume grew in our human Pharma business by 4% despite recent patent expirations. And when excluding the strategic exits, our animal health business returned to positive performance growth. We realized significant efficiencies in our cost structure leading to operating margin expansion of 775 basis points excluding FX. And we have main pipeline progress this quarter with the launch of Verzenio in the first line metastatic breast cancer in the US. The launch of Taltz for psoriatic arthritis in Germany and positive phase 3 data for new indications for both Taltz and Cyramza.  Finally, we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Phil Johnson to moderate the Q&A session. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible during the Q&A session. So we do ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single two-part question. Lia, you can provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from line of Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Greg Gilbert : Thanks. Good morning, team. First, Dan, congrats to you in your new role. Dave, can you talk about the use of Bari outside the US in terms of mix of strengths and any post marketing safety data that you have to bolster your case with the FDA? And secondly on the subject of drug pricing in the US. What types of changes are you expecting the administration to put forth? You can be specific as you'd like but at least conceptually would love your opinion and how do you think Lilly is positioned relative to those potential changes? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you for the questions. We are actually going to have Christi Shah, President of Lilly Bio-Med to take your question on the use of the two different doses outside the US and any o-US data that may be helpful as we present our case to the FDA. And then Dave you'll have the question on drug pricing. Christi? Christi Shaw : So outside the US over 40 countries you have both the 2 and 4 mg approved. And the majority of the use is in the 4 mg with remarkable efficacy, really patients getting their lives back and the safety continues to hold up that we see no new signals that are different than what we submitted to the FDA. And will continue I think yesterday's ADCOM showed for sure the unanimous vote on the efficacy of the 4 mg is important to patients in the US. So we want both the 2 and the 4 mg approved in the US for those patients. David Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Greg. Obviously, big topic drug pricing. I mean it's hard to speculate exactly what the administration will say or do, but I think I can comment on what pharmas position has been and Lilly's as well, which is as it relates to a leading pain at the pharmacy counter and reducing the burden of list prices that consumers pay at the counter, we've been long been proponents of rebate pass-through, both in commercial plans and Part D. And I think the most important action that the administration could take would be to create either set of experiments or mandate a rebate pass-through for patients in the Part D program. This would I think immediately impact seniors cash flow and pocketbook, as well as I think helped to normalize the incentives on gross to net spread. So that I would be personally surprise if that wasn't part of the commentary, and that's something we've long stood for. So that would be I think a positive development from our perspective. The HHS Secretary has commented on Part B and the lack of market mechanism there. I would expect that to be a topic of discussion. And then we do see increased desire under this administration to approve waivers for Medicaid, giving states flexibility in a variety of forms to manage their own programs. And I would expect to see more of that. Finally, we worked closely with this administration on trade agenda to balance the incentives that foreign markets have to suppress drug pricing which are primarily exports from the US. We've had some early signs of success there with the Korea free trade agreement. We'll keep on that. I think long term, US needs to use is trading power to help equalize that sharing across sort of advertising the R&D expense that it takes to create the new innovations, which are becoming even more frequently from the industry. So we watch that carefully and continue advocate for pro innovation, pro patient choice, as well as policies that can make sure that this innovation, this industry can continue innovate and prosper for years to come. So all those topics are front of mind and will keep working out, Greg. Operator : Very good. It's the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the robust results. Just back to Olumiant. Can you just quantify the number of patient years of therapy that you have on Olumiant, not just in the clinical package but how many or how much patient years or number of patient years of therapy that you have abroad especially since it's heavily skewed towards 4 mg? And then on Taltz, on the Novartis call, they clearly indicated that they also had a wholesaler de-stock and buyout. In addition to that was giving away a lot of free products. And then obviously copay accumulators are also a topic that is penalizing patients on deductibles. Can you provide some commentary on the miss on Taltz and the impact across your business of potentially copay accumulator going forward? Phil Johnson : Great, John. Thank you for the questions. So Christi if you want to start with the Taltz question and then we'll figure out who's going to be best position here to give some of the numbers on the patient years exposures for Olumiant and the clinical trial program. Christi Shaw : And can you give me the clarity on the Taltz question that was with term -- John Boris : I think the Novartis indicated they gave away a lot of free product through initial sampling. How much did that impact IL-70 uptake in the quarter particular Taltz? Christi: So for Taltz, we did have some inventory changes which were the biggest rationale for our decline from Q4 to Q1 in terms of dollars. But our demand was up in terms of Q4, Q4. And in fact our NBrx has grown 30% sequentially in the first quarter. So we're seeing actually real demand coming through. I can't really comment on the others, and how they count their inventories. The accumulator program I think our goal is to make sure that patients get access to every medicine that we provide and that their doctors think they need. So whether that a little bit of rebating, whether that's copay assistance et cetera that passed through that Dave talked about earlier. It's also important to ensure the patient's get access, but we haven't had issues to date. David Ricks : And then John I don't think here in the room we have numbers on the patients that are in some of the overseas registries for follow-up. I think Dan you do have some information on the clinical trial program and the number of patients and patient years exposure. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, John. So in the safety data we presented to the Advisory Committee was based on more than 7, 800 patient years in our clinical trials. And that establishes the safety database for baricitinib from clinical trial experience. Your question referred also to the commercial experience outside the United States, where obviously they've been many, many more patients exposed to the drug. Although, we don't have exact numbers for patient years exposure. As you heard from Christi, despite that extensive exposure, we haven't seen any new safety signals. So while we agreed that VTE is a potential risk of this drug. We haven't seen that manifest in the clinical experience. Operator : Very good. That is the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. Going back to Taltz. So in the class of IL-17 in general J&J is running the Phase 3 eclipse trial comparing their IL-23 to Novartis is IL-17. You have both of these mechanisms either on the market or in development. So I'm hoping you have some perspective on what you think is the better more effective mechanism in psoriasis. And if that J&J trial comes out in favor of Tremfya, doesn't that have a potential indirect impact on Taltz? And second question on your GIP/GLP one, I know you've said in the past we're supposed to see Phase 2 data this year. Can you say what the likely venue will be and maybe preview what you're hoping to see in that data? Phil Johnson : Great, Tim. Thank you for the question. So Christi to you for the question on Taltz, IL-23 versus IL-17 and then Enrique over to you for your first question of the day on the GIP/GLP. Christi Shaw : Sure. I mean, first of all, what I would say is thank goodness for patience we have so many more newer medications that are providing such higher efficacy. So IL-23, IL-17, they are going to be great for patients and it's going to spend the time to tap into that older market where the older TNS really lack efficacy relatively speaking. So the other thing is patients really churn through different modalities, each patient might need something different, they response to one and not the other, so we're really confident glad that we have both in our portfolio and we believe there will be specific patients for each. Specific to Taltz, as we look at the future the very short-term, not only is the psoriatic arthritis indication starting to kick off, these are dermatology really move in the first quarter and we think it's due to the psoriatic arthritis s indication really solidifying that efficacy there, but we also have our own head-to-head psoriatic arthritis readout later this year versus Humira, and then we have our ankylosing spondylitis data too that we have one of two studies that have completed. The second will be at the end of this year. So a lots happening with Taltz and we feel very good about our chances are winning the market place. Enrique Conterno : So, we've been an excited for quite a sometime about GIP/GLP clearly, the hurdle for this product is pretty high and we want to see their superior outcome when it comes to hemoglobin A1C and weight loss, this will be current GLP. We expect that we're going to be disclosing some of this data either later late this year or ADA next year. We have to see. Operator : Next is a line of Geoff Meecham from Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meecham :  Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks a lot for the question. Just have a few more for Enrique and diabetes. So Trulicity growth has been great but how is the influential do you feel like rewind could be positive or negative relative to the current trajectory? And then Jardiance SLT-2 class is growing but we've haven't quite seen a tipping point for Jardiance just like guidelines, how do you think that could play out? And what do you think that could be and then I know it's been a lot of very questions already but if it's just a two mg dose that's approve maybe help us with the commercial positioning. Obviously weaker but I just want to give your context for that? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Meecham, thank you for the question. And Enrique will go to you for the first two questions with Trulicity and Jardiance. And then the Christi over to you for a question on 2 mg dose for baricitinib commercial implication. Enrique Conterno : Yes. Maybe just to start with framing the Trulicity quarters because we have another strong quarter continued solid growth. We basically have seen that the increased promotion but the new launches is basically having some impact in market acceleration, but we see both -- we see a very good market growth and we see basically good share performance with Trulicity in a more competitive environment. So we very much like our position we have a strong access position as well and finally I'm calling something that sometimes it's under estimated but it's the patient experience that we basically receive from physicians, from patient themselves. We have an excellent real world efficacy and which is very simply delivered. So we're very excited about that. Clearly, we wind us and change any of that but it is extremely important because we believe the longer-term for us to be competitive in this class we will need cardiovascular outcomes. As it relates to the SGLT2s, clearly we have been seen some very good growth of Jardiance but we had a pretty important event in Q1 related to the exclusion from CBS. Jardiance still has very good access and what we basically have seen post the rebasing of the prescriptions of patients, many patients have been switch and we basically have seen resumed growth over the last few weeks. Clearly the SGLT2 class and Jardiance in particulars still a very small part of the overall prescriptions. We estimate that about 30% of patients with diabetes have established for the vascular disease. So the opportunity for us is of continued growth and we're working to accelerate Jardiance and being Jardiance catalyst for the growth of the class. Christi Shaw : Thanks Geoff for the question. I think you saw yesterday the reinforcement by everyone with the 4 milligram dose is really needed for patients from an efficacy standpoint. So our goal is to actually have both doses available and we continue to study both the 2 and the 4 milligrams and other studies that are ongoing. Operator : Next we go to line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much for the questions. First one was just on the Humalog performance in the quarter and some of the rebates. So just two questions there, first, can you just quantify what the benefit was in the quarter? And second, can you just elaborate and what's happening with mix year and can we think about that is sustainable? My second question was on Taltz channel dynamics is under question just quantifying what we saw in terms of the work down of this quarter. And you've also get some very healthy volume trends but can you talk a little bit more about the underlying price dynamics in the IL-17? Are there other pressures we should be thinking about beyond just channel work down the quarter that could offsets of that volume growth? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Chris. Thank you for the question. Just to understand the second question. You mentioned mix being sustainable, is that specific to Humalog or that more broadly focused across the portfolio products in the U.S. Chris Schott : I was actually specifically with the Humalog, but if there is a broader trend we'd love to hear that as well. Phil Johnson : Okay. Very good, so if you love to the or Enrique if you talk about the Humalog in addition of the mix and then over to Christi for the Taltz channel dynamics. Joshua Smiley, if you are going to make any overall comments and repeat a one on or we generally seeing in the U.S. across our portfolio for mix. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Very good. So when it comes to Humalog of course, strong quarter, we saw about a $50 million benefit in the quarter related to changes in the estimates of rebates and discounts. Part of that was Medicaid and part of that other payers mix changes. We basically see some of those benefits continuing throughout the year of course some of that is also growing as part of Q1. In essence, we are seeing lower Medicaid claims and basically other dynamics that are slightly favorable when it comes to payer mix, when it comes -- specifically to Humalog. Now, when we look broadly the portfolio, it is pretty clear that those Medicaid claims is something that we see across the portfolio but not all of our products are as exposed as of the incidents are. Christi Shaw : Sure, so specifically the inventory change we saw was about $32 million quarter four and quarter one. And if we look at the price dynamics and volume growth, ours volume growth and as we look to the future, if patients really need the best medications out there, we haven't seen a strong need yet to significantly rebate. I know Novartis in its call said that on their but that's not the same case for us. Operator : Yes. We have line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Hi. Couple of questions, please. Could you indicate your assessments have been impacted setting that [indiscernible] [Technical Difficulty] in 2019 given the new business, the third-party patients? Second, could you talk your expectations for Alimta post 189 data as well as the stalling of the 340B expansion which I assumed is health view? And then finally on business development and oncology generally, I know that my pay loss likely go to a competitor and also away that the deal flow we might have expected from to the in oncology not as yet transpired, but could you just update this on your commitment particularly to immuno biology and expectations and valuations you see for and potential acquisition for partnering candidate externally. Thank you. Company Representative : Great. Andrew, thank you for the questions, we'll go to Enrique for the first question on the doughnut hole in 2019, and then Sue if would like to comment on expectations for Alimta moving forward as well as project perspective as you presented on oncology business development. And now the Dave or Josh you want to give a corporate perspective feel free to augment. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : So the increased coverage in during the doughnut hole for 2018, when we look at our overall portfolio is about $200 million, most of it being driven by diabetes Sue Mahony : Yes, with regard to Alimta, clearly, we're very pleased with the Keynote-189 data and as I mentioned earlier, we have seen growth in this quarter on Alimta in the U.S. 8% growth overall and 3% that was price, 5% that was volume. We've also continue to see increase in each brand in combination. I think we don't give focus on individual products, and I think it's key to note that about 50% of our sale is come from first line and second line, about 40% is first line. With that we are as I said, seeing a stabilization in overall share market and an increase in each brand. We continue to see unexpected that increase as we saw some people waiting for the phase 3 trials data outcome before turning the combination of the Alimta, Keytruda and carbo. So we are really pleased with that. We think that it's concerns the benefit that we seen with Alimta, historically as a standard of care in the first line non-small cell lung cancer setting, and we continue to see that will be the case going forward. And with regard to a business development, we are continuing to be very interested in BD across all areas including IL, and we have told previously about offshore bank deal which is a bet that we have one of the best that we will be placing with regards to RNA based vaccines. We anticipate that we will be doing other deals both in the IL space and in other areas in oncology in the future. We're also bringing in new people into our team again. We motioned we\u2019ve on-boarded two physicians recently, one from Duke and the other from the Memorial Sloan Kettering and you will see us continuing to bringing more external talent. David Ricks : I would just say we're highly committed to use balance sheet to expand our portfolio with BD, we've talk about clinical stage assets and particular and oncology's the number one target. So, Jeff I wouldn't read through the relative lack of activity most recently as any signs that we're change our conviction. Of course, we need to look at each idea and make sure make sense for us to only make sure we like sciences and valuations are appropriate. But as we'll be discipline on those matters but strategically we understand, we need to be active externally and you can count us. If you need to look at all available choices that to our pipeline in particular in oncology. Phil Johnson : Okay, thank you, Dave. And then back to question that John Boris had asked but we did not have a data for. Thank you to Olumiant team for providing that we now have 11,500 patients' years of exposure with baricitinib. And when you add in the post approval exposures. Lia, we can go to next caller please. Operator : Thank you. It will be the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Tony Butler : Thanks very much. Two questions if I may. One is, the pipeline related, one is galcanezumab and you do have some data at AN today. But I'm just curious with respect to the range of somewhat similar products that we'll come to market as a cluster, I assume later this year. What makes gout stand out? And can it do so without having a second agent in the bag is it less middle hand. And then second, back to the previous question asked on immuno biology. You have had relationship with an antibody base company I assume for biospecifics. And I'm just curious it seems to be an interesting area with CD1 through engagers in. Could you speak more to that because it's a way maybe to back end and to an area and which you didn't have to go through reset direct PD1? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Okay, thank you for the questions, Tony. Christi we will go to you for the galcanezumab and how we intend to succeed in that market place. And over to Sue for the question on immuno biology biospecifics et cetera. Christi Shaw : Sure, So, Tony thanks for the question. I think this is an area where migraine patient haven't had and an option for few decades, and here we are with the couple of agents coming out quickly together. So, first of all, I think the really good thing to really have a couple of companies activating these patients. So, the first piece is who is going to be better at the consumer driven area, the direct to consumer. And I think our chance is there are very good and we have a history of that. On the day specifically, we have 50%, 75% and 100% measurements endpoint and we are the only one is actually showing at 10% to 15% of the patient have the ability will be free of migraine totally. The other think we have is the galca is fast and durable. We see results as early as month one and we see the results continue through the 12 months that we've looked at. You were right, we do have the cluster data coming up and nothing has ever worked in this type of migraine and if we do it'll be a huge win for patients and obviously is then good for differentiating galcanezumab. So our second half launch, we're well prepared for to be competitive and we think we have some differentiation there. Sue Mahony : Yes. Tony thanks for the question, biospecifics, yes, as we've looked at our I/O portfolio and what we want to do, we want to understand really what the next generation of IO agents are. And we've taken two bets. I mention one, and we'll be taking others by the way but two that we've taken at the moment, one is the RNA based vaccines that we think really could be potentially disruptive in the future. The other is the biospecifics and as you have mentioned we have ongoing collaborations and actually a number of biospecifics looking at different targets that should be coming into the clinic very soon. We're excited by those. Another asset that we've got in the clinic that we talked about before but not too much is the TIM-3 and we're pretty excited by our TIM-3 and think that we've got a best-in-class asset there. We've also got an IDO. We know that there's some data on IDO we have to see what happens there, but we believe that we've got one that again could be differentiated; so those are two assets we've got in clinic now and as you mentioned we're taking bets on the RNA based vaccines and the by specifics. Operator : Thank you. That's the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great, thanks for taking my question. May be just following up on a couple there were topics that were discussed earlier again on baricitinib kind of coming out of yesterday's discussion just I know you have a phase-3 program in atopic dermatitis. Can you just talk about how you see sort of risk/reward and the attractiveness of a product like this in atopic dermatitis where I would think acceptance of safety concerns may be a little bit lower? And then the second question I have just following up on the question on the CGRPs, just curious if you could give your thoughts given we have Botox on the market and also some oral products that are generally used for preventative use, would you expect that the CGRP antibodies are going to use only patients upon through those products or do you think that there might be an opportunity to be used ahead of either. [Technical Difficulty] Phil Johnson : Great, Vamil. Thank you for the question. So Christi we'll go to you for both the baric, atopic term question, as well as where you see CGRP potentially being used. Christi Shaw : Sure. So baricitinib you know each disease they have its own benefit risk ratio so if you look at what we're studying our phase 2 data with Lupus. We have both the two and the four milligram. If you look at atopic derm, the data that we read out in phase two, the two milligram did work; it just took a little bit longer. So whether it\u2019s two or four you know we know the patients will get better there. So each disease, they really have its own dosing and for rheumatoid arthritis we strongly believe the two and four milligrams needs to be available in the US as it is in over 40 countries. On the CGRP side, we expect patients to cycle through the generics and most of them already have there's like 4 to 5 million patients that are on preventatives and then there we believe there's a few million more that aren't on preventative and should be. So we have every expectation that there'll be a requirement for them to have used for example triptan before they; they go on to a CGRP, but we do expect it will compete well versus Botox. I mean getting 21 to 24 injections in your around your head for doesn't seem as good as having a monthly injection if I\u2019m a patient. So I think we have an advantage there and they have the same hurdles from an access standpoint. So I believe that usage will come and we\u2019re already talking to payers about how we make sure that access is available to the patients that need it. Operator : And that's a line of Mark Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead. Mark Goodman : Just to continue on with the CGRP conversation as well as Lasmiditan. Can you just talk about the safety profiles that you see and how you think these things are going to be all used? I mean presumably if everything makes it to the market, how the orals will be used? Your oral versus CGRP orals. Second question is Taltz, just can you explain the specialty pharmacy buying pattern issue and what was the impact on Taltz in the quarter and there were also some inventory patterns with respect to Forteo. Can you quantify that as well? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Okay. So Dan if you wouldn't mind talking about some of the safety profiles for a CGRP monoclonal antibody as well as Lasmiditan. Christi, if you could then get the second part of that piece of the question that was how we see Lasmiditan being used relative to oral CGRPs potentially and then if you could go over again the Taltz specialty pharmacy buying patterns that we've seen in effect of this quarter\u2019s revenues proposal. Dan Skovronsky : Great, thanks. So with respect to the safety profile of galcanezumab, I think we've been really encouraged by what we've seen in our phase-3 trials on safety. And I think that's critically important for a preventative for migraine patients could be on for a very long time to be well tolerated by the patients and have a very clean safety profile. So that's an important differentiator for galcanezumab and for the class probably of anti-CGRP antibodies. When you get to the orals which are abortive, the safety profile could be a bit different and we've seen some evidence of that for the oral CGRPs and I think Christi you were going to comment on commercial differentiation. Christi Shaw : Sure. I think that's one of the big advantages that we bring in the marketplace is a platform that we're building for pain. So we have the prevention and galcanezumab, the treatment in Lasmiditan and then we have Tanezumab coming. With the mechanism of action Lasmiditan is different than the oral CGRPs. And if we look at patients not everyone responds to the same agent. So we believe that they'll be used similarly for an acute phase and that not all patients will respond to one or the other. So obviously our goal would be to win in that marketplace and position ourselves well for that. But we're working on the package to submit later this year. And then on the Forteo question, I'm sorry the Taltz specialty pharmacy, I think I answered that. That was like a $33 million that was the inventory impact for Taltz but demand was positive quarter-to- quarter. And then on Forteo, the last question on Forteo was basically what we saw was inventory cam in at a different way. We saw the wholesaler buying patterns actually increased volume in Q4 of last year. Some of that has been de-stocking in Q1 but not all of it. We did have somewhat formally loss with Tim Lowe's, the new competitive entries but that was a really small impact to the overall performance for Forteo. David Ricks : Okay. I am just going to add I guess there was another question about using for the CGRP antibodies in refractory patients. Just to point out that all of our phase-3 pivotal studies had patients who failed on at least two other modalities. So that's likely the indication I'm not sure if that has a big commercial bearing because those patients who have had - are chronic migrainers or episodic migrainers have tried many other things. So I think the pool of available patients for prevention will be there. The data in our program and I believe all the competitors is on to failures and despite that and the data we\u2019re present today is incredibly strong, large extent of patients have at least 50% reduction in headache days per month. Operator : And that is Dave Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. So I have two questions. First just to follow up on the CGRPs. There was a Reuters article today that described how Express Scripts is asking for lower list prices on CGRPs. Could you just provide a comment on that and whether a manufacturer could trust PDMs to not extract significant rebates in the event that a manufacturer does list, the list price lower than expected and then second with respect to Trulicity rewind, the slide that you published this morning indicates an internal readout in 2018, but not an external readout and I just wanted to understand that a little bit better because clinicaltrials.gov indicates July completion of that trial. Thank you very much. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Dave. Well, the article you're referencing was specific to CGRPs. Your question really more of a policy question. So Dave if you would mind taking the first part of Dave Risinger question then Enrique over to you for the Trulicity rewind, timing of internal readout and top-line press release relative to presentation to medical media. David Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Dave. I did glance at that interview with Steve Miller this morning. I was really happy to see this Express Scripts is now for value-based pricing. Of course, we've been for this kind of construct for years because we believe in the performance of our products and I think in the case of migraine drugs and many other drugs. Diabetes, other autoimmune drugs even in oncology I think we're willing to enter into these discussions. The point about lower list prices is a little bit moods, I think the idea that the price varies in a value-based scheme based on actual product performance I think that's the key piece. So the value determination we will need to do it's difficult to comment specifically on launched products, would we trust the PDMs? Well, I think we worked closely with all the major payers in the US. I am happy to see the ESI is now changing their view and supportive of this kind of construct. We'd be happy to work with them on it. Enrique Conterno : So when it comes to a rewind, we do expect internal readout in the second half with the top-line press release likely in early Q4, and we will be targeting the full disclosure of the results at the next year's ADA meeting. Phil Johnson : And Dave, just to be clear the city.gov date that you cite is the expectation for the last event. Obviously, with it being event-driven there is uncertainty around that. Even once we have the last event occur that would trigger then the analysis to be done. It does take a number of months to go ahead and get all that final visits and data into the system clean and validate the database, and then run our tables, figures and listings and report out. So Lia, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : Very good. It's line of line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin : Thank you. May be for you David and Christi, I don't want to put words in your mouth but it sure sounds like you're not going to launch baricitinib unless you can get both two and four milligrams approved is that correct? And can you cite specific examples where the FDA goes against the panel recommendation? I know recently there was a Pacira that was approved even though the panel went against it but that was a non-opioid drug and in this case there is another jack on the market. So I'm just wondering if you can comment on your level of confidence that you can convince the FDA to vote against the FDA panel on the four milligram tablet. And if you can't would it is your decision not to launch Baricitinib for RA and to what extent would that affects your 5% top-line growth objective? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Great, Christi. You want to go ahead and answer the question related to the launch two and four et cetera and maybe Josh if you want to comment on expectations versus 2020. Christi Shaw : Sure. As I said before I think the promising thing we saw is that there was unanimous, unanimity in terms of the four milligram efficacy. And so the thing that you saw in the voting was based on a specific indication and as we continue to work with the FDA on our labeling and our path to the market that's where we can say we\u2019re the highest unmet need. So that the patients who are suffering so much in the United States have access as they do in 40 other countries to improve their pain and improve their lives. So we will continue to talk to them about what is the path for both two and four milligrams and what is the indication that we can best serve the highest unmet need population. So I think one of the things you saw in the vote was the wording was very specific to the indication that was presented which was at after -- methotrexate, thank you. And then let's see the outcome. So I can't comment or recall any AdCom in terms of overruling but I think as I said it wouldn't be overruling the AdCom if we look at a different and carve out indication for four milligrams that benefits patients the most and make it 2 milligram available as well to lower risk patients. Joshua Smiley : Thanks, Jami. I think we've been clear about our growth expectations through 2020, which is a five% compound annual growth rate and the five% is a minimum and not dependent on any single product where we're confident in our growth prospects. I think if you look at where we are on Q1. We're ahead of our targets to get to a 5% growth in 2020. The strength of the new products that we have on the market today and the potential new launches in pain and other things that we've talked about already I think give us good confidence that we'll be there in 2020. We're still excited about the prospects of Olumiant particularly outside the US where we\u2019ve already launched. I think by just looking at analyst models, the dollars associated with the US sales of Olumiant in 2020. I think in most of your models are pretty small anyway, but we're confident in strength to the portfolio that new products will continue to drive our growth and we're -- that 5% minimum is still valid. Operator : Yes. It\u2019s the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. A couple questions. First on rewind. There's some concern about the less sick population being studied versus some of your competitors studies. Can you talk about how you design rewind to still achieve its endpoint despite its population possibly generating fewer events so maybe you can comment on how you arrived at the trial size, duration and also the statistical power? And then secondly, a couple questions on Elanco yesterday was announced that you hired a CFO for Elanco; is this newly created position and why was it done now? And can you comment on poultry trends? I think you've commented, no, can you comment on swine and cattle, you already commented on poultry. Thank You. Phil Johnson : Christi, thank you for the question. So we'll go around the horn here. Enrique, if you'll take the first question on the design of rewind, Josh, Elanco CFO hiring that was announced yesterday and then Jeff you can give some more details on other parts of portfolio including swine that we didn't comment on in the prepared remarks. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Well, Rewind is an event-driven trial. So we will basically have closer of this trial-one, we hit a certain number of events and the trial is appropriately powered for us to show basically a statistical difference if the product were to show it that is meaningful. So we are pretty confident. I do know that we got a lot of questions about the population that we have enrolled, whether the population is maybe less sick. We at this point in time I think we basically want to see the outcomes of the trial. We do have a lot of expertise when it comes to designing cardiovascular trials. And we're confident that we've designed this trial in the appropriate way. Dan, I don't know if you want to make any other comments. Dan Skovronsky : No, that's correct. I would just add that we'll have one of the longer duration trials here in terms of the follow-up time on these patients, which gives us sort of more area under the curve time for the drug to work. And have its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. So although the lowering right mandates a larger longer trial, the increased duration actually we see as benefits to showing effect. Joshua Smiley : I think our first our strategic evaluation of Elanco is continuing as planned and we'll be in a position in our Q2 earnings call to announce our strategic direction. Our hiring of Chris Jensen as a CFO for Elanco adds to that analysis, he brings good external experience. And I think will position us well for any future direction that we announce and look to execute after our Q2 earnings call. Jeff Simmons : Yes, Steve. So first system industry perspective at a high level, beef continues to be stable and continue to grow. Dairy is a slower recovery expected probably as an industry later in 2019, and swine I think the eyes are a little bit on trade but again pretty stable overall. So we feel pretty good about the overall industry economics, no material impact on us. I think everyone's; as Josh said in his comments we're going to continue to watch trade. I don't think it's relative to a feed additive issue or anything like that. It would be much more just about the impact that trade barriers could have on the overall economics especially of the US industry. At this time, we don't see anything and definitely no impact on us. If you look at Elanco\u2019s business, food animal will return to growth in the second half as we've stated. We see that led heavily by poultry and swine, less so by ruminants. Operator : Next is the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I noticed phase three investigating a really high dose 4.5 milligrams in diabetes and I was just curious, a, what your thought processes but also your expectations on weight loss in that trial? And I would have thought that at such a high dose you might have included a semaglutide comparator as well. So just curious how you thought about that trial? And then in a quick follow up on animal health. Is Posilac and Optaflexx still a driver that's been weighing in just wanted to understand the market access pressures to livestocks? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Umer. Thank you for the question. So Enrique on the recently initiated study for Trulicity using some higher doses and then Jeff back to you for some animal health dynamics with Posilac and Optaflexx. Enrique Conterno : So we are studying both 3 and 4.5 milligrams. We believe those doses can be well tolerated if appropriately titrated. And we basically have design this trial in a way that it can show actually a difference from a regulatory perspective vis-\u00e0-vis dula 1.5 when it comes to hemoglobin A1C. We are also expecting to see important difference when it comes to weight loss, but its okay that we made the A1C end point from risk benefit perspective in order to get this product approval. Jeff Simmons : Yes. So market access issues continue to be definitely and an area that we\u2019re focused on and again we have taken some proactive actions as Josh mentioned with the strategic exiting as we are assessing our decision here with Posilac and exiting the business, but headwinds do continue for Posilac. I would note on our food animal business, first of all international grew as you will note in the backup slides that we saw close to 2% growth in o-US food animal. The net 10% though I would highlight came from one majority of that being Posilac and the declining in use. And again that\u2019s driven by our exit and then some U.S. buying patterns relative to Q1 of 2017. On ractopamine, competition continues although we are continuing to see our business hold and remain stable in this area. Operator : We go to its line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Jason Gerberry : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. First question is on Verzenio. Feedback from Pfizer is that at least in the U.S. the metastatic market for the CDK0/4 agents is getting increasingly well penetrated and that maybe more of the near to medium term growth is shifting to x-US expansion, at least until label expansion occurs with more early use in breast cancer setting. So just kind of curious, if you agree with that assessment and as we look at Verzenio, the real growth opportunity in the U.S. is going to be contingent upon getting new patients start share versus your competitors. And then just the second question on CGRP front, how important you think early mover advantages in this category? One of the three kind of more advanced players in the market faces some uncertainty into it June PDUFA date, so just kind of curious how important you think early mover advantage would be in the category? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Jason, thank you for the question. So Sue, we go to you for Verzenio question and then Christi over to you for the question on CGRP first mover advantage. Sue Mahony : Yes. Thanks for the question on Verzenio. With regards to, well, first, we\u2019re very pleased with the uptick I think as Josh mentioned we\u2019ve got 15% huge brand share. And when we launched it we launched with the single agent activity and the combination with [Indescernible] and we should back at third of the market literally just the end of February we launch with the larger indication which is the rheumatoid just two third of the market and we\u2019re now 16% on each brands, we feel good about that. And with regards to the actual market, we see plenty of opportunity actually for both growth in the market and also taking share with regards to growth about 50% of patients are treated with CDK4 and 6inhibitors, so again we see an opportunity there. One of the things that we\u2019re trying to do is to ensure that physicians really understand patients that can benefit the most and we present a data on pace of the concerning clinical characteristics where with Verzenio, we were able to see that even in those patients we could see robust an efficacy similar to the overall patient population. And obviously with the data that we\u2019ve got with the rheumatoid which is well the 28.2 month PFS is seen as robust as well, we see that as beneficial and we also see we got differentiated molecule with single-agent activity and continue dosing. So, our believe is that we can both compete within the market and that there is still continues to be opportunity to growth in the for the overall CDK market in the U.S. and of course o-US we have submitted to Europe and Japan and we hope to get approval later this year in both those geographies. Christi Shaw : So on how important CGRP in early mover is, look at different classes, it depends on the differentiation strategy pieces, in general though three to four months is not a big deal, I mean by the time you get your label and get approved, then you\u2019re talking about access, really its not a big difference. If you are looking at bigger delay and you have two agents in the marketplace and you are 12 to 18 months later that is a detriment for share. Operator : Next is line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Prakhar: Good morning. This is [Prakhar] for Alex Arfaei. I just had one question. Could you provide additional thoughts behind your decision to discontinue the base in a bit on its own? And yet advance the combination with the anti-PG antibody. And what was the milestone achieved to drive this efficiency. Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you for the question. Dan if you like to comment? Dan Skovronsky : Yes, thanks for that question. So you're correct that we terminated the monotherapy for our phase 2 base inhibitor. That was based on a combination of external data readouts which of course you're familiar with, as well as our internal look at the data. A theory behind this compound initially was that given its higher brain penetration, this would have a favorable, more favorable safety profile. However, we also sought to demonstrate efficacy in Phase 2 and that was futility was what drove us towards stopping it. Now the rationale to continuing in and of course in monotherapy that continues to be on base status and phase 3 for monotherapy. As you commented we continue with the combination. Here I think we have a growing understanding that we need to clear the Abeta out of the brain with a plot clearly antibody that's get centered PG and also inhibited to production. So hitting from both end is rationale there for the combo. Operator : Yes. It's the line of David Mirus with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David Mirus : Good morning, a couple of questions. First going back on the administration's potential moves. When you mentioned the pass through pricing net of rebates. Can you address that assumes or does it assume that PVMs will willingly just make less money or how do you think mechanistically that will work without having an impact to PVMs. And then separately, if you can just provide us with, if you were to think of your top-10 or 20 products relative pricing average in the U.S. versus say developed Europe. What would you say the differential in net pricing would be? Is it as large as some people think or is it because of all the discounts that are much lower, thanks? Phil Johnson : David. Thank you for the questions. Dave Ricks we'll have -- can you take both. David Ricks : Sure. So just on the rebate through. As it relates to the Part D program. We've done modeling ourselves as well as pharma. And I know CMS has as well. Then it isn't free as you point out. But as Scott has been saying his podium speeches lately we somehow device a system where the fixed subsidized well. And I think there is something ethically wrong with that. I think there is going to census about that even among PVM apparently. So the idea will be that premiums would modestly grow across Part D program. We're talking $1 or $2 per member per month is probably all that's necessary. In exchange for passing through some portion not a 100%. But some portion of rebates to consumers in the Part D program in particular when they're exposed to the donut hole and beyond that their share of traffic side. So that's the basic idea. In that model, I think Part D plan providers will just be make a trade- off which is slightly higher premiums in exchange for maybe pass through. And of course that math requires some assumptions about how much rebates pass through. Our position is that it needs to be well more than half. Both to reduce the [Indescernible] of middle man and manufacturers to raise fewer prices, which I think is a positive objective here, as well as to meaningful out of pocket, savings at the point of sale. In correction plan, the dynamics are a little bit different, but here I think the ultimate decider will be the ultimate payers which are commercial payers like our company and other Fortune 500 companies. I think they are the market makers not the PVMs. And I think if they decide that employees would like to have rebate pass through in their plans as a matter of competition for labor that's what will happen. And Lilly's made that choice for instance already and the PVMs we use are implementing it. And as the second question was the European pricing. And I think if you look at big markets like China, Japan and Germany. And then compare that to government pricing in the U.S. a blend of Medicaid DoD, BA and part D, I think most policy makers would be surprised to find that the US government pricing is really not that different across commonly used medications from those major markets. If you change the market basket, you include share single payer models that particularly market with where they have a lot of layers of approval which have the effective beating down manufacturing pricing or use long delay periods which erode IT et cetera. It's less of fair competition but I mentioned China and Japan, Germany is the next three biggest market. But also a relatively rapid market introduction closes to regulatory approval. And I think there are important apples-to-apples comparisons. That time analysis I think you should expect the pharma group to do more off as we continue through this regulatory phase of price reform. I think it will shed a favorable light on the kind of deals that the US government gets today. Operator : And that is the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. A couple of questions. It was mentioned that you've seen lower Medicaid utilization but I am not clear on why you've seen that. So maybe you can amplify. And then secondly, the abemaciclib pancreatic Phase 2 study that was stopped, the trial was not to readout to late 2018 or early 2019. So was it stopped for futility at interim look for instance and does this failure in pancreatic decrease your interest in other new tumor types? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Thank you for the question. And Enrique, if you would like to comment on the first question on the lower than expected Medicaid utilization. And then over to you Sue on the pancreatic cancer trial. Enrique Conterno : So we make our approvals for rebates and discounts before we actually receive the claims. In the case Medicaid, it tends to lack significantly more some of those clear -- receive of those claims significantly more than in commercial plans, another plans. So we basically have our estimate and what we basically have seen is that the claim that we have received have been lower than we had expected. So that's -- now there could be a number of reasons for that but at this point in time we are basically thinking as well okay as we look into the past what does this mean for us we are looking accruals for Q1 and for the rest of the year and the reason what we have a benefit coming from Medicare when we look at entire year. Sue Mahony : Yes. Steve, now the pancreatic study was actually went to the final endpoint and we stopped the study. So I think you might be looking at cg.gov may have late timeline just as we are looking at future follow up with patients. And it does not by any mean reduce our confidence in moving forward in other indications with abemaciclib. This is pretty high bar. Pancreatic as you know is a tough gemo type and we are looking at clearly targeting tumor with the CDK pathway is important and also we do believe the combination is probably the way to go. We have a number of non breast indications that we are looking and you should see some trials starting later this year, as well as of course our lifecycle planning in breast cancer. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. I think we've gotten through 17 different types of questions. And it sounds like there are no more folks in the queue. So I'll turn it over to David Ricks to close our session. And Lia after that you can provide the replay instructions. David Ricks : Thanks, Phil. We appreciate all of your participation in today's earnings call. And your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Our strong first quarter results represent continued progress on top line and bottom line growth prospects. And we've raised our guidance as a result. We have a broad portfolio of new products with many lifecycle opportunities driving top line growth. Hopefully for years to come. And we are executing on our significant margin expansion opportunities. Together with the strong pipeline, Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. Please follow up with our Investor Relations team if your questions we have not addressed on today's call. That concludes the call. Have a great day everyone.

Welcome to the Q2 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] We do remind, today's call is being recorded. Replay information will be given out at the conclusion of the conference. Your hosting speaker, Dave Ricks. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Ricks : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q2 2018 earnings call. I\u2019m Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA; Dr. Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health, and unfortunately Christi Shaw, our President of Lilly Bio-Medicines is ill and won\u2019t be joining us today. We\u2019re also joined by Kristina Wright, Jim Heaney, Kevin Hern and Phil Johnson of the IR team. This will be the last earnings call for Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology who will retire at the end of August. Sue led Lilly Oncology through the integration of ImClone, successfully launched several key brands, including most recently Verzenio; and has now refocused our Oncology R&D strategy. I want to thank Sue for her leadership over the past 18 years at the company and for her inspiring passion for helping patients. Please join me at a round of applause for Sue. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially, due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. We continue the strong start to 2018 with the second quarter revenue growth of 9%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 28%, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 35%. New pharmaceutical products continue to be the driver of our worldwide revenue growth, led by Trulicity, Basaglar, Taltz, and Verzenio. New product growth more than offset revenue declines resulting from the loss of exclusivity on a number of our established products. We continue to expand margins this quarter. Excluding the effect of FX, on international inventories sold, non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by 130 basis points over Q2 2017, and non-GAAP operating income, as a percent of revenue increased by nearly 600 basis points to 30.6%. We made significant progress with the pipeline, including the approval and launch of Olumiant in the U.S. FDA and EMA submissions of Nasal Glucagon, as well as positive Phase 3 read-outs for galcanezumab and episodic cluster headache, Taltz and ankylosing spondylitis, also known as radiographic axSpA and tanezumab in OA pain in collaboration with Pfizer. In terms of capital deployment, we completed the acquisition of ARMO BioSciences, which added pegilodecakin to our Phase 3 portfolio. We returned nearly $600 million via the dividend. And we repurchased $950 million of stock, which completed our previous $5 million share repurchase program. And we authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program. And as reflected in the press release, we released this morning, we concluded the review of our strategic alternatives for our Elanco Animal business and intend to establish Elanco as an independent publicly traded company via an IPO and subsequent separation. Since announcing the strategic review last October, management and the board of directors carefully considered a wide range of options, including the retention, the sale or the initial public offering of the Elanco business. Based on this review, we concluded that after-tax value for Lilly\u2019s shareholders would be maximized by pursuing an IPO and subsequent separation of Elanco. We believe independence will allow Elanco to efficiently deploy its resources to those growth opportunities that best serve its customers. This will also allow Lilly even greater focus on the human pharmaceutical business to pursue our purpose of creating life changing medicines for patients. Execution of the IPO is dependent upon and subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, including business and market conditions. From a timing perspective, we anticipate a registration statement will be available to the public in the next few weeks and we are targeting an IPO of less than 20% of Elanco\u2019s shares before the end of this year. Given the quite period imposed by securities laws, on today\u2019s call we will not be able to respond to many if any questions on the potential IPO. Moving on to Slide 6, and 7, you will see more details on key events since our April earnings call, but now let me turn it over to Josh to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018. Josh Smiley : Thanks Dave. Slide 8 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures. While Slide 9 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I\u2019ll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our second quarter GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 10, you'll see the revenue increase of 9% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 76.1%. This decrease was due to the effective foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX effect, gross margin as a percent of revenue actually increased 130 basis points, primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by the timing of manufacturing production. Total operating expense decreased 1% with marketing, selling, and administrative expense decreasing 4%, offset in-part by an increase to R&D expense of 5%. Total operating expense as a percent of revenue declined 450 basis points, compared to Q2, 2017, driven by our continued efforts to reduce our cost structure and increase our margins, accelerated by the restructuring actions we took late last year. Total operating income increased 28% compared to Q2 2017, which put our operating margin at 29.1% for the quarter. And as Dave mentioned earlier, excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold, our operating income was 30.6% of revenue, an improvement of nearly 600 basis points versus last year\u2019s quarter. Other income and expense with income of $12.2 million this quarter compared to income of $60.4 million in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 17%, a decrease of 470 basis points, compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of U.S. tax reform. At the bottom line, net income increased 31%, while earnings per share increased slightly faster at 35%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from shares repurchased. We achieved a significant earnings growth by delivering high-single-digit revenue growth, while reducing our operating expenses, significantly improving profitability again this quarter. Slide 11 details these same non-GAAP measures for June year-to-date. While Slide 12 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You will find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 24 and 25. Moving to Slide 13, let\u2019s take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, the effective foreign exchange provided a 2% benefit, excluding this benefit our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 7%, driven entirely by volume. For a sixth straight quarter, our Human Pharma business delivered volume growth in each major geography. U.S. Pharma revenue increased 11%, driven almost entirely by volume. Notably our diabetes portfolio delivered over 30% U.S. volume growth again this quarter. We also benefited from higher U.S. Adcirca revenue, which totaled $96 million. Moving to Europe. Pharma revenue grew 5%, excluding FX, driven entirely by volume despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding the impact of the Cialis LOE, volume grew over 17%. This volume growth was led by Olumiant, Trulicity, Taltz, Lartruvo, and Jardiance. In Japan, pharma revenue increased 3%, excluding FX, driven entirely by volume. Volume growth was driven by new products namely Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz, Jardiance and Olumiant, with a significant contribution also coming from Cymbalta. This volume growth was partially offset by price and the impact of the biannual pricing cuts which took effect in Q1. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 8% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth of Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Lartruvo and Taltz. Turning to animal health. In total, our Elanco revenue declined 1% this quarter in performance terms. Our core-Elanco business, which is the foundation of the business going forward increased 8% in performance terms. Core-Elanco excludes strategic exits, which are listed on Slide 41. New products contributed $75 million to our Animal Health sales in Q2, driven primarily by the companion animal portfolio. This was nearly double the amount in Q2 last year. The core food animal business increased 10% in Q2, driven by U.S. purchasing patterns in 2017, as well as strong growth in poultry and aqua products, partially offset by continued ractopamine competition. The core companion animal business grew 5%, driven by uptake of Galliprant, Credelio and INTERCEPTOR PLUS, partially offset by continued Trifexis competition. We continue to take actions to focus Elanco\u2019s business in its core areas and to improve profitability. Since our last call, we completed the sale of the Sligo, Larchwood and Augusta manufacturing facilities and we exited a distribution agreement and a product that is not core to Elanco\u2019s strategy. We also made the decision to suspend marketing of Imrestor, while we pursue additional indications that could allow Imrestor to provide more value to our customers. Slide 14 outlines the same information for our June year-to-date results. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the drivers of our worldwide volume growth on Slide 15. In total, our new products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Verzenio, Olumiant, Jardiance, Lartruvo and Cyramza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 12.4 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The loss of exclusivity for Effient, Strattera, Cymbalta, Zyprexa, Evista and Axiron provided a drag of 450 basis points, while Cialis accounted for 170 basis points of volume declines due to the entry of generic erectile disfunction products. When excluding LOEs and Cialis, the rest of our products had volume growth of approximately 16%. Slide 16 provides a view of our new product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $1.7 billion in revenue this quarter, and represented 28% of our total worldwide revenue. I'd like to highlight the compliance [ph] of Taltz, which grew by 39% in the U.S. and 59% worldwide versus Q2 2017, driven almost entirely by volume. This growth was due to the continued uptake in psoriasis and to a lesser extent the launch of our second indication for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis, both here in the U.S. and in Europe. We\u2019re also pleased to announce this quarter that Taltz had positive Phase 3 results for our second study in axSpA, which Dave mentioned earlier and was granted a label update in both the U.S. and Europe to include data and difficult to treat genital psoriasis. Later this year, we plan to initiate a head-to-head trial with Tremfya, which will be power to test superiority on key measures in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This investment underscores our confidence in Taltz, as well as Lilly\u2019s long-term commitment immunology. Moving to Slide 17, continuing with our non-GAAP explanations, this quarter the effective FX on our income statement was minimal with a small positive impact on revenue and a small negative impact on earnings. Turning to our 2018 financial guidance on Slide 18, you will see that we\u2019ve updated our guidance to reflect an increase of $300 million on the top line, driven by strong performance across our portfolio, particularly in diabetes and the continued uptake of our new launch brands, as well as higher collaborations revenue, partially offset by the impact of weaker foreign currencies. An increase in gross margin percent of 50 basis points on a reported basis, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by an inventory charge related to the suspension of Imrestor sales. A percentage point increase in the non-GAAP gross margin percent, primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange movement, and finally an increase in our tax rate on a reported basis from 17% to 22.5%, which is driven by a non-deductible IP R&D charge for the acquisition of ARMO BioSciences. On a reported basis, earnings per share for 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $3.19 to $3.29, while our non-GAAP earnings per share is now expect to be between $5.40 and $5.50. At the mid-point of the range, this represents an increase of 27% over 2017. Our updated guidance implies second half non-GAAP EPS of between $2.57 and $2.67, which exceeds our consensus, and does not assume U.S. price increases for the remainder of the year. However, it\u2019s lower than our first half EPS, due to the expected U.S. generic competition for Cialis in September, higher second half R&D expenses to support additional late stage investments, including mirikizumab, Olumiant and Taltz NILEX, and the IL-10 from the ARMO acquisition, launch investments for galcanezumab and to a lesser extent, the higher U.S. Adcirca collaboration revenue that we realized in the first half.  In total, we expect strong second half performance led by volume gains in our new products, which allows for targeted investments in our long-term portfolio and which positions us well to achieve our 2020 financial objectives. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave to review the pipe line and key future events. Dave Ricks : Thanks Josh. Slide 19 shows select NME\u2019s and NILEX as of July 17. In my summary of the quarter at the beginning of the call, I mentioned the positive movements for Nasal Glucagon and the Phase 3 addition of pegylated IL-10 from our acquisition of ARMO BioSciences. The ARMO acquisition also includes Phase II studies for pegilodecakin, which are now reflected in the pipeline. Additional movements at our earnings call include the start of Phase 3 studies from mirikizumab our IL-23 antibody in both psoriasis and all ulcerative colitis. The start of Phase 2 for our Tau antibody for Alzheimer's; the addition of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor into Phase 1 with the completion of the Orca acquisition. Attrition of lanabecestat, the BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's diseases we were studying in collaboration with AstraZeneca and the attrition of one Phase 1 diabetes asset.  On Slide 20, we provide an update on expected key events for 2018. In addition to the pipeline movement I\u2019ve already noted, you will see that we have added a new line to reflect our expectations that the U.S. Alimta label could be updated before the end of the year for the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 data. Under regulatory submissions, you\u2019ll see the submission of Nasal Glucagon and the new indication for Cyramza, second line liver cancer, as well as Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's revised expectation that the U.S. submission for the combination of empagliflozin, linagliptin and metformin XR will occur in 2019. In the Phase 3 data presentations at publication section, we reflected presentation at ASCO of the REACH-2 study of Cyramza, as well as the presentation at the American Headache Society of the Phase 3 cluster headache trials for galcanezumab. And in the Phase 3 topline data disclosure section you\u2019ll see the announcement of positive Phase 3 data for tanezumab in OA pain and the attrition of lanabecestat. In terms of Phase 3 study initiations, you\u2019ll see the Phase 3 starts for mirikizumab that I noted earlier, and now expect to start Phase 3 before the end of the year for baricitinib in lupus and in adaptive Phase II/III for alopecia. We've also added a line for initiation of Phase 3 for our novel GIP/GLP agonist in type 2 diabetes. We now have data inhouse from the Phase 2 study of this next-generation incretin. In the past, we\u2019ve said that we have a high bar for efficacy to move this molecule into Phase 3, given the competitive intensity in this category. The Phase 2 results met this high bar. We look forward to presenting this data at EASD this fall. And following the data presentation, we will host a call to discuss the data. In addition, we plan to start Phase 3 in late 2018 or early 2019. Finally, we had positive Alimta rulings in both the U.S. and Japan, while the German Federal Patent Court held our Alimta vitamin regimen patent invalid. We strongly disagree with this ruling and we plan to appeal the decision. This was clearly a busy and productive quarter for the company, and there are still many events to look forward to in 2018. Notably, I\u2019d highlight the expected regulatory actions for galcanezumab in the U.S., Verzenio in Europe and Japan, as well as the data readout of the REWIND study for Trulicity. Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up the progress we\u2019ve made this quarter. In Q2, new products accounted for nearly 28% of our total revenue, and over 31% of our Human Pharma revenue. Volume grew 9% in our Human Pharma business. Despite recent patent explorations and when excluding strategic exits and FX, our animal health business grew by 8%. We realized significant efficiencies in our cost structure leading to operating margin expansion of nearly 600 basis points, excluding FX. We\u2019ve made excellent progress this quarter in the pipeline with the launch of Olumiant for RA patients in the U.S., the submission of Nasal Glucagon to the FDA and EMA and position Phase 3 data for tanezumab, as well as new indication data for Taltz and galcanezumab. We also returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program and made a significant strategic decision on the future of our Elanco Animal Health Business. Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to share that we will hold a live investor meeting this December to provide our initial 2019 guidance and highlight pipeline progress, including life cycle opportunities for select marketed products. Given the limited space available, our investor relations team will be in contact on the coming days to issues invitations and provide more logistical details. This concludes our prepared remarks and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. [Operator Instructions] Kevin, if you can please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we are ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of John Boris, SunTrust. Please go ahead. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the operating results in the quarter. Dave, first question just has to do with the blueprint, obviously proposed by HHS secretary and the White House administration, what do you view as the base case scenario potentially coming out for the industry and or best case scenario that could come out of that blueprint? And then just any thoughts on this issue that\u2019s rising on copay accumulators that are certainly blunting manufacturers ability use copay assistance against co-pay accumulators, it seems to be very detrimental to patients getting access to medicine, so, any thoughts that you have around that? Second question just has to do with the emerging pain, franchise, just to your optimism over that franchise, especially galcanezumab, which seem to have hit some pretty decent data in cluster headache, which is an area where nothing seems to have worked in that area, so just your thoughts on that and Lasmiditan, the timing profiling of Lasmiditan here in the back half? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Hi, John, thank for the questions. Dave if you want to go ahead and comment, and then Dan if you want anything on the pain franchise that would be great. Dave? Dave Ricks : Okay, great. Thank John and thanks for the questions. Just on the policy side, of course blueprint was rolled out in May. And recently, and all actors in the industry seemed to have responded to the requested information. So, you asked me to guess where this will land, that is a really difficult thing to do at this point. Because there is dozens of ideas in there. I think we can comment on actions that have been initiated though because I think that indicates where the administration might be going first and of course many of you may have noted, last week the administration sent to OMB a proposed rule change for the Anti-Kickback safe harbor, which relates to rebates. We don\u2019t know the substance of that rule change, but this is heavily commented on through the archive via questions and I think you\u2019ve right to assume that there will be some changes to the Anti-Kickback Statute as it relates to rebate treatment. We don\u2019t know what those are and I think we\u2019re preparing for all scenarios there, but this is consistent with the broad theme of looking at ways to reduce the growth in that spread in the industry and to allow patients to have more \u2013 a price point in high deductible or without insurance that is closer to net pricing.  Overall, we support that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing for innovators and we\u2019ll have to watch how that rule develops. We don\u2019t have any specifics as of today. You also saw the administration move on putting a task force together related to addressing off-patents, brands, who take super inflationary price increases. In the absence of IP this is really a regulator failure from our perspective, the administration is talking about importation. We think that\u2019s the wrong road to go down, but rather to fix the regulatory system to begin with. Nonetheless, clearly, that is a hot-button issue, and we agree it should be solved. The method we disagree with, but we will have more to say about that in the future. I think for innovators over the \u2013 I think I said in the Q4 call in January, we could expect a busy year in regulatory reform and I think in fact that\u2019s what we are seeing. For innovators at the end of the day, as long as we can embrace a pro-innovation market driven set of changes that embrace this choice, I think we\u2019re going to be fine. Getting from A to B, we\u2019ll have to see how these changes unfold; and as of today, it\u2019s difficult to say more than I did already, but of course we watch it very carefully at various investor updates. We\u2019ll be happy to provide additional commentary as additional actions come forward. On the copay accumulators, this is going in the opposite direction of everything I just said. This is shifting cost, back to consumers by standing the time they spend in high deductible phase. We don\u2019t think by itself it\u2019s a good policy, now coupled with many other things, it could block the impact of that, but frankly I think this although I would say, for Lilly, it's had very limited impact on our performance. It is a concerning thing to watch as we watch the back and forth in commercial markets. Of course, payers and, ultimately employers, are doing this so they want to control drug spending cost, we understand that there may be other ways to do that though. Finally, on pain, you know we\u2019re excited about the pain portfolio, you\u2019re seeing data emerge now from tanezumab, we have the data as you mentioned on galcanezumab\u2019s of all the Phase 3 in-house. And lasmiditan, we do plan to submit before the end of the year as well. Clearly pain is a huge unmet need in this country. I think you\u2019re seeing good interest in the first CGRP antibody launch that we expect that to continue migraines in enormous problem in this country and there are many chronic and episodic sufferers there that we hope to reach with CGRP antibodies, as well as products like lasmiditan, which can relieve acute suffering. So, we\u2019re bullish on that category. Of course, we need all the data and the caution on tanezumab remains the safety study. There is a large safety study that will read-out in 2019 and that\u2019s really the pivotal question to answer on this program. We know the drug, yes, can reduce pain based on prior Phase 3 studies. Phil Johnson : Dan do you have any additional comments to make or\u2026? Dan Skovronsky : Yes, I will just reiterate that we\u2019re pleased with the data we\u2019re seeing with good galcanezumab of course and I think probably I\u2019ll highlight three opportunities here for Lilly, specifically in the migraine space. First, we\u2019re really quite pleased with the quality of our data galcanezumab works fast and has a prolonged maintenance of efficacy in our clinical trials. I think we\u2019ll be, right now, as far as we\u2019ve seen the only CGRP antibody that has 100% clearance data. So, 100% reduction in migraines. That\u2019s statistically significant in our clinical trials. The second opportunity here is with Lasmiditan, as you heard from Dave having both of these products we think could be important for patients and then of course the third is what you mentioned, which is cluster headache, which is another important indication and we\u2019re pleased with the data that we have there. So, differentiated opportunity for Lilly. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Dan. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : And next question is from the line of Chris Schott, JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here, maybe first on tanezumab, can you put this initial Phase 3 data we say into context as you think about your enthusiasm for the program and specifically on safety is there a threshold on rapidly progressing osteoarthritis that the FDA is focused on here, how should we think about that safety profile going forward? My second question was on price increases, it seems like the tone across the industry is a bit more restrained than the past on willingness to take increases, is this a 2018 dynamic or do you see this trend continuing out into 2019 and beyond? And I guess given a disconnect we\u2019re seeing between gross and net pricing, if there is a slow down in list price increases going forward, should we think about that impacting net price increases or is that less corelated than it has been in the past? Thanks so much. Phil Johnson : Great. Chris thank you for the questions. Dan if you want to comment on tanezumab and then Dave feel free to complement that answer and then we would take the price increase question. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : On tanezumab, of course we previously said, we have a lot of confidence in this mechanism of action based on the wealth of data that\u2019s been generated in the past, and of course the challenge here is to discharge the safety risk. Having said that, we also changed some aspects of how we minister the drug in the new Phase 3 program on which we\u2019re collaborating with Pfizer. So, this first study was primarily focused on that aspect and so this is a titration study where we\u2019re investing a subcutaneous of 2.5 and 2.5 going up to 5 milligram doses. And we're pleased that we hit our efficacy outcomes here. With respect to RPOA rapidly progressive osteoarthritis your question on thresholds, of course we and others here have thresholds in our clinical trials that we\u2019re watching for, we haven\u2019t spoken specifically around what those might be and our trials continue to proceed. So, we\u2019re excited about that. This study wasn\u2019t designed to discharge the safety risk that study will come with data probably next year or late this year and that\u2019s a next year 3000 patient 56-week clinical trial. Phil Johnson : [Indiscernible] Dave? Dave Ricks : Yes, I would do that. I think, as I said before the key gating thing is this large safety discharge study we now, I guess more than a dozen Phase 3 trial on tanezumab on efficacy, really the question is, is it safe for long-term use. You know, on price increases it\u2019s difficult to comment on others actions or even what happens long term. We\u2019ve as this blueprint has been rolled out, I think our point of view is, is this a potentially sweeping set of changes let\u2019s see what develops here in 2018 as those changes get implemented or not and then on the backend of this important public conversation about how do we reduce out of pocket cost for patients, while preserving innovation and allowing market forces to prevail, how can we reshape the system on those principles. On the backend of that, of course we\u2019ll reevaluate our strategies. You know net pricing of subject not just to list price changes. And as you know Chris the yield of those is quite different across different categories, but also subject to prior period adjustments on assumptions made in gross to net on current channel mix in many, many other things. So, you will see I think in U.S. we will reflect being a 1% positive, which reflects prior increases, as well as all those other dimensions. As Josh said, we don\u2019t have list price changes in our outlook and it\u2019s still very robust and that\u2019s kind of where we are focused is driving volume of new products here in the U.S. and abroad. Phil Johnson : Thanks Dave. Kevin if we can go to next caller please. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Greg Gilbert : Thanks. First for Dave. I was hoping you could share with us not a question about the IPO here, but how are the Elanco transaction or transactions in the coming quarters shape your thinking about capital allocation priorities for Lilly? And then shifting gears to diabetes, you touched on this a bit, but given the strong profile for the current injectable GLP-1\u2019s and the emerging oral GLP-1 can you put a little more meat on the bones in terms of that bar you talked about, is that the primary endpoint or the multitude of endpoints that shaped your thinking there and perhaps you can fill in any updates on your own oral GLP-1 work? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great Greg. Thank you for the questions. So, Dave, if you comment on Lilly capital allocation moving forward. And then Dan and Enrique, if you'd like to take the question on what we saw with our GIP/GLP in Phase II. Dave? Dave Ricks : Thanks Greg. Well as I said, you know this move is really the result of a deep and thorough analysis at the value maximizing decision for Lilly\u2019s shareholders. We think an IPO produces the after-tax value and also that it will allow more focus, focus for Elanco on its priorities, allocating its capital to the produce to grow that business, and serve its customers and focus for Lilly, which for us assuming this all goes forward as planned will be a human pharmaceutical business with, I think many opportunities to invest in creating breakthrough products for patients. Our strategy on capital allocation doesn't change as a result of this decision, which is really first to invest on our business on our organic ID and the launches in capital needed to manufacture those products et cetera. Secondly, to look at business development, to build our pipeline as the commentary there isn't different than before, which is really we\u2019re mostly interested in clinical stage assets that can build at our core five therapeutic areas. I think you saw a number of moves in Q2 in that regard, most notably the ARMO acquisition as an example of the kind of thing we\u2019re interested. And then finally, if we run out of those ideas, we will return capital to shareholders and this quarter we\u2019re announcing a share repurchase program, which will allow us to continue to do that. As we said, there was 900 million or so in share repurchase activity in Q2 consistent with those priorities. So, I think we have taken a balanced approach on capital allocation. You can expect that to continue and we have more capital to balance. We\u2019ll do just that. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Dave. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes, sure. We previously said that we see incretin biology as an important platform for Lilly to continue to build on that there is a lot more opportunities here for patients, and so over the years we\u2019ve invested here and developed and tested now a number of different molecules that could offer differentiated efficacy in this platform. So, for example, the oxyntomodulin molecules, we're now testing a second one of these in clinical trials, the GLP and other molecules that are in earlier development. In each of these cases, we\u2019re really looking for what we consider to be breakthrough efficacy. In the case of GLP here we were encouraged that dual agonism of both of these receptors which we think is very important in our preclinical studies showed highly differentiated weight loss and glucose controls. So, we're encouraged by that. We took it into Phase 1 clinical trials. We commented that we\u2019re encouraged by what we saw there and therefore moved it into Phase 2 clinical trials. And I\u2019ll hand it to Enrique for the future of this module. Enrique Conterno : Yeah, no. I think you\u2019ve framed it well, but we do have a high bar for any type of next-generation incretin. And this product clearly met that bar, but we won't be able to comment on the specifics of the efficacy just to say that we do plan to have a full presentation at EASD and then an Investor Call following that. Greg Gilbert : That would be early October. Enrique Conterno : That\u2019s correct. Phil Johnson : Thank you. Kevin you can go to the next caller please. Operator : And that will be Andrew Baum, Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Couple of topics. Just to zoom in on the first question around the blueprint particularly the proposal on rebates. Our understanding is this totally relates to federal forms of the plan. I just want to make sure that\u2019s consistent with your understanding? Second, assuming that is the case, how do you envisage the world working if PBMs could meaningfully amend their structure of that rebates or remove rebates altogether for federal plan. Is it conceivable that the commercial side of the business will remain as is? Or would you anticipate that may change? And finally, timing, we assume that nothing is going to assume happen just given the plan is that until 2020 if the earliest again is that system. And then the second topic, just one question on tanezumab. What are you anticipating in terms of enabling requirement, radiographic scans given in the real-world patients maybe premedicating with NSAIDs, which may increase some of the stakes that you saw in the earlier trials? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Okay. So, we\u2019ve had a series of questions essentially on the blueprint, specifically on the rebate program, and is that only applying in our understanding of the federally programs? What will be the impact of PBMs during the commercial business of that same kind of change we you go into effect, earliest timing that we are thinking is 2020 appropriate? And we also had the question on tanezumab in terms of labeling required for radiographic scan. So, Dave if you want to take the first question. I'm not sure as much we can say, but whatever we can see on the blueprint speculation and then Dan if you want to comment on tanezumab? Dave Ricks : I was just going to reiterate. Andrew it is difficult to speculate on a proposed real change when all we have is the title of the rule. I think if you read it like we can, which basically says the change to the rebate rules and the Anti-Kickback Statute and replacing it with a new set of safe harbors. Mike Harrington's with us, who is our General Counsel, I think it came about with and I think that statue, the first two, but I believe it is just federal programs, Mike you want to comment on that? Mike Harrington : Well I think we\u2019ll have to see. The Anti-Kickback Statute addresses payments made to induce prescribing. So, we will have to monitor it closely, but it is potentially, yes that it could expand more broadly beyond just the federal programs. Phil Johnson : Thank you. And then tanezumab and the radiographic labeling? Dan Skovronsky : Yes sure. So, certainly premature to speculate on the labeling on tanezumab, given that we don\u2019t have the primary safety data yet, but as you know we made some changes to the Phase 3 program to try and decrease the risk of RPOA. I think most significant among those is lowering the dose of tanezumab. And so that\u2019s again why this titration study was the first step in demonstrating that. We still have the efficacy that we need. Another change was reducing or eliminating the concomitant use of NSAIDs in OA patients, as well as changing our screening methods as you mentioned. Let's see what the data show and based on that we\u2019ll be able to talk more about where we\u2019re headed in labelling. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Dan. Kevin, next caller please. Operator : And next we have David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. I have a few questions. First, with respect to the strategic exits that you mentioned for Elanco, obviously you can't talk about the IPO, but I just wanted to better understand when those strategic exits were completed that had a negative impact on revenue in the second quarter and thus when they will annualize? So that\u2019s the first question. Second and, with respect to Jardiance and Trajenta, both of those products were flattish sequentially, so they were outliers, obviously the rest of the portfolio was extremely strong, could you help us better understand why they were flattish sequentially, despite the prescription growth that we saw? And then my final question is with respect to your Alzheimer's candidates, you have two candidates in Phase 2 with readouts in coming years, can you just provide a framework for those two Phase 2 programs, including the timing? Thanks very much. Phil Johnson : Great Dave, thank you for the questions. So maybe Josh if you want to take the first questions on when we've completed some of the strategic exits and sort of what the time course is for those eventually to annualize and then Enrique on the sequential growth patterns for Jardiance and Trajenta, and then over to Dan for the question for our Alzheimer's programs in Phase 2. Josh? Josh Smiley : Thanks David. The most significant and the strategic exits would be our Posilac business in the Augusta manufacturing plant in Georgia, but we really just completed that exit over the course of this month. So, as you know Posilac has been declining over the course of 2017 and 2018, so I think you\u2019ll start to see this annualize in total revenue beginning in the second half of this year just as we start to walk through some of the significant headwinds we saw last year. I think it will be totally opposite numbers by the time we get into sort of late 2019, but the majority of the effect that we see for Posilac that\u2019s gone down every quarter because the product before the strategic exit the product was declining pretty significantly.  We also announced that we were on a smaller basis exiting a few contracts, including a manufacturing contract that we had around BI when we acquired the vaccine portfolio, low margin opportunity, but on the topline that will start to come out of the numbers in the second half of this year as well. Remember when we gave guidance for Elanco, at the beginning of the year we said, you would see a pickup in growth in the second half of the year as some of these big items began to normalize in the numbers. I think that\u2019s why we are focused on core Elanco business, which really looks at that portfolio, which is not, we\u2019re not exiting from, and is the basis of our growth going forward. Phil Johnson : Thanks Josh. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Very good. So, let\u2019s start with the easier one. Trajenta net sales in the U.S. reflects the trends that we see when it comes to total prescriptions basically it\u2019s a steady number of prescriptions quarter-on-quarter and that\u2019s basically what we see when it comes to net sales. When it comes to Jardiance just maybe to provide a bit more color, we show in the case of Jardiance a 58% TRX growth versus the previous year quarter-on-quarter. On a sequential basis that growth is 13%, so very solid growth when it comes to Jardiance, but the net sales, there is a disconnect there because the net sales for the quarter versus the previous year only increased 28%.  We did have an adjustment due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts normalizing for the growth versus the previous year would have been 46%. Now, when we look on a sequential basis in the case of Jardiance, some of those changes and estimates for rebates and discounts really belonged in Q1, so you basically have a double whammy effect when you look at the sequential quarter-on-quarter comparison. Phil Johnson : Thank you, Enrique. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes, thanks for the question on the question on the neurodegeneration portfolio. We actually have 3 neurodegeneration-targeted molecules in Phase 2 trials starting with D1 PAM. This is designed to be a symptomatic molecule for patients suffering with dementia. Initially, we\u2019re testing it in Parkinson's diseases dementia. We have reason to believe that there is a higher probability of success in that population, but if we get a positive signal there we would very quickly move that also in parallel to Alzheimer's disease. So, that\u2019s the first.  The other two that you mentioned, the next one behind it is N3PG that\u2019s an anti-plaque A-beta antibody. Based on what we saw in some pretty standard Phase 1 trials. This molecule can clear plaques really to a very dramatic depth. So, a great degree of clearance and also with a great amount of speed. So, faster clearance I think that we\u2019re seeing with other mechanisms. So, we\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019re testing that as monotherapy.  We\u2019re also testing it in conjunction in combination therapy. I believe it\u2019s the first combo trial of two disease modifying drugs and Alzheimer's disease with a base inhibitor, with a thought here that although base monotherapy has been disappointing if you turn off A-beta production, also clear out the plaque that could have added benefits. So, that trial is enrolling and then we also have the Tau monoclonal antibody. This is specific for aggregated forms of Tau and we think this is an important therapeutic morality and Alzheimer's.  Both of those Phase 2 or really all three of the Phase 2 trial are designed to give us efficacy signals both on biomarkers and on cognitive endpoints. I think on clinical trials.gov, we show the disease modifying trials ending in 2020, it\u2019s an 18-month treatment period, but depending on enrolment rates and depending on potential for interim analysis this is also potential to have data read-outs earlier, even next year. You will have to wait and see how those trials go. Phil Johnson : Great, thank you, Dan. Kevin if we can go to the next caller. Operator : And the next question is from the line of, one moment please, it\u2019s going to be Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jami Rubin : Thank you. David just want to go back to some of the questions around rebate structures and I recognize that it\u2019s early and it\u2019s hard to predict how this is going to play out, but just when you look at your own numbers and think about different scenarios, looking at filing Lilly's gross to net of 48% is the widest in the industry, largely because of your diabetes franchise. Is there a change to those rebates, what would you expect to happen to volumes, you just said that volumes that rebates are used to induce volumes, so would you expect volumes to go down for that business? Conversely, if rebates go away, Lilly has about 10 billion in rebates, how can this not be a net positive even if you take into consideration lower volumes and potentially lower risk price, how are you thinking about the different scenarios that can play out here? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great Jami, thank you for the questions. Dave? Dave Ricks : Thanks Jami. I mean the huge opening caveat here is, we don\u2019t know right. We don\u2019t know what this rule. We don\u2019t know where the system will go. We paused on the list price changes in the U.S. waiting to seeing what is happening here. So, just to get the numbers right, we reported last year of 51% gross to net spreads, you were right in that diabetes segment in particular drug that primarily because you have a very large Medicaid population and you have a very large gross to net spreads and Medicaid approaching the federal capital to 100%. So, we have been pretty open about all that. It depends on how this rule would be enacted, whether it would change the Medicaid system, whether it would treat that commercial et cetera, to really guess at what would be on the other side of it. As I said in my first response though, you know we make innovative products, hopefully products people want and need, I think the current system has resulted in basically a structure of the industry where the hospital systems, insurance carriers, distributors, and manufacturers seem to be fine with the current system, the problem is we're shifting too much costs via list pricing directly to consumers. I have to believe that if consumer pricing came down, it would improve volume, improve medication adherence, improve outcomes for patients. So, we think, that\u2019s why in general we think this direction travels a good way. Now, we have to see all the specifics just clearly there is a lot of room for disruption in a negative way here and it'd be very difficult for Lilly to predict what would happen to their gross to net line you're talking about or, more specifically, without seeing the totality of the regulatory reforms. Jami Rubin : Is that a scenario there where this is a net positive for the industry, even if volumes do go down, but your rebates go away as well? Dave Ricks : I think it is a lot of scenarios Jami, it is hard to speculate. Jami Rubin : Okay, thank you. Dave Ricks : Yes, great. Phil Johnson : Thanks Jami. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : And next we have Geoff Meacham, Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hi guys, thanks for the question. On Olumiant, I would just want to ask you guys a little bit more detail about the strategy going forward for the 4 mg dose in RA. What are the options you are looking at and maybe just put this in the context of the priorities compared to your label expanding studies in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, et cetera? And then, Dave or Josh, with the Elanco spin-out, you've \u2013 pipeline progress and obviously a few smaller scale deals already done it on oncology, maybe just help us with, you know, is it fair to say BD is now a lower priority, is there a category that you feel like you still need to add assets like for example in oncology to be more competitive? Thank you? Phil Johnson : Great, Geoff thank you for the questions. So, Dan maybe if you can comment on strategies going forward for the 4 mg in RA and how that may compare with other NILEX opportunities that we're evaluating and then Dave obviously the comment on the business development priorities that we have moving forward. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes, thanks. We are excited about the potential of baricitinib for patients that potentials being realized, of course, to a greater extent outside the U.S. in places where both doses are approved. At the advisory committee, I think we were clear in our position about the benefits that each doze could have for patients and we are clear that after the outcome in our disappointment, I think in terms of next step for, next steps for the 4 mg dose we are still considering what different possibilities might be internal at this time.  I think that in terms of the prioritization here there is great opportunities for baricitinib in RA, but also in some of the other indications, so the lupus data, which was recently published in Lancet, I think, represents a really great opportunity for patients and an opportunity here for us to be first in class here in lupus. We\u2019re also excited about atopic derm where we now have a Phase 3 trial ongoing. So, lots of opportunities for patients with bari remaining. Dave Ricks : Yes, I would just add, you know we\u2019ve launched just now sort of promoting in July and in the U.S. with the 2 mg anecdotal feedbacks very positive and we know from the German launch French launches, which are ongoing, that patients have rapid pain relief. This is a different modality than are used to in disease modifiers for RA and we\u2019re far from disappointed with the performance of the molecule at a global basis. More to do in the U.S., we\u2019ll update investors and probably in more detail at the Q3 call on that performance in the life cycle as Dan pointed as potentially quite broad. On the second question of BD priorities, I hate to say this, Geoff, but I think you have it exactly wrong. I wouldn't attribute it all that would satisfy with BD. We are in a position now with, we are growing \u2013 the top line, we\u2019re growing income, we\u2019re growing cash flows, we are very interested in acquiring assets that all of our therapeutic areas of interest. We are not plugging a whole here, it is really about building value for the long-term and because we are optimistic about the short and mid-term in terms of growth prospects, we are in a position to do just that. So, I would expect to see a continuous flow of pipeline ads from \u2013 hopefully from our own labs, but if not from outside labs as well. And we have more than enough resources to execute that strategy. Phil Johnson : Great, thanks Dave. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jason Gerberry, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Gerberry : Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just first question on Humalog. You've now gotten first half of the year the benefit in terms of the changes and estimates. But just on the, I guess, rebates, but can you talk about second half where you are in terms of comps and then kind of moving forward into 2019, how comfortable are you at this stage that the biosimilar competitor won\u2019t really represent a meaningful source of competitive pressure to the business? And then my second question, just on galcanezumab. The feedback from the Amgen launch in the CGRP space seems to be pretty favorable. I'd just be curious to get your evolving thoughts on, do you think payers are going to cover multiple CGRP agents on par or parity or do you think that they will opt for exclusive contracts out of the gate? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Jason, thank you for the questions. Enrique we\u2019ll go to you for Humalog, I am not sure Dave, if you may want to handle or will it\u2026? Dave Ricks : I\u2019d start [indiscernible]. Phil Johnson : Absolutely. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Sure. So, Humalog had an excellent quarter. We did have a benefit in Q2 due to changes in the estimates for rebates and discounts. That benefit was \u2013 relative to the previous year was about 9 points, so an important benefit. Now, as we \u2013 it is difficult for us to be able to project forward, but we are seeing a bit of a benefit also when it comes to mix. So, when we look at the different segments, which is a positive for Humalog for the insulin franchise. Now, as it relates to Admelog, it's very difficult to \u2013 for us to forecast and predict how the competitor would basically play in the market. Clearly at this point-in-time we will basically see them as gaining share in particular in the area of managed Medicaid, but it is difficult for us to predict what type of access and uptake we will be able to have in 2019. Dan Skovronsky : Great. As it relates to the assets in the migraine category, you know it is pretty early days here. I understand mostly payers haven\u2019t listed the new therapy. We\u2019re of course for the guidance in FDA and early conversations with payers about our data and seeking that kind of feedback from them, I could tell you what our strategy is, which is reading broad access to these medications as appropriate and particularly given the population. So, these are mostly commercially insured, working women who are having anywhere between 4 and 20 headaches a month that is our study population, which causes absenteeism, debilitation, lack of ability to predict and schedule and plan, not to mention just the human suffering cost. So, we think employers will be very interested in covering this class. We need to get that message through. It could be a great category for some value and outcomes-based pricing approaches, and we're optimistic long term that the class will have good coverage. Enrique, do you have anything from your conversation with payers to add? Enrique Conterno : No, I think we are very excited about the opportunity that this new product would represent for us and we are working actively to try to ensure broad access. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you. Kevin, next caller please. Operator : Next, we have Steve Scala, Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you, several questions. First, on Taltz. In Q1, inventory was down 33%, how much of the stellar second quarter performance was restocking the trade versus underlying demand? Second, a filing of galcanezumab in episodic cluster headache is not in the events table, so why is it 2018 filings not likely, is this a result of the miss in the chronic cluster headache setting and then lastly, do you have any early reading on 2019 formulary discussions? Are they resulting in similar positions as 2018 or is there a step change in anyway? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Okay, Steve. I\u2019m not sure with Christi being ill [ph] if we have a strong answer for you on the Q1, but we'll give at least a short answer for you. We can follow up later if needed, on the Taltz question for Q1. And then maybe Enrique if you would like to also comment on the 2019 formulary question and I\u2019ll be happy to go ahead and provide a comment on the galcanezumab filing for cluster. Enrique Conterno : I think the short answer is that Taltz performance when we look at Q2 is really demand driven. We have seen improvements on across our prescription trends in both derm and rheumatology. So, we are very encouraged with the Taltz performance. We typically do not comment on specific formulary focus for 2019. Phil Johnson : And Steve on your question for galcanezumab and cluster, very pleased with the results that we saw in the Phase 3 studies and certainly will discuss those with regulators but are not making any kind of a comment this point in time on potential filing or timing for such filing. Kevin, if we can go to the next caller please. Operator : And that will be Umer Raffat at Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I had three if I may, Dave, first, someone brought it up early as well and I wanted to make it a bit more specific on a product level as it relates to rebates and I guess my question was, when I look at mealtime influence, Lilly and Novo basically split the market, and Sanofi has minimal share. So, do you foresee any scenario on rebates where Sanofi becomes a more meaningful player in mealtime insulins? So that\u2019s first. And second and third are maybe more on R&D, first on IL-10, my question is in your ongoing Phase 2 trials of PD1 plus IL-10, they are both open label and long. And any observation from that trial to date? And then also on R&D on tanezumab, have you - do we know what the rate of conversion was from Type 1 to Type 2 RPOAs in your prior trials? Thank you very much. Phil Johnson : Raffat, thank you for the question. Enrique, maybe if you'd like to comment on the first question about any possibilities we see for Sanofi to become a meaningful player in mealtime insulins? Maybe Sue or Dan, if you'd like to comment on data from the IL-10. And then, Umer, I'm sorry, I actually can't read my own chicken scratch for what you asked on tanezumab. Oh, it's conversion from RPOA 1 to RPOA 2. And maybe, Dan or Dave, if you want to comment. So, Enrique, I'll start with you. Enrique Conterno : Yes. The premise of the question was under a - some sort of a different structure when it comes to rebates and so forth. It's - and I think Dave already mentioned this, but it's very difficult to speculate what the changes would be and what the competitive dynamic would be as a result of that change. Clearly, we do track Sanofi's products in the mealtime insulin space. But so far, I think, the uptake is very minimal. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Sue, you want to start on the IL-10 question? Sue Mahony : Yes, sure. We have two Phase 2 studies with IL-10, as you mentioned, one in the front line and the - one in the second line. Those - both those dose are currently enrolling. The endpoint is response rate data, and we\u2019re anticipating seeing that next year. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Sue. Dan, do you want to add anything, or are you\u2026 Dan Skovronsky : It\u2019s fine. Phil Johnson : Okay. And then on the tanezumab question? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. So, I understand your question about rates of conversion into RPOA 2 from RPOA 1 in previous trials. I know there's a lot of interest in comparing what will be seeing in this current trial and future trials with tanezumab with the past experiences. But there's some really important differences, I think, that should lead us to avoid those kinds of comparisons, primarily around the way that we screened and for events and adjudicated events, which is quite different in this trial. And understandably since we knew what we're looking for, much more thorough. So, we don't have relevant data from the past to compare to. With regards to this current trial, we're not disclosing any more details at this point in time. But that should happen in a future meeting. Phil Johnson : Right. Thank you, Dan. Kevin, next caller, please. Operator : Next is from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So maybe just two on the oncology side. One, on Verzenio, the performance is pretty good this quarter. Just if you can give a little more color on which patients are getting Verzenio relative to IBRANCE or to Kisqali? And then second one, on Alimta, you mentioned you're open to have label update to include the keynote 189 data later this year. Just if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of adoption of that regimen in practice to date, which Alimta uses now in combination with Keytruda in the frontline setting? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Vamil, thank you for the question. So, Sue, for you on both Verzenio and Alimta updates. Sue Mahony : Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we're really pleased with the update on Verzenio today. The sales this quarter was $57.7 million, so that's a $20 million increase versus last quarter. What we\u2019re seeing is, as you know, we're the third-to-market CDK, but we are second now in terms of both NRx, so new to brand and also in TRx. In this quarter, our NBRx share was 18.7%, and we continue to see that increase. So, we are pleased with the uptake. What we're seeing is when physicians are using the brand, they like it. So, our focus is in ensuring that we continue to get trial of Verzenio. And so far, we have about 1,500 physicians who have trialed Verzenio. The patients that they're using in is across the spectrum in the frontline and mainly in fulvestrant. And we do have some single-agent activity. But really, we\u2019re starting to see much more now uptake in the frontline. So, with aromatase inhibitors as well as with the second line in fulvestrant. And the things that are resonating is the continuous dozing. The single-agent activity is clearly a differentiator. People are also interested, and I think the data is resonating in the fact that we see positive data in patients who\u2019ve got concerning clinical characteristics. So, we feel pretty good so far about the uptake in Verzenio. We see opportunity to continue to grow that brand. The market is growing about 22%, and we - and only about 50% of patients are still getting a CDK4/6 inhibitor. With regards to Alimta, we've got the data uptake now in - for the KEYNOTE-021G data is now in the label. We have also submitted to the FDA to include the KEYNOTE-189 data. What we\u2019re seeing is, as you heard, we are growing Alimta in the U.S. We have a 2% growth based on volume, 1% price, so 3% overall. And although the data was only presented at ASCO fairly recently, since that time, we are seeing an increase in new patient prescriptions. So, sort of as a reminder, about 50% of Alimta use is in the sort of in promoted areas. We do have Alimta - some of the use for the KEYNOTE-189 regime is sort of in addition to Alimta use that we've now. But we're clearly also seeing an increase in the typical use and we continue to believe that we'll see that going forward. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Sue. Kevin, next caller, please. Operator : Next is from the line of Louise Chen, Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, first question I had was, what gives you confidence that you will hit stat sig versus just non-inferiority in the REWIND trial for Trulicity? And even if it's not stat sig, can Trulicity still continue with robust growth trajectory that you see currently? And second question was just back on tanezumab. How do you think the FDA will balance the side effect profile of your drug versus the need for alternatives to opioids? Thanks. Phil Johnson : Great. Louise, welcome to the call. So, Enrique, if you'd like to handle the question for REWIND. And then, Dan, over to you for the question on tanezumab. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : So Trulicity today is having fantastic growth. Clearly, the GLP-1 market is growing very fast at 26%, but Trulicity is also having continued share growth over the last few months. We have an excellent access position and quite frankly, an unmatched patient experience when we look at the real-world efficacy that Trulicity delivers. So, we'll look at patient adherence and very simply delivered. So very excited about the core performance of the product. Clearly, REWIND, as we said before, is an important trial for us, and we believe that we've designed this trial in the appropriate way. We expect that we're going to have a top line sometime by the end of the year. But we - one of the differences for REWIND versus other trials is the time the patients are going to be on the product. This is not a short product. It's fairly long, and we expect that the patients would be on average over five years on Trulicity. So, we look forward to the results of the trial. But at this point in time, we're not going to speculate. Phil Johnson : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes, they're strict with tanezumab. But of course, with Pfizer, our priority here in the current slated trials is to demonstrate the benefit, risks of this drug for patients in a variety of settings. Having said that, your question was sort of broader about the societal impact here of the opioid crisis and the need for non-opioid alternatives for chronic pain. Of course, we also see that. That's one of the reasons we're excited by the potential of the pain portfolio, one of the reasons that several years ago we decided to invest in the future for tanezumab. I think how regulators will see the interplay between new molecules for pain versus the opioid crisis is important. And we think that we have an important role to play there in helping solve that problem. Phil Johnson : Thanks, Dan. Kevin, next caller. Operator : And we do have a question from Steve Scala, Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. Back on REWIND. On the Q1 call, it was stated that the top line press release could be anticipated in early Q4. Enrique, you just said year-end, so I\u2019m wondering if there has been a change in timing? Secondly, on Alimta, does the ruling in Germany change anything in the market, such as allowing a generic launch? And then lastly, on Verzenio, a Phase 2 study in MCL had completed in March, but there has been no update when might we see the data? Thank you. Phil Johnson : Great, Steve, thank you for the question. So, when we came back to you for the REWIND follow-up, and then Sue, to you for the Germany ruling for Alimta and the Verzenio Phase 2 and MCL. Enrique Conterno : There has been no change in timing. We expect that the top line would be released in Q4. Phil Johnson : Okay, great. Thank you, Enrique. And Sue? Sue Mahony : Yes, with regards to Alimta Germany, we - we're having junctions in place. So, it's really hard to say what the situation is with regards to generics. I mean, some may go at risk, but it's really hard to say with regards to that. Phil Johnson : And then for Verzenio, we have the MCL Phase 2 wrap-up. Any thoughts on plans for MCL going forward? Sue Mahony : Yes, I'm going to have to get back to you on that one. I\u2019m not sure the plans with regards to the publication on that, but we\u2019ll certainly get back to you on that one. Enrique Conterno : Great. And then also just to place in context for our Q2 results, European sales of Alimta were about $145 million less than $30 million of that came from Germany. Phil Johnson : Kevin, if we have another caller, well, we\u2019re happy to take the question. Operator : Next will be Hima Inguva, BoA. Please go ahead. And your line is open at this time. Hima Inguva, your line is open. Hima Inguva : Can, you hear me okay? Operator : Yes. Phil Johnson : Yes, we can. Hima Inguva : Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking the question. On Slide 5, you're indicating a potential debt offering prior to the IPO, and not asking in terms of those transaction details. But do you expect this Elanco to be a levering up event for Lilly? Phil Johnson : So, Josh, if you want to respond to the question in terms of what would cause Lilly to actually lever up. Josh Smiley : So, the debt offering will - the intent at this point is to do that before we launch the IPO of less than 20% obviously over time that that sits on Elanco\u2019s books. I think, if you look at Lilly\u2019s capital allocation priorities and cash flow, we do expect to be more levered over time as a function basically of tax reform. You'll recall that prior to tax reform, we were in a position where we had cash that was restricted in how we could use it. And it was in effect trapped overseas and that has freed up, we don't need to keep as much cash. So, you should expect to see Lilly on a net basis be more levered. And, in fact, in Q2, we moved into a net debt position. So, it\u2019s less an issue of what will happen with a Elanco, because that will normalize over time and more a function of our capital structure, which is now - gives us much more flexibility as we're able to manage and use cash around the world. Phil Johnson : And this is Phil. I get to my new role as Treasurer. When we would separate a Elanco should that occur, which is our plan, we would lose a certain amount of EBITDA, there would not be a significant reduction to our debt. So, there would be a modest maybe 20 basis point increase in the debt to EBITDA kind of numbers that we have a very minimal change in terms of Lilly's leverage moving forward. Kevin, do we have any more callers in the queue? Hima Inguva : That's very helpful. Thank you. Phil Johnson : You are welcome. Operator : No further question in queue at this time. Phil Johnson : Excellent. Thank you very much, Dave. If you'd like to go ahead and conclude the call with some comments. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Phil. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Our strong first-half growth makes us increasingly confident in our ability to deliver 5% compound revenue growth from 2015 to 2020 and to achieve a 30% operating margin in 2020. While our first-half pipeline accomplishments continue to highlight the depth and breadth of our prospects for growth beyond 2020. As demonstrated most recently by our decision on Elanco, we continue to take concrete actions to focus our resources and allocate capital to best serve our customers and create value for our stakeholders. With a diverse set of new product opportunities to drive growth, a strong R&D capability and a clear path to margin expansion, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. Thanks, again, for dialing in. Please follow-up with our IR team if you have questions we've not addressed on the call. Everyone, have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay and that\u2019s starting today at 11.30 AM Eastern time it will run to July 24th of 2019.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. David Ricks. Please go ahead. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly & Company's Q3 2018 Earnings Call. I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO. Joining me on today's call are Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, the President of Lilly Research Labs and our Chief Scientific Officer; Enrique Conterno, the President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A.; Christi Shaw, the President of Lilly Bio Medicines; and Anne White, who is joining us for the first time as our new President of Lilly Oncology. We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Mike Suppar (1:09), Kevin Hern, and Phil Johnson of the IR team. Please note that Jeff Simmons is not on the call today, as Elanco is now having their own quarterly earnings calls, including their first call earlier this morning. Substantive questions regarding their business performance and outlook should be directed to Elanco's Investor Relations team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed at the SEC. Information we provide about our products and our pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional. And it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. We continued our strong performance in 2018 with a third quarter revenue growth of 7% and non-GAAP operating income of 29% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 32%. New pharmaceutical products, which now represent 35% of human Pharma revenue in the quarter, continue to be the driver of our worldwide growth, led by Trulicity, Taltz, and Verzenio. New products continue to drive strong volume-based growth, highlighted by the 14% Pharma volume growth and the 30% U.S. diabetes volume growth. We continue to expand our margins this quarter. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue increased by nearly 110 basis points over Q3 2017. And non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue increased by over 380 basis points to 28.1%. We made significant progress with the pipeline this quarter, including the approval and launch of Emgality in the U.S., a positive CHMP opinion for Emgality in Europe, the submission of lasmiditan in the U.S., as well as positive Phase 3 readouts for Ultra Rapid Lispro in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients, and a positive Phase 2 readout for GIP/GLP, which is now called tirzepatide, in Type 2 diabetes. And we announced yesterday that Trulicity demonstrated superiority in the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events across a broad range of people with Type 2 diabetes in the precedent setting REWIND trial. These results are important for the millions of people with Type 2 diabetes who face a higher risk for CV disease. We will submit these data to regulatory authorities and plan to present the detailed data at ADA in 2019. These extensive data, along with Trulicity's proven powerful efficacy, simply delivered, further validate Trulicity as a well-established option for people with diabetes. In terms of capital deployment, Elanco Animal Health became a publicly-traded company via a well-received initial public offering. Through the IPO and the associated debt offering, Elanco raised over $4 billion in capital, the vast majority of which was provided to Lilly as partial consideration for the Animal Health business that Lilly transferred to Elanco in connection with the IPO. We announced several business development transactions, including a licensing agreement which Chugai Pharmaceuticals for an oral GLP-1 agonist; a licensing and research collaboration with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, utilizing their RNAi technology platform; a collaboration with NextCure Inc., focused on discovery and development of novel immuno-oncology cancer therapies; and we purchased a priority review voucher. We returned nearly $600 million via the dividend. And we repurchased $1 billion of stock. Moving on to slides 5 and 6, you'll see more detail on key events since our July earnings call. Now I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2018. Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Slide 7 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide 8 provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. So please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our third quarter GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 9, you'll see the revenue increase of 7% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 76.7%. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, gross margins as a percent of revenue increased nearly 110 basis points, primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of product mix, partially offset by the negative impact of price on our revenue. Total operating expense increased roughly 1%, with marketing, selling and administrative expense increasing 2%, while R&D expense remained relatively flat. Total operating expense as a percent of revenue compared to Q3 2017 declined 275 basis points to 48.8%, benefiting from previously announced actions taken to reduce the company's cost structure. Operating income increased 29% compared to Q3 2017, which put our operating margin at 27.9% for the quarter. And as Dave mentioned earlier, excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, our operating income was 28.1% of revenues, an improvement of over 380 basis points versus last year's quarter. Other income and expense was expense of $15.4 million this quarter, compared to income of $49.9 million in last year's quarter. Our tax rate was 15.1%, a decrease of 380 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of U.S. tax reform. At the bottom line, net income increased 29%, while earnings per share increased slightly faster at 32%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. We achieved this significant earnings growth by delivering high single digit revenue growth, while carefully managing our operating expenses, significantly improving profitability again this quarter. Slide 10 details these same non-GAAP measures for September year to date, while slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You will find additional details on these adjustments on slides 23 and 24. Moving to slide 12. Let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange had a modest effect on revenue. Our worldwide revenue growth on a performance basis was 8%, driven by a 12% increase in volume, partially offset by price. Q3 represented the seventh straight quarter our human Pharma business delivered volume growth in each major geography. U.S. Pharma revenue increased 11%, driven by impressive volume growth of 17%, led by Trulicity, Basaglar, Taltz and Verzenio, partially offset by price. As Dave mentioned earlier, our U.S. diabetes business delivered 30% volume growth yet again this quarter. This performance affirms our volume based growth strategy is critical as we grow through an evolving U.S. pricing environment. You will see U.S. price declined 6% this quarter. Nearly 3 points of the U.S. price decline was driven by new access and corresponding volume for Basaglar in Medicare Part D, which we didn't have in last year's quarter. We also have approximately 2 points of decline associated with increases to our patient affordability and access programs for Taltz and Humalog, which also drove increased volumes. The remaining point of decline is the net effect of changes to estimates in rebates and discounts across segments, partially offset by the impact of price increases we took late last year and early this year. Moving to Europe, Pharma revenue grew 1%, driven by volume, largely offset by price. This volume growth was achieved despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding the impact of the Cialis LOE, volume grew over 15%. This robust volume growth was led by Olumiant, Trulicity, Taltz, Lartruvo, and Jardiance. In Japan, Pharma revenue decreased 2%, with volume growth more than offset by price from the impact of the biannual price cuts, which took effect in Q1. Volume growth was driven by new products, namely Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz, and Jardiance, with a significant contribution also coming from Cymbalta. Our Pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 15% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth from new products, namely Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Taltz, and Basaglar, as well as strong volume growth from Humalog. Turning to Animal Health. Total worldwide revenue grew 6% on a performance basis this quarter, driven by higher prices and higher volume. Higher sales of Companion Animal Disease Prevention, Ruminants and Swine, and Companion Animal Therapeutics products were partially offset by lower sales of products that are being exited, including the products which Lilly has retained control of after the Elanco IPO. Slide 13 outlines this same information for our September year-to-date results. Now let's take a look at the drivers of our 12% worldwide volume growth on slide 14. In total, our new products, including Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Verzenio, Olumiant, Jardiance, Lartruvo, and Cyramza were the engine of our worldwide volume growth. You can see that these products drove 13.8 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. This robust Pharma volume growth represented our strongest quarterly volume performance this decade. The loss of exclusivity for Strattera, Effient, Zyprexa, Axiron, Evista, and Cymbalta provided a drag of 110 basis points, while Cialis accounted for 190 basis points of volume decline. At the end of September, generic versions of Cialis entered the U.S. market, which is expected to result in rapid erosion of sales. When excluding LOEs and Cialis, the rest of our products had volume growth of approximately 19%. Slide 15 provides a view of our new product updates. In total, these brands generated nearly $1.9 billion in revenue this quarter, representing 31% of our total worldwide revenue and 35% of our human Pharmaceutical revenue. With the launch of Emgality and the submission of lasmiditan, we look forward to adding a fourth leg to our new product growth story, joining recent launches in diabetes, oncology, and immunology, and demonstrating that Lilly is also building an innovative pain franchise. Moving to slide 16. Continuing with our non-GAAP explanations, this quarter, the effective FX had a relatively minimal impact on our income statement with a small negative impact on revenue and a small positive impact on earnings. Turning to our 2018 financial guidance on slide 17, you will see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect our continued strong operational performance. We're narrowing the range for revenue to $24.3 billion to $24.5 billion; narrowing the range for SG&A expense to $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion; decreasing our tax rate from 17% to 16%, due primarily to recently issued guidance on elements of U.S. tax reform; and we're raising and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.55 to $5.60. At the midpoint of the range, this represents an increase of 30% over 2017. I would note that this revised EPS range assumes a $0.02 to $0.03 negative impact from backing out the noncontrolling interest portion of Elanco profits in the fourth quarter, which had not been included in the prior guidance. Our updated guidance implies fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $1.33 and $1.38, which exceeds current consensus. However, it is lower than our third quarter EPS due to the entry of generic competition for Cialis in the U.S. in late September; higher fourth quarter R&D expenses to support additional late stage investment, including mirikizumab, Olumiant, and Taltz NILEX, as well as pegilodecakin and GIP/GLP; and launch investments for Emgality; and finally the minority interest attributed to Elanco that I mentioned earlier. On a reported basis, earnings per share for 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $3.13 to $3.18 (sic) [$3.04 to $3.09] (14:22). In total, we expect strong full year performance led by volume gains in our new products, which allows for targeted investments in our long-term portfolio and positions us well to achieve our 2020 financial objectives. This robust performance, along with the capital raised from the Elanco transaction, provides strong cash flow, which we are deploying thoughtfully across our capital allocation priorities. As we move forward in line with our strategy, we will continue to prioritize funding our existing marketed products, new launches, lifecycle opportunities, and in replenishing our pipeline. In addition, we continue to leverage business development to upgrade our pipeline and future growth prospects, as you saw with several recent announcements of business development deals. Finally, we'll return excess cash to shareholders via increases to the dividend and share buybacks. Now I will turn the call back over to Dave to review the pipeline and key future events. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Josh. So Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 30. In my summary of the quarter at the beginning of the call, I mentioned the positive movements for Emgality and lasmiditan. Additional movements since our last earnings call includes, the start of a Phase 3 study for Olumiant in lupus; and the start of a Phase 2/3 adaptive study for Olumiant in alopecia areata; the attrition of Cyramza's second line bladder cancer indication from Phase 3; and the attrition of the N3pG plus BACE combo arm from the ongoing Phase 2. Please note, we are still studying N3pG as a monotherapy in Phase 2. On slide 19, we provide an update on expected key events for 2018. In addition to the pipeline movement and regulatory actions I have already noted, you will see that we've added a new line to reflect our expectation to submit Taltz for axial spondyloarthritis to regulatory authorities by the end of the year. In addition, the FDA has granted breakthrough designation to Emgality for the cluster headache indication. And you'll see that we've added a new line to reflect our plans to submit this indication by year end. Under regulatory action, you will see the approval of Verzenios in Europe and Verzenio in Japan and the approval of fruquintinib in China under the trade name Elunate. Under regulatory submissions, you'll see the submission of a new indication for Cyramza in Europe and Japan for second line liver cancer. In the Phase 3 data presentations and publications section, we reflect the presentations at EASD of the EASE 2 and 3 studies in type I diabetes for empagliflozin, as well as the CARMELINA CV outcome study for Tradjenta in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. In addition to the presentations at ACR of the COAST-V and COAST-W axial spondyloarthritis studies for ixekizumab. And in Phase 3 top line data disclosure section, in addition to the Phase 3 readouts for Trulicity and Ultra Rapid Lispro, which I mentioned earlier, we also had a positive Phase 3 readout for flortaucipir, our tau imaging agent. This was another productive quarter, contributing to continued pipeline advancement in 2018. Before we go to the Q&A section, let me briefly sum up the progress we made this quarter. In Q3, we continued our strong operating performance in 2018, delivering 7% revenue growth and 12% volume growth, driven by our newest products. As Josh stated earlier, our Pharma volume growth was the strongest this decade. We continue to realize significant efficiencies in our cost structure, leading to operating margin expansion of over 380 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventory sold. We have made excellent progress in our pipeline this quarter as well : The approval and launch of Emgality for migraine patients in the U.S., this is our 10th new product launch since 2014; the FDA submission of lasmiditan for acute migraine; positive Phase 3 data for Ultra Rapid Lispro; the presentation of exciting Phase 2 data for tirzepatide in type II diabetes; and just yesterday's news that Trulicity demonstrated superiority in the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events across a broad range of people with type II diabetes in the precedent setting REWIND trial. We also returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. We completed the Elanco IPO and bolstered our early phase pipeline with the addition of an oral GLP-1, while completing several other business development deals. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dave. As in prior calls, we would like to take as many questions as possible during the Q&A session, so we do ask that you limit your questions to two or a single question with two parts. Also, given some scheduling issues on our side and the fact that in recent calls we have not exhausted the full 90 minutes we had scheduled, we do intend to conclude today's call at 10 :15. So with that, Lola, if you could provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Certainly. And first we'll go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. My first one was on REWIND results. I think you referred to them as precedent setting. I know you're sharing the full data next summer. But any additional color you can provide, as we try to think about those results in context of prior GLP-1 CV outcome studies? As we get kind of this balance of healthier patients versus longer follow-up in that study. My second question, you touched a little bit on the prepared remarks. But the diabetes portfolio in 3Q, I think we had a few progs coming in a bit below expectations after some very strong first half results. Can you just talk about any color in terms of, was there any kind of one-time issues to speak about, Humalog or Basaglar, that affected this quarter's results? Thanks so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you for the questions, Chris. Enrique, those are both for you. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Very good. REWIND is indeed a precedent setting trial. It included the majority of patients without \u2013 with Type 2 diabetes, but without cardiovascular disease. It also had the longest median follow-up, over five years, and a low A1C baseline of 7.3. I think what we can share at this stage is really what's on the press release. We will not be sharing more information on REWIND until our intended detailed presentation at ADA next year. We do intend to submit in 2019 for a new indication. Related to Humalog and Basaglar on the overall diabetes portfolio, first, I think we're very pleased with the overall volume growth when it comes to the diabetes portfolio. Clearly when it comes to Humalog, we did see a 14% price decline vis-a-vis Q3 of 2017. Just to provide maybe a little more color on this, we are seeing in a favorable segment mix about 8 points of that 14. Patient affordability is impacted in the insulin portfolio. That's another 4 points. And then we had a unfavorable property (22:24) adjustment as a comparator to last year's quarter. Maybe to provide and try to be a little more instructed, yes, we do see a lot of volatility with Humalog. It is better to look at this product on a year-to-date basis. And when we look at it on a year-to-date basis, I think the trend that we basically see is mid-single digit erosion on price. The dynamics on Basaglar are slightly different, in that Basaglar did not have any access in Part D, and that's access that we first gained this year. So when we look at the compare, we are comparing on a segment that is highly rebated. And that basically has an impact on price. Now when we look at Q2 of 2018 versus Q3 of 2018 for Basaglar, there is some price erosion but not the same magnitude that you see year on year. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Enrique, thank you for the answers. Lola, if we can go to the next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. And next, we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Timothy Minton Anderson - Wolfe Research, LLC: Thank you very much. A couple of questions. 2019, can you talk about tailwinds and headwinds? I know you won't be giving official guidance until December, but hoping there are at least some trends both on the revenue and spending side that you can maybe call out ahead of that official guidance. So for example, obviously Cialis is \u2013 will be LOE. If I think about R&D spend, you're going to be starting eight Phase 3 trials on your GIP/GLP-1 program. So any color on 2019 would be appreciated. And then a second question on insulin category. So at some point, FDA may deem biosimilar insulins as interchangeable and substitutable with brand. Do you think this is more likely than not to occur? And could that be something that happens as soon as 2019? And if not 2019, then when? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Tim, good to hear your voice again. Welcome back. Josh, if you would answer the first question on the 2019 tailwinds and headwinds. And then, Enrique, the question Tim had on interchangeability for insulins. Josh? Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. Thanks, Tim. And you started to answer the question. I think the main tailwinds \u2013 or the headwind that we'll see is the Cialis overhang in 2019, as we will experience the main erosion here in the fourth quarter in the U.S. So that certainly will be a headwind as we head in 2019. That being said, we're seeing great growth in the 10 new medicines we've launch since 2014. So we'd expect that the volume from those products to more than compensate for many of the tailwinds we've said we will see. So we will see a difficult compare. The other thing that we've talked about in terms of a headwind on the top line will be the change in the donut hole provision in Medicare Part D, the move from 50% to 70%. As Enrique mentioned, we've got Basaglar in our diabetes products, are in that segment strongly. So we'll see a little bit of a headwind there. But I think we're really pleased with the volume growth that we saw this quarter and expect that the main components of that will continue into 2019. On the R&D side, we do have a very robust set of Phase 3 opportunities ahead of us. You mentioned tirzepatide, which will be starting in mid-2019. In a broad sense we've got mirikizumab that we moved into Phase 3. As you know, those trials are expensive, so we'll have a cost there. And then we'll see data on our ARMO asset, the IL-10, in 2019. And we'd expect that, given positive data there, to continue to push that program. So we'll make targeted investments in R&D and should expect to see some growth there. I think we've been pretty clear on the SG&A line that a big component of our operating margin expansion will be to redirect the investments and resources that we have in products like Cialis and Forteo and others to our new launch opportunities we'll have. Certainly, we'll spend competitively to launch products like Emgality next year. But we'd look to manage that total base at a pretty flat level. All in all, we are excited about the prospects for midterm, 2019 and 2020. We're well on track we think to meet our 2020 midterm objectives, which are 5% compound annual, minimum 5% compound annual sales growth between 2015 and 2020 and operating margin minimum of 30%. So we feel good about where we are there. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Josh. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: When it comes to insulin interchangeability at the pharmacy level, we do not believe this is imminent. At best, it's likely a few years away. And it will require the appropriate studies for the FDA to provide such a designation. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Lola, next caller, please? Operator : Certainly. Next will go to line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Mr. Gerberry? Shall we move on? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes, if you could. And then maybe put Jason into the next slot if he's able to reconnect? Thank you. Operator : Certainly. And next we'll go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. Couple of questions for Enrique, please. Could you talk to the barriers prohibiting broader Jardiance usage? Whether it's education? Reimbursement copay? And then related to that, could you outline the Tier 2 formulary status within Medicare for Jardiance especially? And in particular, whether a second brand at a net price rather than the current list price may be helpful in increasing penetration by reducing the burden on the patients and preparing ground for a world of net pricing, which seems to be potentially upon us? Many thanks. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Okay. Andrew, thank you for the questions. If I got them, first, Enrique, would be barriers that you see to Jardiance usage and ways to maybe change that, Tier 2 formulary status and Medicare, and the opportunity for a second brand to potentially address some of the issues that patients face in that book of business. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. I'm going to try to answer that question, Andrew, just by maybe a bit of color on how we see Jardiance, because I do see there are some barriers. But I see a number of dynamics that are very positive when I look at the overall class and Jardiance in particular. First, clearly one of the things that we look at is, how is the overall class evolving and developing? And the class right now is growing in single digits, high single digits. But more importantly, we are seeing new patient starts \u2013 the growth in new patient starts accelerate. We now see that in the 14%, 15% range. It reminds me a bit of the reacceleration of the GLP-1 class back when Trulicity was launched. Importantly, there are new guidelines that have been published by both ADA and EASD. We think those guidelines are a significant improvement. And that's going to be very helpful. That's an important tailwind. And finally, we have improved access for Jardiance. As you know, we were excluded from one of the major accounts. We are back as of January 1. And that's going to be a very important access for Jardiance. When it comes to coverage, now starting in January of 2019 is in the 90s. So that's an excellent foundation for us to capitalize on. And an additional point, which I emphasized in the GLP-1 class, but it's relevant for now, SGLT2s, is that we have basically additional data from competitors that are confirming the benefits when it comes to CV of the class. And importantly, investments from those competitors. Jardiance is in the best opportunity to capitalize on that. So I see an evolution. And there are a lot of signs and dynamics to be hopeful about the acceleration of the overall growth and the ability for Jardiance to capitalize on that. You asked about Medicare, and whether we would be launching a second brand with Jardiance. Honestly, that's not where I see the issue for Jardiance when it comes to the use of it. Clearly, we always assess all opportunities for our brands. But we are much more focused about \u2013 and I think as you implied on your question \u2013 continuing to educate health care professionals to ensure that they understand the full benefit that Jardiance can offer patients. And these new guidelines are going to be extremely helpful to do that. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Lola, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Certainly. And next we'll go to the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Can you guys hear me? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: We certainly can. Yes. Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Sorry about that. Yeah, first question is just on Taltz. Can you talk about the outlook going into the next few years with a new competitor launching? And do you believe that as these market position with HUMIRA, which has been the leading product in some of these markets, do you think that confers any advantage as it pertains to access relative to the already on market interleukin agents? And then my second question. With oral GLP-1, can you talk a little bit about what you hope to accomplish here, especially with the great data on GIP/GLP? And as we think about Novo's [Novo Nordisk's] oral sema [semaglutide], there are obviously some challenges with that product in terms of dosing. So can you talk about sort of what you're looking for in terms of go, no-go profile? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Jason. Thank you for the questions. So, Christi, if you'll take question on the Taltz outlook going forward. And then over to you, Dan, for our goals for the oral GLP-1 program. Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So we're very excited with Taltz. I mean you probably saw that our year-over-year volume growth was significant. And specifically, our TRx grew 80% year over year. And over the quarter, continuing to grow the same. And we're just starting with Taltz. I mean we have a great position in the dermatology office. We just launched this year in the rheumatology office with psoriatic arthritis, which that launch is going well. And just coming off of the American College of Rheumatology, we also demonstrated our data in ankylosing spondylitis, which we will submit before the end of the year, as Dave said. So as we're looking and winning in dermatology, we're beefing up in rheumatology as well. And to your point about access. Right now, our access is about the same as COSENTYX, a little bit less due to the Optum [OptumRx] change in the beginning of the year. But with that, as you can see, the growth of Taltz \u2013 it hasn't prevented us from getting patients who need Taltz on Taltz. And we see that continuing in the future. Because in this marketplace, unfortunately, patients cycle through many different therapies. And what we're seeing from customers is that they would like a variety of therapies and different mechanisms to choose from. So you look at the entire portfolio that we have of newer agents coming out and IL-17 and IL-23, our JAK inhibitor, we're looking to be able to provide a broad portfolio to those customers, those patients, and broaden our access to payers with the advent of the newer agents. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Christi, Dan? Daniel M. Skovronsky - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, thank you for the question on our partnership with Chugai on this oral GLP-1 receptor agonist. This is still a pre-Phase 1 molecule, but moving quickly towards human trials. An important comment there is that this is a non-peptidic agonist. So this is \u2013 you should think of this very differently from an oral peptide. This is a small molecule approach. As such, we expect it to have in humans \u2013 and this is what we'll be testing \u2013 a much higher bioavailability than you would see for any kind of oral peptide approach. What does that mean for patients? We hope that will translate into a better experience, certainly in terms of how and when this molecule will be dosed for the people on the trials, and ultimately, in practice. But also that should translate into improved outcomes. So it's still very early, but we're excited about the potential here. And look forward to getting some human data. Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Dan. Lola, next caller, please? Operator : Certainly. And next we'll go to the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Olivia Brayer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Olivia Brayer on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the question. Just two from me. First question is on your dual-receptor agonist. Can you provide us with any updates on that Phase 3 trial? We noticed yesterday that the SURPASS 4 was posted to ct.gov. So can you point to what steps you've taken to improve that overall tolerability in that Phase 3? Just curious how the design was influenced by the recently completed titration study that you previously talked about? And of course, the Phase 2 that we saw last month. And any expectations there on enrollment timelines? And then second question is just another on REWIND. Just curious on what your view is on the incremental opportunity here. Any thoughts on how it might change the treatment paradigm? And what the impact on the overall GLP-1 class might be? Thanks so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, maybe we'll have you attack those. So the first one on GIP/GLP or tirzepatide, things that are being done for Phase 3 with titration, things we would have learned in our Phase 2 program, and then any comments on enrollment timing. And then how you see REWIND playing out going forward with the GLP-1 market. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. So as we've shared as part of tirzepatide's Phase 3 program, we are planning to study three maintenance doses at 5, 10 and 15 mg. I think what we've learned is that we should titrate in smaller increments and over time. As we've shared, we have a titration study that we intend to share the details next year. But clearly we've learned a lot from the study in terms of what are the optimal titration schedules. We are planning aggressively when it comes to starting this trial and starting enrollment. So you'll be hearing more when it comes to our trial for Type 2 diabetes soon. As far as REWIND, I don't want to speculate on the particular indication that we will get. But clearly, this is important for the class in that it confirms what other GLP-1s have shown when it comes to seeing benefit. And, I'm sorry, I cannot resist, but I heard Novo Nordisk's call. And they also mentioned that GLP-1s were not all the same, and I think we agree with them. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. So, Lola, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : Yes. And next we'll go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have a couple questions. You mentioned the U.S. price hit from gaining access for Basaglar, Taltz, and Humalog. But was there a one-time volume gain from this reflected in the 17% U.S. volume increase? So that's the first question. The second question is to go back to the questions on REWIND. Is REWIND precedent setting because of the population studied? Or is it precedent setting because you have avoided the less than optimal outcomes of Novo's leader in SUSTAIN 6? Or perhaps both? I mean precedent setting is a big statement. So in the absence of any color, I guess we have to assume you hit all three components of the primary endpoint, which is something Novo was not able to accomplish. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Steve. Thank you for the questions. So, Josh, if you'll take the comment on U.S. price, if there was also offsets there in the volumes that we're gaining. And then, Enrique, on what we mean by precedent setting for REWIND. Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Steve. Yes, if you look at volume for the third quarter in the U.S., it grew at 17%, which Dave and I both mentioned was the most significant volume growth we've seen this decade. And that Basaglar absolutely contributed to that growth. So the access that we got in Medicare Part D is contributing to the 17% growth, as are the other elements that we mentioned around patient access and all of the new launches. So it is a positive offset there. And you can see in total, even with that negative-6% growth, the U.S. business grew at 11% overall. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Josh. Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: As I mentioned when I first discussed REWIND as part of the first question, it is precedent setting because it includes some areas of patients without cardiovascular disease. It has the longest median follow-up and a low A1C baseline. We'll be sharing the detailed results at the ADA next year. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Lola, next caller? Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, maybe on the oncology side, I noticed for your IL-10 you have decent monotherapy activity in the renal cell setting. But the randomized trials you're running are in lung and pancreatic. So I just wanted to get the thought process there. Is that a consideration? And also your confidence on those open-label lung trials that are coming out in the first half 2019. Second, on NGF it seems like the placebo adjusted efficacy definitely faded into the latest readout. And my question is, do you look at this current placebo adjusted efficacy from this latest trial as being clinically meaningful? And also just your thoughts on the joint replacements on that trial. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Umer. Thank you for the questions. So, Dan, we'll go to you for those on the development strategy for the IL-10. And then also what we think about the efficacy results and any safety findings from the initial trial that's readout for our NGF. Daniel M. Skovronsky - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, thanks, Umer, for those good questions. So starting with the pegilodecakin at IL-10. As you point out, the randomized trial that's ongoing at Phase 3 is in pancreas. We're excited about that and look forward to seeing data there in combination with FOLFOX. The two Phase 2 studies that you mentioned are randomized trials in non-small cell lung cancer. The first one is in the first line setting in PD-L1 high patients. And the second one is in the second line setting in the PD-L1 low setting, both in combination with I/O. We're absolutely excited to see data from those trials starting next year, which will inform our progress in that opportunity. As for RCC, you're right that we had the monotherapy activity there in that early Phase 1 study, which was exciting, and part of the basis of the back years, that this molecule is active in the monotherapy setting. I think in terms of that indication and other indications, we're still working through what our plan is. Some of that will depend on data that we get in these next couple of trials, as well as the data that we already have. We hope to be able to share more with you about our plans for full development of that molecule at our December R&D day. With respect to tanezumab, I think you had a question there on both the efficacy and the safety with respect to total joint replacements. On the efficacy, it's hard to make cross-trial comparisons. Of course, this is a different population, that's a more treatment resistant, more severe population than in those prior studies. Still, on balance, the efficacy looks quite comparable to what we would expect. Maybe some small differences in the placebo group from trial to trial. But this is a small trial. And we look forward to the full results coming. But all in all, I would say the efficacy data are where we expect them to be. And we're really, I think, excited as we said before about the potential of this molecule from an efficacy perspective. The question of course is, can we adequately discharge the safety risk? So the total joint replacement, there was an imbalance in this small study. We don't fully understand what drove that imbalance. I think there were a number of factors that we noticed about the imbalance in total joint replacements. One was that most of these events occurred in the follow-up period, rather than the on-treatment period. Another observation is that these events were generally in the patients who were most severe at enrollment. It was in their index joints, and it was not \u2013 in general, in most cases, it was not associated with any adverse event or any finding in the joint adjudication. So we'll keep our eye on that. And of course, the big readout for us with our partners, Pfizer, will be next year, when we get that large 56-week study. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dan. Lola, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. And next it's Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. And congratulations on a positive REWIND readout. First on REWIND, Enrique, June 2019 seems like a long time to wait for the results. You mentioned you plan to file the indication in 2019. So when should we expect to see a new Trulicity label? Then I have a couple of questions on Verzenio, please. The market seems to have slowed down more than we expected. Just wondering if you could give us your thoughts there? You're gaining share, which is great, but what's going on with the overall market? And we noticed you moved up the timeline for the adjuvant study by one year on clinicaltrials.gov. Just wondering if you changed anything about the trial? Or is it just your expectations about, based on the powering of the study or expected benefits? Thank you very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you for the questions, Alex. So timing for a potential label update on REWIND, Enrique, for you. And then, Anne, if you'd to handle what we're seeing for market growth with the CDK4/6 class and the change in timing on clinicaltrials.gov for the adjuvant study. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Well, clearly, we are planning to pursue an indication under a submission in 2019 and a standard review. We will be looking at a label update in 2020. Of course, we are working as fast as we can to try to expedite that as much as possible. And we'll be working with the regulatory authorities. Unfortunately, we won't be able to share the REWIND data prior to ADA. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Anne? Anne E. White - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Well, thanks for the question on Verzenio. And, yes, we have seen some slowing in the growth of the CDK4/6 market, as others in the class have commented. However, we do still see potential growth, as more physicians trial this class and particularly as they trial Verzenio. So as you mentioned, our NBRx rate is in the high teens. And we continue to be pleased with its growth. And we are encouraged by a couple of specific factors. So first, as we continue to drive trial with Verzenio in the U.S., what we're seeing is that when physicians trial Verzenio, they have a really good experience. And they're likely to prescribe it again, so becoming adopters. And what seems to particularly resonate with physicians is the fact that patients with certain concerning clinical characteristics, that indicate a poorer prognosis, do well on Verzenio. So these are patients with liver metastases, a high tumor grade, visceral disease, or cancer that's not confined to the bone. And so we'll be publishing that additional data shortly. We're also very enthusiastic about the fact that we've received approval in Japan and Europe. So we see those markets as significant growth drivers. And then third, related your question around adjuvant, we do see potential future opportunity in the broader breast cancer market, following readouts in the HER2 positive population, our OS readout from the MONARCH 2 study. And then very importantly, the work, as you said, in adjuvant breast cancer. On adjuvant specifically, what we're seeing is that study is enrolling very well. It's more than 60% enrolled. So we're quite encouraged by that timeline. So we do expect results in 2021. And we really look forward to that market, because as you know, adjuvant is really twice the size of the metastatic breast cancer market. So a significant growth opportunity for Lilly in the future. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Anne. Lola, if we can go to the next caller. Operator : Certainly. Next will be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Risinger? David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Sorry. I was on mute. Can you hear me now? Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: We can. Yes, Dave. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. So Lilly's volume growth has been and is set to continue to be very strong. But could you please comment on three quick questions on pricing? First, the list price outlook for 2019 that you have in your planning assumptions? Second, your exposure to a step up in the donut hole fill in 2019? And third, your exposure to growth in co-pay accumulators in 2019? Thanks very much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Dave. Thank you for the questions. Josh, if you'd like to answer those questions on expectations moving forward on price? Joshua L. Smiley - Eli Lilly & Co.: So, Dave, we'll do our guidance for 2019 in December, and we'll provide our pricing assumptions then. I can tell you for 2018 for the guidance that we gave, we're not assuming any additional price increases this year. In terms of exposure to the change in the donut hole provision, we've said before that when we look across our portfolio, it's about $200 million of incremental impact in 2019. And then on the co-pay accumulators piece, of course these impact the specialty drugs, particularly Taltz and Forteo for now. And we're \u2013 at least for where we are right now, we're comfortable that there is not a significant exposure here. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Just maybe a follow on comment on that. I've seen notes from analysts as well as other industry commentators that, roughly in specialty segments, these are single-digit impacts in terms of patients actually exposed to the out-of-pocket costs of co-pay accumulators, net of industry actions and payer actions. And that's not really different for us with Taltz, which is the major product affected. So it's an issue, but it's not a huge driver of the overall picture. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, guys. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thanks, Dave. Lola, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : Certainly. And it will be Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So one just on Olumiant. Looks like still pretty good European uptake, but sort of limited uptake in the first few months on the market in the U.S. So maybe you can just talk about sort of access and sort of initial position interest in that product. And then the other one, I just \u2013 maybe a little bit of a different product we don't talk much about is Lartruvo. Obviously, still one of your newer medications. But I think it's asked about a little less. And I'm just trying to get a better sense of that market. I mean the growth is still there in the U.S. but slowing a little bit. And I'm just trying to get a better sense of how penetrated you think that product is into that market. And maybe a little bit more on the longer-term potential for that one to keep growing. Thanks so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Vamil. Thank you for the questions. So, Christi, if you'd like to talk about what we're seeing in terms of uptake access and physician experience here in the U.S. And then, Anne, over to you for what we're seeing with Lartruvo and the market opportunity there. Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Sure. So thank you for the question, Vamil. In terms of Olumiant, I will start with the EU as you suggested, or outside the U.S. The growth of Olumiant in volume in Europe in the last two quarters has actually been the fastest growing in volume for Lilly as a whole. And in Japan, we just were lifted in September on the two-week prescription. So we're seeing significant uptake now that that restriction is off. And in the U.S., we're getting a lot of usage. In terms of the uptake, we are giving samples in the office to physicians, so you won't see that on the uptake. But more importantly, what we're hearing from physicians is that their patients are having really positive feedback on our speed of onset. Just like we saw in Europe and the other 50 countries where we've launched, the efficacy continues to deliver. And really helping patients with the early onset of symptom relief, so they get back to the productive days of their life. which is significant. And as the physicians see those patients come back, it truly is changing. And then helps them obviously feel more comfortable in prescribing as well. And Olumiant is really key for us. It's not just in the U.S. RA, but we continue to evolve the indications for Olumiant. We have three Phase 3 studies, obviously, that we're recruiting for in atopic dermatitis, in lupus, and a Phase 2/3 adaptive study in alopecia areata. So as those readouts come out as well, we'll be looking for significant uptake of Olumiant in helping a lot of patients with high unmet need. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Christi. Anne? Anne E. White - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. So we are pleased with the uptake on Lartruvo, and it has been steadily increasing since launch. So as you saw the year to dates, we've had a 54% increase over last year and just a 41% increase in this quarter. And Lartruvo is the market leader now in the U.S. in first-line metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. It has about a 20% market share. And then we were excited see that it's now the market leader in the dox-eligible [doxorubicin-eligible] patients, passing [ph] dox focilfide (53:45) this year at a 36% share of market. And as you know well, Vamil, it's the only medicine in four decades that actually helps patient live longer when compared to dox alone. So we're also encouraged by the fact that we're seeing thought leaders fairly routinely refer to it as the standard of care. And growth in our top accounts, particularly, is very strong. In fact, 97% of the top 100 institutions have now posted sales since launch of Lartruvo. We are still seeing launch in Europe and still gaining access. So we still think there's potential for growth obviously in that market. Our major focus really is on driving awareness in the community and in the centers of excellence, where a lot of these key treatment decisions are made. So we do still see quite a bit of potential for growth at Lartruvo, though I will acknowledge it's an orphan disease population. And so at one point we will see penetration. But we don't see that yet. We still see a good potential growth and are pleased on how we're doing. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Anne. Lola, if we can go to the next caller, please? Operator : Yes. It will be Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities : Hi. Thanks for taking my two questions. So my first question is on REWIND. Has this met your internal expectation for relative risk reduction? And have you historically talked about what kind of incremental sales opportunity it could mean for you? And then secondly, on the injectable CGRPs, how do you see this market landscape playing out with three approved products and more to come on the injectable and oral side? And do you think it will grow the entire market or take share from existing products? Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Louise, thank you for the questions. So, Enrique, another question on REWIND for you. And then, Christi, on the CGRP question, please. Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: On the expectations, of course. This is a positive trial. Trulicity is showing superiority in a broad range of patients with Type 2 diabetes. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you. Christi? Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. So we are extremely excited about the migraine marketplace. I mean you're seeing, as we've been discussing over the last year, the high unmet need with now tens of thousands of patients already being prescribed a preventive now. And I don't think I've talked to you since we actually received our label. So we're really happy with the label we received in terms of our differentiation. We have the 50%, 75%, and 100% migraine-free data that we're able to promote. Also our positive outcome for functional measures, which is unique for Emgality, is in the label. And we just presented data at the American Headache Society that Emgality works fast. Our induction dose, so patients can actually get the medication quickly, and they get it in the doctor's office where they teach them how to do the autoinjector. They do it themselves. And then they go and take it once a month then on. Lastly, the other differentiation is we got the breakthrough therapy designation in cluster. And we're very excited about that for patients who have had no treatment \u2013 no approved treatment \u2013 in that suicide headache population. So as we look at the marketplace, we see it continuing to grow. We like our chances in terms of being able to compete. And with the competitive agents and oral agents coming out next year, those right now are in a different class that will compete with lasmiditan and not the preventive therapies initially. So with the entire franchise we have in migraine of both preventative and acute, we think we're a leader. And we know we're a leader in pain and migraine and will continue to prove it out over time. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Christi. Lola, if we can go to the next caller? Operator : And next we'll go the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim Securities. Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities : Thanks very much for the question. So just a couple. Can you help us understand a little bit the opportunity for Emgality in cluster headache specifically? Is this a large new patient population that we should be thinking about? Or is it more an indication that will firm up and differentiate your market position? And then second, Enrique, can you talk more about the international growth opportunity for the GLP-1 class overall? When I look at the class, we're looking at about a third of sales relative to the U.S. And frankly, when we look at other large classes, the opportunity seems to be like it would be quite a bit greater. And I just would love to know what you see as the opportunity internationally? Or perhaps what the holdbacks are? Thanks so much. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Seamus, thank you for the questions, and welcome back to you as well. Good to hear your voice on the line. Christi, if you'll take the question on the opportunity for cluster for Emgality. And then, Enrique, for the international growth opportunity for the GLP-1 class. Christi Shaw - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Seamus, for the question. As I said earlier, we are so excited to help these patients with cluster. And although the number of patients who have cluster is obviously significantly less than the general moderate to severe migraine population, it is such a high unmet need that we're privileged to provide that for patients. And the second part of your question, I think it's good for that. But it's also obviously confirming again the efficacy of Emgality. As I stated before, Emgality is the only one who actually demonstrated efficacy in 100% of \u2013 being able to relieve 100% of migraines in any given month. And that efficacy, now coupled with cluster, which is significant and no one has ever showed efficacy, that halo effect across Emgality in migraine we expect will be a benefit. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Christi. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: So there is a significant opportunity, just like in the U.S., outside of the U.S. for the GLP-1 class. The GLP-1 class is growing in the mid-20s outside of the U.S. in most markets, so very healthy growth. Something unique when we look at the international markets is the size of the basal insulin market, which, as we know, represents a significant opportunity, as we see GLP-1s being the injectables of choice, first injectables prior to basal insulin. So a very significant opportunity, but we see that playing out over time. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. Appreciate it. If we can go to the next caller, please, Lola? Operator : Certainly. It'll be Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. A couple questions. Regarding dropping the N3pG-plus BACE in Alzheimer's disease, the early data was great. So what was the reason for dropping the product? And it was mentioned that monotherapy continues. But I thought the monotherapy was discontinued earlier this year. Or has the monotherapy restarted? So that's the first question. Second question is on Jardiance. Why are you not filing for type 1 diabetes as an insulin adjunct in 2018, given the positive data? I think that had been the expectation that you would file this year. Thank you. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great, Steve. Thank you for the questions. Dan, if you'd like to answer where we are with the N3pG and BACE combo, and N3pG more broadly. And then, Enrique, if you'd like to take the type 1 filing question. Dan? Daniel M. Skovronsky - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yeah, thanks, Steve. Sorry for the confusion there. So on the N3pG BACE, we've dropped the BACE arm of this trial, so N3pG does continue. The decision to drop BACE was based on a couple factors. One was what we've seen across the field with various BACE inhibitors, where these drugs don't have a benefit. And they actually cause some increased rate of cognitive worsening. With our particular BACE inhibitor, we did see some increases in psychiatric adverse events that gave us some pause, as well as changes on imaging, increased rate of brain shrinkage. So that was the basis for the decision to discontinue BACE, despite as you said great preclinical data, showing a combination of BACE inhibition and N3pG to be beneficial in mice. N3pG, however, which is our plaque-clearing antibody, which really shows, I think, deep and rapid clearance of amyloid plaque from the brain, continues on in this Phase 2 study. This is designed to demonstrate evidence of efficacy. And we're really excited about that. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thank you, Dan. Enrique? Enrique A. Conterno - Eli Lilly & Co.: Yes. On Jardiance and type 1, clearly, as part of the EASE studies, we showed that Jardiance as an adjunct to insulin in patient with type 1 can have additional level of glycemic control. And we saw this across all doses that we basically studied. At this point in time, we are working with BI [Boehringer Ingelheim] on the regulatory next steps. And we hope to be able to share more shortly. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Thank you, Enrique. Lola, next caller, please? Operator : And at this time, there's no one in queue. Philip Johnson - Eli Lilly & Co.: Fantastic. Dave, then if you'd like to go ahead and conclude the call with some final remarks. David A. Ricks - Eli Lilly & Co.: Great. Thanks, Phil. Well, we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly & Company. Our strong execution through the first nine months of 2018 highlights the continued progress towards and the increasing confidence in the delivery of our revenue and profitability goals for 2020. We have seen continued pipeline progression, including our 10th new product launch since 2014; compellingly stage opportunities for tirzepatide, mirikizumab and pegilodecakin; and superiority of Trulicity in the ambitious REWIND CV outcome study. This progress underscores the opportunities for growth beyond 2020. We look forward to providing a more detailed update on our pipeline during our December 19 Investor Meeting. Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call. Hope everyone has a great day. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference now to Mr. Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2018 earnings call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Christi Shaw, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; and Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. I will now turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our progress in Q4. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. We continued our strong performance in 2018 with a fourth quarter revenue growth of 5%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 15%, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 17%. Newer pharmaceutical products, which represented 38% of human pharma revenue in the quarter, continue to be the driver of our worldwide revenue growth, led by Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Verzenio, and Jardiance. Highlights of our strong volume-based growth include 31% U.S. diabetes volume growth, and 11% total pharma volume growth. This was achieved despite the significant headwind from the loss of exclusivity of Cialis in the U.S. We continue to see our year-over-year expansion in operating margins. Excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, Q4 non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue increased by over 165 basis points while investing in new product launches. We made significant progress with the pipeline, including the approval of Emgality for the prophylaxis of migraine, in Europe. The submission of Emgality for the prevention and treatment of cluster headache in the U.S., results from a phase 3 study of tanezumab in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain, and the results of two phase 3 studies of baricitinib in atopic dermatitis. We also provided an update or announced the confirmatory Phase 3 study of Lartruvo in combination with doxorubicin for advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. This study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival, and there was no difference in survival between the study arms. We are now working with global regulators to determine the next steps for Lartruvo, and will present the announced data in an upcoming medical conference. In terms of capital deployment, we continue to utilize our strong operating cash flow to access value-creating external innovation that will enhance our future growth prospects. We announced the definitive agreement to acquire Loxo Oncology, a biopharmaceutical focused on the development and commercialization of highly selective medicines for patients with genomically-defined cancers, which would add multiple first-in-class medicines to the Lilly portfolio and expand our oncology presence into precision medicines. We also announced several other business development transactions, including an agreement with AC Immune to develop small molecule tau inhibitors for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. We announced an agreement with Hydra Biosciences to acquire all assets related to their preclinical TRPA1 antagonist program, currently being studied for the treatment of chronic pain, and an agreement with Aduro Biotech to develop novel immunotherapies for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. In addition, we returned over $600 million via the dividend, and announced a 15% dividend increase for 2019. We also repurchased $1.1 billion of stock. I'd also like to provide an update on our plans for completing the full separation of Elanco. As we stated during our December investment community meeting, operationally we are ready to affect the full separation. Today, we are providing a timeline for the separation as well as the method we'll use to dispose of our remaining 293 million Elanco shares. Specifically, we plan to launch an exchange offer to Lilly shareholders in the first-half of this year to exchange our remaining Elanco shares for Lilly shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch this exchange offer will depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days. We're pleased with the market reception of the Elanco IPO, and with Elanco's performance as a publically traded company. Jeff and his team are well prepared to take the next step, and Elanco employees are excited about their future. We're proud of what we've accomplished together, and we share their enthusiasm for Elanco's future. Moving to slides five and six, you'll see more detail on the key events since our November earnings call. Now, I'll turn the call over to Josh to review the Q4 results, and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2019. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Dave. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, while slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP adjusted measures to provide insights into the underlying trends in our business, so please refer to today's earnings press release for a detailed description of the year-on-year changes in our fourth quarter GAAP results. So, looking at non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you'll see the revenue increase of 5% that Dave mentioned earlier. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 50 basis points to 76.6%. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined about 25 basis points. Total operating expense increased 1%, with marketing, selling, and administrative expense increasing 3% driven primarily by increased expenses to support our newer product launches, including the U.S. launch of Emgality, while R&D expense declined 2%. Total operating expense as a percent of revenue compared to Q4 2017 declined by over 190 basis points, benefiting from previously announced actions taken to reduce the company's cost structure, partially offset by investments in new launches and our newest late-phase pipeline entries. Operating income increased 15% compared to Q4 2017, which put our operating margin at 25.1% for the quarter. And our operating margin excluding the effect of FX on the international inventory sold was 24.8% of revenue, an improvement of over 165 basis points versus last year's quarter. Other income and expense was expense of $4.8 million for this quarter, compared to income of $111.9 million in last year's quarter, driven by approximately $100 million less in gains on investments. This reduction was due primarily to a large gain on the sale of an equity investment in last year's quarter, and to a lesser extent mark-to-market reductions in strategic partnership or VC investments in public biotech companies in this year's quarter. Our tax rate was 15.8%, a decrease of 440 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of U.S. tax reform. So, at the bottom line, net income increased 13%, while earnings per share increased faster, at 17%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. Earnings per share also included a reduction of approximately $0.02 per share to reflect the non-controlling interest in Elanco. Consistent with our performance throughout the year, we achieved significant earnings growth this quarter by delivering mid single-digit revenue growth while carefully managing our operating expenses, leading to meaningful improvement in profitability versus last year. Slide 10 details these same non-GAAP measures for the full-year, where you can see the full-year impact of our strong top line growth and margin expansion as revenue grew 7% while operating expenses declined by 1%, which led to a 30% growth in non-GAAP EPS. Excluding the impact of FX on inventory sold, operating income as a percent of revenue for the full-year was 28.4%, an increase of 470 basis points compared to 2017. Moving to slide 11 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. And you'll find additional details on these adjustments on slides 25 and 26. Moving to slide 12, let's take a look at the effect of price, rate, and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange reduced growth by one percentage point. On a performance basis, worldwide revenue grew 6% driven by an 11% increase in volume partially offset by price. Q4 represented the second straight quarter our human pharma business delivered double-digit volume growth. U.S. pharma revenue increased 6%. Like last quarter, strong volume growth, which was 12%, led by Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, and Verzenio was partially offset by price. Excluding Cialis, volume grew nearly 21% in the U.S. highlighted by U.S. diabetes products delivering over 31% volume growth. While the U.S. pricing environment continues to evolve, our sustained success is driven by the execution of our volume-based growth strategy. U.S. price declined 6%, which was similar to Q3. Approximately three points of the U.S. price decline was driven by changes to estimates of rebates and discounts, and disproportionate volume growth in certain government segments for Trulicity. Roughly one point of the decline was driven by new access and corresponding volume for Basaglar Medicare Part D, which we didn't have in last year's quarter. We also had approximately two points of decline associated with increases in patient affordability and access programs for Taltz and Humalog, which also drove increased volumes. Looking forward to 2019, we remain comfortable with our projection of mid single-digit declines in U.S. price more than offset by increased volumes. Moving to Europe, pharma revenue grew 3% driven by volume, largely offset by the negative effect of price and foreign exchange. This volume growth was achieved despite the loss of exclusivity for Cialis. Excluding Cialis, volume grew over 16%. This robust volume growth was led by Olumiant, Trulicity, and Taltz. In Japan, pharma revenue was up 1%, with 9% volume growth largely offset by a drag of 8% from the impact of the biannual pricing cuts which too affect in Q1. Volume growth was driven by newer products led by Trulicity, Jardiance, and Olumiant, with a significant contribution also coming from Cymbalta. Our pharma revenue in the rest of the world increased 10% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth from our diabetes portfolio, namely Humalog, Trulicity, and Jardiance in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. Turning to Animal Health, worldwide revenue grew 6% on a performance basis this quarter, driven by higher volume, higher sales of companion animal disease prevention and future protein and health products was partially offset by lower sales of products that are being exited and to a lesser extent declines in products for ruminants and swine, and companion animal therapeutics. Slide 13 outlines the same information for our full-year results. Now let's take a look at the drivers of our 11% worldwide volume growth on slide 14. Once again, our newer products with the engine of our worldwide volume growth, these products grew 13.7 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, nearly identical to their contribution in Q3. Brands that have experienced loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 450 basis points, driven almost entirely by Cialis. You may recall the generic versions of Cialis entered the U.S. market at the end of September last year and as expected, we've seen a rapid erosion of sales. When excluding LOEs, the rest of our products posted Q4 volume growth of over 18%. Slide 15 provides a view of our newer product uptake. In total, these brands generated over $2.1 billion in revenue this quarter, representing 38% of our human pharmaceutical revenue. Our newer product growth demonstrates the successful execution of our commercial strategy. We're particularly excited about the launch of Emgality in the U.S. for the preventative treatment of migraine. While still early the NBRx share gains we've experienced to-date have been impressive. Combined with best-in-class U.S. payer access, we anticipate Emgality will be a meaningful growth driver going forward, demonstrating the promising future for our pain franchise. Moving to slide 16 and continuing with our non-GAAP explanations, this quarter the effective FX had a relatively minimal impact on our income statement with a small negative impact on revenue and a small positive impact on operating income and EPS. Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on slide 17, you will see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect an approximate $0.34 impact of the anticipated Loxo Oncology acquisition, which we assume closes this quarter. Additionally, approximately $0.17 negative impact of Lartruvo Phase 3 announced study results was offset by positive trends in our core business performance and an improved tax rate versus what we projected in December. This updated non-GAAP guidance by line item includes a decrease of $200 million on the top line, driven by the impact of Lartruvo, partially offset by the inclusion of Vitrakvi, and an improved sales outlook across other products based on Q4 momentum, an increase of $200 million for R&D expense due to the addition of the Loxo Oncology pipeline, and a decrease of $100 million for other income and expense to a range of between $175 million and $325 million of expense, which is driven by higher net interest expense due to the Loxo Oncology acquisition. As we stated during our Investor Call for the acquisition, the incremental interest expense reflects only a portion of the financing, as our 2019 guidance in December had already contemplated business development financing needs for roughly half the size of the transaction. A decrease in our effective tax rate from 16% to 15% driven by adjustments for U.S. tax reform, and this resulted in a decrease in our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.55 cents per share to $5.65 per share. I would note that the revised guidance continues to include a reduction of approximately $0.08 per share to reflect the non-controlling interest portion of Elanco profits for the full-year. The average of 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share estimates for analysts, who have updated their model since the Loxo Oncology and Lartruvo announcement is $5.55, and for those who haven't updated since our December meeting, the average estimates for those is $5.94. Touching briefly on our updated GAAP guidance, the 50 basis point increase in the effective tax rate is due to certain Loxo Oncology acquisition and integration expenses not being deductible for tax purposes. In addition, GAAP earnings per share for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of $4.57 per share to $4.67 per share. I'd note that currently the Euro is slightly weaker and the Yen and Renminbi are slightly stronger to what we assumed in our guidance in December, but in total, FX impacts are modest. We will monitor FX movements and incorporate changes as appropriate in our quarterly updates. Moving to slide 18, the numbers here should be helpful as you think about our business on a go-forward basis post the separation of Elanco. Our pharma-only expectations for 2019 first shared with you at our December Investment Community Meeting reflects mid-single digit revenue growth, relatively flat marketing, selling and administrative expenses, R&D growth to accommodate the Loxo Oncology acquisition and other Phase 3 investments, and operating income as a percent of revenue at approximately 28% or 27.5%, excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold. We will provide an EPS range once we've executed the Elanco exchange offer and know the number of Lilly shares retired. Although our updated full company EPS guidance is lower than our December guidance due to the Loxo Oncology acquisition, we still expect strong full-year performance led by volume gains and our newer products. We remain committed to our innovation-based strategy and are making substantial investments in 2019 to bring forward our next generation of new products. And I'd also note that despite the incremental costs associated with the Loxo Oncology pipeline and unexpected Lartruvo impact, we're committed to and confident in achieving our 2020 sales and operating margin goals. As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize funding for existing marketed products, new launches, and lifecycle opportunities in addition to replenishing our pipeline. We will also continue to leverage business development to upgrade our pipeline and future growth prospects, and finally, we'll return excess cash to shareholders via increases to the dividend and share buybacks. Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave to review the pipeline and key future events. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Josh. Slide 19 shows select pipeline opportunities as of February 1, in addition to the pending addition of Loxo assets movement since our last earnings calls include the U.S. submission of Emgality for episodic cluster headache, the start of Phase 3 for teriparatide and Type 2 diabetes, the start of Phase 2 for a once-weekly basal insulin, and automated insulin delivery system, which is part of our connected care efforts that Dan highlighted at our December Investment Community Meeting, and a new indication for Verzenio in prostate cancer, the initiation of Phase 1 testing for eight biologic entities across our therapeutic areas, and the attrition of three early-stage molecules. On slide 20, we provide a final tally on the key events we expected for 2018. As we reviewed in detail at our December Investment Community Meeting, 2018 was a strong year for progress in our pipeline, and in execution of our innovation-based strategy. And while we experience the setback on Lartruvo in January, we enter 2019 with great momentum. Slide 21 shows the early progress we've made on key events, and we're monitoring for 2019. These include the initiation of a Phase 3 study of empagliflozin in a chronic kidney disease, results from a Phase 3 study of tanezumab in osteoarthritis pain, results from two Phase 3 studies for baricitinib atopic dermatitis, and the previously-announced and discussed Lartruvo study. Now, let me briefly some of the progress we've made in the past 12 months and our priorities moving forward. In 2018, we delivered strong volume-based revenue growth of 7% driven entirely by our new products, which accounted in the calendar year for 34% of pharma revenue. We continued our strong operating performance, and our margin expansion of over 470 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. We've seen excellent progress in our pipeline with our internal and external innovation investments yielding multiple approvals, submissions, and positive Phase 3 readouts, along with several significant first-in-class additions to our late-stage pipeline. We completed a review of the strategic alternatives for Elanco. Through a well-received initial public offering, Elanco Animal Health became a publicly-traded company. Elanco raised over $4 billion through the IPO and debt offering. The vast majority of which was provided to Lilly as consideration for the businesses Lilly transferred to Elanco in connection with the IPO. We also returned approximately $6.5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase, announced the pending acquisition of Loxo Oncology, and bolstered our early phase pipeline and preclinical platforms with numerous business development deals. Moving into 2019, we remain focused on launching with excellence and continuing to replenish our pipeline. Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the latest news regarding potential U.S. Healthcare System Reform. The proposed rule that would eliminate the Safe Harbor protections for rebates within the Medicare and Managed Medicaid segments will represent meaningful change to the system. While it's still a proposal, we see this as potentially accomplishing the following. First, this could be a win for patients, lowering their out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter with the greatest benefit realized by patients taking more highly rebated products, such as insulin. Second, for innovative products and companies the rule will shift the focus to demonstrating the value of our medicines and partnering with health insurers and systems to improve quality, outcomes, and lowering overall medical costs. Patients should directly benefit from price reductions and concessions in federal and commercial plans. Unfortunately, as you know, this rarely occurs today. Finally, this change could remove an artificial barrier to competition, creating space for innovation that addresses unmet needs for patients. We continue to support making medicines more affordable and accessible to patients. Too often the sick are subsidizing the well in our current system. And this appears to be a positive tool to address this issue. We are for improvements to the U.S. healthcare system like this which appropriately balance patient affordability, market-based principles, and reward innovation. While I know you likely have many questions on this, I'm sure we'll continue to talk about this as more details emerge about the rule. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over the Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with two parts. John, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] First, we'll go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for the question. So, just really quickly two -- both on pipeline products, can you guys give us a quick sense of the expectations for how tanezumab, a REMS program might be implemented, and what that might look like in terms of its impact on the launch of that product. And then the second question is, just relative to the data that we got recently, or at least the headline announcement for atopic dermatitis with baricitinib, can you just give us a general sense of how you see those data competing in the market versus the existing product Dupixent? Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Okay, thanks, Seamus. We'll go with Dan for the expectations for the tanezumab REMS program. Christi, if you want to weigh in on the potential commercial impact. And then to Christi for bari -- atopic dermatitis. Dan Skovronsky : Yes, thanks for the question on tanezumab. On course we're excited to, along with our partner Pfizer, announce the data on the latest Phase 3 trial. We still don't have the full data package, of course, on this molecule on OA. As we said before, though, we're very confident in the efficacy. We continue to see that replicate. And that's encouraging, the risk obviously we've been looking at is rapidly progressive osteoarthritis, RPOA. And the data that we continue to get, I think, is a very encouraging picture. This molecule, I think if you take the context of the vast unmet medical need for chronic pain and the deficiencies with the existing therapies that are available, including opioids and NSAIDs, I think really this offers a compelling benefit. So, we have to wait and see what the next trials read out, particularly the long-term safety study. But if we can continue with the pattern of results that we've seen so far, I think we have great reason to be encouraged. With respect to your specific question about post-approval REMS and things like that; I would just say it's premature to discuss that. Let's get the full data package and then move forward with the FDA. Christi Shaw : And to what Dan's talking about, if you look at the commercial opportunity, the number of patients that are suffering from osteoarthritis is 27 million. And if you just look at the patients that are similar to what we enrolled in the study, 11 million of those patients are very similar, which has been on at least three different classes of analgesics. They have been -- it's been over six years, they change medications multiple times, so the unmet need even in the most severe market is extremely high. So, as we look at the safety and REMS, et cetera, that high unmet need and the opportunity is still huge in most severe patients. Turning to atopic dermatitis, yes, we reported out positive results in terms of our atopic dermatitis meeting our primary endpoints. Recall, this is two of five studies, so we have three more readouts this year. That combination of studies will then support a global package. Just to give you a little bit about the atopic dermatitis market, as you may or may not know, 54 million patients suffer from atopic dermatitis, 18 million of those moderate to severe. And if you talk to thought leaders, whether it's one-on-one or from the podium, they see this market like the psoriasis market was 15 years ago, and to be able to come to market with the very first oral is our goal, as these patients suffer and need new therapies. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Christi. John, next caller? Operator : And that will be from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have two questions. Were the baricitinib trials in atopic dermatitis only positive in the four milligram arm or was statistical significance achieved on the one and two milligram cohorts as well? And then the second question is the impact on 2019 P&L of the Lartruvo failure was not small. I appreciate there were reasons for this. But as we look to critical 2019 readouts, what can you tell us about their contribution to guidance. I am specifically thinking about the LOXO-292 LIBRETTO trial, the tanezumab safety trial, Trulicity AWARD-11, and Verzenio MONARCH plus trial. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Christi, we'll have you answer the question on baricitinib, and then go to Josh for the guidance question. Thanks, Steve. Christi Shaw : Yes, so as you look at the trial, it included three doses, one milligram, two milligram, and four milligram. One milligram did not meet the primary endpoints, but two milligram and four milligram did meet the primary endpoints. As you look at the pain and the global assessment scores, the three primary endpoints, four milligrams did meet all of those. And two milligrams met two of the three. So, as we look at those we know in the atopic dermatitis the four milligrams is an effective dose and will be something that as we look at the total package we'll be submitting to FDA for approval. Josh Smiley : Hi, Steve, it's Josh. On the guidance, I'd first say that for all of the R&D pipeline, as you mentioned, our R&D range funds and contemplates success in those categories. Obviously, with the Loxo addition, 292 is the primary driver of the $200 million R&D expansion in our line item guidance. In terms of the top line, we look at all the opportunities and potential sales impacts and probabilize those, so they're contemplated in our range. Although I would say most of the things that you mentioned really will have more of an impact in 2020 to the extent that they're positive. As I mentioned in the upfront comments, even with the impact of Lartruvo coming out, we're confident in achieving our sales goal for 2020, which would be the 7% compound annual growth rate for the pharma business between 2015 and 2020. To achieve that based on the guidance we're giving for 2019 that assumes a minimum growth of about 6%. And that's not dependant on any individual product launch or R&D readout at this point. We're confident with the number of launches that we're in the midst of now and the clinical data that are still accruing, we're confident that we can hit that number in 2020. Kevin Hern : Thank you. John, next caller? Operator : We'll go to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. My first one was on your expectation for mid single-digit decline in U.S. price. I was just wondering can you give us some more granularity like you did in the 4Q about the drivers of that assumption. I guess I'm really trying to get here is, should we be thinking about a similar dynamic, like we saw in the 4Q where it's channel mix and patient affordability initiatives that are the primary drivers of price decline, or this is more about greater rebates and contracting pressures driving that erosion? My second question was just about the operating margin targets as we think out to the 2020 on pharma. I think you're looking at about a 200 basis point impact versus prior guidance on pharma for '19. So, can you just elaborate some of the dynamics as we think out to 2020, and what we should be thinking about for the pharma business there? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Great. Thank you, Chris. We'll go to Josh for both those questions. Josh Smiley : Yes, Chris, first on the price decline for 2020 -- I mean for 2019. So, one thing that we have that is new in 2019 is the Medicare donut hole expansion, the move from 50% to 70%, and that's got about a $200 million impact or close to two points of the mid single-digit decline will have. So that's a new item in 2019. Otherwise, we are seeing generally the same thing. We're seeing an increase in our patient affordability efforts. These are around Humalog; they're around new launches like Trulicity and Emgality. We're very confident that those kinds of impacts are positive in the long-run they lead to volume gains; over time we're seeing that certainly in Taltz right now. So, we do expect a few points of drag there. And then I think the rest is mostly going to be either mix or small unit declines but nothing that -- they're all sort of related to maintaining or improving access. We obviously are always looking at diabetes as a big segment, and one that faces a lot of competition, but we're very happy with the access that we have going into 2019, and I don't think you'll see any big new headwinds from a pricing perspective. As it relates to the operating margin targets for 2020, yes, I think if you look at where -- or the guidance we have for 2019, I think sort is about -- probably about 27% at the midpoint ranges. Remember our guidance for 2020 now is to, when you take out Elanco, is to get to 31%. Elanco, when we take it out, gives us about a point or so of benefit. So, well yes, we're looking at about 300 basis points improvement versus our midpoint range this year to 2020. We think that's very achievable. If you look at in 2018, we improved operating margin by about 450 basis points. We got there through mid to high single digits top line growth and relatively flat expenses. As I mentioned, we would, to achieve our minimum revenue growth, we'd need about 6% growth in 2020, which we feel good about. So, mid single-digit top line growth with good control on the expenses gives us I think a very good -- just mathematically gets us there. So we're comfortable with the ability to achieve that minimum. Kevin Hern : Thank you. John, next caller. Operator : And that'll be Jason Gerberry with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning everyone. This is Chi [ph] on for Jason. Thanks for taking our questions. I have one on pricing and one on Emgality. First one, can you just give a little bit color on how you think about the impact of [indiscernible] exclusive contracting, specifically on products with high gross-to-net [indiscernible]. Just curious, does the company see an end to exclusive contracting [indiscernible] take them broadly away or does that [indiscernible] win the exclusive contract? Second, on Emgality, curious to know how you think about the [indiscernible] for the progression of Emgality over 2019, is Lilly focused on primary care, so [indiscernible] might be lagging competitors in this space given [indiscernible] are early adopters? And if you can quickly comment on the Emgality paid prescription [indiscernible] right now, that would be great. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Okay, thank you. We'll go to Enrique for the question on Part D rebates, and then Christi for Emgality. Enrique Conterno : Yes, I'm not sure that I understood the full question, but at this point in time I think as we look at the status quo, we basically see the continued trend when it comes to exclusive contracting. As we all know, mealtime insulin is already contracted that way. And we basically trends where most payers are trying to restrict utilization, maybe have fewer products and extract rebates on concessions clearly, right now there's some uncertainty when it comes to the new proposed rule. And we really need to see how that is going to play out. I won't be able to speculate at this time. Christi Shaw : Yes, and on Emgality, we're so excited with the number of patients that are being helped by the CGRP agents. We expect probably six million patients to be eligible. If you look at Emgality specifically in your questions, we launched in October, obviously so we just have a couple of months of data. But right now what we're seeing is similar, that our paid prescriptions are at about 50%. The marketplace splits up, that about a third of the prescriptions come from primary care, a third come from neurologists, and a third come from midlevel. So this very much will be an expansion into primary care beyond the neurologists as well. So specifically looking at Emgality's performance, we ended the year, even though we launched late at a 20% NBRx. And we're currently looking at 26% already in January. So, as you look at these launches, we just launched our direct-to-consumer TV ad campaign this week. We know that Lilly has very strong consumer activation relative to our competitors. We know that we have a drug that has not just demonstrated 50% improvement, but 75% and a 100% reduction in monthly headaches that our competitors don't have, as well as quality of life. And we have the unique platform and device that Trulicity uses that we know over a million patients really like. So, we're very bullish on both the market and on Emgality's ability to compete. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Christi. John, next caller please? Operator : That will be Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question here is how long do you think it will take for Trulicity sales to benefit from your Rewind presentation at ADA, and what type of uptick you think we should see after that? And then secondly, on the market opportunity for lasmiditan, just curious how you think about it now in light of the injectable CGRPs being approved and the potential for oral CGRPs to come to the market? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thank you. So, Enrique will take Trulicity, and then Christi will handle the question on lasmiditan. Enrique Conterno : Clearly Trulicity is on a present outstanding run right now and benefiting from a huge growth of the GLP-1 market. If anything, we are seeing the GLP-1 market accelerate from already very high levels, growing at nearly 30% on a year-on-year basis. And importantly, in those markets Trulicity has continued to perform well, and we've been able to gain share, in fact over five share points since the launch of Ozempic. Now, as we look at Rewind, clearly we see that this as a critical trial and dataset that's going to benefit patients. The big impact is when we basically start promotion of this important data. And I think it basically solidifies, I think, the bright future that Trulicity already had. We expect that impact, of course, some time in the 2020 once we get the FDA action on the new label. Christi Shaw : Yes, and then on lasmiditan and how it will play in the marketplace, where we will have some regulatory action this year. So, we're looking forward to that. If you look at the marketplace, kind of how we look at is with the 36 million patients who suffer from migraine there's about 16 million of those that are diagnosed, and 6 million that suffer from acute migraines and are taking therapy. And that is overlapping only somewhat with the prevention market. So, as you look at prevention CGRPs versus acute use, there's obviously a huge need for both distinctly. And CGRPs also obviously don't clear a 100% of all patients of their migraine. So we see the use obviously may overlap there. And we think lasmi [ph] has a really great positioning versus the oral CGRPs. If you're taking a preventative CGRP you may want to look at the different mechanism if you have to add to that. And then if we look at the acute marketplace, so many patients have fallen out of the market because of lack of efficacy or they cant tolerate the safety, so lasmiditan will be a great option for them. Kevin Hern : Thank you. John, next caller, please. Operator : That will be from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei : Great. Good morning and thank you. Verzenio was notably below our expectations. You mentioned buying patterns in the U.S. impacted this. Could you please quantify the inventory impact and your latest long-term expectations for this product given the apparent slowdown in the CDK4/6 market? And just a follow-up, a bigger picture question on your operating margin. I'm just trying to look past 2020 here. Historically you've invested more on internal innovation as opposed to external innovation, and with that higher R&D your operating margin was relatively lower to your peers. Now that you seem to have a more balanced approach with increased contribution from acquisitions, as your top line grows in the mid single digits is it reasonable to expect that Lilly can get to mid 30s operating margin? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Okay, thank you. We'll go to Anne for the question on Verzenio, and then Dave will take the question on operating margin post 2020. Anne White : Thanks, Alex, for the question. So, we saw about $4 million in inventory impact in 2018. And as you mentioned, we are seeing flattening in the CDK4/6 market as penetration has occurred. With Verzenio our focus is clearly on execution, to drive new Verzenio -- new trial of Verzenio and increasing our share of market. On a positive note, we're encouraged that we're seeing a high conversion rates with over 50% of physicians who trial Verzenio moving on to write additional prescriptions. We're also really looking forward to the launches outside the U.S. So we've launched in Japan, and in several countries in Europe, and the uptake has been strong as well, in particular what we're seeing is good uptake in patients with a poor prognosis. And so that will be patients with visceral disease or liver metastases who are also driving execution in there. So we have a hope for continued growth for Verzenio as we really focus on a strong year of execution across the globe. Dave Ricks : Yes, and as it relates to sort of margins and long-term R&D strategy, it's a good question. I know there's a lot of appetite for us to nail down some long-term target number. We're not going to do that, because I think really at the core of this is a question, \"What are our opportunities,\" which we don't have full visibility to be on 2020, but let me just tell you how we think about this. We see a period ahead of prolonged revenue growth for the company, because we have a relatively new line-up of products that should continue to grow. We're adding to that even this year, and next with additional launches. We do see ourselves balancing R&D spending both in balance sheet, M&A as well as partnerships, and continue to expand it, I would say, toward the top of the industry on internal income statement-based R&D, because we see good opportunities today, but that is not a fixed line item, it's based on what we see in front of us and the opportunity to create value for shareholders and patients with innovation. I would expect long-term to continue to see as we grow top line, a better gross margins and better SG&A as a percent of sales, so those will be helpful long-term to that to continue an expansion, R&D will be more a function of our choice making on growth drivers for the future. And it's hard to speculate on which direction that would go. We would hope actually to be able to spend more because that would mean the science is promising and we see opportunities to grow the value of the company and improve therapies for patients. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. John, next caller, please? Operator : We'll go to Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I just had a few, Enrique, you saw some good sequential trends for Jardiance in 3Q as well as 4Q, so the question is what do you attribute that to and should the demand backdrop continue into 2019? I know most investors were initially expecting more of an inflection after [indiscernible], it hasn't happened yet, but I received signs of that happening now. And then, just bigger picture for Josh on the back of the Loxo deal, obviously you guys have broadened -- even more broaden your oncology presence, so from maybe a capacity or from a priority standpoint, where do you see BD fitting in, is there a therapeutic category that you feel like you maybe need a little bit more help them? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Very good. As we look at 2019, I'm particularly bullish when it comes to Jardiance, because we have a number of inflection points that I think are playing us strong tailwinds for the success of the product. As you know, we have new updated ADA and EASD guidelines I think that place emphasis on SGLT2s, but in particular, preference for Jardiance within that class. Clearly, we have the re-inclusion of Jardiance and the CVS formularies, and that's pretty significant in that. Now, Jardiance has basically 90-plus access across commercial, and part of the -- it is likely that we are seeing as we look at some of the data, when we look at market data, it is likely that we are seeing some spillover effect of that re-inclusion even beyond some of the formulary itself. Jardiance now, it's basically running around in the low to mid-60s, when it comes to NBRx share, and we're actually seeing the SGLT2 class accelerator now basically showing growth in double-digits. I think all of that I think is very encouraging. And finally, given the profile that we basically have the increased investment in terms of our competitors, we see that also as beneficial to the product. So very bullish in terms of how I see these overall class accelerating, and more importantly, Jardiance basically capitalizing as the share leader. Josh Smiley : Hi, Geoff. Thanks for the question. I think as it relates to business development capacity and interest, first, I'd go back to Dave's earlier comments about how we think about the future, we see a period of good growth in front of us, and that good sales growth and operating income growth translates to strong cash flow generation. So I think in terms of capacity, we feel like we've got very good capacity going forward. So really from a business development perspective we're going to be mostly constrained by the opportunities that we see. We're not particularly tilted towards one therapeutic area. It's really the therapeutic areas that we're invested in today when we see good assets where we like the science can enhance the portfolio and can create value for shareholders with the acquisition. We'll pursue those and we'll pursue them aggressively. I think just given where investment and the progression of opportunities and sciences, you'd have to expect that we will continue to be looking in oncology and immunology are two areas where there's just a lot of opportunity, but all of our therapeutic areas are open for us and when we can find the best assets, really, we've got the balance sheet and cash flow capacity to act. Kevin Hern : Thank you. John, next caller, please? Operator : That will be David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. First, could you please discuss the forthcoming Loxo 292 readouts to watch and if possible it would be helpful if you could characterize what percentage of patients could be candidates in each tumor type. Second with respect to Novo's oral semaglutide, I think, the expectation is that it will be priced lower as an oral, could you discuss potential implications for the GLP1 market including Trulicity? And then I just have one little nit question, which is for Tradjenta, the CAROLINA study versus sulfonylurea completed six months ago in August, when should we expect the top line, thank you? Kevin Hern : Okay, thank you. We'll go to Anne for Loxo and then Enrique will take the final two questions. Anne White : Yes, so for Loxo 292, you can expect to see an additional readout at a scientific meeting in the second half of 2019, so we'll be looking forward to that. The study, the LIBRETTO is enrolling very well. It has over 300 patients in it now. And so there will be robust data reported at the end of this year. Importantly, as we saw -- as some of the data that was reported last year at some of the various meetings such as World Long [ph], we saw response rates between 60% and 80% depending on the tumor type and then seeing patients stay on therapy 90% or higher, staying on that therapy. So we remain very excited and encouraged by the 292 data. We think it's transformative for patients with RET fusions or mutation. And so you will continue to hear more from that. On the actual incidence rates, what we know as far as conversations with thought leaders and also Vivian literature is that with RET fusions in lung cancer it happens in about 2% to 3% of lung cancers and so as you know that's a substantial market and so that's one of the largest growth opportunities that could be over 3,000 patients in the U.S. In papillary RET fusions it's about 10% to 20%, a smaller population, but again a very strong response rate in those patients. And then in a tumor such as medullary thyroid which has activating RET point mutations, that actually happens to about 60% of those patients that they see that RET mutation. And so again that could be an additional 500 patients in the U.S. alone. And then you start to include the global numbers. So while the incidence rates are not high, the response rates are really remarkable and so we do believe that we'll see strong penetration, and also a long durability of response, so again, very excited about looking forward to those readouts. Enrique Conterno : Very good. David, thank you for the question on oral sema. There is a question for Novo Nordisk. Unfortunately I'm unable to really speculate on how they're going to price the product and some of the implications. As far as Tradjenta and CAROLINA, we expect to release the top results this quarter, the top line results. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Enrique. Next caller, please? Operator : We'll go to Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Hi, great, thanks for taking my questions. So first on Olumiant just following up on the other questions, I know the four milligram dose may be coming, but at least for now the two milligram dose in the U.S., how should we think about the uptake potential, I guess, say for this year, maybe early next year, pretty limited sales in the fourth quarter at least just trying to get a view on the dynamics there. And for Emgality, appreciate some of the comments you made there around the dynamic, but just curious how you're seeing the discount, you know, the net pricing evolve for that market with three players in this space. Looks like you guys have done pretty well in terms of gaining access based on the announcement, but any longer-term insights would be helpful, thanks. Christi Shaw : Sure. Thanks, Vamil for the question. So I guess, I'll take both of those\u2026 Kevin Hern : Sure. Christi Shaw : -- I'm sorry, Kevin, I kind of just fitted in there in front of you, so on Olumiant what we see across the globe is really strong uptake, especially with our clinical experience that the patients are having fast pain relief and what we see with the two versus the four is very similar from an efficacy standpoint. The AACR 20, it's about 1% less on the two versus the four milligram and AACR 70, it's about 4% less. So in the U.S. those physicians who have tried it and the patients' feedback has been extremely positive. Obviously, in the U.S., our indication places us post TNS. At a 60% discount to the market leader, our access hasn't been an issue and we think this will be a continued growth product in that smaller market that we're playing in right now. We obviously continue to look at the four milligram across multiple indications as I talked about earlier with atopic dermatitis, lupus. Obviously, the discussion is ongoing in Rheumatoid Arthritis et cetera so. We're still very confident in that dose and the benefit risk profile of that. As I move on to Emgality then thanks for asking about the discounting and the net pricing, because I forgot to mention we are very excited to know that starting February 1st, we will have best-in-class access in 2019 versus the other CGRPs. We are on all three major PBMs. There has been only one regional player, small regional player that has not put us -- that has disadvantaged us to get a CGRP. So we have wide-open access and relative to our competitors, better access. I can't really comment on the discounting piece. I can tell, you know, what we're seeing as the market plays out is the sampling happens in the physician's office. We started right away in the physician office sampling, and in retail. So what you see in our NBRx rates is actually no samples in there -- pure play, only the co-pay piece of it. And what you see with the market dynamics as well, getting a lot of questions on is the market flat. We think the market continues to grow, huge opportunity, up to six million patients. A with the market dynamics of our competitors changing from specialty mail order into retail has kind of made that market chart look a little bit flat versus what we actually think the underlying demand is. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Christi. Next caller please? Operator : We'll go to Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Vineeth Agrawal : Hi, this is Vineeth Agrawal for Andrew Baum at Citi. Two questions, please. First one is while the HHS net pricing proposal might reduce near-term political pressure and drug price affordability, how concerned are you that it will ultimately spill into the much more profitable commercial plans with material negative pricing implications for you? Secondly, do you think a second NDC brand strategy for Medicare formularies is commercially viable or does it materially increase risk of fraud at independent pharmacies? Thank you. Kevin Hern : So we'll go to Dave for the initial question on the pricing pressure and what we're seeing in the government and then the potential spillover to the managed care. And then we might need to come back for clarification on the second question. Dave Ricks : Yes, I'm not sure I got all the details of your question. But I guess, I'll just caveat this answer by saying it's difficult to speculate right now, of course, it seems like nearly every week, we see some new proposed regulatory rule or introduction of some idea on the Hill as it relates U.S. drug pricing. I'll give you our long-term outlook, which is as an innovative-based company, we're of course very excited about the underlying science in this industry, and what it can do. The products we've been speaking about today are good examples of that. And I think an innovation-based strategy is the way to overcome whatever the pricing pressures are out there. So we like where we sit. We're in a period of strong growth and we've got innovation flowing now as well as recently launched that gives us strong base going forward. We'll adapt to whatever rules come out and how they get finalized. No doubt, I would say it's fair to say the administration is focused on both government formularies as well as spillover into commercial markets. We think it's fine. It's probably difficult to run two systems side-by-side and their top priority is actually our top priority, which is lowering out-of-pocket costs for patients at the pharmacy counter. So things like in the new rebate rule, this ability to pass through savings [indiscernible] even as early as this year into Part D plan, participants, that's a great idea. And I think that's highly consistent with the policy positions we've taken before. We'll have to see how the dynamics evolve, but Lilly has got a very strong capacity and capability in managed markets and in working with fair customers. That will serve us well as we navigate this period of change and you know, I'm confident based on innovation we'll emerge successful. Kevin Hern : Could you please repeat the second question and -- so we can try to answer that for you? We didn't pick it up in the room. Vineeth Agrawal : So, do you think the second NDC brand strategy for the Medicare formularies is commercially viable or does it materially increase the risk of fraud at independent pharmacies in the sense that the pharmacies dispense the lower-priced drug, but bill for the higher-priced drugs? Enrique Conterno : Maybe I'll try to provide an answer to that question. This is Enrique. We do review all options available to us including potentially having a second brand. There are a number of reasons where a second brand could be viable and it really depends on the specific situation for the product. So that's something that we always study very carefully. But I'm not prepared to comment on that at this time. Kevin Hern : Thank you. Next caller, please? Operator : We'll go to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, sorry. Thanks so much for taking my question. First, I noticed in some of the deal documents that came out on the Loxo deal, there was the sale estimate from Loxo management of sub $40 million for 2020, can you comment on that and maybe just give us a little more specific metrics on what extent of testing is already happening, and how you see that changing let's say by year end 2019? Thank you very much. Kevin Hern : Okay, thanks. We'll have Anne take those questions. Anne White : Going forward, sales forecast, we don't comment on those specifically and so we won't comment on that -- the details of forecasted sales. This is obviously the launch year for -- if I track the info, I think it's too soon to comment. I believe, Bayer would say that the things are off to a good start, but again we'll have to see the full-year performance before we can comment on future performance. . : So, in our launch strategy, it's very much about the partnership at the laboratories, the pathologists to make sure that they understand the value of testing and I know that Bayer and Loxo agree with this as well. So we believe that good medicines will drive change in practice. And so we definitely are bringing forward good medicines. We look forward to helping change the face of medicine, particularly in precision medicine, which is a very high value driver with the fact that with these very strong response rates, the efficiency of the healthcare system is significant; small numbers of patients, high response rate. So very efficient use of health care dollars, so we believe we can change that dynamic pretty rapidly. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Anne. Next caller, please? Operator : And we'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. Christi, may I clarify your comment on the baricitinib atopic dermatitis data, there is only one primary endpoint in the trial, that's Investigator global assessment, is that the one that the two milligram missed? Secondly, MONARCH Her and MONARCH plus are not listed in the key 2019 event, but both were expected, can you clarify? And then lastly for Enrique, I hate to split hairs, but on the Q3 call you referred to REWIND as paradigm changing on several occasions. You did not say that today, what has changed in the last three months? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Christi for the first one on bari, then Anne for the MONARCH readout, and then Enrique finally to close out on REWIND. Christi. Christi Shaw : Yes. So on the data primary endpoint, and then we had multiple secondary endpoints, and we're going to be sharing that data at a future scientific meeting, especially as we gain more knowledge with the next three studies that we'll readout this year. There were multiple -- we had -- global assessment is the primary endpoint, then we had multiple secondary endpoints to that, actually eight of them. And so, as we know the four-milligram met all of the primary endpoints as I said, the two-milligram missed on some of the secondary endpoints. So I appreciate you allowing me to clarify that answer. Kevin Hern : Anne? Anne White : Yes, on the MONARCH Her study, we do expect the readouts to be in the first-half of this year. It is a Phase 2 study, so that's [indiscernible] we wouldn't know necessarily on those listings, but we do look forward to that readout and look forward to the next stages of that, so, whether we move forward to a Phase 3 study depending on the verboseness of the data. So you'll see that readout in the first-half of this year. Kevin Hern : Thank you. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : My enthusiasm for REWIND and Trulicity have not changed at all, if anything, we are even more bullish today than we were maybe a couple of months back. Steve Scala : Thank you. Kevin Hern : Next caller please? Operator : And Mr. Hern, there are no further questions in queue. Kevin Hern : Okay, great. Thank you. We will go to Dave for the close. Dave Ricks : Great. Thank you, Kevin, and we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in the company. We demonstrated again in 2018 clear progress toward our revenue and profitability goals for 2020. The company is executing well. We continue to advance our innovation-based strategy through progressing internally discovered medicines augmented with business development transactions, highlighted by our recently-announced acquisition of Loxo Oncology. With a robust pipeline and volume-driven revenue growth, Lilly continues to be a compelling investment as we move into 2019. Thanks again for dialing in today. Please follow-up with our Investor Relations team if you have any additional questions we didn't address on the call, and hope you have a great day. Thank you.

Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during the first quarters of both 2018 and 2019, and present earnings per share as though the full disposition of the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018. We believe this view provides insights into the drivers of our underlying business performance as a dedicated pharmaceutical company and provides for cleaner comparisons to future and prior periods. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our progress in Q1. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. The Company\u2019s focus in 2019 is to execute on a broad and exciting range of new products and indication launches, to build and accelerate our pipeline, and continue to improve the focus and competitiveness of our company. We are pleased with the progress on these objectives in Q1 2019. First quarter revenue grew 5% in constant currency, despite a significant decline in U.S. Cialis revenue due to the recent loss of exclusivity. We made significant investments in key commercial and late-stage pipeline products and delivered non-GAAP EPS of 2% putting us on track to meet our full year financial guidance. Our key growth products, which all launched since 2014 contributed meaningfully to our performance and account for 39% of our revenue. While still relatively early in their product life cycles, these products continue to drive growth led by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, and in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, Jardiance and Basaglar. Total volume growth across the entire portfolio was 7% and excluding Cialis was nearly 13%. U.S. diabetes contributed strong volume growth of nearly 17%. Oncology growth accelerated in the U.S., Japan and China. And our international markets grew volume by 9%, as global launches of key brands continue across our major geographies. Excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold, Q1 non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue decreased by nearly 600 basis points versus Q1 2018, reflecting a decrease in gross margin and investment in recent launches and multiple late-stage pipeline opportunities. On the same basis, operating income as a percent of revenue in Q1 increased by nearly 80 basis points versus Q4 2018, reflecting progress toward our 2019 full year margin goal of 28%. We exited Q1 on track with our plans for the full year. We have invested in our future growth, while delivering strong volume growth across the business. Importantly, several pipeline assets achieved milestones this quarter, including the regulatory submission for the Trulicity REWIND study for CV outcomes label in the U.S. and in Europe. The FDA granted priority review for Emgality for cluster headache in the U.S. The submission of Ultra Rapid Lispro for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in both Europe and Japan. The U.S. submission of our first connected device, our connected care prefilled insulin pen. And we had several Phase 3 data readouts. We also announced an updated timeline for expected regulatory action timing for nasal glucagon. We received notification. The FDA has extended the review timeline by up to three months to analyze information requested late in that review cycle. We remain confident in nasal glucagon submission package and look forward to FDA action in the coming months. In terms of capital deployment, we continue to utilize our strong operating cash flow to access value creating external innovation, which will enhance our future growth prospects. We completed the acquisition of Loxo Oncology and in key pipeline assets and expanding our presence into precision medicine. We completed the full separation of Elanco Animal Health via an exchange offer, retiring 65 million Lilly shares with approximately $8.2 billion. We entered into a global licensing and research collaboration with ImmuNext, focused on new medicines for autoimmune disease. We announced a global licensing and research collaboration with Avidity, focused on potential new medicines in immunology and select other indications. We announced an agreement to sell the rights in China for two legacy Lilly antibiotic medicines, as well as a manufacturing facility to Eddingpharm, a Chinese-based specialty pharmaceutical company. And we returned an additional $3.5 billion to shareholders via a previously announced accelerated share repurchase program and $600 million in dividends, representing a 15% increase per share versus 2018. Moving on to slides five and six, you will see more details on key events since our February earnings call, including our announcement to introduce Insulin Lispro a low priced version of Humalog in the U.S. Now, I will turn the call over to Josh to review our Q1 results and to provide an update on our post Elanco financial guidance. Josh Smiley : Thanks Dave. Slide seven summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures and slide eight provides a summary of our GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide nine, you will see revenue increased 30%. Excluding the impact of FX on international inventories sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 80.2%, in line with our long-term goals for manufacturing efficiency and profitability. On the same basis, gross margin declined 130 basis points compared to Q1 2018, driven by production timing and lower volumes from post patent products. Total operating expense increased 12%, with marketing selling and administrative expense, increasing 13%, driven primarily by increased investment to support our recent launches, including DTC campaign campaigns to drive awareness from Emgality, Verzenio and Taltz. R&D expense increased 11%, reflecting the ramp up of multiple late-stage pipeline assets, the addition of the Loxo Oncology portfolio and the insight communicating to us that they would no longer co-fund the development of baricitinib, which reduces the royalty we will pay them moving forward. As a result of the investments described above, operating income decreased 8% compared to Q1 2018, which put our operating income as a percent of sales at 26.2% for the quarter. As our recent launches continue to drive revenue and operating leverage, we expect income growth and improvements in operating margin during the remainder of 2019. Other income and expense was income of $86 million this quarter compared to income of $70 million in Q1 2018, driven by over $100 million in gains of mark-to-market of public equities held through venture capital investments and strategic partnerships, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was 12.9%, a decrease of 260 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by timing associated with the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. At the bottomline, net income declined 4%, while earnings per share increased 2%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. Recall that our non-GAAP comparisons remove the 65 million shares retired through the Elanco exchange for both 2018 and 2019. While income declined this quarter versus Q1 2018 we made important progress on several fronts that will drive future growth, as demonstrated by growing revenue despite significant headwinds from the loss of exclusivity of Cialis in the U.S., investing behind key growth brands, such as Emgality, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and Trulicity, and advancing several pipeline assets to the next phase of development, including multiple regulatory submissions. Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you will find additional details on these adjustments on slide 23. Moving to slide 11, let\u2019s take a look at the effective price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 2 percentage points. As Dave mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 5% on a performance basis, driven by a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by price, Q1 is the ninth straight quarter our business grew volume in each major geography. U.S. revenue increased 3%. Like last quarter Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Basaglar were the key drivers of 6% volume growth, partially offset by price. Excluding Cialis, volume grew nearly 15% in the U.S., highlighted by diabetes products delivering nearly 17% volume growth. Consistent with our 2019 financial guidance U.S. price declined 3%, driven by increased utilization of patient affordability programs, mainly for insulins and Taltaz, adjustments through estimates for rebates and discounts at higher contracted rates, primarily related to Trulicity, which were partially offset by favorable segment mix across the portfolio. Moving to Europe, strong volume growth of 9% was largely offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and to a lesser extent price. Volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant and Taltz. In Japan, strong volume growth of 7%, driven by Cymbalta, Verzenio and Trulicity, was largely offset by a drag of 6% from price, as a result of the government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2018. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 9% on a performance basis this quarter, led by volume growth from Humalog, Trulicity, Cialis, Jardiance and the recently launched Tyvyt, a China-only anti-PD1 immunotherapy agent in collaboration with Innovent Biologics. As shown on slide 12, our key growth drivers were once again the engine of our worldwide volume growth. These products drove 14.8 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, an increase of over 100 basis points versus their contribution to growth in Q4 2018. Brands that have experience loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 530 basis points, driven primarily by Cialis. You may recall, the generic versions of the Cialis entered the U.S. market at the end of September last year, and as expected, we have seen a rapid erosion of sales. When excluding LOE, the rest of our products posted robust Q1 volume growth of nearly 16%. Slide 13 provides a view of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $2 billion in revenue this quarter, representing 39% of revenue. Trulicity continues to post robust growth, having achieved over 45% total share of the U.S. market, in a rapidly expanding class, that grew nearly 30% this quarter. Similarly, Jardiance posted impressive U.S. share gains in volume growth, now capturing 50% and 64% share of market in total and new prescriptions respective. Both products continue to be the market leaders in their classes. Emgality launch trajectory continues to be strong, with nearly 33% share of market for new prescriptions in the U.S., an increase of almost 13 share points from where we finished 2018. We expect increasingly strong performance in the U.S., combined with best-in-class access to drive meaningful sales contribution in the second half of 2019. Continuing with our non-GAAP explanations on Slide 14, foreign exchange rates had a modest impact on our revenue, but a more meaningful impact on cost of sales, due to the effect in last year\u2019s quarter, resulting in the mid-single digit impact of operating income and EPS. Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on Slide 15, you will see that we maintained non-GAAP-pharma-only expectations we shared in February. And with the Elanco exchange offer complete, are now providing EPS on the same basis. Our non-GAAP earnings per share range is $5.60 to $5.70, an increase of $0.05 versus our previously issued guidance range, which included Elanco. While the line items remain unchanged from the previously communicated pharma-only expectations, I\u2019d highlight two items that impact our outlook for the remainder of 2019. First, we will manage expenses to deliver within our SG&A range, while investing thoughtfully to drive continued revenue growth. And second in Q1, OID benefited from mark-to-market equity gains and our tax rate benefited from a net discrete item. We are maintaining our full year outlook for these items, however, as these items are highly variable and it is early in the year. Touching briefly on our updated GAAP guidance, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $8.57 to $8.67, which includes a $3.7 billion gain on the disposition of Elanco recorded in discontinued operations. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our recent activity regarding capital allocation. Consistent with our strategic priorities, we spent over $8 billion on initiatives to drive future growth. In addition to investing in internal R&D, we closed the Loxo Oncology acquisition which augmented our pipeline, and returned over $4 billion of cash to shareholders. As Dave mentioned earlier, we completed the successful divestiture of Elanco this quarter via an exchange offer. We exited Elanco at an attractive price and recognized a $3.7 billion gain on the disposition. In addition, the exchange offer was substantially oversubscribed, and resulted in earnings accretion in 2019, from retiring Lilly shares. As we have returned to growth, our confidence in our business outlook has been reflected in meaningful dividend increases in 2018 and 2019. As we move ahead, our ability to continue to generate strong operating cash flow supports our pursuit of external innovation to enhance our long-term growth and create shareholder value. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Josh. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 24. Movement since our last earnings call includes, the regulatory submission of Trulicity rewind data for CV outcomes label in the U.S. and Europe, submission of our Connected Care prefilled insulin pen for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the U.S., submission of a fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin. linagliptin and metformin XR, for type-2 diabetes in the U.S. and submission of Ultra Rapid Lispro from type-1 and type-2 diabetes in Europe and Japan. We also highlight the initiation of Phase 2 testing for our IL-33 monoclonal antibody and immunology. The initiation of Phase 1 testing for three new molecular entities, including our GIP, GLP glucagon tri-agonist, and the attrition of two Phase 2 molecules. With the submission of Ultra Rapid Lispro, we are now on track to deliver 12 NME approvals since 2014. Therefore, a common question I get is, what\u2019s next? As we replenish our late-stage pipeline, in the past 12 months we have made four big innovation bets with mirikizumab, pegilodecakin, our recently acquired RET inhibitor and tirzepatide. Moving to Slide 18, mirikizumab is our IL-23 in Phase 3 for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, with expected data readouts in 2020 and 2021 respectively. We see first-in-class potential for ulcerative colitis, a disease with high unmet need in growing incidence, where we saw strong Phase 2 efficacy and clinical response and endoscopic healing. Based on positive Phase 2 data in Crohn\u2019s disease, which we will be presenting in a few weeks at DDW, we are now moving quickly into Phase 3 for Crohn\u2019s disease yet this year. Pegilodecakin is our first-in-class PEGylated IL-10 from ARMO Biosciences. We see strong biological rationale and single agent activity in renal cancer. There\u2019s also an intriguing signal in combination with both chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in several tumor types. We are looking forward to data readouts from the Cypress-1 and Cypress-2 non-small cell lung cancer studies by the end of this year, as well as the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer trial in 2020. We will also be starting a clinical program in renal cell carcinoma this year. Our most recent late stage entry is our potential first-in-class and best-in-class RET inhibitor from Loxo Oncology. Currently in the Phase 2 portion of the LIBRETTO-001 study, we look forward to having both additional data readout and a regulatory submission by the end of this year. This molecule has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for three indications, RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and RET fusion positive thyroid cancer. We are excited about the data we have seen to-date, which has shown robust response rates and encouraging response durations. We look forward to presenting new data at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Finally, tirzepatide, our novel first-in-class and best-in-class GIP, GLP dual agonist twincretin, which started its Phase 3 SURPASS program in late 2018, on the heels of presenting impressive Phase 2 results in October at EASD. We believe tirzepatide could provide levels of efficacy not seen with existing products. All SURPASS studies for the global submission should start by the end of the year, with data expected in 2021. We also expect to initiate Phase 3 studies in obesity and a Phase 2 study in NASH later this year. We look forward to presenting new data at ADA in June on tirzepatide, including the additional dose escalation data from a Phase 2 trial in diabetes, data from a Japan clinical trial and new biomarker data from our Phase 2 trial supporting potential efficacy for NASH. We are excited about this cohort of innovative first-in-class, late-stage assets each with the potential to improve the standard of care across immunology, oncology and diabetes. We look forward to what\u2019s next from these assets as they achieve important milestones and readouts over the next 12 months. Slide 19 shows a tally of a significant progress we have made since our last earnings call on key events we are monitoring for 2019 including submissions across four key line extensions or NMEs that I described earlier, the regulatory submission of Emgality for episodic cluster headache in Europe, positive results from CAROLINA CV outcome study of Trajenta, positive results for a Phase 3 study of Taltz for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Results from two Phase 3 studies of Tanezumab, the first in patients with chronic lower back pain and the second a long-term safety study in patients with osteoarthritis pain. Positive results from a Phase 3 study of Cyramza for first line EGFR non-small cell lung cancer. We also note that we received notification that for technical reasons the FDA has refused to file the supplemental NDA for Empagliflozin in type 1 diabetes and that we have made a decision to not pursue the development of Olumiant for psoriatic arthritis. In addition to the late-stage highlights I shared with you today, we are growing our early stage pipeline through both enhanced internal productivity and external innovation. We will highlight several examples in upcoming earnings calls. Now I will turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. In the first quarter, we delivered strong volume based revenue growth of 5% on a constant currency basis, driven entirely by our key growth products. We made strategic investments in commercial and late-stage products, which will enhance our future growth prospects. We have seen good pipeline progress this quarter, including a number of regulatory submissions. In addition, we bolstered our early phase pipeline by advancing multiple assets into the clinic and signing research agreements. We also completed two significant transactions that will allow us to simultaneously focus the business and accelerate our pipeline of innovative medicines, the disposition of Elanco and the acquisition of Loxo Oncology. Finally, we returned over $4 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. Speaking for the entire team at Lilly, we remain incredibly excited about the prospects in front of us to reach millions of people, who need better medicines for difficult diseases. And we are eager to continue to execute on the growth opportunity in front of the company. This concludes our prepared remarks and now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with two parts. Karen [ph], please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then we are ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : The first one from me was just elaborating a little bit more on Trulicity dynamics this quarter, particularly as you think about price as well as to make sure I heard the comments in the prepared remarks properly. But how should we be thinking about net pricing and the overall pricing environment for Trulicity in 2019? And were there any one-time impacts or true-ups of rebates for Trulicity this quarter? My second question is really quick one on Emgality, and just how we should we be thinking about where net pricing is going to shake out for this one. And should we think about second quarter results reflecting maybe more normalized gross to net then we saw with the Q1 result? Thanks very much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris we will go to Enrique for Trulicity and then Christi for Emgality. Enrique Conterno : Chris, thank you for your question allow me to provide some color on Trulicity\u2019s overall performance. We continue to be very excited about the underlying business fundamentals of the product. When we look at volume growth, we are basically the beneficiary of very strong share growth. We are now sitting at 46%, which is an all time high for Trulicity and with the tailwind of very significant class growth now sitting at 30%. Something to note is that when we look at sequentially volume while scripts basically increased for Trulicity from Q4 of 2018 to Q1 of 2019 by about 5%/6%, our actual shipments declined by 7%. So I want to make sure that we are looking at the underlying business fundamentals and not necessarily just some shift in retail or wholesale inventory dynamics. When it comes to pricing, there hasn\u2019t been a step change, when it comes to pricing. I think of course, we see pricing pressures across all diabetes categories. But it\u2019s important to note that our price this quarter was comparable to our price in Q4 of 2018. Now what we basically see in terms of pricing is relative to Q1 of 2018 is higher rates, when it comes to managed care and rebates. Growth in highly rebated segments, whether it\u2019s the Department of Defense,VA and so forth. And then we also had a negative impact due to changes in the estimates for rebates and discounts. Christi Shaw : And Chris on Emgality, your question on net pricing and will be more normalized on Q2, what we saw in Q1, first of all, on-demand, very excited about the fact that we are now the number two CGRP passing a JV in both new prescriptions and total prescriptions. And we are on track in Q2 to pass Aimovig in new prescriptions. As we look at the net, we saw a higher than typical free goods as reimbursement was coming on. To give you a little bit of flavor the first quarter had a 57% of commercial claims were reimbursed. We exited Q1 at 67 or two out of every three prescriptions are claims -- commercial claims being reimbursed. So as the reimbursement comes on in Q2, we should see an improvement in that. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Jason Gerberry, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Gerberry : Christi, just to follow up on the Emgality comment I know that a lot of companies in the space of kind of frame second half payer environment is a little bit fluid. So is your comment that where you exited 1Q, should we be thinking about that as a linear trend. Are there any puts and takes going on changes in the reimbursement of CGRP biologics just wanted to get a better sense there. And I guess my follow up probably staying with you AbbVie\u2019s SKYRIZI got pretty good early access. And so I am just sort of curious, your thoughts winners and losers there either be the established novel interleukins or do you see this as more cannibalization of AbbVie\u2019s own Humira franchise. Thanks. Christi Shaw : Sure so, continuing on Emgality in terms of access. First of all, we saw very good receptivity by the payers for this class really given doctors and patients choice. And also not having many if any real restrictions for primary care prescribing. So on the reimbursement side we see the payers coming on board and more and more are coming on board right now our access ending Q1 is 82%. So we do expect that to get better and better over the course of the year. So I hope that answers your question there. On SKYRIZI, the data on SKYRIZI is as expected and as we look at tolerability to compete, the competitive landscape that we environment that we are in really doesn\u2019t change access is very similar SKYRIZI and Taltz all of the newer agents really coming to market and helped increase the expectations of patients and doctors should have on really skin clearance. And so it\u2019s a competitive marketplace, but we like our chances because with Taltz in the dermatology office we know clear skin, very fast and it lasts up to five years, we have seen data that sustained and no new safety signals. And we also have the head to head versus an IL-23 that will be coming out this year which will demonstrate that speed and clearance at 12 weeks and 24 weeks for the IL-23 really show their peak efficacy. So we are looking forward to that and in rheumatology we will continue to compete there as we just released our head-to-head data versus Humira showing superiority and then later this year, being able to look at the regulatory approval of AxSpA. So the competition is fierce, but our chances and our add with Taltz are extremely good. And we don\u2019t care huge difference in the landscape because of really coming in. Operator : Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. I am sorry. One moment. Yes go ahead please. Seamus Fernandez : So just a couple of quick questions. As we think about the evolving competitive landscape in the insulin space. We have seen Humalogtake up quite a bit of share in a short period of time. And then there\u2019s also the threat of potential biosimilars reaching the market in the next couple of years. The evolving landscape and how that potentially impacts your portfolio as it relates to Humalog or also for the long-acting insulins going forward. And then just a second quick question for Dan. You guys have some data on your ERK inhibitor at ASCO, just hoping that you could give us your thoughts on data coming at ASCO for that product and perhaps any other datasets, that you think we should be watching for. Thanks. Dave Ricks : Thank you, Enrique, if you want to answer the insulin question we will go to Dan. Enrique Conterno : Sure. Clearly, there\u2019s -- there are new competitors in the insulin space, I think, in the case of EADVI think it\u2019s important to reflect that their most of their share gains really have been driven and managed Medicaid outside more look and Humalog of management are -- our overall script are basically flat, clearly there is an evolving landscape, when . it comes to insulin with the potential entry of other insulins follow-ons. As you know the insulin categories are going to be transitioning to BLAs in the 2020 timeframe. Clearly, there\u2019s questions about interchangeability and when is that going to play out as we said in the past, we don\u2019t view interchangeability or something imminent. We eventually think, this is going to happen, but it needs to be more clarity. So this is likely something that won\u2019t happen before 2021. Now, it\u2019s difficult for us to predict when insulin follows up will come into the market in particular in the U.S., given that some of these products have expressed certain expectation when it come to launch timelines, but have been delayed. Importantly, to note as well is that we continue to evolve our overall instrument strategy and we like to say that we are reimagining insulin systems and an insulin delivery with by basically bringing in a connected care platforms to be able to improve patient outcomes in a much more meaningful way. So we are excited about our overall innovations with systems connected care, but also bringing new insulin like our Ultra Rapid Insulin Lispro that we are developing. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes, thanks for the question on our ERK inhibitor. This is a Phase 1 program, but it\u2019s still very early, but we are pretty excited about it. The reason that we are excited about this pathway is because the MAP Kinase pathway is implicated in driving about 30% of solid tumors. So it\u2019s a great opportunity to drive that pathway. At ASCO, we have a couple of presentations on the ERK inhibitor, including some of the early Phase 1 data in a variety of patients and some data in lung cancer patients as well. So we look forward to being able to share that, but again it\u2019s a early program. I think we have a few other disclosures ASCO, but we are excited about, turn it over to Anne to comment on late-phase disclosure. Anne White : Yes. So one of the disclosure that we are very excited about at ASCO is the results of our EGFR mutation positive first-line lung cancer study in CYRAMZA. So this is the RELAY Study and we shares top line data in March that the study was positive and met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. So we will be submitting to regulators globally midyear and approval on this would make the six indication that we have achieved for Cyramza. Importantly, we are excited about the data and we look forward to this oral presentation at ASCO. Also there\u2019s currently the standard of care in this setting and we know that our magnitude of benefit must be competitive with that. We look forward to providing more answers for patients in the setting and also providing more options for physicians as they look to sequence therapy for the best outcomes for their patients. So we look forward to sharing more with you at ASCO. Operator : And next we will go to Tim Anderson with Wolfe. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : On the rewind data for Trulicity coming up at ADA without running the data. Can you just talk about your level of excitement and if this is the data where once just presented you think the prescriber community is going to say well, that\u2019s really a game changer? And then second question on Tanezumab, I think a lot of investors see this program is probably dead based on the latest data disclosure from you and Pfizer. Can you just share your perspective? Dave Ricks : So we will go to Enrique on rewind, and then Dan, you want to talk about the tanezumab results. Enrique Conterno : Yes. We continue to be excited about the rewind results for Trulicity. I am going to -- I have a plug here for my Investor Relations colleagues that we have an investor, we are planning on in new investor call at the ADA post disclosure of rewind we saw. Also, we hope to either see you there. Hope there you can either connector be there in person. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Great, thanks for the question on tanezumab. Before I address your question on the future tanezumab, I think it\u2019s important to comment on why we entered into this partnership with Pfizer and why we have pursued this program. It\u2019s obviously because of the dramatic unmet medical need here. There are nearly 60 million Americans suffering with chronic pain from osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain, many of whom have moderate to severe disease and aren\u2019t getting relief from currently available therapies. When you put that in the context of the drawbacks of the therapies that are currently available, including in many cases opioids, you can just understand how important it is to have new non-opioid mechanisms to address pain. So that\u2019s why we entered into this program and as we said before, we entered in, with a high level of confidence on the efficacy of this mechanism. But what we saw to discharge was the safety risk through this program. And so that brings us to the final study, which of course was designed to fully understand the safety risk of this mechanism that reason in the study enrolled a different population of patients and we enrolled in the others, we wanted to compare to NSAIDs and therefore we had to enroll patients, who were getting some measure of relief and it is tolerate chronic NSAIDs. So we are continuing to analyze the results from that study from 10.58, we are looking at that so in the context of all of the available data on tanezumab. Our plan then is to discuss the totality of the data with regulators in the coming months and that will help us decide on what the next steps are, and then we will be able to share an update with you when that\u2019s globally. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : For Dan on the Olumiant and atopic derm, what do you guys see as differentiation in the data so far among the JAKs. I know you still have some data coming up. And in this indication is your view from the field how attractive oral options are versus injectables. And then just a real quick one for Enrique on Trulicity, just wanted to ask your view of the class growth differences in the U.S. versus O-US and how durable says, I know this has been a big driver in independent of the share gains that Trulicity has gotten over the years. Thank you. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Geoff. So Dan and then we will go to Christi. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay, maybe I will start with the comment on differentiation and toss it to Christi for the commercial insights on patient interest and in an oral here. Although I should just say it\u2019s premature to speculate differentiation versus other molecules where we haven\u2019t seen the full data from theirs or even ours. But we are excited about the opportunity to be first year in atopic derm. Christi? Christi Shaw : Yes, exactly, right now DUPIXENT is available, but it\u2019s an injectable for the more severe type of atopic derm and there\u2019s so many more patients out there suffering millions of patients. In fact, our dermatologist tell us atopic derm space reminds them of the psoriasis space about 15, 20 years ago. So we do think it\u2019s a large opportunity and we do plan to be the first JAKs to market. We have released on the fact that our first two studies were positive. You probably saw that we have three more studies to read out this year and then based on the totality of that data, if they continue to be positive. We will be submitting next year. Enrique Conterno : So when it comes to Trulicity class or GLP-1class growth, I think we see the same dynamics in most markets, the drivers are similar, which is the updated guidelines that having recently released. So when we look outside of the U.S., we are GLP-1class growth is in the mid \u201820s, given the maturity of the class in the U.S., it is impressive that the growth in the U.S. is even higher than that, but it\u2019s very exciting to see and as a corollary to that, I think the Trulicity\u2019s performance is very consistent across many markets. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Just going back to SKYRIZI for the first question. What\u2019s your first-line market share for Taltzin psoriasis and do you expect to be able to grow it now that\u2019s SKYRIZI has been introduced into the market. I am obviously referencing Avi\u2019s enormous rebates influence as well as the profile of that drug and what it may mean for the contraction of the more refractory lines of therapy? And then second, perhaps Dave could comment on the timing and the impact of the proposed rebate reform on your diabetes business expressly on the near-term impact for realized pricing because of the Medicare math, assuming it does get implemented at the beginning of next year. Many thanks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Andrew, so we will go to Christi for the comment on SKYRIZI and then, Enrique, if you want to talk about the impact on diabetes so then proposed rebate Safe Harbor world. Chris Schott : Yes, so in dermatology specifically, our total prescriptions are a little over 15% and we do see growth continuing absolutely, we see actually with the new therapies that have come to market. It actually has increased the market growth, so right now the market is growing at 13%. And the more of the newer agents coming to market, I think the more, you will see the older TNFs be used for short periods of time or potentially not used first line in the future. And so we do see our growth coming from the fact also our ability to compete in dermatology. So the SKYRIZI versus Taltztop to head will be another place for us to go five year data sustained efficacy and we really are the only one that\u2019s had been able to show not only clear positive 100, but the ability to do it fast and one to two weeks and that sustainability. So our growth continues and we continue to see have very high confidence that growth will continue. Enrique Conterno : The biggest impact from the proposed rule is really at the patient level, because patients will have access to medicine side to more affordable prices. And if you take that threat forward, I think what you will basically see is better appearance, and I think that\u2019s something that we all want when it comes to healthcare, which is better appearance to medicine. So the impact that is not often talked about is really, when it comes to maybe an impact on volume. When it comes to some of the mechanics and so forth honestly, I view pretty neutral overall. Dave Ricks : Let me just jump in Andrew, on both of those points. I think it\u2019s important to note in psoriasis two things, one that there\u2019s four stepping through TNFs for almost every patient, if that were to change, I think that\u2019s a big positive for the newer innovation, so the doctors can select appropriate therapy for patients with psoriasis noting that TNFs don\u2019t work nearly as well as in the new classes and amongst those we think tells us the best profile. Also within derm, there\u2019s a lot of switching anyway, so the front-line market is versus the total is much smaller than other immunology indications. That\u2019s an important thing to keep in mind. On the rebate rule we do, we are planning for implementation January 1, I think Enrique rightly notes that the volume upside, the thing I would worry about is rate compression because presumably you would have more facial transparent pricing. But I think across our portfolios, because of the hike consolidation on the payer side, the rates are pretty compressed already. There aren\u2019t big differences between what the payers are paying. So that\u2019s why we lean into this one, we think it\u2019s the right policy answer to help seniors with medication costs and to shift the debate from list pricing to net pricing, which we see as our long-term interests. Kevin Hern : Thanks for your questions, Andrew, next caller please. Operator : I will go to Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So just first on Olumiant, I think, I asked this question before, but just the U.S. opportunity there against our limited sales this quarter. I think you said in your prepared remarks, you are not going to be filing for psoriatic arthritis, just correct me if I miss heard that? And I am just, I guess, on how you think about getting the 4-milligram to the market and so the opportunity in the U.S. for that product and also the implications from the data of Pfizer recently released from their long-term trial showing some additional question on thrombosis? And then the second one, just following up on the psoriasis questions, you mentioned mirikizumab and the data there in psoriasis, I know you said you will be first in GI, I am just curious what the differentiation of any would be in psoriasis for that product or is it really more just a GI focus we should think about? Thanks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Vamil. We will go to Christi for Olumiant Americas questions. Christi Shaw : Okay. So for Olumiant, yeah, I think, what we see in the U.S. is it will be slow and steady in Olumiant 2 milligrams RA. Your question about psoriatic arthritis, you did hear correctly, as we look at the opportunities for us to be best-in-class, first-in-class and really enter market with unmet need. In psoriatic arthritis in the ankylosing spondylitis non-radiographic expire as well. We already have Taltz and Taltz has shown very remarkable results and so we feel very good with that play as we look to study Olumiant and other indications like atopic dermatitis. Remember Lupus got Fast Track designation in December. We are studying both 2 milligrams and 4 milligrams in that indication, as well as atopic dermatitis and we have our alopecia areata study where Phase 2 will readout later this year and if positive we will move to Phase 3. So we are still very big on the opportunity of baricitinib as a whole, the RA 2 milligrams will be slow and steady growth and 4-milligram is being studied and we looked at CD efficacy results there and bring it to market if they are positive. In regards to the Pfizer question about what readout in their Jack high dose. So we -- as we look at the data that we have and 55 countries that have approved Olumiant, we haven\u2019t seen unusual safety signals in DTEs and we continue to study, obviously, post marketing research that we are doing in collaboration with agreement with FDA both on real world evidence and in randomized clinical trials, those will continue as well. So no news on -- no unusual news on our Taltz and Olumiant like the Pfizer announcement. And then lastly on mirikizumab, so, yes, we are in Phase 3 studies with both psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, we are very excited about the GI space because mirikizumab should be the first IL-23 to ulcerative colitis. We also finished our Phase 2 data on Crohn\u2019s disease that data will be released at DDW in just a few weeks here in May. So look for that. And then, yes, in psoriasis we are doing a Phase 3 clinical trial with some competitive endpoints in head-to-head data. So when that study reads out we will be looking to see if we can have stronger and more sustained results then current IL-23 in the market. Kevin Hern : Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : And next we will go to Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, can you quantify for us what percentage of TRx are paid versus free on Taltz, as well as Emgality? And secondly, I noticed one of the trials reading out for you this fall, the IL-10 plus Opdivo trial in second-line lung has been shrunk from 100 down to 50 patients. Is that simply a function of increasing Keytruda use in first-line or is there another dynamic here as well? Thank you very much. Dave Ricks : Okay. Thank you. We will go to Christi for the questions around Taltz and Emgality and then Enrique will talk about pegilodecakin. Christi Shaw : Sure. First of all, Lilly believes in really open access and giving choice to patients and physicians. So we continue to work with payers on access with Taltz. In spite of that, we -- the barriers that we have had -- we had very good uptake with Taltz and as we look at our programs, patient specific, copay cards, et cetera, being able to allow patients on drug and then transition to insurance coverage, we see that two-thirds of patients in the market on Taltz are paid for. On Emgality, as I said before, the commercial claims that have been submitted, we see in Q1 that 57% of those have been reimbursed. And as we exited Q1, we saw that in the mid \u201860s, two out of every three patients that submitted a claim we had reimburse coverage for. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Christi. Enrique Conterno : Yes. On the question on pegilodecakin, this is the Cyprus 2 study referring to. So this is a second-line lung study, its Phase II study IO-naive patients. So following first-line treatment, but not in immunotherapy and then it\u2019s in combination with Opdivo in low expressers. And what we are finding, as you know, well, is that IO-naive patients in the second-line are becoming increasingly rare. So what we decided to do was analyze that data and have that inform the next steps for the program. But not continued to further enrolled patients in this somewhat diminishing population. We have remain confident that the greatest opportunities for pegilodecakin remain in lung cancer, both in the first-line setting and in later lines, and also in renal cell cancer. So as Dan mentioned, we will be starting a renal cell study later this year. But we look forward to readouts in lung at the end of this year and then also in pancreatic cancer early next year and remain confident in the opportunities for pegilodecakin across those tumor types. So I look forward to hearing more towards the end of the year, both on Cyprus 2 and on the Cyprus 1 study, which is in the first-line setting. Kevin Hern : Thanks, for the questions Umer. Next caller, please. Operator : And we will go to David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions. The first is for Dave. I am hoping that you can help us understand a little bit better, how you are thinking about the forthcoming HHS action on the elimination of rebates and how that will negatively impact companies that use volume based discounts such that a product like Taltz will be able to step up on the formulary and maybe move into a formulary position that another larger player held in psoriasis? And then second, Enrique, with respect to Trulicity, just hoping that you can help us with a little bit more of a bridge. So you said that, Rx increased sequentially by 5% to 6%, actual shipments declined by 7%. So does that mean there was an inventory work down of 12% to 13% and could you also quantify the negative dollar change in reserves? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Dave, and then Enrique. Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on the rebate rule, again, we are planning for this January 1, of course, it\u2019s Part D, there are some legislative efforts to look at regulating commercial market. I guess, at this point, my speculation would be that looks more challenging either for political or practical reasons. But I do think once Part D changes and I think we are, as I said, planning toward that, you will start to see increased interest from payers that are not in the government systems or commercial payers to have similar benefits provided to their beneficiaries, particularly in chronic disease where list price effects have a lot of distortion and increased out-of-pocket costs and we have all heard the upgrade around that really centered on insulin, frankly. So I think your logic is the right one in the sense that today with rebates which are not share with patients and confidential payers have a strong incentive to keep those confidential and use those to compete on premiums, that\u2019s the way it works. I think in the future world where that can\u2019t be the way they use those rebates, they will need compete for premiums in other ways, efficiency, presumably, and patients will have a choice at the counter based on net pricing. I would assume the doctors are informed about those net prices and that also becomes an influence on prescribing. So for new innovative therapies hypothetically one in specialty market or in a general practitioner market like Emgality, I think that will be an important part of any company\u2019s strategy to understand the net price that will officially be there for the consumer. The final comment is, of course, Part D is senior program. So the demographics will affect us mostly in our diabetes franchise initially and that\u2019s where a lot of our planning is focused right now. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Whenever we look at sequential growth you -- there\u2019s a lot -- what I call the colloquially a double whammy effect. So we could be double counting here is not to simply add up. One good way to think about it is just if we were to shift 5% of the units from Q4 to Q1 that that explains 10 percentage points of difference, but in reality we are only shipping 5% of units from one quarter to another. That\u2019s a long way of saying that, I will have your estimate likely the -- we don\u2019t have full visibility into the retail inventories, but my assessment is about 6 points. David Risinger : Thank you. Kevin Hern : Dave, thanks for the questions. Next caller please. Operator : And next we will go to Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. We were expecting Verzenio data in 2019 from MONARC Her and MONARCH plus. I am wondering if there still on track. And then, secondly, Enrique, one of the concerns with the upcoming rewind readout is that the benefit might be driven by the 30% or so of patients in the trial with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and that the remaining patients add little to the overall outcome. So, overall, the benefit might be a solid but unspectacular 20% or so reduction in risk, which won\u2019t offer opportunity for differentiation. I am just wondering, can you tell us not to be concerned about this point? Thank you. Kevin Hern : All right. We will go to Anne for the question on Verzenio and then Enrique on rewind. Anne White : Yeah. So you are correct. So we are looking to deliver our new data to drive additional growth in one of them the HER-2 positive study, which we will report results on towards the end of the year at a medical meeting. The MONARCH 2 overall survival data will readout as we had communicated in the past in 2020. And then we also have importantly the adjuvant study reading out in 2021. And I appreciate asking about Verzenio because there has been an encouraging start to the year. The revenue grew 30% over Q4 and we also are seeing nice uptake across Japan and European markets. So we look forward to these additional data readouts helping contribute to that message. But look forward to those readouts coming as we had communicated in the past. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : We are unable to provide additional comments on rewind, but look -- we look forward to seeing you at the conference call. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Alex Arfaei, BMO. Please go ahead. Alex Arfaei : Okay. Thank you and good morning. On tirzepatide, your -- good to see the program formally, I guess, extended in obesity and NASH. Regarding your Phase 3 obesity trial, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of the outcomes you are looking forward the competitor are you using and the potential readout? And you mentioned you have dose titration data at ADA, can you comment on the extent to which that data shift you dosing for the Phase 3 trials, particularly the high dose? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Enrique? Enrique Conterno : Yeah. So we are very excited about the tirzepatide and being able to start our Phase 3 Type 2 diabetes study and basically pursuing both obesity in Phase 3 and NASH in Phase 2. We are not providing additional color on the specific obesity trials that we are conducting -- that we plan to conduct. Clearly we need to have the appropriate discussions with the FDA as we engage in this Phase 3 trial, but we plan to do sometime -- that sometime in the future. And as far as the titration question, yes, we do plan to have presentation at ADA, looking at some of the additional titration data for separate thing. Kevin Hern : Thanks for the questions, Alex. Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Next we will go to Louise Chen, Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on mirikizumab, you had mentioned that you will likely be the first to IL-23 to marketing you see in Crohn. I am just curious in addition to that, what are the competitive advantages do you see as it relates to other ILs and about and also Jack? And then the second question I had was on LOXO-292, you showed very good ORR median duration percentage of patients on therapy. How do you think that will hold up into the Phase 2 readout and how do you think you might compare with other RET inhibitors in development? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. We will go to Christi for mirikizumab and then Anne on RET inhibitor. Christi Shaw : Thanks Louise for the question on miri. So, to be clear, we expect to be first in to the market on ulcerative colitis and first of a couple to market on Crohn\u2019s disease. So, you never know, we have been speeding up the Phase 2 trial and look forward to entering the next, but that\u2019s where we are on GI. We are very excited, because our studies are set up to be best-in-class and so if they read out positively, we expect to not only be first-in-class or best-in-class in ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Christi. Anne? Anne White : Yes. When we have thoughts on the Loxo question, when we start to move into precision medicine and to obtain a RET inhibitor, we really thoroughly survey the landscape and selected the molecule in the portfolio that we believe to be first and best-in-class, and we continue to believe that today. We intend to submit in the U.S. by the end of the year end in Europe shortly thereafter. So to answer your question, we remain very confident in the efficacy, safety profile and the duration of our RET inhibitor. And we will continue to expect that will deliver first in both lung and thyroid cancer. So we are actually be having -- we are presenting an update on the registrational data in the second half of 2019 at a major -- a couple of major medical meetings in advance of that potential regulatory filing. And importantly, as you look at this data set, we now have over 400 patients enrolled across tumor types with RET fusion or mutations. And so we fully expect the data to continue to bear out what we saw last year, which is in response rates, as you said, from 60% to 80%, with well over 90% of patients remaining on study. This is the data reported last year and then we will provide an update later this year. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Next we will go to Navin Jacob from UBS. Please go ahead. Navin Jacob : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, number one, I just wanted to -- I am sorry to beat a dead horse on GLP-1 pricing. But Enrique, if you could just dig in a little bit further, just wanted to understand in Q1 of this year, how much of the lower price was related to Medicare Part D on whole changes versus other rebate related changes, because you mentioned that there was rebate estimate adjustments, I want to understand is that a one-time impact for accrual accounting related issues or is it something that we should be thinking about as continuing on going forward. And so, overall, just wanted to understand, where is the GLP class going in terms of pricing, is there going to be continued pricing pressure over the next couple of years? And then, secondly, just on op margins, if you could help us understand longer term where the op margin profile for the human health business will look like. Can we expect margins to reach mid-to-high \u201830s in line with some of your other peers? Appreciate the help. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Navin. We will go to Enrique for Trulicity. Then Josh on the op margin question. Enrique Conterno : Yeah. So I just first to address the question about the doughnut hole. The doughnut hole becomes a little more important in Q2, I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but in the case of diabetes medicines maybe Q1 is maybe only about 10% of the overall doughnut hole from an accounting perspective, what we are going to see throughout the year. So when we think about Trulicity, while there was some impact of the doughnut hole. It was not material to the pricing results. As we -- as I mentioned, when we look at Trulicity, we do have high rebates in managed care and so forth relative to Q1 of last year, the change is due to estimates -- change in estimates for rebates and discounts. That -- yes, that is basically changing because of how we had accrued them based on a full review of the claim that we received later basically changes the information that we have on hand and we need to account for that as soon as we know that information. So, yes, that is a particular impact that was from other quarters that basically is impacting this particular quarter. So that\u2019s probably as much detail as I can provide. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Enrique. Josh? Josh Smiley : I mean on operating margins for the quarter, we were slightly above 26%, our guidance for the year is to be at 28% we are confident we will get there. I think you will see through the remainder of the year that we will see if power guidance topline growth netting out currency effects similar to what we are seeing this quarter and we will see sort of the operating expenses at a more constant absolute level than what we are seeing in Q1. So we are confident in our 28% for the year. And then for 2020 our goal is 31% and we are confident as well in achieving that. That\u2019s for pharma only, so that\u2019s on our new basis excluding Elanco. We see good opportunity to get to the 31%. So we are no change there. I think if you look past 2020, we would expect margin expansion to continue. We have a limited patent expirations in the first half of the next decade and we still have the new products that we are launching now will still be in their growth phase. So we definitely see margin expansion opportunities post 2020. But we haven\u2019t given a specific goal. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Next caller, please. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. Dave Ricks, please go ahead. Dave Ricks : All right. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us and we appreciate your participation in today\u2019s earnings call and your interest in the Eli Lilly and Company. We began 2018 with a lot of momentum and we made meaningful progress in our first quarter. Although, Q1 was a period of investment, we remain committed to our revenue and profitability goals for 2019 and 2020. We continue to advance our innovation-based strategy to progressing internally discovered medicines, augmented with external innovation. We completed two transformative transactions this quarter as well, with the full separation of Elanco and the addition of Loxo Oncology. With a robust pipeline and volume driven revenue growth Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow up with our IR team if you have additional questions that were not addressed on today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are : Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A and Patrik Jonsson, who is joining us for the first time as our Incoming President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2018 and 2019, and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our progress in Q2. Dave Ricks : Thanks Kevin. Well, it's an exciting morning for us here at Eli Lilly and an important day for women around the world living with breast cancer. As we have just announced the positive results showing that Verzenio extends life of the women with breast cancer in the MONARCH 2 trial, more on that in a few minutes, but first let me make a few comments on the overall performance in the quarter. We continue to execute on our strategic objectives, focusing on launch excellence, progressing our pipeline and improving productivity and our capabilities. Second quarter revenue grew 1% and 3% in constant currency, despite the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Cialis late last year and the impact of Lartruvo\u2019s impending product withdrawal. Q2 marked our 15th consecutive quarter of worldwide revenue growth. Our performance was driven by volume growth of 6% excluding the Cialis loss of exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo volume grew nearly 15% led by our key growth products which accounted for 43% of the company's revenue. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 27.9%, representing a 250 basis point decline versus last year. This reflects a decrease in gross margin and increased investment in both our launches and our pipeline. Operating margin improved by 170 basis points versus Q1 of this year, reflecting progress toward our margin goals for 2019 and 2020. We achieved milestones on several pipeline assets since our last earning call, including the FDA approval of Emgality for treatment of episodic cluster headaches in adults. The FDA approval of CYRAMZA as a single agent for patients with High-AFP Second-Line Hepatocellular Carcinoma and FDA approval of Baqsimi, our nasal glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes. We're pleased to note that for all three of these approvals, the Lilly product represents a first-in-class opportunity within their respective indications. Additional milestones to highlight include the positive Phase 3 data for higher doses of Trulicity in patients with Type 2 diabetes. And the positive Phase 3 overall survival data for Verzenio from the MONARCH 2 study which I mentioned earlier, an exciting milestone for Verzenio differentiating this medicine from others in the CDK 4 & 6 class. Also in partnership with Pfizer, we're prioritizing a potential U.S. submission of Tanezumab in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain by Q1 2020, followed by submissions in the EU and Japan. At this time, we are not planning regulatory submissions for moderate to severe chronic low back pain. We continue to leverage our strong operating cash flow to augment our pipeline through external innovation and return capital to shareholders. We announced a worldwide licensing agreement for novel small molecule from Centrexion Therapeutics that is currently being studied as a potential non-opioid treatment for chronic pain conditions. We completed the $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program announced in Q1. And we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders via the dividend. Moving on to Slide 5 you'll see more detail on the key events since our last earnings call in April. In our continuing efforts to make medicines more affordable for patients, we launched Lily insulin Lispro this quarter, at a list price of 50% lower than current Humalog list price. While an important solution for patients access so far has been limited. We will continue to work with payers to make this important solution accessible to patients. I would also like to highlight our leadership changes. First, a sincere note of gratitude to Mike Harrington, for his tremendous leadership and service to our company. Mike, you've done a great job defending the company and serving as a key advisor to our leadership team and our board. Second, I would like to welcome Patrik Jonsson as her assumes leadership for our Biomedicines business unit. Patrik is a patient focused leader with a long track record of delivering results in some of our largest markets. Under Patrik's leadership, Lilly Japan has climbed from the 17th ranked Pharma Company in Japan in 2014 to the number six ranking at the end of this year. We delivered the highest growth rate in Japan during that period of time, which included the successful launches of our key growth products. It's great to have Patrik joined the senior leadership team. Now I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on the financial guidance for the balance of 2019. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results to non-GAAP measures. And Slide 7 provides a summary of our GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on Slide 8 you'll see revenue increased 1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 81.0%, excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 80.2%, keeping us on track to achieve our long-term goals for manufacturing efficiency and profitability. On the same basis our gross margin declined approximately 60 basis points compared to Q2 2018 driven by unfavorable impact of product mix and a negative impact of price on revenue, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expense increased 8%, with marketing selling and administrative expense increasing 7%, driven primarily by higher marketing investments to support the recent launch of Emgality in the U.S. as well as other key growth products. R&D expense increased 10% reflecting higher development expenses for late stage assets, including tirzepatide, our RET-Inhibitor and mirikizumab. Total operating income decreased 7% compared to Q2 2018 driven by all the investments that I just mentioned, which put our operating income as a percent of revenue at 27.9% for the quarter. As our recent launches continued to drive revenue and operating leverage, we expect income growth and improvements in operating margins, while we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of 28% as well as our 2020 target of 31%. Other income and expense was expense of $32 million this quarter compared to income of $21 million in Q2 2018. This was driven by higher net interest expense primarily related to the Loxo acquisition. Our tax rate was 10%, a decrease of 670 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by a net discrete tax benefit associated with the resolution of U.S. and foreign tax audits as well as the timing associated with the impact of U.S. tax reform. At the bottom line net income declined 3%, while earnings per share increased 1% due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. In Q2 we made good progress aligned with our strategic priorities as evidenced by driving strong volume based revenue growth despite significant headwinds from the loss of exclusivity of Cialis in the U.S. and the impact of Lartruvo. Investing behind key growth brands such as Emgality, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and Trulicity and continued pipeline progress, including three regulatory approvals, two submissions and positive Phase 3 readouts for two key growth products. Slide 9 outlines, these same non-GAAP measures year-to-date, while Slide 10 provide the reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS and you'll find additional details on these adjustments on Slides 27 and 28. Moving to Slide 11, let's take a look at the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, worldwide revenue grew 3% on a performance basis, driven by a 6% increase in volume, partially offset by price. Foreign Exchange reduced revenue growth by 2%, for the tenth straight quarter we delivered volume growth in each major geography. U.S. revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2018, volume growth of 5% was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance and Alimta, excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, volume grew nearly 17% in the U.S., with our diabetes products delivering over 24% volume growth. Consistent with our 2019 financial guidance, U.S. price declined 4% with nearly 3% driven by increased rebates in the Medicare Part D coverage gap resulting from the change this year that moved manufacturing funding from 50% to 70% of the doughnut hole. Approximately 2% was due to unfavorable segments mix. The remaining 1% price favorability is a mix of modest list price increases and favorable adjustments to estimates for rebates and discounts partially offset by higher contracted rebates and patient affordability. Going forward, we expect the changes in coverage gap funding to continue to impact Q3 with less impact in Q4 and we still anticipate mid-single-digit declines in U.S. price for the full year. Moving on to Europe, revenue grew 6% excluding FX, driven by volume partially offset by the negative impact of price. Volume growth is led by Trulicity, Olumiant and Taltz. In Japan, revenue growth of 4% excluding FX was driven by volume, with Verzenio, Olumiant and Cymbalta as key contributors to the growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 12% excluding FX led by 26% growth in China on the same basis. At the bottom of the Slide is the same information for our June year-to-date results. As shown on Slide 12, our key growth products were once again the engine of our worldwide volume growth. These products drove 15.4 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, reinforcing our confidence in achieving our 2020 revenue goals. Branded that have experienced loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 650 basis points driven primarily by Cialis. As expected, and we've seen a rapid erosion of Cialis sales, following the entry of generics in the U.S. market at the end of September last year. We expect this drag to continue in Q3 and begin to normalize in Q4. Slide 13 provides a view of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $2.4 billion in revenue this quarter growing to 43% of revenue. In addition to the sustained strong performance of Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance, I'd like to highlight the performance of CYRAMZA, which grew 19% in the U.S. as our share of market doubled in second-line lung. We look forward to continued growth as we launch the High-AFP HCC indication in the second quarter and expect to submit first line metastatic EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. later this year. We're excited to see Emgality continue to gain share, exiting Q2 at 41% share of market for new-to-brand prescription in the U.S. which is an increase of approximately 9 share points where we exited Q1. As our best-in-class access continues to grow, we exited the quarter with paid script of approximately one-third of total U.S. scripts. We look forward Emgality continuing its strong uptake in U.S contributing meaningfully to sales in the second half of 2019. Slide 14 shows the year-over-year select lines of our income statement, focusing on our non-GAAP results, foreign exchange rates had little impact on gross margin and modest positive impact on operating expenses, operating income and EPS. Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on Slide 15, you'll see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance that reflects increase in our bottom line results for the year. Specifically, we're raising and narrowing the range for SG&A expense of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, reflecting continued investments in recent launches. We are lowering the range for other income and deductions to zero to an expense of $150 million reflecting first half gains in our equity portfolio. We're decreasing our tax rates from a range of 14% to 15%, to 13% to 14% to reflect the net discrete tax benefits associated with the resolution of tax audits in future. And we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.67 per share to $5.77 per share, which reflects the Q2 discrete tax benefit as our performance expectations remains unchanged. On a reported basis, the tax rate is expected to be in the range of 14% to 15% and our earnings per share for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of $8.58 per share to $8.68 per share. Slide 16 shows the progress we've made towards our 2020 revenue and operating margin goals. On the left of the slide, the midpoint of our 2019 guidance represents 5% revenue growth over 2018 in constant currency, despite headwinds from the loss of exclusivity for Cialis and the impact of Lartruvo. With that performance in 2019, we would need to grow sales at 6% in 2020 to achieve the 2015-2020 minimum compounded annual growth rate of 7% that we've outlined. As the headwind from Cialis LOE and Lartruvo abates in 2020 and our new products continue to scale, we're confident that we'll achieve that minimum revenue goal. On the right, you can see that we've delivered significant margin expansion since 2015, increasing from just under 20% to over 29% last year. Again, as the impact of the Cialis LOE and Lartruvo diminishes this year. As our new products continue to scale, we're confident we'll achieve our 2020 goal at 31% operating margin. On Slide 17, we provide an update on capital allocation. Aligned with our strategic priorities, we spend over $10 billion in the first half of the year to drive future growth between our business development activities, capital expenditures and internal investment in R&D. In addition, we've returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we'll continue to fund the growth of our new \u2013 our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline, seek external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return capital to shareholders. Now, we'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Josh. It's been an exciting quarter for R&D results, really capped off with a big news this morning that Verzenio\u2019s MONARCH 2 trial demonstrated positive efficacy at the interim analysis, improving overall survival for women with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. A bit more color on Verzenio and its important results in a minute. But first I'll summarize some of the other R&D highlights for the quarter. Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of July 25th. Movements since our last earnings call includes the regulatory approvals that Dave mentioned earlier, the regulatory submission of empagliflozin in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for type 1 diabetes and the regulatory submission of CYRAMZA for first-line EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer. The initiation of Phase 3 testing for baricitinib and alopecia areata. Iinitiation of Phase 1 per five assets including our Oral GLP-1 Receptor Agonist and the attrition of two Phase 1 molecules. Moving to Slide 19, since the last earnings call, we've made progress on a number of key events that we're monitoring for 2019, including the approvals, submissions and top line disclosures that Dave and I have already mentioned. New this quarter, we've added the top line readout for pegilodecakin SEQUOIA trial to the Phase 3 trial in combination with FOLFOX with second-line pancreatic cancer. And we expect this event driven trial to read out later this year. We'll recall that ARMO had moved this program into Phase 3 based on limited data for Phase 1, this was driven by the high unmet medical need in second-line pancreatic cancer. As we've shared in previous updates, we still see lung and renal cancer as the key indications for this molecule. Later this year, we'll initiate a study in renal cell cancer, as well as a biomarker driven studies in lung cancer. In diabetes, we had a number of medical presentations at this year's American Diabetes Association meeting, including Ultra Rapid Lispro for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the Trulicity REWIND CV outcome study, as well as several tirzepatide datasets. I'll share a few key takeaways from the ADA meeting. Moving to Slide 20, I'll highlight the tirzepatide dose escalation study. The study demonstrated consistent efficacy with improved tolerability relative to the Phase 2b study that we shared at EASD in 2018. This is evidenced by significant reduction in the treatment discontinuation rates shown here. The GI side effects that did occur were mostly mild to moderate and were less severe than in the first Phase 2b study. These results are encouraging, particularly because the dose escalation in the Phase 3 study was a slower step-wise design and was tested in the Phase 2 dose escalation study. We believe tirzepatide has the opportunity to reset treatment expectations for patients for HbA1c and weight loss relative to current therapies. Five trials in the surpass program are already underway and we look forward to data readouts beginning in 2021. Turning to Slide 21, you'll see summary data regarding the REWIND cardiovascular outcome study for Trulicity. As a reminder, the patient population included in REWIND was different from other CV studies for GLP-1s, as observed by the notably lower rate of MACE events in the placebo arm updated on the left. Studying a lower CV risk patient population established a high bar to demonstrate efficacy and generated data and a population that's more representative of diabetes patients seen in physicians\u2019 offices. Despite the high bar for efficacy, Trulicity demonstrated clinically meaningful 12% reduction in MACE while demonstrating safety consistent with prior studies. Equally impressive is the consistency of MACE results, which showed a benefit across a variety of measures, most notably the prespecified subgroups of patients with and without prior CV disease. We expect the label to reflect the broad population we studied, and we look forward to hearing from regulators on our submissions. Moving to Slide 22. Last quarter, we highlighted the four big late-phase bets we've made over the last 12 months. This quarter, I'd like to highlight select Phase 2 opportunities. But first, let me start with some comments on Verzenio. Obviously, we've made exciting progress with this medicine, now generating additional data in Phase 2 and Phase 3, which highlight Verzenio's important differentiation versus other CDK 4/6 inhibitors. When we previewed upcoming data readouts at our December 2018 investor meeting, we highlighted three important readouts that we expected over three consecutive years. We said we expected Phase 2 data in HER2-positive patients in 2019, Phase 3 data for overall survival for MONARCH 2 in 2020 and Phase 3 adjuvant data in 2021. We're pleased to show today that the first two of these readouts have occurred and both are positive. As per our press release this morning, the MONARCH 2 readout occurred earlier than expected and showed Verzenio extended life for women with metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. This interim analysis was the first robust analysis of overall survival and required a stringent p-value. While we had originally expected this trial to go to its final analysis in 2020, the results were strong enough to meet the endpoint at the interim analysis, making Verzenio the first and only CDK 4/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant to achieve statistically significant improvement in overall survival. We look forward to presenting these results later this year and working with regulators to submit this important new data. In addition, we're announcing today that our Phase 2 trial in HER2-positive breast cancer was positive, making Verzenio the first CDK 4/6 inhibitor to show positive efficacy in a randomized controlled trial in this HER2-positive population. We'll work with regulators to determine the appropriate next steps. Also, we're pleased to hear today that MONARCH plus, our Phase 3 study in China, was stopped early due to efficacy. This data will support our upcoming submission for approval in China. Finally, I should say we're still very much looking forward to receiving data in the adjuvant population, and our Phase 3 trial in this population is still expected to read out in 2021. Now let me turn back to the topic of ongoing Phase 2 trials. Touching briefly on pegilodecakin, in addition to the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer results we now expect in 2019, the Phase 2 lung cancer trials, Cypress 1 and Cypress 2, are on track to complete later this year, and we expect data disclosures to come in 2020. Moving to neuroscience. Zagotenemab is our anti-tau antibody currently in a placebo-controlled study of nearly 300 patients. This study uses a tau imaging agent to identify early symptomatic Alzheimer's patients whose disease has not progressed beyond the potentially treatable state. While Alzheimer's is a higher-risk area, we believe our molecule uniquely targets aggregated forms of tau, a key pathologic hallmark of the disease. And our trial design incorporates unique elements that will help us best learn a treatment with a tau antibody is a beneficial strategy for Alzheimer's disease. We look forward to seeing the data in 2021. In addition, D1PAM is our positive allosteric modulator that targets the dopamine D1 receptor. We previously shared some encouraging Phase 1 data, and we're now studying this molecule in Phase 2 in the symptomatic treatment of Lewy body dementia, which includes patients with both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, focusing on improving attention and cognition. Based on enrollment, we expect data in early 2020. If we see a signal in the Phase 2 data, we're prepared to move quickly into symptomatic treatment of Lewy body dementia as well as Alzheimer's disease. In immunology, we recently moved our anti-IL-33 antibody into Phase 2 development in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, an area of high unmet medical need. We're excited about the potential of this target and this molecule. This asset builds on our emerging immunology portfolio, and we anticipate seeing data in the first half of next year. Finally, I'd like to highlight two diabetes programs. First is our Basal Insulin-FC, which is a next-generation basal insulin. Basal Insulin-FC uses the same time extension technology that we used to create Trulicity, enabling convenient once-weekly dosing. This asset has the potential to be the first weekly basal insulin and could be an important new treatment option for people with diabetes. We're anticipating reporting top line data next year. Second, we have ongoing efforts focused on improving the delivery of insulin and improving patient outcomes. We know that more than half of people on insulin today are not achieving their A1C treatment goals. The ongoing Phase 2 efforts of our automated insulin delivery system are the first step in an iterative process towards a closed loop system that we believe has the potential to significantly increase the number of patients achieving their A1C goals. Pending positive Phase 2 data will move into Phase 3 in 2020 with a potential launch in 2021. We look forward to tracking the progress of these assets over the coming years and will share additional pipeline updates on our next earnings call. Now, I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the second quarter. We delivered volume growth of 6%, despite the continued erosion of Cialis due to generic competition and the withdrawal of Lartruvo, key growth products Liberty impressive volume growth of 15%, which now represents 43% of our revenue. We made strategic investments in commercial and late-stage pipeline products to reach more patients today, and improve the standard of care in the future. Meanwhile we continued to progress towards our margin goals as operating margin improved to 170 basis points versus Q1 2019. We made progress with the pipeline this quarter, including three regulatory approvals, along with the exciting MONARCH 2 overall survival readout for Verzenio. In addition, we moved one asset into Phase 3 development, while also advancing multiple assets into the clinic. Looking ahead, we're excited about the data disclosure for our RET inhibitor at a major medical meeting and subsequent submission later this year. We also returned over $600 million to shareholders via the dividend, and completed our $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, last week, the Senate Finance Committee released details of its plan to address drug pricing and improve patient out of fund cost for patients. This is of course just the latest in a continuing discussion in Congress and the administration, and it won't be the last word we'll hear from the Senate on this subject. I know there may be a lot of questions about this particular package, so let me make a few points here in the hopes of allowing our Q&A to focus on the solid Q2 results we delivered and the strong prospects for Lilly's future. First, I want to assure investors that the industry has and will continue to focus on shaping this to be, guided by our core principles of encouraging and protecting innovation, fairness and transparency in the pharma industry and all healthcare, and lowering costs at the pharmacy counter for patients who use our medicines. While the Senate Finance Committee package advance some of these ideas, it falls short on many others. We'll be working with all stakeholders over the coming weeks and months to try to better align legislative proposals to our core principles. I know many of you have and will continue to work to size the impact of these proposals on the industry and on patient care. So let me make a few comments here to help. We're reserving a more detailed numeric answer for a later time when there's more clarity and more uncertainty. The three parts of this package I'll highlight are the Part D redesign, resetting the 100% relate cap in Medicaid and capping list price increases in Part B and D. Pharma has already put out a public statement on the policy concerns from a patient innovation perspective, so I'll just focus on the practical implications here and assess the likelihood and the impact to Lilly. This strategy just follows. A Medicaid Part D redesign, which includes an out-of-pocket maximums beneficiaries seems, the most important and the most needed to be legislated in some form, and is a proposal, which would deliver savings to patients for use higher cost medicines with the addition of this out-of-pocket cap. Based on our current portfolio, we should have a neutral to positive impact on our diabetes portfolio, which currently is our primary exposure in the Part D benefit. But it would have a negative impact on our immunology and oncology business. Removing the 100% rebate cap in Medicaid is the next most likely proposal in our view, as it was \u2013 it has also shown up in a draft house legislation as well. The current finance version basis in the new cap at 125% in late 2022, raising money for the government, but delivering no benefit to patients. In the near-term, this would represent a larger headwind for us in the general industry, primarily due to our insulin business. Medicaid represents a little more than 10% of the U.S. Humalog and Humulin volume, so a 25% increase rebate would represent a moderate negative impact on our insulin revenue. Finally, capping list prices, it was price increases at the rate of CPI inflation in Medicare Part B and D will perhaps be the less likely to be enacted proposal that we've seen. Medicare Part D is a market-based structure, which has worked quite well, coming in under budget, while expanding access to innovation for millions of seniors. We're concerned about the price controls this represents. And mechanisms already exist to limit price increases in these segments and contracting in Part D and the ASP reporting system in Part B. While Lilly has already significantly moderated list price increases for our medicines, this policy if enacted we'd continue to encourage this kind of a moderation. Patient impact will be quite modest from this proposal, although accumulate through time as do the government savings. Unfortunately, none of these proposals address the fundamental structure issue of the gross to net spreads, and this will remain a centerpiece of our advocacy over the coming months to remake the incentives for all actors and deliver substantial out-of-pocket savings to patients who use innovative medicines. I would note that as presented \u2013 presently constructed, these proposals would begin to take effect in 2021 and 2022, and currently would have no impact on our 2020 guidance. Longer term, in any case, we will continue to focus on volume driven growth through innovation. Across our Company, Lilly employees remain energized and motivated to progress the pipeline to bring innovative medicines to millions more \u2013 million more patients who need solutions for different diseases. We are excited to execute our strategic priorities to deliver not only our 2019 and 2020 goals, but also to realize the long-term growth opportunity in front of us. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with two parts. Cynthia, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I read the blog post with a lot of interest on Medicaid Max rebate caps. And my question is what's the dollar impact if that cap is raised to 125% and what's that dollar impact if there is no capital? I think this is one of those questions every investors is very curious about given the exposure here. So that's first. Secondly on R&D, I was curious on Cyprus 1 trial for ARMO which is due this fall. I understand it's an open-label trial, how would you set the investor expectations going into that readout knowing that IO-IO of late, has been very disappointing? Thank you very much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Umer. We'll have Dave take the first question and then Anne, your second. Dave Ricks : Okay. I appreciate the question. Although I was hoping to head most of these off in my prepared remarks, Umer. As I said the \u2013 any version of a Medicaid M catalyst, we think is a regressive policy. It punishes companies by forcing us to underwrite state Medicaid, actually giving a rebate in excess of our list price. But policy issues aside, I think you're asking with the exposure of the Company. As I said this almost exclusively impacts our insulin portfolio across the Lilly medicines. And we are in the low teens in terms of total volume for Medicaid as a percent of that \u2013 those businesses. So that would be the theoretical cap on the impact of those businesses. 25% of that is a smaller number related to insulin and insulin related to the total of the Company. So it's a concerning policy because of the nature of it. The absolute financial impact for the Company is capped in a way by the volume in Medicaid and the 25% with the phase-in is certainly a better version of a bad policy in any case, we advocate for leading to Medicaid MCAP at 100%. Anne White : Pegilodecakin, so it's \u2013 Dan mentioned, we look forward to completing the studies and sharing that data at the beginning of Q1. We are particularly looking forward the results in Cyprus 1. So this is a patient population where we've added the Keytruda in high-expressers, so those are the PD-L1 over 50%. So positive data from those trials would trigger additional long trials, potentially registration trials. We do continue to believe that the greatest opportunity for pegilodecakin is in lung cancer in the first line setting and then also in later lines whether following or combination with other IO agents. And then the other area of great interest is renal cell cancer. Both lung and renal had encouraging data in the Phase 1 study. So as Dan mentioned, we do see this as a rapidly evolving landscape and then working on our plans to optimize peg in that setting. And so look forward to starting those studies at the end of the year, as well as biomarker driven studies in lung cancer and other tumor types. So more to come and Cyprus and pegilodecakin. Kevin Hern : Thanks Umer. Next caller, please, Cynthia? Operator : That will come from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first just would love some perspective on Trulicity growth in the second half given the dynamics you saw in the first half, there. And then can you help frame for us, the high dose data for Trulicity in the context of tirzepatide? And then my second question is on the LOXO-292. You mentioned you're going to have data presentation later this year. Just would love high level thoughts on kind of the durability and safety, tolerability, you're seeing to date. Thanks. Kevin Hern : Thanks. So we'll go to Enrique for the first question, and then Anne on that 292. Enrique Conterno : Very good. Well, we are pleased with the performance of Trulicity. We got sustained strong volume growth. We saw a 41% prescription growth in the United States when we look at the second quarter of 2019 relative to the second quarter of 2018. As we look at that, our sales growth was below that. Clearly there was some price erosion. The bigger pieces of this price erosion were the high rebates that were somewhat offset by modest list price increases. And then about seven points was the incremental funding of the donut hole, going from 50% to 70%. Clearly, when we look at relative to Q1, we did see good continued sequential growth when we look at volume. I think importantly, I think the fundamentals of the business are very strong, as we look at both class growth of about 30%, and when we look at their share performance. We do have, as you mentioned, significant catalyst with REWIND, and of course when it comes to the higher doses 3.0 milligrams and 4.5 milligrams for Trulicity. We are excited about the opportunities with both. When we think about tirzepatide, we sort of think of tirzepatide being in a completely different zip code when it comes to efficacy. That's why we utilize in the worse of resetting expectations of treatment for people with type 2 diabetes. When we look at both A1C and wait, so we continue to be very excited about that particular asset. Anne White : And then with LOXO-292, thank you for that question. We will present as you said, an update on the registrational data in the second half of 2019 at one or more a medical meeting, and that's an advance the regulatory filing, which is on track for the U.S. by the end of the year. And we really do look forward to sharing that robust data set. It's now over 500 patients enrolled and it's rolled across tumor types with RET fusions or mutations. And we continue to be very excited about the profile as both a first and the best in class RET inhibitor. So LOXO-292 is highly potent and we've seen robust response rates and exciting emerging durability as well. And also a safety profile that doesn't carry the burden of cytopenia that can require costly supportive care interventions. So again enrolments continue to be strong. The LOXO team is continuing to do a fantastic job in this program. And so we're very much looking forward to sharing that data at upcoming meetings. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Thank you, Terence. And next caller, please? Operator : That will be from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Baum : Thank you. First question, could you break down for us the initial versus subsequent lines of CDK 4/6 therapy for the entire market, and give us some idea whether you can use the MONARCH 2 data to cure formally status on that this commercial and Medicare plan for 2020? And then second, if we take the inflation cap is something that will happen with the Medicare Part D. Is it possible that could relate concerns about rising insurance premiums to allow rebate reform to research as part of the proposal? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. We'll go to Anne for the initial question and then Dave for the inflation cap question. Anne White : Well, thank you, Andrew. And you asked a really good question and thought about this carefully. So in a trial like this, the reason it's so difficult to show a survival advantage is because of patients crossing over. And the fact that we were able to demonstrate significance at a pre-planned interim confirms the strength of Verzenio, and we do believe differentiates our product. We do expect increased growth across all lines of therapy based on these results. And importantly, we will certainly share this data with those making access and treatment decisions. As we've heard overall survivals, the most important outcome and most objective outcome as well, so this really verifies the importance of Verzenio to achieve that best outcome for patients. And we've heard repeatedly from patients that overall survival is the most meaningful one for both patients and the physicians who are treating them. And this is an incredibly devastating disease and women who are living with this disease want to do everything they can to be with their families as long as possible. So we're really glad to have delivered this result for women with metastatic breast cancer. Dave Ricks : Thank you. Thanks for your question, Andrew. And I think you \u2013 I didn't quite make it up. I think you're talking about the Part D CPI cap as it relates to the impact on the rebate reform score. Look I \u2013 the Senate finance package, which is sort of the leading integrated package we've seen generates a huge amount of savings to the government, most of which does not go back to the patients. This is our primary issue with it. Even the reform within Part D that is on the table, the AF proposal pretty much pays for itself, maybe generates a little bit of surplus action, really. So the question we're posing to policymakers is how do we reinvest that? For yes, premium stability, premiums are already extremely low in Part D and have been stable for years, but more importantly, directly leave at the pharmacy counter more relieved than this package delivers with the various proposals. One of those is as you indicate is to go back to the idea of passing through some or all of negotiated discounts with seniors and indexing their co-payments, their deductible to net pricing not list. I think pretty much everyone is closely as you think this is a good idea, as you point out the issue has been the score. Now, if we can find into Part D and make it in connection with the rest of the Finance Committee package, I think there is a huge potential to achieve all those goals. One could also look at phases, phasing it in or even partial rebate pass through stepping up through time. So all these ideas are \u2013 ideas we've had as pharma that we're actively pushing on. And maybe the main thing about all this is, although this package, got a lot of ink, we're far from the finish line here and there'll be a lot of discussion, probably with policies we really don't like and some we like better like the one you're suggesting. And we'll do our best to try to shape this into something workable that addresses the fundamental issue, which is out-of-pocket costs for people who use innovative medicines. Kevin Hern : Thank you. Andrew, thanks for the question. Cynthia, next caller, please? Operator : That will be from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a couple. First on tanezumab, how would you describe your level of confidence that the 2.5 milligram can be approved in OA, why are you no longer a filing in chronic lower back pain and where does cancer pain stand? So that's the first question. And then secondly, AbbVie's IL-23 SKYRIZI seems to be off to a great start, and AbbVie specifically said they were taking share from IL-17. So just curious what you're seeing. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. Dan will have you take the tanezumab question, and Josh, if you can handle SKYRIZI. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks Steve for the question on the various tanezumab indications. In a sense, you're right, in the order that you put them in, which is that we sort of prioritize based on the data that we have and the overall benefit risk in each of those populations. So based on that as well as the unmet medical need in osteoarthritis, we've prioritized moving that forward with the regulators. Overall, we wouldn't be proceeding with regulatory submissions and announcing that we're proceeding unless we had confidence in the overall benefit risk that this medicine provides in that population. That's based on the trials that we have recently disclosed. It's also based on the totality of the evidence and that's a decision that we've come to together with our partners. At Pfizer, the chronic lower back pain we've decided not to pursue at this time for almost exactly the same reasons, given the unmet medical need in that population and the benefit risk in that population. Cancer pain is the third here in line and we don't have that trial. It's taking a bit of time to read out and so it's hard to comment on what the benefits could be there given that we don't have that data yet. Josh Smiley : Okay. On SKYRIZI, it's Josh. The launch is really in line with what we expected it to be. It's a good launch, if you look at it relative to Taltz and time normalize Taltz is a little bit better in terms of prescription trends. But in terms of what we see in the market place right now Steve first, we saw really \u2013 we're pleased with Taltz's performance in the U.S. In Q2 we saw TRx volume growth of 61%, and really we see share growth. Really as we look at SKYRIZI, we see \u2013 it looks like share coming primarily from the store, in the IL-20 \u2013 IL12/23 class, maybe some from Cosentyx. But our growth continues and we feel good about the share performance that we're seeing. Of course for later this year, we're looking forward to releasing data on our head-to-head trial against Tremfya and I think that will be an important competitive positioning for us. So we \u2013 overall, the biggest thing that we need to see is continued growth in the class. I think still majority of prescriptions are happening in the TNF class. So I think anything on the \u2013 both of IL-17 and IL-23 classes are able to shift to the better more modern treatments is good for patients and it will be good for us. Steve Scala : Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Thanks, Steve. Next caller, please? Operator : Go to the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. So I have two questions, please. First, Dave, you had mentioned that out-of-pocket costs for people who use innovative medicines are a challenge. But could you talk about what the industry is doing if anything with respect to such costs outside of Part B because the government's actions will likely only applied a Part D, that's where the government can affect drugs. And the industry has a major public relations problem with the majority of the population that is outside of Medicare Part D that struggle with out-of-pocket costs. So is the industry doing anything i.e. with the Chamber of Commerce or with major employer groups to try to change the dynamic of the out-of-pocket cost challenge? And one final thing I'll just make a statement which is that it does seem that the industry has not been able to overcome the unfair treatment of drug coverage, i.e. the fact that people pay too much out-of-pocket relative to the out-of-pocket costs for other healthcare utilization such as physician visits, hospital visits, et cetera. So anyway, sorry for the long diatribe but I did want to understand the industry's agenda outside of government reimbursement. And then second, could you just talk about Lilly's evaluation of oral GLP-1s as a potential pipeline product opportunity? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. Dave will have a \u2013 Dave will take your first question, and then Dan will talk about glutathione oral pipeline. Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Dave for the question, a lot in there. But I think in general we agree that \u2013 I mean, we need to improve the rhetoric in the \u2013 around the industry, we're working hard to do that. But mostly we need to improve the experience of patients at the pharmacy counter. You correctly point out that a lot of the discussions about government programs, but for Lilly's business more than half our business in U.S. is commercially reimbursed in whatever we are doing there. That is an area of increasing focus for us. And I think there is probably four things that I would point to that we're both doing in ramping up. The first is how we design and implement our own healthcare coverage. As a healthcare company, I think we can begin to shape the market by our own purchasing behavior. And I think we have \u2013 with that we are going through it here, one of the most progressive policies for our own employees as it relates to drug cover, including first dollar drug coverage on products like insulin and the way the deductible gets funded et cetera. And these are all physicians having years of experience, doing it, we're in a position to recommend to our peer companies as well as to insurance providers as best practice. As you know, probably that \u2013 recently there was an IRS ruling that is quite important maybe subtle thing that allows for the first time clarity around the question of whether medicines can be classified as a preventative treatment under HRA \u2013 HSA designs and high deductible plans. And the answer from the ARS is yes, they can. So we will use that as I think, a new point to help those that are purchasing insurance products in the commercial market so they can design plans that a first dollar coverage zero-out-of pocket for important essential medicines, in particular in diabetes for us, but also other categories as well that affect millions of people. Thirdly, a value-based pricing is something Lilly is taking a leading position on. Although it's been stubborn in government segments we're making enormous strides in commercial markets. And this \u2013 well, it doesn't directly translate to the issue out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, I think it does allow us to both demonstrate the value of our medicines and share the risk and benefit of those medicines with self-insured employers. We're having a lot of success with this and I think it does begin to shift the discussion pretty dramatically around medicines as a cost versus medicines as a solution and that's important. Finally, there are state-based efforts that are seeking to regulate the commercial marketplace. I think you'll see pharma and Lilly increasingly active in those debates, Colorado being one of them that's out there. And as the playing field shifts from a federal debate during an election year where \u2013 let's be honest very little will probably happen, the states maybe a center for action in 2020, and we'll be ready to engage and advocate for policies that help patients with the innovative medicines there. So a lot in my answer, but I think you pointed out, a good thing here which is commercial market matters for a lot of companies including Lilly, and we need to address those inefficiencies as well. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Great. Thanks for your question on oral incretins. It's obviously an area of interest for us. And maybe speak generally about our strategy here, which is that we want to be able to offer oral incretin therapy that meets sort of one of two criteria. First, it could have a significantly improved bioavailability versus what's currently under development. And that's important because that will translate to more convenient experience for patients, more convenient dosing with more reliable efficacy. The other option is to offer greater efficacy in an oral product than the currently available once weekly GLP-1s. So we're pursuing those two tactics with different approaches. So to get something that's very highly bioavailability you need to move to small molecules. And so here we have a program, which is characterized by molecule just moved into Phase 1 this quarter, we call the GLP-1 NPA or non-peptide agonist, which is the product that was invented by Chugai, and we partnered with them on that. So we're excited to see Phase 1 data from that. We'll quickly learn what kind of bioavailability we get, and that will determine how we pursue that project. The other avenue to get better efficacy than currently available injectables really relies on next generation incretins. So these are by specific molecules like our tirzepatide GIP/GLP where we are seeking to get the peptide to become orally bio-available. And we have a number of purchase to accomplish that and look forward to moving those programs into the clinic soon. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. And thank you, Dave. Next caller, please? Operator : We will go to the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much. So just two very quick questions, first on Verzenio and HER2-positive disease. Can you just give us a quick sense of Lilly's definition of a clinically meaningful if the data registrational? And then just maybe give us an estimated market size or path to thinking about the market size? And then separately, on Taltz, gross to net, can you just give us the gross to net currently? And given the Company's need to reposition the product for growth in RA, should we anticipate further price concessions in the next formulary negotiation cycle? Thanks a lot. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. Anne will review for the Verzenio question and then Josh will take the Taltz question. Anne White : Yes, Seamus, thanks for that question on the HER2-positive data. And as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, we're extremely pleased to have a positive result in that study. And so as you mentioned, this is the first randomized controlled study to have positive results in HER2-positive breast cancer. And this has been a very difficult-to-treat population. And so finding opportunities for them to avoid chemotherapy has certainly been the goal of this study. And so we do believe that the positive result and the meeting of the primary endpoint of PFS are clinically meaningful. And while I can't show the specifics of the data and we'll be presenting that at a scientific meeting later this year, we do believe that it's clinically relevant for patients, particularly those that want to avoid chemotherapy in this setting. We do \u2013 the next step really is to discuss this data. And that's our plan, to discuss this data with regulators as we share at the scientific meetings. So I can't comment any further at this time on regulatory strategy. On the market size, so as you probably know, this is about 15% to 20% of breast cancer. So this is not an insubstantative market. So we do believe this is a significant opportunity as we go forward for these patients who have that particularly hard-to-treat type of breast cancer. So again, together with the overall survival data and the robust result that we had in the China registration study, I think all three just reinforce the strength that Verzenio brings. And again, the only CDK 4/6 that has continuous dosing, the only one with a monotherapy indication, and it's continued to help patients, particularly those with a poor diagnosis. So I think we're very pleased to share these updates on Verzenio today. Josh Smiley : And Seamus, on Taltz and price and gross to net, really in the second quarter, neither of those were major factors in terms of U.S. growth. Our price and gross-to-net rates have remained pretty steady. As we mentioned in Q1, about two-thirds of Taltz prescriptions right now in the U.S. are reimbursed, and that really didn't change in Q2. We're pleased with the share performance in psoriasis. I think as you mentioned in the room space, we're looking forward to indications in AxSpA, which we think will make us more competitive and open up significant growth opportunity there. And we're focused on access, and we would like to see that improve. But really, in terms of price and availability today, not significant changes in the first half of this year. Dave Ricks : And maybe just to comment to add to that, PsA is the indication, not RA. I think we see \u2013 the way we see this is these additional indications actually will enhance our leverage in payer access discussions, not erode it. So actually, I think it works the opposite way from the way your question was phrased. The more volume we can build on PsA, the more indications like AxSpa we get, the more unique the product is and the more leverage we gain. So I think we're optimistic about both the growth of the product but also the pricing power in this market. Kevin Hern : Seamus, thanks for your questions and next caller please. Operator : We will go to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Alright, great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one is, there seems to be lingering investor concerns about Trulicity and GLP-1 pricing as we look out to 2020 and beyond with the launch of oral sema. Can we maybe just get your latest thoughts in terms of how you see payers reacting to new entrants in the market? And should we be anticipating a more challenging pricing environment for Trulicity going forward? So that's the first question. Second question was on tax. I think you mentioned some discrete items and a lower tax rate this year. Just any thoughts about how we should think about normalized tax rate for Lilly as we look beyond 2019? Thanks very much. Kevin Hern : Thank you, so Enrique and Josh for the tax question. Enrique Conterno : Appreciate the question. I know we get this question often on Trulicity and the outlook of price. And I'm unable to provide that, but I think it's important to think about the value that Trulicity is delivering today and the incremental value that we can deliver as we think about REWIND, as we can think about the higher doses that Trulicity will be launching because all of that is basically additional value that the product will be providing. We think we have a strong foundation with the performance of the product. I'm not going to speculate on how Novo would price the product and what the potential responses from payers, maybe. Josh Smiley : I think on tax rate, our prior guidance for this year on a non-GAAP basis was between 14% and 15% as we reduced that by a point, given the discrete tax benefits that we saw in the second quarter. I think from a long-term perspective, that 14% to 15% range is reasonable. One of the things \u2013 the swing factor here is the calculation around guilty and depending on where and how our income flows that again can move that a little bit. But we're comfortable in the sort of low-to-mid teens as a sustainable rate given the tax structure that we have today in the U.S. So as long as that's maintained, we think we can maintain at somewhere in that range with again \u2013 on any given year depending on where we're launching, how sales are moving, we could see a 100 basis point swing one way or another. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : We will go to the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you. On Trulicity, where is the Lilly Diabetes team expect that Novo's oral semaglutide source of business will come from in terms of drug classes? And when that product launches, do you think that will lead to a slowdown in the scripts for Trulicity that will be palpable by investors, or is the class growth high enough such that Trulicity may not really budge at all? And then second question again on reform, sorry, Dave. I was surprised to learn from someone who is well-informed in this area that AARP was a key stakeholder in killing the proposed rebate reform because of their alignment with the drug industry where they supposed to get something like half of their funding. My question is, whether you think rebate reform still be brought back on to the table or is that permanently off the table? Kevin Hern : Okay, thanks. So Enrique for Trulicity and then Dave for the policy question. Enrique Conterno : Yes. It's \u2013 honestly it's very difficult to speculate given that we need to see when we think our source of business, we will need to see basically how Novo will price the product, what type of placement, what is the message and so forth and so on. I think what we see, though, I think just generally when we think about diabetes is that, patients do tend to go to an oral first, right as we think about orals. So right now I think the product that we basically have, that we are commercializing is Jardiance, which has an incredible evidence and incredible benefit. My sense is depending on how product positions, how they price this product, and that's going to be a pretty big barrier for them to overcome. I think we're extremely well positioned with the product. We're investing well behind it and we have a great partner on Boehringer Ingelheim to make that extremely successful. Kevin Hern : Dave? Dave Ricks : Yes. Okay. Thanks for the question, Tim. I think I guess we can declare the experiment of heading off questions in advance in prepared remarks that we missed our primary endpoint. Anyway, I think it\u2019s true, AARP was a strong opponent of rebate reform. We can all speculate why, but it's also true that the majority of their revenue, I think more than half comes from royalties from the Part D program. So easy to get cynical when you spent time in Washington. That said, we still think it's a good idea. Is it possible to come back? Well, probably in some other form. I think the broad-based pulling of the Anti-Kickback Statute gets harder because of the way the scoring happen and the politics around it. But as it mentioned by Dave Risinger earlier or perhaps it was Andrew, that inside of a Part D benefit redesign, the idea of patients linking out-of-pocket costs to something other than list price is a good idea. And there is a sliding scale, we don't have to go all the way. That could change the scoring and make it more affordable and create a model for insurance design in the commercial market and other segments. So we're far from giving up on this idea. And as you know, given a retail portfolio like Lilly's, with big gross to net spreads, over 50% on average across our portfolio, this is a single quickest and most efficacious way to save patients' money at the point of sale, and restructure the incentives of the payers to work on behalf of patients directly versus work on behalf of all beneficiaries, including non-patients, which is kind of how it's set up today. So we got a long way to go in this debate and this is an idea we have might go. Kevin Hern : Thanks , Dave. Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : We will go to the line of Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on tirzepatide. I wanted to ask you what you think or what level of GI side effects is considered acceptable by physicians? And then on your NASH and obesity product, how do you plan to differentiate your product from others in development, are those that are failed? And then my second question is on the CGRPs, the potential entry of these oral CGRPs. And do you think the prophylactic ones would interfere with the growth of the injectable CGRPs and then what about the acute CGRPs if there is any overlap there with your products? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. We'll go to Enrique for the question on tirzepatide and then Dan, if you want to talk about the CGRPs. Enrique Conterno : I think, we already have an excellent in-market experiment here because we've seen the success of GLP-1, so we know that with the level of side effects of the GLP-1 class, we can have significant success. We do believe that we are not going to be trading off. In the case of tirzepatide, we will get the additional efficacy and we believe that we will have a comparable side effect profile to the GLP-1 class. When it comes to NASH and obesity, honestly we are bidding to be best-in-class product. We're not bidding to be first-in-class or we are thinking that we are going to reset the expectations of what's possible in both obesity and NASH with tirzepatide. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Enrique. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Great. Thanks for your question on the CGRP market and the potential impact of oral CGRPs coming to market. Of course, as you know and pointed out the injectable CGRPs like our Emgality are approved and marketed for prevention for prophylaxis of migraine, whereas the initial indication for the oral CGRPs is likely to be in the acute treatment or a broader use of migraine. I think there is a couple of questions about the oral CGRPs that are still outstanding, and probably first I would go to safety. One of the great things I think about the drugs like Emgality is the great safety data that we've been able to generate here. Remember, this is a relatively young and otherwise healthy population with somewhat chronic disease and so safety has got to be a key factor in choosing a medication in this population. There are questions about the safety of the oral class and we'll just have to see how that ends up with regulators. I think there is also a bit of a mechanistic question here which there's just not data to address yet. So the question though is, if you've got chronic blockade of CGRP because patients on a preventive antibody already, and we know we pretty much maxed out on the dose response curve here. The question is whether adding an additional oral agent will have any effect if it will even work as and part of and people are already on chronic treatment. So for that reason, we've looked for other mechanisms for migraine and part of that won't clash with CGRP antibodies, but rather are likely to be complementary. So we're excited about the potential that we can offer with lasmiditan and that's currently under FDA review. And I think will be an important new treatment in the broader space coming soon. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : We will go to the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Gerberry : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions from me. First on tirzepatide, just thinking about, absent the reporting of Phase 3 data, do you think we'll learn anything in the next 12 to 18 months as it pertains to the diarrhea side effect, and whether it's a GIP-driven side effect? And then my second question just on the Olumiant detailed Phase 3 BREEZE data in atopic dermatitis, the IGA scores relative to dupilumab were a bit lower, so just sort of curious, based on the data we have so far in hand, how do you think Olumiant could be positioned in the atopic dermatitis market? Thanks. Kevin Hern : Okay. Thanks. Enrique for tirzepatide, and then we'll go to Dan for the Olumiant question. Enrique Conterno : Yes. My sense is I'm sure that we are going to be waiting for the Phase 3 trial so what we see basically on some of the Phase 3 trials for us to understand this dose titration actually delivers when it comes to tolerability. And as we mentioned, we feel very comfortable given the modeling, given the studies that we've done that we are going to have a product that has unsurpassed efficacy resetting expectations for A1c and weight loss, and at the same time a product that is tolerable and comparable to GLP-1s. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Enrique. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks for the question on Olumiant for atopic derm. Just specifically comparing it to dupilumab, I\u2019d just point out, obviously that it's tough to compare in this case, an oral medication with injectable biologic for atopic derm. I think Olumiant has some advantages in the repetidy of action and patients may like that. But really I think the important comparison here is versus other orals for atopic derm and there are none yet. So, we have the potential to be the first oral for atopic derm and I think that's encouraging. We've got more data to come here and we'll see how that comes out. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Jason, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : We'll go to the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. Your line is open. Navin Jacob : Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Just on Taltz, wondering if you could give any color on the underlying volume growth of the overall psoriasis market and psoriatic arthritis market? AbbVie is planning to double-digit underlying market growth in terms of dynamic that perhaps some of us are missing, I am just wondering if you're seeing that level of growth. And then with regards to your SG&A line, you came in a little bit higher than expectations raised your guidance for the year. Over the next couple of years I know you're launching a bunch of products, wondering how you're thinking about that line, how we should be thinking about it? And then finally with regards to capital allocation, we've seen several companies in this space do large deals and/or just yesterday, a large spin-off, any color on how you're thinking about your business whether there is any potential for restructuring that we may not be necessarily thinking about and your continued interest in bolt-on M&A deals? Thank you very much. Kevin Hern : Okay, thanks. So we'll go to Josh for the Taltz and SG&A questions and Dave talking about the capital allocation structuring. Josh Smiley : Okay, great. So first on the overall derm market, we're seeing low double-digit growth in total across the class, the IL-17s are of course growing faster than that and I think we'd expect to continue to see with the launch of SKYRIZI, the IL-23s grow. And again I think that's what's probably most important is moving, as I mentioned earlier, moving patients from TNFs to the modern IL-17s and IL-23s. So we're looking forward to the data that we will generate later this year on our head-to-head versus on Tremfya. And again we're focused on Taltz in psoriasis is on 100% clearance and acting fast and being durable. So we're looking forward to continued growth in that market. As we move to SG&A, our guidance for the second half of the year really implies a pretty flat, absolute level of SG&A with the first half of this year. We're comfortable with that. As you look with our new product launches, we've got a lot of variable SG&A expense. We do a lot of direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S., both television as well as digital. So we've got a good handle on how we pulse that investment and we've clearly in the second half of last year, as our new launches we're scaling, we're putting a lot of money behind them. We've continued that the first half of this year, but in an absolute basis, we feel comfortable with sort of flat to moderate growth in SG&A as we look out over the course of the next few years. We think we're well invested behind our new launch products and mostly we'll see a mix of tactics, but a pretty good absolute envelope where we are now. And again that reinforces as I talked in the prepared remarks, so we look at operating margin for 2020 with the kind of sales growth that we'd expect headed into 2020. We do expect to see good operating leverage there and are very confident with our 31% operating margin target for 2020. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Josh. Dave? Dave Ricks : Yes. I mean on capital allocation nothing changes for us. I think we've said for quite some time, we don't believe in large scale merger activity generates value for shareholders. We still don't believe that. In terms of spin-outs yesterday's news, we don't have such an entity to spin out. We had one in animal health and we executed that transaction. I guess of the thinking being similar in that we think human innovative pharmaceuticals is the business to be. And then it's what we do well and where we can generate a lot of value for all stakeholders, patients, society and shareholders if we execute. So our focus in terms of capital allocation is really on funding organic R&D, and then looking outside for opportunities, bolt-on\u2019s mostly that would fall within the pipeline, building type exercise where we can add value where it fits within our therapeutic focus, and where we see value for shareholders and patients. So that\u2019s what we've been focused on for some time. We had the Centrexion deal announced this quarter, Loxo in Q1, those types of things are what we're interested in and where our focus lies. And I don't see there's a change from even the past 10 years. So we'll continue on that path. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. Navin, thanks for your questions. This ends the Q&A portion. I'll turn it over to Dave for the close. Dave Ricks : Great. Thank you. We appreciate your participation in our call today and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. As we begin the second half of the year, we reflect on the meaningful progress we made in the first two quarters and the opportunity that lies ahead on the balance of 2019. We are committed to our revenue and operating margin goals in 2019 and 2020, while we continue to invest in our innovation-based strategy. With a pipeline full of exciting opportunities and a diversified volume driven growth in the market, Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. Thanks for dialing-in. Please follow-up with our IR team if you have follow-up questions that we didn't address on today's call. Hope everyone have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Eli Lilly Q3 2019 Earnings Call. At this time all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations. Kevin Hern. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Thank you. Good morning, thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr.Dan Skovronsky, President of Lilly Research Laboratories; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; and Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly U.S.A; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio Medicines; and Mike Mason, incoming President of Lilly Diabetes. We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-K's, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products in pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2018 and 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our Q3 results. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Kevin, Q3 was another strong quarter for Lilly as we continue to deliver robust results and execute on our strategy, which is launching new medicines, advancing our pipeline and driving productivity. Revenue grew 3% this quarter or 4% in constant currency, driven entirely by robust volume growth from our new products and international operations. Volume contributed 8%, -- 8 percentage points of growth despite sizable headwinds from the loss of exclusivity for Cialis in the U.S. and the withdrawal of Lartruvo. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo volume growth was an impressive 16%. Our newest medicines continue to be the engine of revenue growth and account for 44% of revenue this quarter. We made good progress in productivity in Q3 as our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.6%, keeping us on track to meet our 2019 and 2020 operating margin goals; compared to last year's quarter, operating margin was essentially flat, reflecting lower gross margin offset by prudent management of our operating expenses. We achieved milestones on several pipeline assets since our last earnings call, including the FDA approval of [indiscernible] for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. The European Commission approval to expand Trulicity's label to include results from the rewind cardiovascular outcome study. The presentation of registration Phase 2 data for selpercatinib in non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancers and the presentation of overall survival data of Verzenio in metastatic breast cancer -- also made impressive progress with its development program this quarter with the FDA approval of radiographic axial spondyloarthritis or AxSpA along with its submission in Europe. Submission of our non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in the U.S. and Europe, which represents our first-in-class opportunity in this indication and positive results from a head-to-head study in psoriasis versus guselkumab in IL-23 antibody. We remain focused on creating long-term value for shareholders as we allocate capital seeking external innovation that will enhance future growth prospects while at the same time we returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders this quarter via share repurchase and the dividend. Moving on to slide 5, you'll see more detail on key events since our last earnings call in July. I would like to highlight today's announcements regarding leadership changes and I want to congratulate and thank my long-time colleague Enrique Conterno for significant contributions to Lilly. Enrique has done an outstanding job leading Lilly Diabetes over the past decade really re-establishing our company as a leader in diabetes care with the broadest and fastest growing portfolio of medicines in the industry. Enrique, Lilly will not be in the strong position it is today without your leadership, your energy, optimism and thirst for excellence will be missed. I would also like to welcome Mike Mason as he assumes leadership for our diabetes business unit. Mike is a 30-year veteran with deep expertise and significant experience in our diabetes business. Mike is a patient focus leader with a track record of delivering results for Lilly and for patients in the U.S. and Canada. Under Mike's leadership, Lilly successfully launched both Jardiance and Trulicity in the U.S., becoming the diabetes market volume leader during his tenure. Since July 2018, Mike has led our Connected Care and insulin commercial and development organizations working to leverage technology to enhance insulin delivery and improve the user experience. Importantly, he has also led Lilly's efforts in building the most comprehensive suite of insulin affordability solutions in the U.S., including the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center to support people in need of less expensive alternatives for their medicine. Mike, it's great to have you join our senior leadership team. And now I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and provide an update on financial guidance for 2019. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Slide 6 summarizes our presentation of GAAP results and non-GAAP measures, and slide 7 provides a summary of our GAAP results. Looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide 8, you'll see revenue increased 3% or 4% in constant currency. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 60 basis points to 79.6%; excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78.9%. On this same basis, our gross margin percent declined approximately 140 basis points compared to Q3, 2018 driven by the unfavorable impact of product mix due to Cialis, and the negative impact of price on revenue, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expense grew 2% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3% as our ongoing cost containment measures and lower litigation charges versus last year were partially offset by increased investment behind recent launches, consistent with our long-term strategy. R&D expense increased 8% reflecting higher development expenses for late-stage assets including double selpercatinib and tirzepatide. Total operating income increased 3% compared to Q3 2018, our sales growth outpaced expense growth, driving operating income as a percent of revenue to 28.6% for the quarter. As our recent launches continue to drive revenue growth and headwinds from Cialis and Lartruvo both sunset in 2020, we expect additional operating margin expansion and bottom line growth. We are on track and committed to achieving our full year operating margin guidance of approximately 28% as well as our 2020 target of 31%. Other income and expense was expense of $25 million this quarter compared to expense of $2 million in Q3, 2018 driven by higher expense primarily due to the Loxo acquisition partially offset by investment gains. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.7%, which is a decrease of 320 basis points compared with the same quarter last year driven primarily by a net discrete tax benefit related to the settlement of certain tax matters. At the bottom line, net income increased 5%, while earnings per share increased 10% due to reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases. In summary, in Q3 we again drove volume based revenue growth and made progress on our productivity goals. In addition to continued solid execution third quarter also featured impressive performance outside the U.S. as revenue grew 10% in constant currency driven by 12% volume growth. Examples of our ability to launch with excellence as Emgality and Baqsimi are off to strong starts. The approval of the first medicine in a new class to treat acute migraine, submissions of new indications for our key growth brand in multiple geographies and important clinical data at major medical meetings from our portfolio. Moving to Slide 9, it outlines these non-GAAP measures for September year-to-date, while slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. You will find additional details on these adjustments on slides 24 and 25. Moving to slide 11, let's review the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 4% in constant currency driven by volume growth of 8%, partially offset by price, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point this quarter. For the 16th straight quarter we delivered worldwide revenue growth despite major headwinds from patent expirations. U.S. revenue was flat compared to the third quarter of 2018, volume growth of 5% was led by our newer products Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality, Jardiance, Verzenio, and Basaglar. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, volume grew nearly 17%; consistent with our 2019 financial guidance and in line with Q1 and Q2 results, U.S. price declined 5%. This quarter's decline was impacted by approximately 3 percentage points, driven by the net of higher rebates across segments, offset by modest listed price increases and over 2 percentage points from increased funding obligations during the donut hole phase of Medicare plans. We anticipated approximately $200 million of impact for the year and our actual results are consistent with this projection. However, we are seeing the donut hole impact more concentrated in Q2 and Q3 than prior years and expect a smaller impact in Q4. As our largest product, Trulicity of course had a significant impact on the U.S. portfolios price decline; Trulicity's robust U.S. volume growth of 42% was consistent with first half trend and was partially offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics in the quarter, including disproportionate growth in lower net price segments driven by the access wins we had in 2018 and the increased volume associated with these wins throughout this year, increased funding obligations during the coverage gap in Medicare due to payer consolidation and adjustments to our overall estimates for rebates and discount liabilities across various segments. Combined, these factors had a negative impact on price in the quarter of approximately 20 percentage points. If we exclude these items, Trulicity price declined roughly 5% versus Q3 2018. Well, we don't typically give forward-looking product level guidance and don't intend to change that practice, I do want to provide some perspective on Trulicity over the coming quarters. We expect the Q3 negative factors to moderate substantially going forward as impacts from the donut hole diminished in Q4 and then will be in the base for next year's comparison. Similarly, as we have driven rapid volume growth in government segments, including the VA and DoD between Q4 of last year and this quarter, we expect these segments going forward grow more in line with overall sales. Finally due to payer consolidation is now fully reflected in the base going forward. Given the absolute size of the Trulicity rebate and discount liability, we will continue to see quarterly adjustments to that liability. But as we have seen historically these are difficult to predict, it can be both positive and negative. So taking these factors into account, we think Trulicity's underlying U.S. net price decline of roughly 5% in Q3 is more representative of what we expect to see in subsequent quarters. We have excellent access for Trulicity across all payer segments and anticipate that continuing in 2021. Moving to Europe, revenue grew 8% excluding FX driven by 9% volume growth, partially offset by the negative effect of price; volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, and Taltz. In Japan, revenue growth of 6% excluding FX was driven by volume with Verzenio, Cyramza, Trulicity, Alimta, and Olumiant as key contributors to the growth. We were negatively impacted by purchasing patterns in Q3 in Japan by approximately 4 percentage points, which we expect to largely recover in Q4. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 15% excluding FX, led by 33% growth in China. The same information for our September year-to-date results at the bottom of the slide; as shown on Slide 12, our key growth products were once again the engine of our worldwide volume growth. These products drove 15.4 percentage points of volume growth this quarter, reinforcing our confidence in achieving our 2020 revenue goals. [Indiscernible] have experienced loss of exclusivity provided a drag of 700 basis points driven primarily by Cialis, as expected, we have seen a rapid erosion of Cialis sales following the entry of generics in the U.S. market at the end of September last year. So we expect that impact to begin to normalize in Q4 of this year. Slide 13 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $2.4 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 44% of total revenue, Q3 sales of growth products were impacted by inventory burn in the quarter of approximately -- $70 million with U.S. Trulicity comprising approximately $40 million of that total. Our diverse commercial portfolio of new medicines continue to drive growth that is well positioned in large and growing therapeutic areas. Within diabetes, Trulicity and Jardiance continue market leadership in the GLP-1 and SGLT2 classes respectively. In immunology, Taltz continues to perform well in psoriasis and new indications in rheumatology present opportunities for additional growth. In pain, Emgality continues its impressive uptake exiting Q3 with a market-leading 46% share of market from new to brand prescriptions in the U.S. Within oncology, Cyramza growth has accelerated over the past year and we are excited for the newly released overall survival data to drive additional use of Verzenio. Finally, I would like to highlight our newest launch product nasally administered glucagon, which is sold under the trade name Baqsimi. Baqsimi is an important new option for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia and unlike existing rescue therapies does not require reconstitution to administer. This is a significant improvement in user experience and exemplifies the type of innovation we strive to deliver to patients. The commercial uptake in the U.S. has been strong as Baqsimi already has 33% of new to brand prescriptions. We believe this product has the potential to grow the overall glucagon market. Slide 14 shows the year-over-year change in select lines of our income statement; focusing on our non-GAAP results, foreign exchange rates had a net modest negative impact on revenue and a modest positive impact on gross margin, operating expenses, operating income and EPS. On Slide 15, we provide an update on capital allocation aligned with our strategic priorities, between our business development activities, capital expenditures and internal investment in R&D, we invested over $11 billion in the first 9 months of the year to drive our future growth. Additionally, we have returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We continue to prioritize investment in the pipeline through both internal and external sources. Turning to our 2019 financial guidance on slide 16, you will see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect an increase in our bottom line results for the year. Specifically, we are updating the range for other income and deductions to $50 million of income to an expense of $100 million reflecting year-to-date gains in our equity portfolio, we are decreasing our tax rate from a range of 13% to 14% to 12% to 13% to reflect the net discrete tax benefit in the third quarter and we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share range to $5.75 per share to $5.85 per share reflecting those two items as our operating performance expectations remain on track with our prior full-year guidance. On a reported basis, the tax rate is expected to be in the range of 13% to 14% and earnings per share for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of $8.59 to $8.69 per share. We continue to progress towards our 2019 guidance and remain committed to delivering on our 2020 goals. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Josh. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 22nd, positive movement since our last earnings call includes the previously mentioned FDA approvals for [indiscernible] and FDA approval for new indication for Taltz, the European Commission approval for Trulicity rewind and the submission of Taltz for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. The U.S. submission of ultra-rapid Lispro, for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The U.S. submission of Flortaucipir for imaging agent in Alzheimer's, initiation of Phase III testing for mirikizumab in Crohn's disease, and the initiation of Phase 1 for 2 assets. In addition to the positive milestones, we delivered this quarter, we also announced disappointing results from the Phase III Sequoia trial, pegilodecakin in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Pegilodecakin plus FOLFOX failed to show benefit in overall survival compared to FOLFOX alone and is difficult to treat a deadly cancer. While this is a disappointing outcome for patients, we continue to move forward with pegilodecakin in lung and renal cancer, which we've always viewed as the key indications. Moving to Slide 18, since the last earnings call, we made progress on the number of key events; in addition to the previously highlighted approvals and submissions, Cyramza has been submitted for first-line EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. As Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, the third quarter was an exciting one for our oncology portfolio as we shared promising registrational data for selpercatinib [ph] which showed impressive objective response rates and durability of response data along with low treatment related discontinuation rates across RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer, RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and RET fusion positive thyroid cancer. We're excited about the opportunity for this first-in-class and potentially best in class RET inhibitor to help patients with cancer. These are the kind of results, we were hoping for when we planned the Loxo acquisition and we are extremely pleased with the progress of Loxo since then. We were also pleased to share the results of the Monarch 2 study at ESMO showing [indiscernible] delivered the largest median survival benefit to date in this setting, extending survival by 9.4 months. We also announced that Taltz demonstrated superiority versus in total skin clearance at 12 weeks for people living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and met all major secondary endpoints and Olumiant had a positive readout in atopic dermatitis in the third of five studies, which will support its global submissions; it continues to be a busy and productive year for our pipeline. Moving to Slide 19; last quarter we highlighted select Phase 2 opportunities, this quarter we'd like to highlight select Phase 1 molecules from our portfolio. As we continue to accelerate our internal discovery and development engine, by year-end we expected to have delivered more Phase 1 initiations in a single year than we have in any other year this decade. Importantly, these new Phase 1 entries represent a mix of internal discoveries from our own labs as well as external innovation that we have brought in through business development. We selected several Phase 1 molecule to highlight today. Let me start with another molecule from the Loxo Oncology acquisition the BTK inhibitor LOXO-305, which is a next-generation non-covalent reversible BTK inhibitor that does not depend on interacting with the cysteine-481 residue. We started dosing patients in a Phase 1 -- 2 study earlier this year in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The unmet need in this space continues to grow. Since more patients are treated with chronic recurrent BTK inhibitors, more and more patients become resistant or intolerant to therapy; LOXO-305 was built to be potent selective and have well behaved human pharmacology; should these attributes present in the clinic as we hope, LOXO-305 could be an important new therapy for these patients. As we announced in September. We plan to present data from the trial later this year. It will be a typical early clinical presentation from a dose escalation trial, including safety PK and any efficacy assessments that have been conducted. In neurodegeneration, last quarter we initiated with our collaborator AC Immune a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers for small molecule tau aggregation inhibitor. While still early in development, we're excited about this program and also about the target aggregated tau, of course aggregated tau along with amyloid plaque comprise the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, we remain excited about our 2 Phase II programs aimed at disease modification in Alzheimer's disease which is our anti-aggregated tau antibody and now especially tanezumab our entry PG antibody which is also in a Phase II trial designed to test efficacy in a carefully selected population. Both of these programs are now fully enrolled with tanezumab clearing an important interim futility analysis and we look forward to the final readouts for these trials in 2021. Moving to pain, earlier this year we acquired the rights to a novel small molecule somatostatin receptor type 4 agonist that's currently in Phase 1 as a potential non-opioid treatment for chronic pain. The clinical hypothesis here is that the known analgesic effects of somatostatin are mostly mediated by SSTR4, which is found in the dorsal root ganglia, a selective agonist for SSTR4 could therefore have an analgesic effect without peripheral somatostatin adverse effects. We look forward to the internal readout next year to inform the potential progression of Phase II. Pain is the number one reason people go to physicians and if you look at the opioid crisis, there is still significant unmet medical need. There is more work to do here, and I'm excited we're a leader in this space with a number of interesting mechanisms now being tested in patients by Lilly. Turning now to immunology; with 3 novel checkpoint agonists in Phase 1 with first-in-class potential BTLA agonist antibody CD200R agonist antibody and our PD-1 agonist antibody. These are all Immune resolution agents; when dampening down immune system with chronic immunosuppression, we're trying to potentially reset the immune system. These checkpoints exploit insights from immuno-oncology, but they work in a different direction as a checkpoint agonist, but the brake is on the immune system. BTLA is a novel checkpoint receptor that negatively regulates activation of BPDC and T cells; [indiscernible] at this pathway has the potential to provide a first-in-class treatment and our BTLA agonist antibody is currently being studied in Phase 1 b and lupus. CD200 is a key immune checkpoint that functions on both innate and adaptive immune system on many cell types involved in autoimmune skin disorders. Our CD200R agonist antibody is in a Phase 1 trial in both healthy volunteers as well as in atopic dermatitis patients. Finally, we know that treatment of cancers with PD-1 inhibitors leads to a variety of autoimmune conditions; it's hypothesized that a PD-1 agonist with suppress activation expansion of lymphocytes leading to treatment of autoimmune diseases. Our PD-1 agonist antibody is currently in Phase 1. Each of these 3 opportunities represents novel biology, which we are among the first to explore with the potential for each to move into Phase II next year. We also have an IL-2 conjugate license from Nektar Therapeutics which preferentially stimulates expansion of regulatory T-cells; this potentially first-in-class opportunity is currently being studied in Phase 1b in lupus patients with Phase 1 data in healthy volunteers presented at EULAR earlier this year, we show the IL2 conjugate could achieve robust expansion of additional Phase 1 studies in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have been posted to ClinicalTrials.gov and are expected to start up before the end of the year. We expect to move to Phase II with this molecule in 2020. Finally, I'd like to highlight two exciting diabetes programs. With our next generation injectable incretin GIP, GLP, glucagon, tri- agonist or GGG we're testing the hypothesis that adding glucagon to GIP/GLP will have more metabolic activity and stimulate additional weight loss. The initial Phase 1 study, to study the safety of a single injection in healthy participants and we're now studying multiple doses including dose titration. We expect this program to enter Phase II by late 2020 or early 2021; just like the hurdle for tirzepatide to enter Phase III was a meaningful improvement over Trulicity, the bar here will be a step change over tirzepatide itself. Additionally, our commitment to oral incretins has continued to increase as we advanced programs through development we seek to improve upon administration or efficacy. Our first oral incretin program which we licensed from Chugai last year is a small molecule non-peptide agonist of GLP-1 that entered Phase 1 earlier this year. Our initial focus will be on PK with the expectation that it should be meaningfully better than a peptide as well as the PD response, which we should see even in Phase 1, this molecule could enter Phase 2 in early 2021; in addition to this approach, we're also pursuing dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist peptides for oral delivery. These programs, which are designed to give tirzepatide like efficacy with a once-a-day oral peptide administration are also progressing preclinically and should enter Phase 1 next year. We look forward to tracking the progress of these assets over the coming years and we'll share additional pipeline updates on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A. Let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the third quarter. We delivered robust volume growth of 8% driven by our key growth products and an impressive performance outside the U.S. We continue to demonstrate our launch capabilities and have a diverse portfolio of commercial products to drive future growth. We advanced our productivity agenda controlling operating expenses while investing behind key commercial growth drivers and our late-stage pipeline. In addition, we made important progress toward our margin goals as the operating margin improved 60 basis points versus Q2, 2019 to 28.6%. We made important pipeline progress including the initiation of a new Phase 3 program with mirikizumab in Crohn's disease sharing new registrational data for Olumiant, Taltz, Verzenio, and selpercatinib submitting new indications for Taltz and Cyramza and receiving positive regulatory actions for Trulicity. Finally, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed $600 million of share repurchase as well. We are proud of our strong business performance and excited about the opportunities ahead for the company. There has never been a more inspiring time to be working on discovering new medicines and patients and healthcare providers are waiting the next wave of innovation. We have grown through the headwinds of Cialis and Lartruvo and we expect our strong business performance to continue driven by our newest products and a relative lack of patent exposure ahead and of course by the work of our scientists who continue to redefine with as possible for patients suffering from serious diseases. Looking ahead we are focused on a strong finish to 2019 as we prepare for next year. This concludes our prepared remarks and now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two or to a single question with 2 parts; please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much for the questions, just -- I guess first broader 2020 pricing questions, you're seeing price erosion with the U.S. portfolio this year; is that a reasonable dynamic to expect in 2020 or we'll see some of these pressures start to ease as we get past the donut hole fill and some of these kind of one-time items with Trulicity that you mentioned. And my second question was just elaborating a little bit more on Trulicity in terms of access and price dynamics in 2020, the pricing commentary in the prepared remarks is very helpful. I guess with the approval though of oral sema, are you seeing a more difficult payer environment here than in the past or any signs that payers are more aggressively managing the GLP-1 category. Thanks very much. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Josh for the overall 2020 pricing and then to Enrique for your second question more specifically on Trulicity. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Chris. I think as we look into 2020, just going back to the guidance that we gave in December of last year. So we were planning for sort of low single digit net price erosion across the portfolio for the period of '19 and '20. I think that's what we see right now. We are going to see variability in the quarters as you mentioned, we've got donut hole and other things that are particularly I think acute in Q3 of this year, but I think the net as we look and project into 2020 I think sort of low single digit price decline is probably a fair place to be and that's very consistent with how we thought about 2020 goals and our productivity agenda and otherwise. Dave Ricks : Thanks Josh, Enrique? Enrique Conterno : So Chris when it comes to Trulicity coverage, we have unprecedented access. We are right now in the mid '90s from a coverage perspective, which is outstanding and we are projecting that into next year. It is too early for us to be able to say exactly how the discussions of oral sema are going with payers, of course, we'll learn more they basically get further into some of those discussions. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Enrique and Chris thanks for the question. Next caller, please? Operator : And the next caller is from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I don't know how to ask my first one, but I'll ask anyways, given all the renewed interest. My question is on the A4 trial and I know you're using a super high dose of solanezumab tracked over 240 weeks. So my question is this, since this trial was fully enrolled about couple of years ago, what have we learned to date from any interim analysis that have been conducted and I ask because almost every patient in this trial has passed the week 76 follow-up. Thank you for any color on that. And then secondly on glip and tirzepatide -- broadly. My question is what's the median duration on therapy real world on Trulicity currently and I ask about it relative to the 20-week titration being employed in Phase 3, and I'm also curious, is there any observations to date from blinded basis in the ongoing titration regimen. Thank you very much. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Umer. We'll go to Dan for the solo question and then Enrique to talk about what we're seeing today with the duration for Trulicity. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Umer for your question on solanezumab and A4 trial, of course this is a trial of solanezumab as you pointed out for higher dose and it was tested in the original Phase 3 studies . But what's really interesting about this trial is that we're testing it in asymptomatic elderly individuals who don't have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, but do have amyloid plaque in their brain. It's a 4-year treatment that's planned and so we will get data on this trial in mid-2022. So we just have to wait patiently for those results to see if silicon have efficacy in this very early population. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Enrique? Enrique Conterno : So, when we look at Trulicity adherence and I think we've said this before, we tend to see better adherence with Trulicity than with other product. One of the things that we measure is refill rates. So, we measure the second refill rate, the fourth refill rate, Trulicity tends to have better adherence than the GLP-1 class, tends to have better adherence than insulin, but also better adherence than orals, which is sometimes difficult to believe but the value proposition is that simplicity; it's is a complicated -- question. When we look at medium duration of therapy, because we do lose so many patients in the first fill and in the second fill across all of the diabetes therapy. Just to give you a sense by the fourth fill, Trulicity is basically in the '60s, what we basically see though is for patients that have stayed after the first year, we tend to lose about a third of those patients every year going forward after that. So that gives you certain sense of what is the adherence of Trulicity as you're thinking about modeling this. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Enrique, and Umer, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please? Operator : Next is the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Just I'm wondering your latest thoughts on the ongoing policy discussions in DC [ph] potential outcomes in impact to your business. And then as we think about Emgality for 2020, I know you don't give product level guidance, but you've been focused on the second phase of growth year into the primary care market, any update on the progress there as well as the initial European launch. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Terence. We'll go to Dave for the policy question and then Patrik on Emgality in 2020. Dave Ricks : Yes, I wish I could provide a clear answer on the probable outcome of the policy debate in Washington, I think it's really unclear other than we probably know that the House bill will probably pass the House completely on partisan lines and then we'll see from there. There are of course a number of initiatives in the various Senate committees that the industry is [indiscernible] and Lilly certainly -- if a version of those came together and passed both chambers; in general that would be I think a modest positive for us. We see important discussion that should happen providing out of pocket cap to seniors is important benefit and any changes that can possibly adapt the donut hole math and other pieces of the benefit, which we're talking about even on this call are helpful for products that are more commonly used for conditions like diabetes, so we track that closely. We're very engaged in this whole discussion, of course probably given the environment in Washington, the most probable thing is there isn't really legislation happening for some time, but -- point to note to investors, where we're promoting changes in particular the Part D benefit and affordability measures that can impact the pocket book at the pharmacy counter without throwing out the baby with the bathwater in wholesale change to the U.S. system, which obviously be hugely damaging to the business model. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Patrik [ph]? Patrik Jonsson : Well, thank you very much. We are very pleased with the overall performance of Emgality and we actually became the leader in NRx in Q3 and we have been that for more than 10 consecutive weeks right now and we are also closing the gap in terms of total Rx. When we look upon the access to Emgality, it is a best-in-class access with more of the 90% today in the U.S. and we are making steady progress in terms of the claims paid and we are today -- the claims being paid. And we are making steady progress in that regard as well. We still believe it's very early days for Emgality. We know that we have population in the U.S. of 6 million eligible for preventive treatment and all the 3 million of those are being treated today and year-to-date, we have approximately 100,000 patients treated with Emgality. So we see a tremendous opportunity also moving forward, and also the prescriber base in U.S. is still limited, so only 15% of our customers are regularly prescribers of Emgality. So I think that signals very clearly the opportunity we foresee. We are also excited about the opportunity outside of U.S.; migraine is not a U.S. phenomenon. We had thought million patients suffering from migraine in EU and 9 million in Japan and only 2 million of those are treated in EU and 300,000 in Japan, it's still very early days and we have just received the regulatory approval from European Medical Agency and we are in pricing reimbursement discussion on accounted counter basis, but we believe that the opportunity for Emgality is big also outside of the U.S. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Patrik and Terence thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : Next is the line of Geoff Meacham [ph] with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, thanks for the question. I just have a couple. Josh on the SG&A side, are there opportunities for more cost savings looking forward beyond what you guys have talked about post the Elanco. So I'm just trying to get a sense for where the 3Q trends can be extrapolated and then Patrik another one on the migraine side. So I know obviously early in the launch, but can you leverage the access you just mentioned with Emgality to help benefit. I'm just trying to get a sense for the commercial synergies looking to 2020 and with the CGRP space being a little bit more crowded, how has the pricing environment been so far. Thank you. Kevin Hern : All right, thanks, Jeff. So, go to Josh for SG&A and then Patrik on the migraine. Josh Smiley : Okay, thanks. Jeff, welcome back. On SG&A, yes, I think if you look at what we see in Q3 and what we've been talking about relative to our productivity goals for 2020. We're pretty comfortable with the absolute level of investment we have behind our new launches. If you look at the last few Baqsimi, which I mentioned on the prepared comments and for example, we're putting those into existing infrastructure and we'll get good leverage there. So we'll continue to invest behind our key launches. But I think the absolute level of SG&A with our ongoing productivity efforts to get more out of each of the promotional dollars we spend, we feel pretty comfortable with that, so you should expect modest to flat growth going forward on that line. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Patrik? Patrik Jonsson : Well, thank you very much. We are also very excited with the approval of [indiscernible] and we are waiting for the DA to give overall assessment by January of next year and launching very early in 2020. Overall, we believe there is a significant need also in the acute treatment of migraine. We know that currently 5 million of Americans are being treated for acute migraine, but 35% to 40% of those don't respond or can't tolerate the triptans and approximately 15% of those are contraindicated for triptans, so that's why we believe it's really a tremendous opportunity of the 2 decades to launch a new oral treatment for acute migraine. We see some significant synergies with Emgality both in terms of access and the overall infrastructure and particularly being able to capitalize on the learnings that we have had with the launch of Emgality since the beginning of 2018, where we have rapidly been able to take a leadership position, not just in terms of access, but also in terms of the NRx and closing the gap in TRx. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Patrik. Jeff. Thanks for the questions. Next caller, please. Operator : Is the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I'd like to come back to 2020 and contracting and diabetes. I know you were asked this earlier, but you didn't give much of an answer, the stock down 5% today on a beat and raise. I think that reflects concerns about whether you can hit your operating margin guidance in 2020. The outlook for diabetes, so specifically on diabetes you're in this window of kind of having an idea of where your coverage is going to be for Trulicity and Jardiance in terms of net live gains or lost and what the price -- so, can you just hopefully give us a little more detail on how we should be thinking about Trulicity specifically and Jardiance as well going into 2020, because there have been changes in the competitive dynamics there. Second question, just going back to Alzheimer's, it seemed like a couple of years ago, Lilly started to quietly pivot away from thinking that any monotherapy that's anti-amyloid would yield the benefit and you started to really go down this combination route, given what Biogen disclosed yesterday and your ongoing work in this area. Just how are you thinking about monotherapy in the anti-amyloid space and really anything you can offer, your impressions of the news yesterday would be helpful. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Tim. So we'll go to Josh for outlook for 2020 and then to Dan for the question on Alzheimer's. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Tim. As we said in the opening, I think if you look at Trulicity and strip out the things that we see in Q3 that we say are concentrated in that quarter. We feel good as Enrique mentioned, feel very good about the access that we have now and the access we project into 2020 and as we said, you should think about Trulicity at a modest year-over-year price decline, which is really just a function of modest price increases and we like the price and the value that have in the U.S. today. So we'll do everything we can to preserve that and we feel confident as we head into 2020 that that's a very manageable dynamic. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Tim For the question. Of course, with respect to the amyloid hypothesis and the Biogen data. I think there was a lot of thinking about this when they announced their utility, that the main question was whether or not there was evidence that if you removed significant amount of -- brain. This could result in a slowing of cognitive decline, so everyone was sort of waiting to see with the very highest doses where there was high level of amyloid removal what would happen. So I think the data we saw yesterday, from that respect is an important indicator on the amyloid hypothesis. We've thought for some time that complete removal of amyloid from the brain could be the goal here, doing it in early in the right patients could be important and that underlined the design of our trial with -- which we said should be able to remove plaque more quickly and more deeply than anything else we've seen. So I think yesterday's news is reason to be a little more optimistic about that theory. And as I said before, we're excited to see the results of that Phase 2 trial; with respect to your question on combination therapy, indeed we do think that combination therapy is an important avenue in Alzheimer's disease. I think we're the first and probably the only company to have tried a combination of two disease modifying therapies, unfortunately we had to stop that, one of the therapies was a base inhibitor, which proven not to be a productive avenue of investigation. But given that we have both tau and amyloid approaches, I think combination in the future is a very rational approach for Alzheimer's. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. And thanks for your question. Next caller, please? Operator : Next is Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My first question here is when you first gave your 2020 revenue outlook or your long-term revenue guidance, what did you assume for Skyrizi an oral semaglutide and how have those launches proceeded relative to your expectations there. And then second question is, how do you think the data readouts from ESMO impact your thinking on the commercial opportunity for Verzenio, is there more growth left in the U.S. and how much can your share increase with this positive data. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Louise. We'll go to Dave for the 2020 revenue question and then Verzenio [ph]. Dave Ricks : Louise, thanks for the question. Of course, we set the 2020 guidance in the middle of 2016. So many of the products were facing competition from etcetera today were a twinkle in the eye of the inventors back then and including some of our own launches at that time. We set the guidance because we thought there was a distance between what the people who do your work and the company thought about the long-term prospects, not line by line, but looking at a portfolio of opportunities that existed in front of us, of course, our ability to predict any one competitive situation or product uptake for Lilly is not perfect, but at that time we did project that we would launch 10 medicines by the end of ' 19 in the first five years of that period and that because of the profound nature of those opportunities, we were confident we would find a way to grow the company; at that point, the pharma business 6%, Elanco a bit slower. We've actually raised that to 7% and I think we're closing in on achieving that goal despite the fact that probably how we predicted we get there is at the same way we have. But I think that was the nature of the exercise back then and I think we successfully closed the gap and understanding in terms of what the opportunity for the company to grow was during that time, so we're proud of that achievement. If we look at the competitive threats we face across our big products, of course that are there. I would just point out as well though that Trulicity volume growth in the U.S. was over 40% in Q3. That's in the face of a year and a half of Ozempic and that Taltz volume growth was substantial as well in the face of the uptake and in both those cases, it's important to understand that there is far more growth opportunity left in the classes we're participating in than share erosion threat to our [indiscernible]. Final comment on all this because I know there's lot of interest in the Q3 pricing dynamics on Taltz and Trulicity most of those effects were determined early in 2018 and are now manifesting themselves in Q3 of '19 whether it'd be the donut hole law change, which affect both of them. The rates we contracted on in the commercial mergers that occurred in the payer space or the contracting in the case of Trulicity and what we knew were lower price segments, but a good volume and of course at the margin are highly productive for us to make sure patients in VA DoD, those segments can reach our products. So just to put a perspective on all that long-winded answer but thanks for the question and maybe we address. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, I would be very happy to. So, thanks Louise for the question and quarter-over-quarter Q3 U.S. sales were up 19% since Q2 and Q3 monthly sales look very strong as well. So we do believe that we are seeing growth from the outstanding survival results that we released and we do hope that we all see some growth for the CDK 4/6 market, although it may be in the single-digit area; for us here at Lilly, this is a relaunch of Verzenio. So the top priority for our team is to ensure that doctors, particularly those in the U.S. are aware of these statistically significant OS data nearly 10 months of survival benefit and we'll work with them to share that benefit the patients can have from Verzenio. And we do know that oncologists are data driven and we have extremely compelling data and a very strong commercial team that will ensure that we get the word out. So we do hope very much to increase our share of market, obviously not all of the competitors in this space have been able to demonstrate statistically significant results and so we'll make sure that that data is well communicated, particularly we're going to encourage physicians to identify patients that are likely to do worse. So, you probably saw that data that we released at ESMO on where the cancer recurred or when it recurred and those patients do particularly well on Verzenio with some very robust results. Again we see that as a differentiator as well from some of the competition. And we do know that physicians and patients number one goal is survival and we've been able to deliver now, as I said nearly 10 months of a survival benefit, which is really remarkable in this setting. And I think really a bit of a game changer for this molecule. So we look forward to next year. And then just to comment a little bit outside the U.S. and additional good growth in the US, we're seeing a great portion of our growth come from outside the U.S., particularly in Japan and we just got the updated data that in combination in first-line in combination of aromatase inhibitors, we have a 30% share now and in the second line in combination of 45% share. So really outstanding work by our Japan team and a good growth there. And then great work in Europe as well with continued uptake, strong patient uptake in UK, France and Germany and many countries now having reimbursement and often running. So, as we look forward to next year with Verzenio and continue to grow based on this we think very significant contribution to this important medicine. Kevin Hern : Louise, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please. Operator : Is the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead. Navin Jacob : Great, thanks for taking the questions. You gave a lot of color on Trulicity and the pricing dynamics there, just on Taltz. I'm wondering if we could get similar sort of color, specifically UNH recently excluded Taltz from its 2020 formulary help us understand how the access looks for 2020 as you go into those discussions. Do you see any pressure there from some of the other newer entrants and second question on Jardiance, you have a couple of trials reading out over the next few years. The drug trials and heart failure; how are you thinking about that opportunity, are those trials meant to bolster the profile of Jardiance in the diabetes market or do you actually view the heart failure opportunities as a individual stand-alone opportunity. And if so, could you help us understand if this could be a blockbuster opportunity by itself and then associated with that wondering if the six-minute function tests are fileable by themselves. Thank you very much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Navin. We'll go to Patrik for the question on Taltz and then Enrique for the question about Jardiance. Patrik Jonsson : Well, thank you very much. Access continues to be our challenge in the field of immunology in the US, but we will continue to ensure that through a combination of Taltz clear access program and contract with payers that we continue to ensure that patients get the access to whenever they need. If we look specifically into 2020, we expect 2020 to be similar to 2019 and incrementally better in some areas, and we know that not all plans -- drug benefits gains of 2020, as we believe we are entering into 2020 we have positive momentum and with Taltz now replacing Cosentyx as a preferred IL-17 we've had core formularies, which is covering more than 14 million lives in the U.S. So in an essence we believe 2020 to be very similar to 2019. But we have some incrementally better areas. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Patrik, Enrique. Enrique Conterno : So we do see heart failure for Jardiance as a significant opportunity for us. I think you described it as a blocks status type of potential, and I think that's right; clearly, we do have a lot of opportunity for Jardiance in type 2 diabetes. So heart failure is on top of the opportunity in type 2 diabetes. We do have when it comes to the six minute walk test, we have a read out later this year. You asked whether we believe that data would be fileable with the FDA and we believe that we can get that data on our label. Clearly the outcome studies are also critical for us and they will be coming at the end of next year and then in early 2021, so very significant opportunity for Jardiance and for patients. Dan Skovronsky : And this is Dan. I could just also add in that we are studying Jardiance in chronic kidney disease and Phase III trial that will read out in 2022. Just another exciting opportunity there. Kevin Hern : Thank you. Navin, thanks for your questions. And next caller, please. Operator : The next is Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much. So just a couple of quick questions, first for the diabetes market. Enrique can you just help us understand the mix of payers, how that might be changing from a Trulicity perspective in terms of the next incremental script gained. And then similarly, where is Trulicity gaining the most traction incrementally amongst physicians, is it now really the growth driver growing beyond the ENDO market and pushing into the primary care physician portion of the market. The reason that I ask that is because I think the mix of payers is really important relative to the incremental acquisition cost for each script considering the competition from an oral drug obviously moving and seeking to penetrate the primary care market. The other question is really a kind of bigger picture question on business development. I think Dave, you've said in the past that the focus now that Lilly has launched several successful products in the market today is to really reload the Phase 2 and the Phase 3 pipeline. Can you just give us a sense of where your focus, do you feel like the current Phase 1 pipeline is sufficient to advance there or is the focus more so or equally on areas outside and maybe you can just give us a sense of where you're most excited about the science going forward. Thanks. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Enrique first for the question on Trulicity mix of payers and then Dave for your question on business development . Enrique Conterno : Seamus continues to grow across all payers. So whether it's commercial or Part D, of course as we've highlighted, we had this proportionate growth in the VA and DoD and other types of payers that tend to be lower price. But as we look at the future, we do continue to expect growth for the product across all of the different payers. When it comes to primary care, we do see the class continue to grow across all segments and in particular Trulicity has been growing quite a bit when it comes to reaching more primary-care physicians. So a big part of the growth is just having more primary-care physicians try -- new try a GLP-1 and start using and adopting this important class and because of the simplicity of Trulicity, it is an ideal product for that. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Enrique. Dave? Dave Ricks : Yes, thanks for the question on capital allocation in VD. You have a right that we see a significant investment in our own labs, in our own efforts is very important. And we've had good success comment on Phase 1 starts this year as an example, we aggressively want to complement that with outside opportunities really it all phases of development and across all therapeutic areas. Now, of course, our opportunities to add value and find value are not uniform across stages of development or therapeutic areas and so that does skew our work in our effort there. But we are open-minded about all -- we operated in and all phases of development, where we can add value and find value, those are the most exciting and attractive opportunities. Of course, this year we did our largest acquisition ever with Loxo Oncology on the one end, on the other end you saw a nice tuck into our pain portfolio with another, we don't come at this with any particular financial framework, other than finding value and of course valuations and biotech have dropped a little bit lately. So, that always helps the equation. They've been pretty high over the last 18 months prior to that, so we continue to look at all mechanisms -- in all phases and probably because of the number of opportunities, I've said this before, you will see is active in oncology, that's where a lot of early stage biotech is and earlier because that's where more of the opportunities lie. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : Next is the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead . David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. So I just wanted to go back to the target. So with respect to the 31% operating margin target for 2020 that was reiterated today the street isn't quite there. I don't think I think it's just a tad bit below 31%. What is your sense that the street is over projecting in terms of costs, i.e., where do you think the cost will be lower than what the street is currently assuming. And then with respect to the revenue target that was provided in the second quarter slide, are you still comfortable with that $23.6 billion figure for 2020. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We will go to Josh for both of those questions. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Dave. On the targets themselves and margins, I think if you look at how we've progressed since we've established those margins, what you've been seeing multiple hundred basis point improvements per year and this year we were clear in saying that wasn't going to be the case, because of the Cialis overhang that we faced this year. So I think when we look at in 2020 and of course, everybody has got different, different models, I think it's a combination probably of where we see revenue and how we think we can manage cost again as I mentioned earlier on a prior question. We feel good about the overall SG&A investments that we have. So as we lose the overhang from Cialis and Lartruvo, the volume gains that we're seeing in the new product portfolio and the price that we're projecting gets us I think in a much better growth position on the top line with modest growth on operating expense line. So again we're confident, we've reiterated, as you know we raised this this number a little bit, we reiterated every opportunity we have that we will get there. I think it's probably just a function of both top line and more modest increases in operating expense. But again, that is very much in the context of the competitive dynamics we face and with the large growth opportunities we have long-term, we are going to invest behind those. In terms of the revenue piece, I think the answer again is the same as you look at how the portfolios performing on an underlying basis this year where we're confident in the minimum number that we need to achieve in order to get to the 7% compound annual growth rate target that we've outlined. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Dave, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please. Operator : In the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. And Dave for investors who choose to be skeptical this quarter has provided things to point to, so you explained Trulicity and Taltz, but Basaglar and Alimta also fell short. The beat was tax rate driven as was the 2019 guidance raise, Enrique is departing at a not ideal time. So, why should we be confident that the weaknesses are temporary, the tax rate lowering will create a tough compare in 2020 since one-time factors occur once and that Enrique's departure doesn't portend difficulty ahead in diabetes. So that's the first question. And with the stock unusually weak this year and given your confidence in the outlook, why not take this opportunity to be more aggressive with share repurchase. Why isn't this a phenomenal opportunity. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve, we'll go to Dave for the first handful of questions and then Josh on the share repurchase. Dave Ricks : Yes. Great. Steve, thanks for the question. We of course have an answer to all of those things. And honestly, I don't think there has been a more interesting and exciting time to be in this company or more optimistic time and we went through many of those reasons today. We are broad portfolio products that are new in a life cycle with Cialis behind us remembering that Cialis is a 6.0 growth headwind over the last 4 quarters, that's ending now coupled with the one-time price effects, which we went through today, which we really believe are substantially one time either a step-down on the big mergers with our payers or the one-year effect of the donut hole which falls disproportionately on companies like Lilly, who have retail oriented products and then we look ahead in diabetes. I have to be honest, I think the diabetes pipeline, the growth opportunities ahead whether it be with Jardiance or Trulicity [ph] has never been stronger for the company. So I'll let Enrique answer the question on his timing, but I think he is leaving on top and there is another level to get to in Lilly Diabetes that's certainly how I feel I think of course every category we're in, we've talked about, we compete with companies, some of the bigger than ours. Some of them more focused, because we have more opportunities than the average company out there and that doesn't mean that every quarter, every line item we're going to nail our goals. So I think we're honest with ourselves about that, but we have more than half a dozen products that get scale in a significant way and given our base of pharma revenue, I think that continues to offer a unique situation and then you couple that with margin expansion, which were convicted on as per the prior question and given our placement in the league table there, certainly we have upside on that one as the topline scales. I can't think of a better place to work in this industry, to be honest, we've got a great opportunity ahead. Now on share buyback, I'll let Josh address that, but certainly that has been our thinking. We've done aggressive share buyback this year as we think about sources of cash etcetera that's clearly on our list. And when we have that discussion with the board, I'm sure that will be key topic as we planned capital allocation over the coming years. Enrique you want to touch on your retirement. I think it's probably worth a mention here. Enrique Conterno : Look I'm sad to be leaving and retiring from Lilly. We're very proud I think of the business that we've build in diabetes as good as I feel about building the business together with all of my colleagues, I feel even stronger about the bright future that diabetes has and Lilly has ahead. Just I think about Trulicity, Jardiance great momentum, leadership brands, but with important catalysts when it comes to Trulicity on rewind and the higher doses and when it comes to Jardiance of course heart failure and CKD on top of the opportunity in type 2 diabetes, and I continue to feel very bullish about what tirzepatide could do on both the efficacy and the tolerability profile. So very exciting time for us in diabetes overall and I couldn't be more excited about the future of Lilly Diabetes. Josh Smiley : Thank you. Yes, just a couple of points; it's Josh. On share repurchase. As Steve, just to remind everybody, we did $3.5 billion share repurchase in the first half of this year, we did 600 million in the third quarter and as you say, when we see opportunities on the margins to create value, we're going to be opportunistic in share repurchase. Of course, we want to be balanced here as we mentioned in the comment, we want to ensure we've got the capital capacity to invest in the pipeline and business development opportunities when we see them. But, yes, you should expect that when we see outsized movements will to do what we can. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Josh. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you, couple of questions please. In relation to tau you spoke about access for next year. You didn't talk about pricing net pricing. Perhaps you could talk to that, given it's predominantly a commercial market. I'm assuming the rebating we've seen which looks like 40% is only going to go one way, I note that your 25% higher rebate and your net price on our calculations at least is down 16% year-on-year. So color on where it goes in 2020 will be helpful. And then second, again on net pricing in relation to Trulicity, we estimate that about 25% of Trulicity is Part D, based by volume, I'm obviously coming from point of view of trying to work out the contribution of the additional donut hole impact versus other factors, if you confirm how close we are to where it is, that would be very helpful. Many thanks. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Andrew. We'll go to Patrik for the question -- Josh cover both. Josh Smiley : Okay. Thanks, Andrew. On Taltz -- the Taltz pricing dynamics are a little bit different than Trulicity as Patrik mentioned I think earlier as we've talked about in other calls, about a third of our prescriptions now, just given the access challenges we have are not reimbursed or Lilly ends up being the primary payer. So as we get incremental access, you see interesting price moves here. So we're happy to gain access in pay rebates for that volume because we're transitioning patients in some cases from free product to reimbursed product. That being said, there are other cases where the product may not be on formulary, but as we work through PA process and other things, we end up ultimately getting 100% reimbursement. So I think as you look at that piece, you're going to see it will be a little bit more difficult in Taltz to translate prescriptions to net price. All that being said, I think if you look in the third quarter, the biggest dynamic we saw for Taltz on price was similar to Trulicity and that we saw a prior period adjustment and again this is just estimating the rebate liability and as we looked over the preceding 12 months as we get invoices in we had to make an adjustment there that in total when we look at the sort of in quarter adjustment, it was about 20 points of prices as well, so we don't see that going forward. I think as you look into 2020 as Patrik mentioned we've got some opportunities to gain some incremental access and that will show up at some price concession, but it's more than compensated for and volume. So we see a relatively sort of steady price but lots of things moving around under the water. I think on Trulicity your estimates are good, about 30% of Trulicity right now is in Medicare Part D. We see that probably as pretty stable going forward and as we mentioned we see that the pricing environment on a contracted basis as being pretty stable as we head into 2020 as well. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Andrew, thanks for the questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The line of Damien Conover [ph] with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the Taltz study that showed encouraging data head to head versus Tremfya at 12 weeks. And it looks like there is a 24-week secondary endpoint coming up and my question is, is there any data points coming up after 24 weeks maybe pushing into 48 weeks and I ask that because of the eclipse data that showed favorable data from Tremfya versus a different IL-17 but really didn't show the strong data until week 48 and I just wondering how you're looking at Taltz position against Tremfya in those sort of longer duration of treatment. And then maybe a follow-up to that is when you position the product for physicians, is the quick response or potentially a longer response more important from your marketing perspective. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Okay, thanks. Patrik? Patrik Jonsson : Well, thank you very much. We are extremely excited obvious first superiority to try out of an IL-17 over an IL-23 and we just got the data published a couple of weeks ago. So we are now in the phase of disseminating this data among healthcare providers in the U.S. and the rest of the world. The 12 weeks as you said and we shared or showed the superiority both in terms of onset of action and clearance; of the next data cut will be at the week 24 and that is driven by the fact that we have seen also the IL-23 they peak in terms of efficacy pretty much at that time. If we look into the key attributes, particularly among patients treated psoriasis, its onset of action, its clearance and its durability. And I think this was a third Phase 3 trial that we have to confirm that Taltz is superior both STELARA and now Tremfya in terms of both onset of action and the end clearance, and we have 5 years data confirming the durability of efficacy as well, we really believe that there is a lot of good momentum with Taltz right now. Dave Ricks : I would just add, you mentioned another IL-17, but we don't see these two IL-17 as similar and it's interesting to note that all our competitors who are doing IL-17 comparisons are choosing Cosentyx and not Taltz. I'm certain today, no one has actually compared any other psoriasis medicine to Taltz and I think that tells you a lot about the powerful efficacy that we deliver with this leading medicine. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Damien, thanks for the questions. And we'll go to Dave for the close. Dave Ricks : Great. Well, we appreciate everyone's participation today and your interest in the company. As I said earlier, we've made meaningful progress thus far in 2019 and we're committed to our revenue and operating margin goals in '19 as well as in '20. While we continue to invest in our innovation-based strategy with a diversified and volume driven revenue growth from one of the freshest portfolios in the industry and complemented by a pipeline full of exciting opportunities, some of which Dan commented on today , we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. Thanks again for dialing in. And please follow up with the IR team if you have questions, we didn't address in today's call. Have a good day.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2019 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio Medicines and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We're also joined by Kim Macko and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-K's, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products in pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2018 and 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2018. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our Q4 results. Dave Ricks : Thanks Kevin. 2019 was a solid year for Lilly and our strong Q4 financial results highlight the strength of the underlying business. We exited 2019 with momentum and will continue to focus on executing our strategy in 2020, which is to deliver excellent business results, develop and launch new medicines for patients and drive increased productivity. Revenue growth accelerated in Q4 increasing 8% versus Q4 2018 or 9% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven entirely by volume, which contributed 10 percentage points of growth despite continued headwinds from the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of Cialis and the global withdrawal of Lartruvo. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, worldwide volume growth was an impressive 15%. Newer medicines continue to be our growth engine representing 46% of our revenue this quarter. We made good progress in Q4 on our productivity agenda, as operating income grew 10% versus last year. We posted strong revenue growth and held marketing, selling and administrative expenses flat versus last year, while increasing our investment in R&D.  Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%, an improvement of 40 basis points versus Q4 2018. We finished 2019 with a full year operating margin slightly below our guidance of approximately 28% as we made targeted, strategic investments in Q4 across both our commercial portfolio and pipeline, which will enhance our opportunities for future growth. These investments provide good momentum heading into 2020 and keep us on track to achieve our 31% operating margin target this year.  We\u2019ve announced multiple pipeline milestones since our Q3 earnings call. These include positive results in the remaining two Phase III trials of the baricitinib BREEZE-AD program in atopic dermatitis, the submission of selpercatinib in the U.S. and Europe, and the FDA granting selpercatinib a priority review; the submission of tanezumab for OA pain in the U.S., in collaboration with Pfizer; the submission of higher doses of Trulicity in the U.S. and Europe, and the submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in Europe and Japan. During Q4 we put our strong operating cash flow to work, returning approximately $900 million to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. In addition, as previously announced we increased our dividend 15% for 2020. This marks the second consecutive year of a 15% dividend increase, reflecting our confidence in the outlook for the business.  Finally, we recently announced the pending acquisition of Dermira. The company focused on developing new therapies for chronic skin conditions. Dermira is an exciting \u2013 has an exciting asset Phase III for atopic dermatitis, baricitinib in addition to the currently marketed products for excessive underarm sweating, QBREXZA. This transaction enhances our Phase III pipeline and complements our existing efforts in atopic dermatitis with baricitinib. We look forward to closing that transaction here in Q1. Moving to slide five, you\u2019ll see the list of key events since our last earnings call. In our continued efforts to help make medicines more affordable and reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients, we recently announced plans to introduce two additional lower priced insulins, Humalog\u00ae Mix75/25 KwikPen and Humalog Junior KwikPen, both products will be available by mid-April and will be offered at a 50% lower list price compared to the branded versions. Once these additional options are available more than 90% of Lilly\u2019s Humalog options will be accessible to help patients reduce their out-of-pocket costs, and we hope to see payers provide increased access to patients for these solutions.  During the month of December alone Insulin Lispro helped nearly 79,000 patients in the U.S. These recent addition complement existing offerings in the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center which currently helps as many as 20,000 patients per month better afford their insulin. As a company that has been in business for over 140 years, it invests over $5 billion per year in long term research and development, we take our responsibility to pursue sustainable business, social and environmental practices very seriously.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q4 results and to provide an update on our 2020 financial results. Josh Smiley : Thanks Dave. Slide six summarizes our presentation of GAAP results to non-GAAP measures, and slide seven provides a summary of our GAAP results.  So looking at the non-GAAP measures on slide eight, you\u2019ll see revenue increase 8% or 9% in constant currency. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 70 basis points to 79.9%. Excluding the impact of FX on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79.6% and on the same basis our gross margin percent decreased by approximately 50 basis points compared to Q4, 2018, driven by unfavorable product mix and the negative impact of price on revenue. Moving down the P&L, operating expenses grew 6% versus last year's quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were flat as cost containment and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products.  R&D expenses increased 14%, reflecting higher develop expenses for late stage access, including tirzepatide, selpercatinib and mirikizumab. Operating income increased 10% compared to Q4, 2018 and sales growth outpaced expense growth, resulting in an operating income as a percent of revenue of 26.3% for the quarter and 27.2% for the full year.  This quarter's results are indicative of the potential for growth and margin expansion our portfolio of new medicines offers. We are well positioned to drive top-tier revenue growth and invest in the next wave of new medicines, while driving margin expansion at the same time. We exit 2019 with significant momentum executing our strategy and are on track to achieve our 2020 full year operating margin target of 31%.  Other income and expense was income of $206 million this quarter compared to income of $31 million in Q4, 2018, driven by investment gains on public equity. As we highlighted previously, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Gains in Q4 were primarily generated by our investments in China biotech companies through our Lilly Asia Ventures ARM and strategic investments in companies focused in newer technologies like RNAi. While we appreciate the gains, we are even more pleased with the relationships and the potential to develop new medicines for patients that accompany some of these investments. Our tax rate was 12.6%, a decrease of 300 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by an increase in net discrete tax benefits, including tax benefits from the resolution of U.S. and foreign orders. At the bottom line net income increased 26%, while earnings per share increased 31%, due to a reduction in shares outstanding from share repurchases.  Slide nine outlines the same non-GAAP measures for the full year. While we are excited with our performance in Q4 and the momentum headed into 2020, we are also pleased with our overall performance for the full year in 2019. Last year we experienced the full effect of the Cialis patent expiration and the impact of the withdrawal of Lartruvo.  In spite of these headwinds we grew the top-line at 5% in constant currency and generated EPS growth of 11%, while investing behind our newer products and pipeline. We are also generating good shareholder value and established a strong strategic foundation, through our split-off of Elanco and the acquisition of Loxo Oncology. As we highlighted in December last year, we are well positioned in 2020 to deliver our five your financial goals and continue this period of sustained growth. Moving to slide 10, you will find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details are provided on slides 26 and 27. On slide 11, we quality the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 9% in constant currency during Q4, driven by strong volume growth of 10% partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest negative impact on revenue growth. For the fourth straight year we delivered worldwide revenue growth each quarter despite headwinds from patent expirations. U.S. revenue grew 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, volume growth of 8% was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio, Jardiance and Emgality. Excluding Cialis and Lartruvo, volume grew over 50.  Pricing was a 1% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, impacted by increased funding during coverage gap in Medicare, unfavorable changes in estimates for rebates and discounts and disproportionate volume growth in lower net price segment, which was partially offset by the net of modest list price increases and higher rebates, as well as reduce reliance on patient assistance program, primarily due to improved commercial access for Emgality. The full year impact of price was a headwind of 3% consistent with our 2019 and 2020 expectations for U.S. price having a moderate drag on revenue growth.  Moving to Europe, revenue grew 12% in constant current, driven by impressive 15% volume growth, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and price. Volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio. We are pleased with the uptake of our new products across Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2020.  In Japan revenue grew 7% in constant currency, driven entirely by volume growth, somewhat offset by a modest pricing headwind due to the government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2019. Verzenio, Cymbalta, Trulicity and Olumiant were the key contributors to grow.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 14% in constant currency led by 44% growth in China on the same basis. China growth was driven by strong performance across a number of key products, including Tyvyt, so we are excited about the recent launches of Trulicity, Taltz and Olumiant. The same information for our full year revenue is at the bottom of the slide.  As shown on slide 12, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 15 percentage points of growth this quarter, continuing the strong trajectory we've seen throughout 2019.  Brands that have experienced loss of exclusively provided a drag of over 400 basis points driven primarily by Cialis. As a reminder, generic tadalafil entered the U.S. market in September 2018, significantly impacting Cialis revenue, with erosion further accelerating in Q2 2019 as multisource generics entered the market. While the impact of this event is beginning to sunset, it\u2019s still had a meaningful negative impact on growth in Q4, 2019.  Slide 13 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total these brands generated over $2.8 billion of revenue this quarter making up 46% of revenue. Our newest medicines again had impressive results in large and growing therapeutic areas and our ability to reach more patients continues to demonstrate the strength of our commercial execution. Within diabetes, the injectable GLP-1 class continues to add new patients despite the entry of the new oral therapy. In the U.S. total injectable clip prescriptions grew 29% versus Q4, 2018 and Trulicity grew faster than the market, hosting an increase of 32% in total prescriptions during that same period.  Net pricing in the U.S. for Trulicity declined in the mid-single digits in-line with our expectations for Q4 and for 2020. As we discussed on the Q3 call Trulicity price in Q1 through Q3 of 2019 with impacted by a number of factors that we don't expect to persist in 2020. SGLT2 inhibitors accelerated their trajectory as full U.S. prescription for the class grew nearly 20% versus last year\u2019s quarter and new therapy starts grew over 46% as the market leader Jardiance continues to drive strong class growth and accounts for over 55% of total prescription.  Our sustained market leadership in these two important and growing classes within diabetes is a competitive advantage for our diabetes business and positions us well for future growth. In analogy Taltz continues to have growth as U.S. total prescriptions grew nearly 40% versus Q4 2018. Despite an increasingly competitive market, Taltz gained over three share points in dermatology during 2019 and rheumatology weekly prescriptions have more than doubled during that same time frame.  In 2020 we look to build on the strong momentum demonstrated in 2019 and reach even more patient. In pain, Emgality continued its U.S. leadership and share of market for new to brand prescription at over 47%. While pleased with the uptake, we believe there is room for significant additional grow as we expand our commercial presence in primary care. We continue to see progress with roughly 80% of prescriptions reimbursed at the end of Q4, reflecting the strong access of Emgality.  Within oncology, Verzenio U.S total prescriptions grew over 46% versus Q4 2018 and the CDK four and six markets is showing encouraging growth as total prescriptions increase by over 16% during the same timeframe. Additionally Cyramza continued to post solid growth as we realize the rapid synergies across our portfolio.  In addition to the strong performance of our key growth drivers and look forward to potentially launching three new medicines in 2020, with Rayvow, selpercatinib and Ultra Rapid Lispro. We believe all three new medicines have potential to be first in class or best in class and to improve the lives of patients. In addition, launching new medicines in to therapeutic areas where we have existing commercial infrastructure will support further margin expansion.  Slide 14, shows the year-over-year change in select lines of our income statement, focusing on our non-GAAP results, foreign exchange rates had a moderate \u2013 negative impact on revenue, gross margin, operating income and EPS, and a moistest net positive impact on operating expenses.  On slide 15 we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2019 we invested over $13 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition we returned approximately $7 billion to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. As Dave mentioned earlier, we also announced the 15% dividend increase for the second consecutive year, showing our confidence and the outlook for the company.  We're focused on utilizing the strong cash flow our business generates to develop the next wave of new medicines through both internal and external sources, that\u2019s highlighted by the recently announced acquisition of Dermira. We remain active in assessing bolt-on acquisitions or in-licensing where we can create shareholder value and enhance our future grow prospectus.  Turning to our 2020 financial guidance on slide 16, you'll see that we've updated our non-GAAP guidance to reflect the impact of the planned acquisition of Dermira and a recent strong business performance. Specifically we're increasing our revenue range by $100 million to include QBREXZA and to reflect strong prescription trends we see in the underlying business.  Updating our SG&A guidance to accounts for the addition of the Dermira sales force and the commercial expenses to support QBREXZA and maintaining all other line items and confirming our non-GAAP earnings per share range of $6.70 to $6.80, an operating margin target of 31%.  On a reported basis the impact of the Dermira acquisition will have an impact $0.21 and earnings per share for 2020 is now expected to be in the range of $6.18 to $6. 28. We continue to execute our innovation based strategy while leveraging our young commercial portfolios of new medicine to drive margin expansion over the mid-term. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Josh. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 27. Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the submission of selpercatinib in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the initiation of Phase III for selpercatinib in patients with RET Fusion-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer. The submission of tanezumab in the U.S. for osteoarthritis pain, the submission of higher doses of Trulicity for Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. and Europe, the submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in Europe and Japan; the addition of lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis to the Phase III portfolio pending the closure of the Dermira acquisition; the initiation of a Phase III of Tirzepatide in obesity and a Phase II study Tirzepatide in NASH; the initiation of Phase II for our checkpoint agonist, CD200R in immunology and the initiation of Phase I for four assets, as well as the termination of three early stage oncology assets.  In addition, we had some important early stage readouts, including LOXO-305 our novel BTK inhibitor, which we highlighted on the 2020 financial guidance call and continues to progress quickly in development. We also had internal data readouts from to Phase II trials, of pegilodecakin in combination with immunotherapy agents in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, CYPRESS 1 and CYPRESS 2. Although the full data will be presented at a medical meeting later this year, I can say that both studies were negative.  So we are disappointed in the lack of efficacy for pegilodecakin in combination with checkpoint inhibition in lung cancer, we remain committed to finding new therapies for people with cancer. Although we are still analyzing the totality of the data that we have obtained with pegilodecakin, at present we do not anticipate additional trials with this agent.  Moving to slide 18, we show a final tally of how we finished 2019 versus the key events we expected to occur. 2019 was a very productive year and we made significant progress in bringing new medicines to patients. In total, we added four new Phase III clinical programs to our pipeline, all with the potential to be first in class or best in class.  We reported 12 positive Phase III or registrational trials readouts, including a mix of NMEs and new indications or new data for launch products. We submitted 12 NMEs or new indications for regulatory review in geographies around the world and we received positive regulatory action on two new medicines, Reyvow and Baqsimi, as well as four important new indications across Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality and Cyramza.  We're proud of the significant achievements we made in 2019, and we are focused on discovering and developing more new medicines to help patients as we enter another promising decade.  Moving to slide 19. While it\u2019s early in the year, we've already made good progress on our 2020 goals, having announced the initiation of additional Phase III trials for selpercatinib, positive results in the remaining two trials of the baricitinib BREEZE program for atopic dermatitis. The submission of baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in the EU and Japan, the submission of tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain in the U.S. in collaboration with Pfizer. FDA approval of Trijardy, a fixed dose combination of empagliflozin, linagliptin, metformin and regulatory approval of Cyramza for first line EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer in Europe.  Before turning the call back over to Dave, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing additional details on important milestones for two clinical programs that I mentioned earlier. It is the initiation of additional clinical trials for tirzepatide and the completion of the baricitinib BREEZE-AD atopic dermatitis program.  Beginning with tirzepatide on slide 20, we previously shared our plans to initiate a cardiovascular outcome study for tirzepatide this year, assessing tirzepatide head-to-head against the most widely used GLP-1therapy, i.e., Trulicity. This is a bold move. It signals both our confidence in the strength of tirzepatide as well as our desire to deliver meaningful data for patients and physicians on how new medicines measure against leading therapies.  Through very collaborative discussions with the FDA, we've gained alignment on the key design features of this unique study called SURPASS CVOT. This trial will include approximately 12,500 patients with Type 2 diabetes and confirmed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and will measure time the first occurrence of the composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke. The study will assess both non-inferiority and superiority of tirzepatide versus Trulicity and we anticipate it will take just over four years to complete.  In addition to SURPASS CVOT, we're pleased to share that the Phase III Type 2 diabetes program, SURPASS, is progressing extremely well. Investigator interest has been very strong, and four of the eight SURPASS clinical trials are already fully enrolled. We look forward to sharing topline results for the first study readout from the SURPASS program later this year. Finally, we are exciting that the SURMOUNT Phase III obesity program is actively dosing patience and that the synergy Phase II program and NASH is currently under way as well. Given the profound weight loss scene in Phase II trials of tirzepatide we are excited about the potential opportunity these additional clinical programs presents to help patients. Together with the ongoing SURPASS studies, these additional studies will expand the current Phase III tirzepatide program to over 20,000 patients. We're excited about the breakthrough that tirzepatide represents for patience and will continue to invest fully to maximize this opportunity.  Moving to slide 21, we recently announced the completion of the final two studies in the BREEZE-AD clinical program, BREEZE-AD4 and BREEZE-AD5. The full BREEZE program was comprised of five studies assessing baricitinib in both monotherapy and in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.  Well not all the data have yet been presented, we are particularly encouraged by the strong results for the 2 milligram dose in the U.S. trial. We believe that the full data package generated from BREEZE-AD shows the potential that baricitinib could offer as an additional treatment option for patients with atopic dermatitis where there are limited choices.  In addition these data add to the large safety database of baricitinib having over 10,000 patient years of safety data. We recently submitted baricitinib for atopic dermatitis in the EU and Japan and we expect regulatory action late in 2020. We plan to submit in the U.S. later this year. We anticipate that baricitinib will be the first oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and we look forward to bringing a new treatment option to patients.  Finally we recently announced the planned acquisition of Dermira. Pending deal closing, this transaction would add an additional medicine to the Lilly pipeline for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, that is Lebrikizumab, which is an injectable antibody targeting IL-13 currently in Phase III trials.  We view Lebrikizumab as highly complementary to our efforts with baricitinib in atopic dermatitis. The unmet medical need here is large and we anticipate physicians and patients we use a range of oral injectable therapies similar to current common practice for the treatment of psoriasis.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly some up the progress we've made in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year.  We deliver impressive performance in Q4. Our revenue grew 8% as our newest medicines were again the catalyst for volume-based growth. Our worldwide prescription trends are strong and we are well positioned entering 2020 to continue our positive trajectory and deliver our 2020 financial guidance.  We advanced our productivity agenda, controlling operating expenses, while investing behind key commercial growth drivers and our late stage pipeline. We grew sales in Q4 while keeping marketing, selling and administrative expenses flat versus Q4 \u201918, demonstrating our ability to drive margin expansion.  We've made important pipeline progress in Q4, tapping a year that featured significant new additions for the Phase III portfolio, several positive readout in Phase III trials and a multitude of regulatory submissions and approvals.  Finally we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed $300 million of share repurchases as well.  As we shared during our 2020 financial guidance call last December, we are in the early stages of a period of sustained growth at Lilly. The balance of new medicines we plan to launch over the next five and the continued scaling of our newer medicines compared to our limited patent exposure sets up an exciting period ahead. We are pursuing new medicines in some of the most important diseases with both significant unmet medical need and sizable business opportunities. We are pleased with our finish to 2019 and our position of strength as we enter 2020, and the next decade of this company's history. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two for follow-up. Sean, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we are ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just say we\u2019re on Taltz and one on the Olumiant Filing in AD. So for Taltz the growth has been solid, but what would you say could be a demand tipping point looking to 2020 and beyond. Is it a new contract agreement or is it a broader indication base. You have to invest more commercially.  And then on the Olumiant Filing in AD, I wasn't sure if the effect of the 4 mega-dose changes the regulatory conversation in the U.S. Maybe you\u2019ve had an RA Indication since approval obviously, which was mostly focused on the 2 mega-indication and 2 mega approval but wasn\u2019t sure if that changes at all on the back of this new data. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Geoff. We\u2019ll go to Patrick for both of those questions. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much. We are very pleased with the performance of the policy in the fourth quarter last year with the growth of growth of total RX with approximately 40%. If you look at the difference space its possible in dermatology despite the increased competition. We think we are holding ground very nicely and we are maintaining our total RX share of market in Q4 despite the increased competition. Also added to the body of evidence, we had a diverse strength by the IL-23, but we have gained demonstrated superiority on skin clearance; and that's the third study combined with Stelara and in Enbrel where we have again demonstrated superiority. So we are confident in the continued growth phase of dermatology.  The biggest opportunity for us remains being in rheumatology where we \u2013 in Q4 announced the old IL-17 to demonstrate superiority versus humera in the SPIRIT-Head-to-Head (H2H) study, and we saw something \u2013 this consideration in Q4 in terms of new to brand and we are confident that we will continue to grow in the rheumatology space where there are a lot of opportunities for us.  We also filed during the second half of last year the Non-Radiographic AxSpA, and that's an indication where we\u2019ll also see a lot of patients that are not being appropriately diagnosed and even if diagnosed, not appropriately treated.  Lastly, both in dermatology and rheumatology, a huge amount of patients are still treated with [inaudible]. In Dermatology 40%, in rheumatology 70% and we believe that remains the biggest opportunity for all new assets to ensure that patients are being upgraded to new modern modifications and save the treatment.  In terms of Olumiant, why we don't comment on regulatory actions for specific brands, we continue to explore options to get the 4mg dosage approved in the U.S.; however, in the light of most recent regulatory actions without the JAK inhibitors, we are also realistic in terms of our expectations to get four milligrams approved in the U.S. in the near term.  But as Dave mentioned, we are very much encouraged by the 2 milligram data of Olumiant in atopic dermatitis and where we\u2019re demonstrating hitting our primary objective both in terms of at least 75% improvement on skin inflammation, but also in terms of patient reported outcomes, improvements on itching. So that is encouraging for us in terms of the Olumiant submission in the U.S. Kevin Hern : Thanks Patrick. Geoff, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Thank you. The next question is going to come from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great! Thanks very much. First question was just on the quarterly progression of sales and earnings as we go through 2020. I think last year we saw depressed first quarter sales relative to the rest of the year that\u2019s surprised the street a bit. Should we expect a similar dating of sales in 2020 and are there any particular products we should be watching where I guess 2020 kind of resets of plans could impact those first quarter results. My second question was just on the Alzheimer's strategy more broadly. How would the approval or I guess not of Zagotenemab impact how you're thinking about your pending Alzheimer's readouts and development strategies from here. Thanks very much. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Chris. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and Dan for the second one. Josh Smiley : Thanks Chris. If we look at 2020, you know we don't provide quarterly guidance, but if we look at sort of the trajectory of sale that we\u2019d expect, if you look at our guidance for the full year you know we're somewhere in the high single digits for sales growth. We\u2019d expect that kind of growth to be pretty consistent through the year, although keep in mind in Q1 we still will have a little bit more of the overhang from things like Cialis. So you might expect to see a little bit more sales growth through the year, but pretty consistent.  On an absolute basis though Chris, we do always see sales in Q1 lower than Q4. One of that just has to do with shipping patterns and otherwise so \u2013 again, growth should look good in Q1 relative to the year. Absolute sales will be less. I think that is a trend that you see I'm sure across almost all companies. There's nothing unique going on there other than normal shipping patterns between Q4 and Q1. Dan Skovronsky : Chris, thanks for your question on our Alzheimer's strategy. You know of course we like many others will be watching aducanumab closely, and of course we\u2019ll adapt our plans and thinking to meet wherever we see the regulatory bar placed, but I don't think you should expect us to pivot in our Alzheimer's strategy one way or another.  We\u2019ve placed some pretty important bets. We are excited to see those readouts over time, both with Solanezumab, but also our own plaque clearing antibody Donanemab, as well as our anti-tau antibody that\u2019s in phase II. We also have a tau small molecule in phase I and other agents earlier in development. So we\u2019ll continue to progress those. We think we have smartly designed trials that will give us import readouts over time. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So the first question I had for you is can you provide more color on what might be driving your stronger volume growth when compared to other companies out there in the space, and if this is durable over the longer term.  And then my second question for you, is with this growing competition in atopic dermatitis, where do you see Lilly fitting into the evolving treatment paradigm. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thank you. So we\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and Patrick for the second. Thanks guys. Josh Smiley : Thanks Louise, good morning. I think in terms of volume growth, what we see at a corporate level is the function of our portfolios. We mention about a little bit less than half of our sales are coming from new products that we launched since 2014. 10 of those, they are all still in \u2013 very much in their growth phases; Trulicity growing at 31% for example, Taltz at 37%.  So we've got a relatively young portfolio. We expect the volume gains that we saw in Q4 to be sustainable between 2020 and 2025 as we mentioned on our guidance call. We expect to see top tier revenue growth over that period. It'll be driven by volume gains; it'll be driven by that cohort of products, as well as the new launches that will expect over this period, including the three that we\u2019re planning for this year. You couple that going forward with last generic exposure, then probably most of the companies that you know we compete against or that you cover and I think that would certainly say to us that the volume gains we're seeing or something that we\u2019re planning for and think are sustainable. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh, Patrick. Patrik Jonsson : Apparently it\u2019s estimated that approximately 18 million Americans are suffering from Atopic dermatitis and 10 million of those are suffering from severe to moderate Atopic dermatitis and the treatment opportunities are very limited. One is saying that they feel Atopic dermatitis is pretty much where psoriasis was 15 years ago.  In the light of that we believe that we are extremely well positioned. As we shared, we are encouraged by the most recent data on Olumiant, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and we have submitted Olumiant for approval in Japan and EU and we\u2019ll take regulatory actions in 2020 here in the U.S. and we believe that Olumiant could definitely be an option for patients that are having fear of injection.  And we're also excited about the announcement we made a few weeks ago about our intent to acquire Dermira, and lebrikizumab is the big driver of that deal and we see lebrikizumab based upon the phase II(b) data as the medicine will at least be competitive with Dupixent and we have an opportunity given the best in class differentiating on each.  So overall we believe that we can play a very important role in the field of Atopic dermatitis. We built the first oral JAK inhibitor for patients of fear of injections and the potential best in class medicine in lebrikizumab. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Patrick. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. I apologize, the next question then will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my two questions. Both of them are Kevin\u2019s favorite topic.  So the first one is on the CNS penetrance of your GLP-1 and I have two parts on the first one. So there's feedback out there that Trulicity doesn't cross blood-brain barrier very much, perhaps in part because of its size. A, can you comment on that, and in that same question I also want to ask, tirzepatide does not have an IGG. So presumably, it should have good CNS penetration. I just want to make sure I hear your take on the CNS penetrant of both Trulicity and tirzepatide.  Secondly, Dave perhaps for you, so the A4 trial in asymptomatic Alzheimer's, my understanding is it was fully enrolled in December 2017 and at this point it's already past two years in every single patient and by end of 2020 you would have hit a three year landmark in every single patient. So my question is, strategically thinking if regulators are being more accommodating of late. Wouldn\u2019t it make strategic sense to possibly consider taking an efficacy read at three years, because even at three years it's 2x the duration of all prior sola and aducanumab trials. Thank you very much. Kevin Hern : Thanks Umer for those questions. This is \u2013 Butler Bulldogs basketball is probably my favorite topic, but we don\u2019t cover that on the call; this is a close second though. We'll go to Dan for both of these. Dan Skovronsky : Okay, great. Thanks very much. So with respect to CNS penetration of GLP ones, you're right that these are large molecular weight molecules. Actually both FC fusion molecules like Trulicity and also isolated peptides like tirzepatide. Those modifications to the peptides are what gives them the long half-life that enables once weekly injection and molecules of that size typically don't penetrate the blood brain barrier.  Having said that, we don't see those attributes, blood brain barrier penetration as being important for the efficacy of this class of drugs as evidenced I think by the tremendous efficacy that we\u2019ve seen with Trulicity and unprecedented efficacy that we've seen with tirzepatide, so I think that addresses that. With respect to A4, you're right that this is a longer duration trial and really I think any other large Alzheimer's trial has ever been. The reason for that though is because these patients are asymptomatic at the beginning of the trial, so they are very early in the disease course and it takes a great deal of time to let these patients progress in their disease course and it's only through progression of patients on the placebo group and hopefully differential, less progression of patients on therapy that we could hope to see an effective drug. So that's why the design includes such a long follow-up period. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Umer, thanks for your questions and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator : Thank you. And once again we\u2019re going to have a question from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Hi! A question on your PD-1 with an event and really plans for that product outside the U.S. It seems like last summer when I talked to management it was really described as the China only opportunity with limited potential, but it seems that you may have pivoted in recent months and may have bigger plans to bring them in to other geographies, so I'm hoping you can give us your latest thinking. And then second question is just on the Dian-Tu Alzheimer's trial confirming that we should see those results really any time, can you confirm that? And then just how do you view odds of success. It kind of seems to me that it's highly improbable that this will yield positive results for solo, but what are your views? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Tim. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the first question and Dan for the second. Anne White : Well Tim, thanks for the question on Tyvyt and our business collaboration. So as you said, our current focus is on development and commercialization of Tyvyt in China, however it\u2019s been really important and a perfect strategic partner to us and so we're always open to discussing opportunities to expand that for mutual benefit. There's really not more we can say at this time. We're really pleased. I think as Josh and Dave mentioned, the performance of Tyvyt in China, it's been a remarkable story and really now as you know the only PD-1 that\u2019s included on the NRDL list and I think that demonstrates how the NHSA has recognized its clinical value and then we were able to share the great news that we had the first line non-squamous read out at interim that\u2019s positive, so we\u2019ll be planning to submit that this year and we expect additional read out in first and second line squamous this year with an event. So it's been a great product and we look forward to what more we can do here. But thanks for the question. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yeah Tim, on DIAN, just reminded for everyone that this is dominantly inherited type of Alzheimer's. It's rare and sort of severe and fast progressing form of Alzheimer's disease where we testing solanezumab. Your question on timing of results, we don't have the data yet, but we do expect that this quarter.  In terms of the odds of success, I think it's hard to speculate, but as you know this is a very small trials, small population is being studied and it is as I said a severe form of Alzheimer's. So those factors weigh against it, there is other factors that weight for it. We know that it\u2019s driven by mutations here and amyloid over production and has a relatively longer follow-up, but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see that data. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Tim thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question then is coming from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A couple of questions. [inaudible] Kevin Hern : Hey Andrew, this is Kevin. Andrew, we are really having trouble hearing you and can't really pick up the question, other than we heard tirzepatide. Andrew Baum : Is that any better? Kevin Hern : No, not much, we\u2019ll try it. Andrew Baum : My question is on tirzepatide, talking about your outcome trail. You are running a head-to-head trail versus Ozempic, which you described as a high bar. There is some literature on potentially GIP agonism could potentially be increased in cardiovascular, rather than decreasing it, given its evidence is a marker for heightened cardiovascular disease as well as some preclinical data.  Perhaps you can talk to your thoughts on the relevant development literature and then second more broadly we\u2019d like to think that Lilly is perhaps second in place than many of your pears, in understanding the direction of this particular administration in terms of healthcare reforms. There has been some discussions about the IPI proposal could be expanded to include Medicare part D drugs rather than just part B. Perhaps you could share your thoughts on what you expect in that direction. Apologies for the long question? Kevin Hern : Thanks Andrew. We\u2019ll got to Dan for the question on tirzepatide and then Dave on the policy question. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah thanks. First of all, just a clarification that tirzepatide trial it had again against Trulicity. Look I think that there is a little bit of literature out there as you referenced about \u2013 it\u2019s actually GIP-1 but our thinking is really based on the clinical data we've already obtained with tirzepatide in the Phase II trials.  I think everything we see in those trials, point to a large cardiovascular benefits for drug like this, and so that's the driver\u2019 that's what gives us confidence is the real clinical data with this molecule. The combination of GLP-1 and GLP-1 gives certain effects which we are able to see. So for example there improved day-1 C control and notably the very dramatic improvement on weight loss, which I think will drive cardiovascular benefits even higher than we saw in Trulicity. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Dave. Dave Ricks : So on the policy front, we continue to advocate for change in the U.S. system because although we're in a \u2013 as an industry and certainly as Lilly a deflationary price environment those savings are not reaching consumers at the pharmacy counter. And so either through a combination of passing through a transparency of those discounts or insurance reform, we're for change. And our focus is primarily right now with the legislative pathway on both those fronts. There is one more vehicle probably left in this Congress to work on those, but progress is difficult in Congress. So we continue to advocate for change on the other patience though.  As it relates to IPI, you know this proposal was part of the blueprint in spring of \u201918. It's been sitting out there for a while. We've yet to see any draft guidance for proposed rulemaking or any version of this in detail. There is always a lot of swirling rumors about it, including expanding it to other parts of government programs or changes to it in terms of the objectives.  We see it largely as misguided, primarily because in Part B patients hardly have any cost sharing to begin with. So if we're worried about out of pocket costs for patients, IPI will do very little, it's mostly just a punitive measure against the industry going back to decisions made on European pricing sometimes decades ago. It won't probably change those prices in Europe if that\u2019s the present goal, and it certainly won't change the affordability equation for patients in the U.S. So we oppose it for those reasons.  That said, it's administrative potential action and want to read it if it comes out and decide what to do from there, but it pretty much is a difficult thing to support for our industry and you\u2019ll probably see pharma universally oppose it. So we'll wait and see. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. Andrew thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks for the question. So maybe that the first question is really for Josh. Josh, can you just help us understand the progression of margins as we move through the balance of next year, or sorry this year in 2020.  When I look at the original guidance from this year, I think you guys had said 28% was the target. I think ultimately we ended up at 27.2% at the final point in the year. But on the guidance call in December, you had \u2013 you stated and reiterated the 31% target. Can you just help us understand the past to that 31% just because the second half of this year I think kind of came in below investors\u2019 expectations to some degree, and we're just trying to understand a little bit better the very strong moves in margins going higher. Obviously the pieces of guidance makes sense. I think we're just trying to understand the path as we move through the balance of the year.  And then the second question. You know that the pegilodecakin update, thanks for that. Appreciate the understanding and the challenges. Can maybe \u2013 Jay can just sort of update us on his thoughts and also Dan, could update us on your thoughts for the growth of the oncology development portfolio and directionally where you're headed? Thanks. Kevin Hern : Josh, and then Dan. Josh Smiley : Great! Thanks Seamus. In terms of margin this year, again we reiterated that we are on track for 31%. And the one thing that we have said is Q1 will likely be below 31% that\u2019s mostly a function of the less absolute sales that I talked about on a prior question, on top of a relatively fixed OpEx absolute amount. So I think as you look or model OpEx for the year, we see that it's pretty constant on an absolute base quarter-over-quarter. Of course some small variation, and then you'll see absolute sales dollars on a quarter over quarter basis grow. So we don't expect to be at 31% in Q1, but that\u2019s - again that the function of the dynamics of the growth through the quarters.  Remember though in terms of how to get there in totals for the year, we said for 2019 that we would grow our R&D at a unusual growth rate in in 2019 as we scale up programs like tirzepatide and Mirikizumab. In 2020 those programs are running at, you know more like full speed, we are able to bring and a an asset like Dermira and keep that with you know relatively smaller growth rate and R&D. So I think we are confident that the sales growth that we are seeing, that we talked about in Q4 and should persist for the year on top of a slower growing OpEx that we can predict and manage, will get us to 31% and again I wouldn't be too concerned in Q1 if we are not at that level, but you should expect it as we move through the year. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh, Dan. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks for the question on oncology strategy. Of course on the last call we talked about our Loxo Oncology at Lilly and how that's changed oncology strategy and we're quite pleased with the progress that we made on executing against that strategy. You can see some portfolio changes in our pipeline update and we also talked about the three key early stage programs, 305, KRAS and SERD, all of which are progressing in the clinic. While we said we're going to focus on a lot of our resources on high probability, biology that's well understood, bets like those, we will also from time to time continue to pursue more novel biology, higher risk, high reward bets like Pegilodecakin was and that will be a smaller part of our portfolio in the future. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Seamus, thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Thanks very much. I have two questions, first just going back to the high level on GLP-1s and Alzheimer's. Novo has recently conveyed enthusiasm about the potential for GLP-1 treatment in Alzheimer's. Could you just comment on your view of whether GLP-1 treatment over a few years can actually change the progression of Alzheimer's? And then second with respect to hide those Trulicity, could you please frame what we should focus on when we see the Phase III data and your planned positioning of that product. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. We\u2019ll go to Dan for the first question and then Mike for the second one. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah thanks. Of course we are aware of the comments that Novo has make on GLP-1 and Alzheimer's disease and the potential there. Look forward to seeing data from that first trial. Look I think we know that GLP-1 treatment has beneficial cardiovascular outcomes, including we've seen reductions on stroke, probably that's a tip of the iceberg and there's other micro infarcts that are decreased by GLP-1 therapy. That could overtime contribute to a slower rate of cognitive decline. Is there a direct effective of GLP-1s on Alzheimer\u2019s pathology? I think that's not yet known.  So we'll watch how the field evolves. If it turns out that there are great opportunities, I think we have the best in class incretin in the form of tirzepatide and we'd be opened to future opportunities for it. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan, Mike. Mike Mason : David, thanks for your question on our favorite subject. It proves we had another great quarter, growing by 32% on volume of 29% on revenue. We are still quite excited about the overall GLP market growth. The 52 week rate was at 29.7 while the monthly rate in December was at 31.5. So the market continues to grow and Trulicity continues to hold up in a very strong market share leadership position outpacing TRS class growth in the phase of some of the type of product launches.  So we expect that both the new Trulicity rewind, as well as the high dose label enhancements will continue to drive class growth as well as certify our market leadership position place. So we're excited about that. I think as you take a look at the results of that, take a look at increased are A1C results, as well as the weight loss results. And what we think is the strength of Trulicity is the fact that you get little more benefits by having powerful efficacy simply delivered and this will just give people using Trulicity another reason to stay on it. Kevin Hern : Thanks Mike. David, thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Great, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. The first one is on tirzepatide and the CVOT trial. I was wondering if you can share any more details on this states or powering assumptions there, as well as the discontinuation rate that you're assuming in the arms of the trial. And then for Emgality you mentioned you know look into the next phase of growth here in the primary care market. What are some of the markers beyond obviously sales that we should look to you know gauging successful uptake there and then any thoughts on potential impact from oral CGRP? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Okay thanks. We\u2019ll go to Dan for tirzepatide and then Mike and then Patrick for the oral CGRP question. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah, thinks for your question asking for more detail on the tirzepatide SURPASS-CVOT trial design. I think at this moment we don't sort of comment on any of the finer details around clinical trial design and dropout rates. But I would say that having a trial like this where it\u2019s a head to head with two great active drugs, one on each arm should be a very compelling opportunity for enrolling physicians and a great opportunity for treatment for patients as well. So I think those kinds of factors should help with both enrollment and retention in the trial. Kevin Hern : Go ahead Mike. Mike Mason : I think as we look at the opportunity and really learn from what providers and payers want, they want active competitors. I think this provides a lot of value and lot of insights into the incremental value of one product over another product. And so obviously doing a head to head trial versus Trulicity is a bold bat, but I think it really reinforces the confidence we have in tirzepatide in its population. So we're very excited about the study. It is a bold bat, but one that we are very excited about the potential of product and CVOT. Kevin Hern : Thanks Patrick. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you. If you look at on the prevention market with currency 6 million patients eligible for prevention treatment in the U.S., but only 3 million of those are being treated. So that's a big opportunity for us with increased competition in the market place as well to drive patient activation. And specifically for Emgality, if you look from the prescriber base today, its relatively limited and only 15% of our targets are currently, regularly prescribing Emgality, so that's why were we see a tremendous opportunity both in specialty care, as well as in primary care.  In terms of the oral CGRP, I think it\u2019s important to have in mind that they are only approved or will be approved for the treatment of acute migraine this year and the prevention indications coming later on. We are very confident with the profile of Emgality, particularly taking into account that we are now the market leader and the preferred CGRP in the marketplace and particularly with a differentiation, we have been labeled with both efficacy 57 till 5 and 100% level and also the convenience at the device offers from the same device platform as Trulicity.  The oral CGRPs will be competing at a huge pace and we are also very excited about the announcement that was the pre-publication notice from the DEA that was publicly displayed this morning and will result in an announcement in the Federal Register tomorrow, enabling us to bring Reyvow to the marketplace, probably late next week. And that\u2019s where we have a tremendous opportunity to bring more value in the space of acute migraine and for the first time we\u2019ll be able to talk about complete pain elimination already after two hours with one single dose of Reyvow and not just compete pain elimination, but also complete elimination of bothersome symptoms such as sun phobia, light sensitivity and nausea.  So we believe that we have very well positioned us in the preventive space as well as the acute phase but patient activation will be key and that's something that would be beneficial with also new entrants in the marketplace. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Patrick. Terence, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. I'll take the other side of an earlier question and suggest it would be surprising if DIAN-TU didn't hit it end point given the signal you saw in the expedition trials and the fact that DIAN-TU is testing a higher dose in a more homogeneous population for a longer time with the tailor made end-point.  So Dan, I'm trying to understand your pessimism and maybe you could please tell us on which of the points that I stated you disagree? And then there are four components to the primary endpoint. Do you need to hit all four to achieve success? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Steve, Dan. Dan Skovronsky : Okay Steve. So look most of the commons you said are right. The importance of those factors in the outcome of the study is what we don't now, and there are other factors as I said earlier going against us here. The one that should give anyone the most pause I think is the small sample size and Alzheimer's trials are \u2013 I think even in large trials notorious for surprising us because of the heterogeneity of the fact and variability in the outcome measures. So its factors like that that could make it difficult to really know what is true. Look I still think it's regardless an interesting scientific question, a partner experiment we'll look forward to seeing the data.  With respect to the specifics around the composite, I think the nature of a composite is that you have to hit the overall composite score as the primary endpoint, which could be driven by the various sub-measures or not, but as you point out this was custom made for this trial. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Steve thank for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : We have a question from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS. Please go ahead. Navin Jacob : Hi yes, thanks for taking the questions. Just on Verzenio, Pfizer has slightly delayed its IBRANCE adjuvant trial PALLAS to early 2021. Wondering \u2013 and they highlight the event rate progressing much slower. Wondering how relative to your expectations the event rate has been progressing and MONARCH? And is the time line still for an early 2021 readout, and any color on the potential for an interim would be appreciated? That's on Verzenio.  And then just on Humalog, I think your press release suggested that pricing in the U.S. benefit from a better segment mix. Is that because of the volume shift to the Humalog authorized generic and that\u2019s assuming that the authorized generic is being recorded within the Humalog revenue line. I just wanted any if you can provide any clarity on that. Thank you so much. Kevin Hern : Great, thank you. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on Verzenio and Mike for the question on Humalog. Anne White : Navin, thanks for the question on Verzenio. So as you know we have not disclosed any interim analysis. Now this is an event driven trial similar to PALLAS, but our estimates make us quite confident that we are looking at a readout in the first half of 2021. So we continue to expect that and as you know the trial unrolled remarkably well and so we're able to roll ahead of schedule, which helps obviously drive [inaudible] rates for that. And again we specifically designed this trial with a high risk population and that was both a strategy of where we believe that Verzenio would really different, but as well it drove the speed of the trial. So again we feel quite confident in that.  As you know the positive MONARCH-2 overall trial results, particularly as we saw those with primary resistance and visceral disease, really an eight month survival benefit in the patients with visceral disease really reinforce our confidence and the potential, the success of MONARCH. So we designed it with that high risk population and really used what we think are thoughtful selection factors the physicians use today to make prescribing decisions in that adjuvant setting. So things like the number of nodes involved, the tumor size and the measure of proliferation and so we feel quite confident in the design of the study and again look forward to the readout in 2021. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne, Mike. Mike Mason : Thanks for your question on Humalog. The biggest drive in Humalog segment mix is the fact that with Humalog uptake they are taking volume away from Humalog in Medicaid since our Medicaid rebate rates are essentially 100%, that TRx decline actually doesn't have \u2013 had a flat to positive impact on that revenues for Humalog. Navin Jacob : And just to confirm the AG products are consolidated into the Humalog. Kevin Hern : Thanks Mike. Navin, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ll go to Dave for the close. Dave Ricks : Okay, thank you all. I appreciate the participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company.  2019 was a strong year for the company and we anticipate another great year in 2020. We remain focused on executing our innovation based strategy to bring new medicines to patients and create value for our shareholders. With our strong commercial portfolio complemented by our pipeline of exciting opportunities, Lilly continues to be a compelling investment.  Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow-up with our Investor Relations team if you have any additional questions we weren\u2019t able to address on today\u2019s call. Hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, your conference call today is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Go ahead, please. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q1 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We\u2019re also joined by Sarah Smith [ph] and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. In addition, I would like to welcome Anat Hakim who recently joined Lilly as Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Anat joined Lilly with a wealth of experience in the healthcare industry and more broadly across the legal profession. Her prior experiences include General Counsel of WellCare Health Plans and Associate General Counsel at Abbott as well as working for a number of years at Foley & Lardner, Latham & Watkins. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the extent and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed on slide three, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-Ks, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for some opening comments. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. Well, these are challenging times for all of us as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way we live, the way we conduct business and most importantly, the health and wellness of millions of people. Like all of you, we\u2019re hopeful that the decisions to implement social distancing will be effective to curb the spread of COVID-19 as our industry works urgently to enhance testing and speed therapies to market to treat and then prevent the virus. Today\u2019s call will have a different structure than normal. Before we discuss our Q1 results, we\u2019ll describe the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic in general is having on our business and the actions we\u2019ve taken to respond to the resulting global crisis. Our Q1 results were driven by very strong fundamentals with additional benefit from increased inventory across the supply chain, including at the patient level. This is as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite that near-term benefit, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a negative impact on our business in the future. We expect headwinds later in 2020 and potentially beyond, such as destocking as supply chains normalize from the recent demand surge, decreases in new prescriptions as a result of fewer patients visiting physician\u2019s offices, potential changes in segment mix in the U.S. due to rising unemployment and pricing pressures resulting from the [Technical Difficulty] on government-funded healthcare systems around the world. While we do not yet know the extent and duration of these impacts, like everyone around the world, we\u2019re hopeful that the massive mobilization of scientific and technical resources occurring across this industry and in collaboration with government and academic labs will yield multiple effective therapies in the coming months and an effective vaccine in calendar \u201821. While it\u2019s difficult to predict the specifics of how the world manages through this pandemic, it seems clear our industry will play a leading role. In the midst of the outbreak and in its aftermath, it seems equally clear that investing in research and development to address and then conquer human disease has never been more important, and this is likely to remain true for some time. As we\u2019ve navigated the crisis, we\u2019ve acted with speed and agility, focusing on the needs of patients, our employees and the communities we serve and operate in. I\u2019ll provide a summary of our response, then Dan will describe our ongoing efforts to develop a treatment for COVID-19 and Josh will walk through potential financial impact of our outlook going forward. Slide four summarizes our strategic approach and actions to-date. As you can see, we focused on five areas, maintaining a safe supply of and access to our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing a treatment for the virus; keeping our employees safe; and supporting our communities. To ensure that 40-million-plus patients we serve have access to their medicines, early in the outbreak, we took a number of steps to maintain the supply of medicines around the world. To limit their exposure to the virus, we reduced personnel at our manufacturing sites to the bare minimum required to operate our facilities and enhance already robust precautionary measures for safety and cleanliness. The majority of our supply chain is multi-sourced. And from materials we supply from one source, we keep sufficient inventory on hand to avoid disruptions. Even with increased demand and customer stocking, we have sufficient inventory and production capacity for all our products. This includes all forms of insulin. And we don\u2019t currently anticipate any issues meeting patient needs through the remainder of the pandemic. Our manufacturing sites in the U.S., Europe and China have remained operational through this crisis. We\u2019re proud of the extraordinary efforts of our manufacturing colleagues, who\u2019ve worked diligently to supply our medicines to patients around the world who depend on them. In addition to the numerous programs currently available through the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, we announced the introduction of the Insulin Value Program. This allows patients with commercial insurance or without insurance to limit their monthly out-of-pocket expenses for insulin to $35 per prescription. Of note, the Solution Center has seen a significant increase in daily calls since this new benefit was announced. Patient affordability continues to be a top priority, and we remain committed to helping people access to medicines they need. We\u2019ve also made a number of decisions which reduced the strain on the medical system. These include pausing new clinical starts and enrollment for most ongoing programs, suspending our in-person customer visits to physicians, repurposing our labs to conduct diagnostic testing here in Indiana for COVID-19, and creating a drive-thru testing facility for healthcare workers and first responders in the Indianapolis area. We took these actions because they are the right thing to do during these challenging times and to do our part to combat the spread of COVID-19. Dan will give a more complete pipeline update later, but I would like to highlight that we do not expect significant changes to the timelines for our ongoing late-stage studies, except for the previously announced delays for the GI indications of our IL-23 antibody, mirikizumab. In terms of addressing the significant unmet need of treating COVID-19, we\u2019ve acted upon several opportunities, which we hope will result in a treatment option. These include partnering with AbCellera to develop potential antibody therapies, which we expect will enter the clinic this summer, participating in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial with our JAK inhibitor, baricitinib, initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial with an antibody targeting Angiopoietin 2 pointing to explore its potential use in reducing the progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19. The need for new medicines is urgent, and we\u2019ve mobilized our development team at a record pace. Keeping our employees safe and healthy and our Company running smoothly is of course also a top priority. We\u2019ve implemented remote work practices, added health and wellness benefits and provided additional compensation for those essential employees routinely coming to our sites, such as those in manufacturing. We\u2019ve also created opportunities for employees to volunteer during work hours to support our medical system, including helping staff, drive through testing facility. To-date, Lilly has tested nearly 30,000 people for COVID-19, which represents over a third of all tests conducted in the State of Indiana, while absorbing all associated expenses. We are building on this capacity by developing serological antibody tests that will be critical in the next phase of the pandemic. In addition, we\u2019ve been supporting our local communities by funding or contributing to public health awareness campaigns as well as providing assistance and deploying available resources to fight the pandemic. I would also note, our appreciation for the high-level of responsiveness and cooperation from the FDA and other government agencies in the U.S. and abroad as we partner together to fight COVID-19, and to minimize the negative impact to drug development timelines for our other innovative medicines. Across the biopharmaceutical industry, we\u2019re working around the clock, collectively driving forward to address the acute medical need created by the COVID-19 pandemic. And to further elaborate on that, I\u2019ll turn the call over now to Dan to provide more details on the ongoing efforts to treat COVID-19 and our regular pipeline update. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Dave. I\u2019m proud to highlight the ongoing efforts we have to combat COVID-19. As Dave mentioned earlier, we\u2019re moving at an unprecedented pace as part of an industry-wide effort to develop a treatment for COVID-19. As a scientist and as a physician, I am incredibly impressed and thankful for the ways our teams at Lilly are working to make an impact against this new disease. We\u2019ve demonstrated how nimble a large organization can be when truly focused and united behind an important cause. Slide five provides an overview of the three active therapeutic programs we are pursuing. First, is baricitinib. This is our JAK inhibitor in collaboration with Incyte. We have recently announced it is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial. Based on the known anti-inflammatory activity of baricitinib, recent data in preclinical studies and case reports from investigator sponsored clinical trials, we believe baricitinib could have potential to dampen the cytokine storm that occurs when hospitalized COVID-19 patients are fighting to combat the inflammation in their lungs, which often leads to requiring a ventilator. While we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the potential of baricitinib to help treat patients with COVID-19, it\u2019s important to also note the approved rheumatoid arthritis indication includes warnings about the risk for developing serious infection. The baricitinib arm of the study begins this month in the U.S. with planned expansion to Europe and Asia and results are expected in the next two months. Next, we started a Phase 2 trial with a monoclonal antibody against Angiopoietin 2 or Ang2 in pneumonia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are at a higher risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. The Ang2 level in plasma is strongly correlated to the ARDS risk and severity, based on multiple studies in humans. Our trial we\u2019ll test with our inhibiting the effects of Ang2 with a monoclonal antibody can reduce the progression to ARDS or the need for mechanical ventilation. This trial has already begun enrolling patients at centers across the United States. We expect results from this trial in the coming months. Our third and potentially most significant program is part of our previously announced collaboration with AbCellera, where we are pursuing antibody therapies for the potential treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Our scientists have been working together with AbCellera, NIH and academic partners to characterize virus-neutralizing antibodies obtained from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from the virus. The most advanced antibody in this program shows potent neutralization of live virus, and has now entered GMP manufacturing. We plan to submit an IND to the FDA by the end of May, to allow start of clinical testing in patients. The pace at which we\u2019ve advanced these potential treatments has been possible through the tireless efforts of our research and development colleagues, in partnership with a number of private and government partners. The need for treatment options to battle COVID-19 is staggering, and we are leveraging our financial resources and our very significant scientific capabilities to rapidly pursue solutions. The challenges facing our society and our economy are great, and the pharmaceutical industry is rising to the challenge. I\u2019ll now provide a brief pipeline update. Slide six shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 20th. Movement since our last earnings call includes the approval of Lyumjev in the EU and Japan, the U.S. approval of Taltz for pediatric psoriasis and previously mentioned COVID-19 trial initiations for baricitinib and Ang2, one program advancing to Phase 1, the attrition of an early phase project, and the removal of empagliflozin for type 1 diabetes, based on a complete response letter from the FDA. Moving to slide seven, we provide an update on our 2020 key events that have occurred during the quarter. In addition to previously mentioned approvals, we also announced the first of two Phase 3 trials studying mirikizumab in psoriasis met its primary endpoints, the submission of tanezumab in Europe for moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain in collaboration with Pfizer, the DIAN-TU trail for solanezumab, which did not meet its primary endpoint, and galcanezumab received a negative opinion from the CHMP for cluster headache in Europe. Before I close the R&D update, I\u2019d like to emphasize that in addition to our ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19, we remain committed to advancing important new medicines across our entire portfolio. Although, we announced our pause to new trial starts and enrollment in most programs, we remain committed to discovering and developing new treatments for the patients we serve. With the exception of mirikizumab for GI indications, our late-stage portfolio remains on track to deliver important clinical trial data, in line with our previously communicated timelines. Of note, the tirzepatide SURPASS program in type 2 diabetes is fully enrolled, and we expect to share the first Phase 3 trial results later this year. These are challenging times around the world. But, I\u2019m encouraged by the unprecedented response to the scientific community and the pharmaceutical industry to rapidly develop potential new treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 and to sustain advancements across all diseases. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Josh to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our Q1 financial performance and our outlook going forward. Josh Smiley : Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. As Dave shared earlier, we are confident that our business fundamentals are strong and that we\u2019re well positioned to navigate the obstacles ahead. However, there undoubtedly will be a near term impact to our industry and our company. So, the length and magnitude of the effects are uncertain. So, I\u2019ll spend a few minutes discussing the financial impact of COVID-19 on our Q1 performance, and providing a framework for how we are thinking about this potential impact going forward, before then providing a more detailed review of our financial results. We began 2020, with positive momentum and observed robust prescription trends in January and February. As COVID-19 spreads throughout the world and economic activity slows significantly in many cities and regions, we observed the following changes and behaviors that affected our business. Patients refilled existing prescriptions earlier than normal or bought a larger supply to ensure that they didn\u2019t run out. Wholesalers and retailers increased the level of inventory on hand to ensure adequate supply. Reduced hospital visits resulted in a preference for medicines that do not require administration in a physician\u2019s office or the hospital. Patients abandoned fewer prescriptions at the pharmacy counter. Mail order utilization increased, which typically has a larger number of units per prescription in those filled at retail pharmacies, and new therapy starts slowed as patients largely avoided hospitals and clinics unless they were seeking treatment for COVID-19. We estimate, the net impact of these trends resulted in increased patient and channel stocking, which increased worldwide sales by roughly $250 million in Q1 with approximately $200 million of that impact in the U.S. We think the majority of the U.S. impact occurred in our diabetes portfolio and notable products, where we believe increased stocking impacted our Q1 U.S. results include, insulins by approximately $70 million to $80 million, Trulicity by approximately $30 million to $40 million, and Taltz by approximately $20 million to $25 million. While we expect much of this stocking to reverse in future quarters as the excess supply in the channel and in patients\u2019 medicine cabinets is consumed, the timing and ultimate levels are uncertain. We continue to closely monitor these factors and will utilize our quarterly earnings calls to provide update to our outlook. Slide eight lists a number of factors we are monitoring that may impact our financial performance. While reduced new therapy starts had a negligible impact during Q1, this impact could grow in future periods as fewer new starts translate into fewer total prescriptions. In the U.S., we are starting to see an impact as IQVIA reported new-to-brand prescriptions across the industry declined by 42% for the week ending April 10th versus pre-COVID-19 averages. For our portfolio, we anticipate this impact to be more pronounced to our immunology and pain products and less so for oncology and diabetes. However, we expect this impact to be temporary as patients will return to seeing their doctors as social distancing restrictions are lifted. Over the midterm, the significant increase in unemployment we are seeing could be a headwind. Increased unemployment may result in a shift of patients from commercial insurance to lower net price government insurance in the U.S. or to being uninsured. We\u2019re monitoring this dynamic closely. And while it could create headwinds in the near-term, this effect should lessen when the global economy eventually strengthens. Given the significant benefits our products provide to 40 million patients around the world, we remain competent in our long-term outlook for revenue growth and margin expansion. In terms of managing capital, our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and we have investment grade ratings from both Moody\u2019s and S&P. We\u2019re confident in our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow and have not seen an impact to our ability to access capital markets, including commercial paper at reasonable rates. Financial strength is a valuable asset during this period and we intend to maintain our current credit ratings, while using our balance sheet capacity to invest in the business and pursue business development opportunities and enhance our future growth prospects. I\u2019ll provide more details on our 2020 outlook shortly, but in summary, we do expect the impacts on our financial results through the remainder of the year and potentially into 2021, but the underlying strength and momentum in our business is strong. While combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a top priority, we remain focused on executing our strategy of developing new medicines for patients. We exited 2019 with very strong momentum in revenue growth and margin expansion, driven by the uptake of our newer products. On slide nine, you\u2019ll see that momentum continued in Q1 2020 as we delivered strong underlying business performance augmented by the estimated COVID-19-related buying patterns from patients and customers I just described. Revenue growth accelerated in Q1, increasing 15% versus Q1 2019 or 16% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by volume, which contributed 22 percentage points of growth. Net of the estimated COVID-19 impact, revenue growth was 11% for the quarter in constant currency. Our newer medicines continue to be the driver of this growth, representing more than half of our revenue in the quarter. We\u2019ve made good progress in Q1 on our productivity agenda as operating income grew 32% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 390 basis points to 30.1% as revenue growth outpaced operating expenses. The estimated impact of COVID-19 buying patterns on the quarter also had a positive impact on our non-GAAP operating margin. But, as we discussed during our 2020 financial guidance call, we expect our 2020 operating margin to build throughout the year to achieve our 2020 target for the full year of 31%. We\u2019ve announced multiple pipeline milestones since our Q4 2019 earnings call, including approval of Lyumjev in Europe and Japan, and new indications for both Trulicity and Taltz in the U.S. During Q1, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and the dividend. As previously announced, we increased the dividend by 15% for 2020. At this point, we do not expect to make additional share repurchases in the near term, in order to maintain a cushion of liquidity and capacity for investment and continued dividend growth. Finally, we closed the acquisition of Dermira, a company focused on developing new therapies for chronic skin conditions, enhancing our Phase 3 pipeline with the addition of lebrikizumab, which is complementary to our dermatology business. Slide 10 includes the summary of key events since our last earnings call. Moving to slide 11, our non-GAAP financial performance in Q1 was robots, even when adjusting for the COVID-19 impact described earlier. In addition to strong top-line performance, gross margin as a percent of revenue was stable versus Q1 2019 at approximately 80% as favorable product mix and greater manufacturing efficiencies were partially offset by price and increased costs associated with COVID-19. Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew slower than revenue at 7% versus last year\u2019s quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased modestly by 2%, as cost containment and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. Travel restrictions and the suspension of in-person customer interactions late in the quarter, did result in lower travel and meeting expenses. However, it is offset by a higher U.S. branded prescription drug manufacturing fee that we recognized in Q1. R&D expenses grew 13%, reflecting higher development expenses for late-stage assets that increased throughout 2019. Our pause on clinical trial starts had limited impact in Q1. Operating income increased 32% compared to Q1 2019 as sales growth outpaced expense growth, resulting in operating income as a percent of revenue of 30.1% for the quarter. We begin 2020 with good momentum executing our strategy and are on track to achieve our 2020 full-year operating margin target of 31%. Other income and expenses was income of $89 million this quarter compared to income of $86 million in Q1 2019. In both quarters, this was driven by investment gains on public equities. Mark-to-market gains in Q1 2020, were primarily generated by prior equity investments in companies that are now pursuing vaccines for COVID-19. As we regularly highlight, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Our tax rate was 13.6%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in net discreet tax benefits. So, at the bottom line, earnings per share increased 32%. On slide 12, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 16% in constant currency during Q1, driven by strong volume growth of 22%, which we estimate at 17% net of the impact of COVID-19 buying patterns. This was partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest negative impact on revenue growth this quarter. Price declined 3% net of the price impact from the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government-sponsored programs in China. U.S. revenue grew 15%, compared to the first quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 19% was led by Trulicity, Humalog, Taltz, Alimta, Verzenio, Emgality, and Basaglar. As I mentioned earlier, we saw stocking at the wholesale and patient level due to COVID-19 that contributed approximately $200 million of revenues this quarter. While the situation remains fluid, we do expect this impact to largely reverse over the course of 2020. Pricing was a 4% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, in line with our 2020 guidance. This was driven primarily by growth in lower price segment, primarily driven by our diabetes products, which was partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts recalls and reduced utilization of patient assistance programs for Emgality due to increased commercial reimbursement. We have strong commercial and Medicare Part D access across the portfolio and have remained intact throughout Q1. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 21% in constant currency, driven by 24% volume growth, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and price. Volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio and also benefited from the divestiture of a legacy product in Spain. We estimate total international results were impacted by approximately $50 million of stocking due to the impact of COVID-19 in Q1 and the significant majority of this occurred in Europe. However, the underlying trends are very strong, as our newer products have continued to scale. In Japan, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, driven by volume growth, somewhat offset by a modest pricing headwind due to government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2019. Verzenio, Cyramza, Trulicity, Olumiant and Alimta were the key contributors to growth, partially offset by increased competition from Forteo and the impact of generic Strattera. In China, revenue grew 30% in constant currency, driven by 93% volume growth, partially offset by pricing concessions associated with the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs. We\u2019re very pleased with the significant volume increases we saw for these products and our ability to increase access for patients disease to these important cancer medicines. Outside of Tyvyt and Alimta, our business in China saw a meaningful decline in new patients starts during Q1 as the COVID-19 spread peaked during March. As the situation appears to be moving toward more stability, we are cautiously encouraged that new patient initiation and in-person customer interactions have begun to resume. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 14% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth drivers, Trulicity, Jardiance in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, Taltz, Cialis and Cyramza drove growth in Q1. As shown on slide 13, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 20 percentage points of growth this quarter, while also benefiting from the increased stocking that I described earlier. Slide 14 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $3 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 51% of total revenue. On slide 15, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2020, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We remain well-capitalized and closed Q1 with approximately $4 billion of cash and investments, and the ability to access debt markets at attractive rates. Moving to slide 16, you\u2019ll find our updated 2020 financial guidance. This is based on our best estimate at this time as we\u2019re balancing transparency and insight into the current view of our business with the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key assumptions supporting our updated guidance include the Q1 stocking benefit largely reverses over the course of 2020; the near-term reduction in new patient prescriptions, peaks in the second quarter in the U.S. and much of Europe; healthcare activity returns to more normal levels in the second half of this year, as doctors resume seeing new patients; price headwinds from the increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased us unemployment; and enrollment in existing studies, as well as the initiation of new clinical trials resumes midyear; and near-term spending on travel, in-person customer interactions and direct consumer advertising decreases and investments in digital promotion and support increases. We do believe the reduction in new patient starts will be temporary, but will impact our 2020 performance. The potential impact from increased unemployment will likely be more muted in the near term, but the impact could be more pronounced in 2021, depending on the shape of an economic recovery and the U.S. government programs to stimulate employment. While the extended duration of impact from COVID-19 drives the most uncertainty in our outlook, the positive underlying momentum in Q1 in our business augmented by the addition -- the estimated additional revenue benefit from COVID-19 related buying patterns, gives us confidence that the potential downside for the remainder of the year is accommodated within our previously community revenue range. While there are scenarios that could cause revenue to fall outside either end of our range, we believe the revenue range accommodates most of the uncertainty we see today. In addition to the impact of unemployment and the pace of economic recovery described earlier, the main variables we will monitor are the impact on new prescription trends during social distancing period, and the timing of resumption of non-COVID-19 healthcare activities. While we currently anticipate the most pronounced impact on new prescriptions to occur in Q2, the headwinds are likely to show up in Q3 and Q4 as inventory levels normalize, and the impact of pure new prescriptions compound. Moving down the income statement, we\u2019re confirming our prior expectations for gross margin as a percent of revenue to be roughly 81% on a non-GAAP basis and 79% on a GAAP basis. We do anticipate higher manufacturing costs associated with the extraordinary measures we are taking to keep our manufacturing workers safe and to keep medicines flowing to patients around the world. We expect this to be offset though by benefits from higher manufacturing volumes. We\u2019re maintaining a range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses as savings from reduced travel and decreased promotion are anticipated to be offset by investments in digital capabilities and increased marketing expenses in the second half of the year for key growth products. Our range for research and development expenses is also unchanged as savings from the pause to clinical trial activity are offset by our investments to pursue therapeutic treatments for COVID-19, as Dan described earlier. Therefore, there\u2019s no change to our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue guidance of 31%. We\u2019re updating the range of other income and expense to 0 to $150 million of expense, reflecting Q1 gains in our equity portfolio. Obviously, this number has some volatility going forward and we\u2019ll update accordingly. Turning to taxes. There\u2019s no change to our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance of approximately 15%. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.90 on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40. We are increasing the range to reflect the uncertainty of the impact to our business for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the first quarter, net of COVID-19 benefit, highlights the strength of our underlying business fundamentals. And as Dave mentioned in his introduction, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business. So Dave, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Josh. The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted us all in unforeseen ways. Although near-term challenges exist, we do remain confident in our long-term outlook for the Company and the strength of our fundamentals. The times of great crisis can bring out the best in people and in companies. And Lilly will continue to rise to that challenge. While a great deal of uncertainty remains, there are few certainties to which I would draw your attention. First, the collective spirit, expertise and commitment of my Lilly colleagues around the world is inspiring. Despite challenging circumstances and disrupted work routines, they\u2019ve rallied to fulfill our mission of discovering and supplying medicines that make life better for people around the world. They are exceptional. Second, speed and agility continue to be critical to the success of our business. We\u2019ve moved swiftly, pivoting our focus to join the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging our deep scientific capabilities and expertise on both the testing and therapeutic fronts. And lastly, I\u2019ve never been more certain of the importance of a healthy and vibrant biopharmaceutical industry. While it will take time to exit the current situation, we will recover. And the pharmaceutical industry will be the primary catalyst, developing new treatments and a vaccine to combat COVID-19, allowing people across the world to return to living their lives more normally and enabling economic activity to grow. It\u2019s clear, we are a vital part of any long-term solution for fighting this or any future pandemic. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We\u2019d like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Alan, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then,, we\u2019re ready for the first caller. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first I was just wondering, Josh, if you could expand on how the environment changes your approach to capital allocation. I know you mentioned, maybe less share repurchases in near term. But on the BD M&A side, do you actually think there could be an increasing number of opportunities? And does it change how you think about size? And then, the second I had was just where you stand with regulatory interactions in launch prep for selpercatinib. Just wondering if COVID changes at all your go-to-market strategy. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Terence. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first one and then Anne for the question on selpercatinib. Josh Smiley : Hi, Terrence. Thanks. On capital allocation, we really are sticking to our strategy. And as we\u2019ve outlined, we do see external innovation or business development as a key component of our long-term growth strategy. But, what we\u2019re really focused on -- continue to focus on are key opportunities in our therapeutic areas where we can bring in first or best-in-class type of assets into the pipeline. We\u2019re continuing -- I think that work continues. I haven\u2019t seen anything slow down as a function of not being able to travel or work from home types of activities. Certainly, there are a smaller biotech companies that may have different views in terms of their cash runway or ease. And to the extent that that helps to engender more discussions, we\u2019ll take advantage of that. I don\u2019t think it changes anything in terms of how we think about size, our business is strong, as I mentioned, and we don\u2019t see benefits in large scale types of acquisition. So, we\u2019ll continue to focus on the things that we are focused on. And I think for as long as we\u2019re in these kinds of social distancing restrictions, I don\u2019t see that as impacting our ability to transact. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Anne? Anne White : Yes. Terence, thanks for the question on selpercatinib. So, I\u2019m pleased to share that there\u2019s been no delay in the regulatory timeline for selpercatinib. And the FDA has been extremely collaborative and responsive in working through these challenges, time. So, we just thank them for the speed and the commitment they\u2019ve had. They continue to progress the application. And as you know, we submitted in December, it\u2019s currently under priority review. So, we expect to have regulatory action by the PDUFA date in Q3. Regarding your questions on launch, it is interesting times, obviously. And as a Company, as Dave shared, we continue to prioritize combating the spread of coronavirus, and we recognize that this is also the case for healthcare professionals, and we\u2019re incredibly aware of the load that they\u2019re carrying at this time and need to express our appreciation for all of their efforts on behalf of their patients. So, with that, we also though recognize that selpercatinib has shown striking efficacy and really a very favorable safety profile in treating lung and thyroid cancers with RET fusions or RET mutations. And so, we think it\u2019s still very important that patients and physicians are aware that there\u2019s a new medicine available, and the first to specifically target RET alterations. So, what we\u2019re doing with launch activity is they will look different. But we\u2019re committed to making sure that patients who are good candidates for selpercatinib have access. So, assuming that in-person interactions are still on hold when we launch, we\u2019re going to focus initially on making sure that we inform customers of the approval and the key efficacy and safety data via email and other digital channels that we have. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we\u2019re quick to engage in virtual product details when the customer requests those and give them more information. And then, when appropriate, we\u2019re also going to make sure that we leverage virtual peer to peer programs to provide thought leaders the opportunity to share the data with their colleagues. And in addition, of course, we\u2019ll be sharing the data through a top tier journal publication, as well as in upcoming medical meetings. So, we\u2019ll make sure that the -- the goal here is to make sure that physicians and patients are aware and informed that we have now an incredible new medicine that\u2019s specifically targeted for RET. And it\u2019s just been an incredible partnership with Loxo and Lilly teams. If you think about it, this medicine started Phase 1, first patient dosed in May of 2017, and we\u2019re looking at approval here in 2020. So, it\u2019s remarkable. And our thanks really goes to the FDA for the speed at which they\u2019re moving through the review. Operator : Our next question will come from the line -- one moment, please. [Operator Instructions] We are restarting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] My apologies to everyone on the conference call. We\u2019ll move next to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much and I appreciate all the color on the call today. Just my two questions. First on disruption to near-term prescription. You mentioned diabetes as an area less impacted relative to areas like pain and immunology. But, I do have a specific question on Trulicity. I guess, when I think about that product and the GLP-1 category in general, we\u2019ve been seeing very healthy growth here. We\u2019re seeing significant new patient starts. Is it a product and a market maybe more broadly that you anticipate could see a slowdown as we go through 2Q as the impact of some of the reduced physician visits start to build? And then, my second question was on payer mix over time. Could you just help us frame the magnitude of impact you could see to net price in the U.S. from adverse payer mix as we look out over the next year or so? I guess, specifically, is this something that could cause price to meaningfully deviate from this low-single-digit price erosion we\u2019re seeing? So, could that become more like a mid to high-single-digit erosion or you think you\u2019ve got a more modest impact than that? Thanks very much. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Chris. We\u2019ll go to Mike Mason for the question on Trulicity, and then Josh, the question on payer mix. Mike Mason : Okay. On Trulicity, it\u2019s difficult to predict long-term impact of the COVID-19 crisis, given the uncertainty on the length and the impact on economy and patient visits. And also, it\u2019s unclear how patients who live with diabetes, who are at greater risk for complications from COVID-19, will that change the compliance that they have with the medication and increase that. But, what I can tell you is little over a month into the crisis that the GLP market and Trulicity TRX volume remain strong. It\u2019s currently at 30%. And so, we haven\u2019t seen the impact at the TRx level yet. We have seen the impact on NTS and NBRx volume kind of post-COVID, both for Trulicity and the GLP market. Josh has shared that the overall pharma market has seen a decline of 42% in NBRx. What we\u2019re seeing in the GLP market is a 30% decline for NBRx. Now, we haven\u2019t seen that manifest itself in the TRx volume yet. If you take a look at the NPRx and for Trulicity, it\u2019s only 5.6% of the TRx rate, which is a relatively low turnover for the marketplace. So, we think that, Trulicity relative to other products, other therapeutic areas will have kind of a slower impact from the COVID situation. But again, it\u2019s hard to predict as we have uncertainty on the length of the impact of the economy and patient visits. What we can say is that we\u2019re very confident in Trulicity\u2019s strong fundamentals. We saw 32% volume growth in Q1 and 40% revenue growth in Q1. So, we\u2019re very confident in the very-strong fundamentals of Trulicity. So, Chris, thanks for the question. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Josh? Josh Smiley : Thanks, Chris. On your question on what could happen to net price going forward given what we\u2019re seeing in the in the U.S. with the economy, first, I think it\u2019s too early to make too many predictions. There\u2019s a lot to still see. And as you highlighted in your question, we\u2019ve already assumed that we\u2019re going to see negative net prices in the U.S. for -- between now and 2025. That\u2019s already in our current guidance. So, I would see whatever happens here is probably a moderate impact on that. I think, what we have to keep in mind first for Lily\u2019s portfolio, we\u2019re spread across multiple payer segments. Certainly, in general, a move from a well-insured commercial patient to Medicaid is a net negative. But, many of the commercial patients, it\u2019s my assumption, who are losing -- in the first wave, losing employment, they may not be in great commercial plans to begin with their exchanges and other things. So, there\u2019s a lot to still see what happens here. Our view is, we\u2019ll ensure that the patients who are losing insurance have access to our medications and programs. We, as Dave mentioned, announced the $35 change to our diabetes program. So, we\u2019re looking at everything we can do to ensure that people can stay on our medications and have access to them, and believe that some of these impacts will be temporary and then we\u2019ll have a much better sense by the end of the year on what 2021 looks like. But, I\u2019d say, overall, our expectation is this continues the trend, the net price declines, but not a fundamental change to our thinking about the business. Operator : We will move next to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Same topic. You have a high exposure relative to your peers to the commercial book. For your full year guidance, could you help us on what kinds of U.S. unemployment rates you\u2019re assuming, as well as some magnitude of the volume loss and potential Medicaid expansion, anything you can say about the rest of the 2021? And then, separately, on Olumiant baricitinib COVID-19. I\u2019m just trying to understand, which patient population you\u2019re targeting. The literature talks to both a potential antiviral effect, as well as an anti-inflammatory effect, which would suggest potentially two different patient populations, the earlier then respiratory distress. Where you\u2019re going here with the clinical trials? Many thanks. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Andrew. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and then Dan on bari \u201819 COVID. Josh Smiley : Thank you, Andrew. I think, as it relates to 2020, our sales guidance range on the -- I described sort of the factors we\u2019re looking at. I\u2019d say, if we\u2019re on the lower end of that sales range, we do include in our thinking there some incremental impact from pricing. Again, I think it\u2019d probably be pretty muted this year. And then, I think we\u2019ll just have to look and see what next year looks like. And I think it\u2019s not just absolute levels of unemployment, it\u2019s what programs are in place to bridge the gap and otherwise. So, this year, again, I think our range, given the strong position we\u2019re starting from Q1, our range accommodates potential incremental pricing impacts for potentially short-term moves to insurance or Medicaid. But I think at this point, it\u2019s a little early to have -- rollout specifics around this one. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thank Andrew for the question on baricitinib and mechanism of action and potential on COVID-19. You\u2019re right in your comments about a potential for a dual mechanism of action for baricitinib. I think first publication on the potential role of baricitinib in COVID-19 came from a group called BenevolentAI where they modeled out that the effects both, on viral entry and on inflammatory response could be beneficial in this disease. The trial that we discussed that is the Adaptive COVID-19 trial with NIAID is in hospitalized patients. So, it\u2019s rather later in the disease progression. And the design of the trial is primarily to look at the effects of baricitinib on that inflammatory cascade. It\u2019s notable that that trial currently is conceived of as a factorial design with remdesivir. Of course, in addition to look at the clinical outcomes of these patients with viral load, and other factors will also be evaluated. I think, if we see success there, that could give us confidence to go earlier in the disease course. But, given sort of the mixed mechanism action here, right now, we\u2019re looking at those hospitalized patients. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : That will come from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. So, I have two questions. First, in the event that baricitinib and/or the Ang2 succeed in June, what are the next steps? Would you be filing for approval at that time? And then, with respect to the Ang2, could you just discuss the manufacturing capacity and the amount of volume you could produce later this year? And then, second, with respect to clinical trials, when do you expect to restart enrollment in the majority of your trials? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. Dave, we\u2019ll go to Dan for both of those. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Dave. So, starting out with the expectations for what if any of our molecules are successful in COVID-19. Baricitinib is probably the most straightforward to answer. It\u2019s a small molecule that can be produced at large capacity and it\u2019s already approved in geographies around the world for rheumatoid arthritis. So, depending on the quality of the data and the benefit risks that we see in COVID-19 patients, you could expect that could potentially move very, very quickly, if it\u2019s successful. Ang2 is sort of the opposite end of the spectrum. This is investigational monoclonal antibody, production is more constrained and lead times are longer, and this is a Phase 2 type trial. I think though, the one that we\u2019re most focused on, which you didn\u2019t directly ask about in your question, is the neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. I think, that\u2019s where we see a relatively high probability of technical success, given success with neutralizing antibodies against other viruses, and also given what we\u2019ve seen pre-clinically with our project. And that\u2019s also one where you can imagine a broad treatment paradigm. Antibodies like this are likely not only to work in sick patients, but could potentially have a prophylactic use, which then sort of demands large quantities. I think, in all of these programs, you just also note that these aren\u2019t chronic therapies. They\u2019re one time use or short period of time in a case of baricitinib. But still, I think for the antibody, we\u2019re working very diligently to expand our manufacturing capacity that would be ready to deploy, both internally and with partnerships, if the neutralizing antibodies are successful. We\u2019re making those investments in advance. I mentioned, we started GMP manufacturing already at our facilities to support the clinical trials and we\u2019re prepared to scale quite rapidly, if we see a positive signal with a neutralizing antibody. Your second question was on clinical trial restart timelines. I think, it\u2019s important to think about the context for why we stopped enrolling new patients and starting new clinical trials. It wasn\u2019t so much a problem with our ability to maintain the clinical trials. In fact, I\u2019m quite confident -- even more confident today than I would have been a month ago, in our ability to meet all of our sponsor obligations, our ability to deliver drug to sites, or even directly to patients, where it\u2019s needed to measure outcomes either at the sites or by other means directly with patients. So, I\u2019m really confident in our ability to carry out the trials. It\u2019s a desire to relieve the sites and hospitals of the burden of running clinical trials. So, we\u2019re watching our clinical trial sites carefully, many of them are already starting to ask the same question you are when they can restart. We\u2019ll make decisions along with them based on the burden of COVID-19 that they\u2019re having and how much time and attention they can devote to clinical trials. Operator : Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Go ahead, please. Seamus Fernandez : A couple here. There\u2019s a -- HMA is a consulting group that estimates the sort of medical -- Medicaid enrollment increases. So, I guess, if -- I was just hoping that you guys could put a little bit more granularity around your estimates for expectations for Medicaid enrollment. This group estimates that Medicaid enrollment could increase by 11 to 23 million, uninsured could increase by 10 to 11 million. And just maybe if you can just help us put a little context around the percent of volume -- of Lilly\u2019s volume that flows into Medicaid currently, versus the percent of sales that flows into Medicaid currently, and just I think help us understand a little bit of the context in that regard. And then, the second question for Dan. Dan, I think we were expecting the Phase 2 Alzheimer\u2019s data in the second half of this year for the NGC antibody. Could you just update us on that and how that\u2019s progressing? Is that still expected in the second half of this year, or should we anticipate that in sort of a 2021 timeframe? Just an update there would be great. Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and then Dan for your question on donanemab readout. Josh Smiley : Sure. Thanks, Seamus. In terms of -- across our entire portfolio, in the U.S., about 10% of our volume is Medicaid right now, about 40% is commercial insurance, 20% Part D, and then the rest is Part B or hospital-based or uninsured or other types of volumes. As we talked about before, I think the biggest sort of challenge would be a really well insured commercial patient moving to Medicaid. There are a lot of steps in between those things happening. As I mentioned, in the prior question, we are anticipating in our sale guidance for 2020 that we could see some net impact as a function of that. But again, I would say, it\u2019s -- and we\u2019ve looked at all those estimates and in terms of what the long-term look could be. And we\u2019ll provide more updates on that for 2021 when we have a better sense. But again, I\u2019d say that our sales guidance right now does accommodate the fact that we may see some near-term moves to increase Medicaid or increase uninsured. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Seamus for the question on our Alzheimer\u2019s Phase 2 portfolio. You asked specifically about the donanemab, our anti N3pG-a beta antibody. This is a really robust plaque clearing antibody. We know it can clear plaques to quite a great extent and quite quickly as well. It\u2019s an 18-month Phase 2 study designed to demonstrate efficacy in a relatively large and homogenous population of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. This study is fully enrolled. It\u2019s proceeding along the previously communicated timelines, which means that last patient visit will be in the end of this year, as you said. And most likely then, we\u2019ll have a data to talk about shortly after that, although probably in January rather than December. But, no changes to our timelines on that trial. Similarly, the tau antibody as well as our symptomatic D1 PAM, those are all Phase 2 studies designed for efficacy, similarly fully enrolled and moving along the previously communicated timeline. So, no change in the Alzheimer\u2019s portfolio there. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : That will be Steve Scala from Cowen. Go ahead. Steve Scale : Good morning. Thank you. It was mentioned that most clinical programs are paused for new starts. A couple of questions related to this. First, I realize that every trial is different. But generally speaking, how long will pause have to last to impact the long-term outlook for Lilly\u2019s sales vision, say through 2025? And then, second, according to clinicaltrials.gov, only 5 of 155 Lilly trials that are actively recruiting have had recruitment status changed in the last five weeks. Just wondering about this relative to what you said and what the release said. I believe companies are obligated to reflect any changes within 30 days. So, I\u2019m just curious why really no changes have been reflected. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Hey, Steve. We\u2019ll go to Dan for both of those questions. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. Thanks, Steve, for those questions. So, the first question was just about, like how long does the delay and your enrollment have to be before it starts to impact our long-term financials? Look, I think, you know very well that clinical trial timelines and enrollment timelines are often estimates. We give those rounded usually to the half a year or sometimes just calendar year. So, for now, you can think of these as a worst case scenario being a day-to-day delay. So, for every day that were paused enrollment, it\u2019s a stay delay to when we get the data. Now, our ambition is to beat that. And there\u2019s a couple of reasons why we think we can do that. There\u2019s sort of a latent demand to be in these clinical trials that\u2019s accumulating. So, when we put the switch again to allow enrollment, we think we\u2019ll see both, the patients and be able to make up some lost time on enrollment. That\u2019s one of the reasons. Another reason why we can even make up some time and be better than day-by-day is the fact that we can stagger our enrollment in different geographies, not everywhere in the world is similarly affected by COVID-19. So, while our comments on pausing enrollment might apply to the majority of our geographies, there could also be certain countries where we continue to enroll or even shift enrollment more to those countries. As for the clinicaltrials.gov updating, you\u2019re right that there\u2019s a time lag in that update. There\u2019s also a time lag really in stopping enrollment because you can imagine that although we say no new enrollment, there are patients who could be part of the way through screening and on a case-by-case, trial-by-trial, geography-by-geography basis. We often allow those patients who are already undergoing study procedures to continue those procedures and enrolling in a trial. So, it takes a little bit of time for all this to trickle through the system. But, I\u2019m as I said earlier, looking forward to the day when we can turn these back on when hospitals and clinical trial sites have gotten beyond the burden of treating COVID-19 patients. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Steve, for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : That will be Navin Jacob with UBS. Go ahead. Navin Jacob : Just on Trulicity, if I may. Sorry to beat a dead horse here. But, I want to understand, relative to the negative 5% price pressure that you have guided to in the U.S., how we should be thinking about that now. And related to that is -- I know you\u2019ve spoken about or spoken to insulins being barely profitable in Medicaid channel. Is that true for Trulicity as well? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not as onerous as it is for insulins if that switch were to happen. But just any kind of color would be helpful with regards to Trulicity. And then, just a quick question, if I may on Taltz, looks quite strong. You also mentioned changes in rebates and discounts. Any kind of color around pricing for Taltz as well would be helpful. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Navin. We\u2019ll go to Josh for both of these price-related questions on Trulicity and Taltz. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Navin. First, our outlook at the beginning of the year for U.S. price was net declines in the low single digits. And, as I mentioned, in the range that we\u2019re looking at now, I think we\u2019re still in the low single digits that that could add in the more pessimistic case, maybe that adds a point or something but it\u2019s still in the same range. To your question specifically about products, what we said is insulins are not profitable in Medicaid. We pay in effect 100% rebates for patients who are on our mealtime insulins in Medicaid. So, that\u2019s a place where you see a real challenge I think if -- to the extent that the patients are moving from commercial insurance to Medicaid. On Trulicity, it\u2019s less of an issue. It\u2019s still net positive but Medicaid just in general is a lower price segment than commercial plan. But it wouldn\u2019t be as big of a move as it would be for our commercially insured mealtime insulin patients. On Trulicity, I think, we\u2019ve highlighted through the last few years that Trulicity access is not as strong as it is for the rest of our portfolio. And what we do in many cases is Trulicity patients have to step through various PAs or restrictions in their plan. We make estimates on our utilization on how things are going to transpire there. What we found in Q1 is we were actually getting more net price for a segment of our patients than we had estimated. So, we\u2019ve got a little bit of a benefit there. I think, for the year, we\u2019re still sort of assuming the same that we maintain a kind of access that we have now at relatively constant prices. And you\u2019ll see these ups and downs and it\u2019s a little bit challenging in Taltz for the reason that I mentioned. You\u2019ll see sort of the quarterly ups and downs. But, the underlying trend that we see is pretty stable pricing, pretty stable access. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Navin, Thanks for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : That will be Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions] All right. Thank you. Next question will be from Umer Raffat with Evercore. One moment, please. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I hope everyone is staying safe. There has been some concern about GIP safety after European paper. And I just thought it would be helpful if you could speak to the Blinded CV event rate you\u2019re seeing across your Phase 3 program and whether it\u2019s in line with what you would\u2019ve expected? And secondly, I know Josh, you\u2019ve gotten only 25 questions on it, so let me just ask the 26th one. You mentioned pretty stable pricing in the diabetes business. Can you speak to whether patients in high-deductible private plans still produce the same net price for Lilly as those in Medicaid? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Umer. We\u2019ll go to Dan around GIP safety and then Josh for pricing. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks Umer for the question. Surely, you\u2019re referring to sort of a small epidemiological study that looked at a risk of GIP polymorphisms. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s directly applicable to what we\u2019re seeing with tirzepatide. Here, we\u2019re studying this in a population that has diabetes. And we know from our Phase 2 trials that the physiological effects of tirzepatide, which obviously is combined GIP and GLP, are quite beneficial, and they look like they would have a strong effect on improving cardiovascular outcomes. So, we\u2019re super confident about that. In terms of the blinded event rates in ongoing studies, that\u2019s not something that we disclose or talk about. But, certainly though the rate of those events is the rate limiting factor in our submission. So, that\u2019s a long tail in our submission is waiting to get enough events to discharge any cardiovascular safety risks, so we can we can submit tirzepatide. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Josh? Josh Smiley : Hi, Umer. Thanks for the question. And I think you are building on one of the comments I made, which was, I don\u2019t think you can just look at sort of a move from commercial to Medicaid. It\u2019s very much driven by plan dynamics and otherwise. And I think without getting into too much detail, yes, it is fair to say that patients in high deductible plans, when they\u2019re in that deductible phase, you know that we and other pharmaceutical companies have copay cards and other things to try to alleviate sort of the cash burden at the retail pharmacy. So, we do -- the net price for those specific prescriptions to us is very low and probably in many cases could be lower than a Medicaid prescription. But again, I think that gets back to what I was saying earlier, I think it\u2019s way too premature to make assumptions around what a move from commercial to Medicaid may look like. There are lots of complexities here and I think lots of things still to be learned about the economy and what 2021 will look like. But, it\u2019s not -- we\u2019re not as I think on a mass basis as concerned as probably it looks like when you just look at just general commercial to a Medicaid for one of the reasons that you are sort of implying in your question. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Umer, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : We will return to the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Josh, a number of P&L questions for you. You quantified the pull forward COVID impact for a few products. Just wanted to ask you, are those things kind of happening today in the U.S. and do you expect the OUS dynamic to eventually mirror the U.S.? And then on your guidance, would you expect normalization of the market to be more of a 3Q or 4Q type of event? And then real quick, Dave, you highlighted at the end, but how would you characterize your discussion with policymakers today versus the beginning of the year, just with respect to headwinds on drug pricing and clearly industry response to COVID having somewhat of a halo effect? Josh Smiley : So, just on the $250 million, we estimated in Q1, as we mentioned, about $200 million are added in the U.S., and we talked about the three big product categories. I think, the rest -- the product I didn\u2019t mention is sort of spread nominally among those others. As we look at that $200 million in the U.S., only -- less than a third of that is at the wholesale -- wholesaler level. So, we saw some modest build at the wholesaler. Most of that estimate we\u2019re making is either in the retail channel or all the way down to patients -- in patients\u2019 homes. So, I think it\u2019s going to be pretty difficult. I mean, we\u2019re assuming that that will turn around. But, I think being able to sort of make a prediction at this point is top, I would assume the wholesaler piece will start to normalize more quickly and I think we\u2019re seeing that. The retail and patient piece I think will be -- some of it will be a function of what happens in social distancing otherwise, and some of it, who knows, it may be a little bit more -- have a long tail associated with that. What we saw in Europe, there was about $50 million. And I think most of the estimate is around our diabetes portfolio. And I think that one we probably assume is a little more likely to normalize in the second half of this year. So, I think Geoff, we\u2019ll try to be transparent about this as we move through the quarter. But, I think there is going to be some variability in that U.S. piece that\u2019s in the retail channel or all the way to patient homes. Dave Ricks : Yes. On the policy side, I mean I think you have it right there, maybe just a little subtext that -- there\u2019s sort of two pressures that prior to COVID I think we were feeling. One was a broad acceptance across both sides of the aisle that there were certain behaviors and actions which are undesirable by the industry and should be curbed. Many of these actually Lilly agrees with. So, this is about patent evergreening and strategies that involve using systems designed to create incentives in a way that perhaps is best case in foretaste and maybe worst case abusive. There\u2019s a bunch of Senate-related actions to curb these. And I think we\u2019re generally for them because we don\u2019t do those things. And I think they do create a suppression of the respect for and trust in the industry. I actually think those items will continue amidst the COVID crisis, maybe even be amplified, because as solutions come from the industry, which they will, it\u2019s clear that the producers of those solutions will be under a lot of scrutiny to make sure there\u2019s broad access and affordability and that we\u2019re acting reasonably. But I have to say, I\u2019m speaking to my peers across the industry, many collaborative projects, and within our own Company, nobody is really focused on the pure commercial side of this. It\u2019s really about solving the problem. And the spirit of collaboration and response has been tremendous. But, I think that pressure will be there, and some there could be actions coming quickly that could strike in those areas. Again, from a Lilly perspective, we\u2019re less constructive on those. In fact, we\u2019ve been for in many of those proposals. On the other hand, there\u2019s, I think from the more the far left in the U.S. and in certain OUS circles this idea that perhaps the industry itself is flawed and profit motive in pharmaceuticals is a bad thing. Of course, we vehemently disagree with that point of view. And I do think, those voices are significantly quieted today as everyone realizes that the built-up capacities of this industry are the very thing that will allow the world to escape COVID-19. And while in the absence of a pandemic, those may seem like a premium; in the presence of a pandemic, those seem really scarce and important. And so, I\u2019m more bullish on that more extreme view being significantly dissipated for some time to come. We need to behave ourselves appropriately and with good taste, if I can use that word and with kind of balance to our actions as we solve the problem. But I\u2019m encouraged by that so far. So, I think, we\u2019ve got a unique, as I said in my comments, it\u2019s just kind of a once in a generation opportunity to reset the reputation in the industry, and to put in place policies that make sense and balance profit motive, which we think clearly has a place to create new medicines, not just for COVID but others with curbing abusive behaviors and making sure we\u2019re earning a respect from patients and policymakers alike. So, anyway, we\u2019ll work on that certainly over the next couple of years. But first, we need to work on solving the pandemic problem. And that\u2019s got all my energy right now. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Geoff, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : That will be Louise Chen with Cantor. Go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So, my first question is, if there is any way you could give us a sense of the underlying earnings growth, if you extract the impacts from COVID and any non-operational items, even if it\u2019s just qualitatively? And then, second question is, are you expecting any economic benefit for your COVID candidates in development if they do work? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Josh? Josh Smiley : Hi, Louise. Thanks. I think, if you just -- at a very high level, if you just take out the revenue for Q1 that we\u2019re attributing to -- the $250 million we\u2019re attributing to buying patterns, and sort of hold everything else the same, we get down to earnings, EPS growth on a more normalized basis of about 18% or so. So, I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable look at the business. As with every quarter, there are other things that we could normalize out there. But I think that\u2019s probably a good sort of starting point. And as we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019re expecting that $250 million to normalize some sometime through the year, at least in our guidance for now. But that\u2019s where we are. I think then, on the question around economic benefits, no, there is no benefit assumed in our guidance from any of these treatments more much more interested in getting these treatments to patients at this point. And frankly, I\u2019d say, at this point, we\u2019re probably just assuming some costs for sure associated with the investment in the trials that Dan mentioned in the scale up and manufacturing and otherwise. So, some of that thinking is already embedded in our line items now. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : That will be Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thanks for all the color on the call. I just had a couple of questions on pipeline. So one, mirikizumab, you mentioned a positive initial top-line data in psoriasis. I guess, I\u2019ve been wondering about sort of differentiation for that product relative to the other IL-23. Maybe if there\u2019s anything more you can share now that you have some of the top line data? And just any update on timing, especially on the GI trials, or I think you\u2019ve talked about that being a kind of a more unique opportunity potentially. And then, going back to Alzheimer\u2019s, I appreciate your comments from before. Just regarding DIAN-TU and kind of what we saw from sola and also from gantenerumab. You mentioned the plaque reduction that you\u2019ve seen with donanemab. Does the DIAN-TU results in any way change your thoughts around sort of plaque reduction, the biomarker impact and the impact it might have on the clinical outcome at the end of the day, just because we do not see that correlation in that trial? I know, it was a small trial, but any perspective would be helpful. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much. We announced that mirikizumab met all the co-primary and key secondary endpoints in the first OASIS-1 trial, which is the placebo-controlled 52 weeks trial in psoriasis. And that is what we expected as well. We are setting the bar extremely high in psoriasis with Taltz. We have been able now to demonstrate in five head-to-head trials superiority, and then, three of those in psoriasis, both in terms of time to onset, the level of clearance and the sustainability of a clearance. So, we are waiting now for the second Phase 3 trial, which is the head-to-head trial versus secukinumab 52-week data. And I think that will particularly inform our decision on how we progress with psoriasis indication. For miri, I think we have also stated very clearly, but the big excitement is around ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. And we really believe that in ulcerative colitis, there is big unmet need. And we have a potentially first-in-class and best-in-class asset in mirikizumab. And we also know that the biologic penetration is relatively low. And we have previously shared that we expect the top line readout for the induction data in Q4 this year and the maintenance top line in 2021. For Crohn\u2019s disease, we have announced earlier, but we will do a top line announcement in 2022. At this time and with COVID-19, we are certain that there will be a delay in one or both of those programs. However, we believe it\u2019s also premature to quantify the impact. And as the situation evolves, we will have a better understanding of the impact as well as our ability to mitigate those. And the delay here that\u2019s important to state is it\u2019s driven by difficulties to access the study sites, but particularly infusion centers, and the ability for some of those centers to conduct and perform endoscopies. So, overall, a high level of excitement still for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, and the head-to-head data versus secukinumab will guide our decision moving forward on psoriasis. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : As for Alzheimer\u2019s, DIAN-TU, I mean, of course, this is a really heroic and difficult effort to study effective drugs in the dominantly inherent Alzheimer\u2019s population. I think, unfortunately, there is just a small number of patients who completed the trial, especially with the higher dose for solanezumab. So, tough to make conclusions about any clinical effects of sola there. But, as you point out, sola is not a plaque-lowering antibody. It works on soluble A-beta. So, I can\u2019t draw conclusions about plaque-lowering from solanezumab data. I think, though, the most important things to look at in DIAN are the biomarker outcomes. And perhaps, if you think about the biomarker outcomes, you could add a little bit of confidence around plaque lowering. But once again, it\u2019s a small study and hard to draw those conclusions. I look forward to the results from our Phase 2 trial, which I think should be a clean trial, a clean test of the hypothesis in a relatively homogenous population. That data is not very far off right now. Kevin Hern : And we\u2019re going to the next caller, please. Operator : That would be from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : A couple of questions, please. On tirzepatide, you mentioned results in 2020, and everyone knows that, I think. Is that just likely to be top line, or are we likely to see a more set of results in some form or another, whether it\u2019s publication or presentation? And then, second question is on Tyvyt, your PD-1 in China. I feel like over time, I\u2019ve gotten mixed messages from the company on the importance of this product. Maybe a year ago, I was talking to one of the members of senior management and it was kind of described as a China-only product, of smaller importance. But, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still the current point of view. I asked about it last quarter. I didn\u2019t get much of an answer. So, the question is really twofold on Tyvyt. The development program from here in China in terms of next tumor types; and perhaps more importantly, your plans to take this outside of China into developed markets, U.S., Europe or anywhere else that\u2019s traditionally considered developed? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Tim. We\u2019ll go to Mike for the tirzepatide question and then Dave will take the Tyvyt. Mike Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. Just directly, we do believe we\u2019ll have our first top-line readouts of the SURPASS program for the first trial in Q4 of 2020 and then additional readouts, top-line as well as at medical meetings going into 2021. Thanks for the question. Dave Ricks : Yes. Tim, as it relates to Tyvyt, I don\u2019t think your read of the prior commentary is wrong. I think, we originally collaborated with Innovent as a China-only play for biologics and cancer, and a few other biosimilar opportunities. But, there are -- two things have changed, which I think -- and today, we\u2019re breaking out China for the first time. So, maybe that\u2019s the third thing that\u2019s changed. But what one is that Tyvyt was the only PD-1 put on the PD-L nationally in China. So, that does change the economic profile of it for us and certainly for the Chinese business. And the second is the positive data that was released in the combination with pemetrexed in first line non-small cell lung cancer, which is very-encouraging and I think does change the trajectory of that certainly in China. Of course, right now, we\u2019re very focused on the Chinese opportunity, and that remains our focus in the short term. And as Josh mentioned, I think, in his remarks, there was a great volume growth in China for our oncology portfolio, and Tyvyt is a key part of that. So, anyway, great partnership with Innovent. They do a great job. And it\u2019s been a successful way to think about building our business, which is a little bit underrepresented in China a decade ago through local partnerships with local innovators. And we\u2019re really pleased with how that\u2019s progressed. Kevin Hern : Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please? Operator : That will be Carter Gould with Barclays. Go ahead. Carter Gould : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to I guess dig into the comment over the inevitable fiscal pressure on government-funded healthcare, specifically thinking about Europe and the pressure on budgets there. I guess, are you guys viewing it as a possibility, probability or likelihood there\u2019s incremental pricing pressure in Europe, I guess, looking out later this year or into next? I appreciate any thoughts there. And then following up on the Tyvyt discussion. When could we expect the ORION-11 data to be presented? Is that something that could still come in the first half this year, or will we have to wait until the back half of the year? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Carter. We\u2019ll go to Dave for the question for Europe, and then Anne for the question about the Tyvyt ORION-11 data. Dave Ricks : Yes. As it relates to Europe - and I would say this extrapolates to other government-run health systems like Australia, Canada, Japan as well, we saw a policy response in nearly every jurisdiction following the \u201808, \u201809 fiscal crisis. Well, this isn\u2019t a fiscal crisis. It\u2019s -- there will be a fiscal crisis brought on by the pandemic in many of these economies. It will lower tax receipts. And then, the governments will need to look for methods to reduce their spending. I think, we can predict that with almost absolute certainty. One of the items on their list is often drugs because it\u2019s an input that can be negotiated or in many cases, they don\u2019t need to negotiate. They just change their rules. And we saw that certainly happen and create a three or four-year series of policy moves, depending on the relative strength of the economy that suppressed drug pricing in places like Europe and Australia, Canada. So, we\u2019re projecting that in the future. As Josh mentioned, we don\u2019t see a lot of that happening in \u201820, probably tax receipts falling in \u201821 lead to legislative actions in \u201821 and \u201822, which leads to suppressed pricing beyond that. That\u2019s to me a certainty across the industry. And then, the real question is how relatively innovative is your portfolio? Because a lot of these policies tend to be using leverage governments can have when there\u2019s relative substitutability. So, the more innovative the portfolio, the more immune you become to these things. Obviously, we\u2019re working hard on that side of the equation. And hopefully, we\u2019ll be on the positive end of the industry. But, I suspect as an industry as a whole, there will be -- these international pressures will present themselves across everyone\u2019s portfolios to some degree or another. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Anne? Anne White : Yes. Thanks for the question on Tyvyt. So, with the Phase 3 ORION study, as you know is an interim analysis that was positive, and we\u2019re very excited about initiating that submission with Innovent to the regulatory authorities in China. And we will be submitting that data for a medical meeting in the second half of this year. So, you\u2019ll see it in the second half of 2020. Kevin Hern : Great. Thanks, Anne. Carter, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ve exhausted the queue. So we\u2019ll go to Dave to close. Dave Ricks : All right. Thank you all. We appreciate your participation in the call and your interest in the Company. Obviously, different times today. And just on a personal note, I know many of the sell side community are based on the East Coast, and we hope you\u2019re all well and your families are functioning and certainly healthy through this crisis. As usual, any follow-up calls or questions can be directed to our really incredible Investor Relations team. And again, hope you all stay well. And we\u2019ll be in touch soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, VP of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Hern : Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q2 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We\u2019re also joined by Sara Smith and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team.  During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the extent and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed on slide three, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-Ks filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll remind you that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for some opening comments. Dave Ricks : Thanks Kevin. A lot has changed in the world since our last earnings call. Science has continued to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and efforts across the industry to develop treatments and vaccines are progressing rapidly. While some regions and countries have begun to reopen, COVID-19 cases and deaths are climbing in other places. Despite these challenges, Lilly continues to demonstrate resilience and resourcefulness to progress our mission of making medicines for the millions of patients we serve.  I've never been more proud of the company and my 35,000 teammates. This past quarter was unlike any other during my tenure as CEO and currently combating social, economic and public health crises. Economic uncertainty remains as high unemployment persists in many countries. As expected, our business experience headwinds this quarter, with patients unable to see doctors or access healthcare during periods when the economies were shut down to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and by the dwindling or the unwinding afford buying into Q1 that occurred.  Overall our year-to-date results are strong and indicative of the underlying trends. I'm proud of Lilly\u2019s efforts to ensure patients have access to their medicines. To find creative ways to ensure we advance critical research, and to advance our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19.  We continue to staff our manufacturing facilities around the globe with essential personnel, to ensure there are no disruptions in the supply of medicine, and in recent weeks we resumed activity in the majority of our clinical trials where enrollment had been paused. Resuming in-person promotional activities when it's safe on a country-by-country and on a state-by-state basis in the U.S., and we will continue to use these virtual engagement tools we\u2019ve built to augment in-person promotional activities.  Throughout Q2 we saw a steady increase in customer contacts and medical education touch points as we leveraged new platforms to reach physicians. We continue to see increased interest in volume of virtual interactions from physicians and expect a hybrid model of in-person remote engagement for some time in the U.S. as well as internationally.  We also made good progress this quarter, executing our R&D strategy, launching two new medicines in the U.S., including Retevmo, the first therapy ever approved for patients with RET driven lung and thyroid cancers, and Lyumjeva, a fast acting mealtime insulin for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Taltz and non-radiographic axSpA, Cyramza in combination with erlotinib for EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer and Tauvid, our new diagnostic for patients with Alzheimer's disease who were also approved in the U.S.  Several positive Phase 3 readouts this quarter include Verzenio in adjuvant breast cancer, now the first and the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to succeed in this population. Mirikizumab and psoriasis compared to both placebo and head-to-head versus Cosentyx and just today in collaboration with Boehringer and Jardiance in heart failure patients with reduced injection fraction, both with and without diabetes. We also continue to make progress on our potential COVID-19 therapies. Notably, the initiation of multiple clinical trials developing neutralizing antibodies, both as monotherapy and in combination. Dan will provide you with more detail during the R&D update. The unprecedented pace at which we're executing this project across our development and manufacturing organizations is evidence of what we are capable as an innovative company.  As I mentioned earlier, our Q2 business results were negatively impacted by COVID-19; however, we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business. COVID-19 had a meaningful impact on economic activity and we observed the following trends in the U.S. A sharp decline in the number of patient visits to physicians dropping to roughly 50% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Reduce visits translated into fewer new prescriptions with the peak impact in late April and early May in most therapeutic classes.  A slow return to health care activity through a combination of Telehealth and in-person visit as IQVIA data showed patient visits were back to 85% of pre-COVID-19 levels in June, and new prescriptions slowly beginning to recover although some variation across therapeutic areas. While the outlook for economic activity is uncertain, we remain optimistic that patients, physicians and hospital systems will continue to find ways to ensure patients can access the medicines they need.  Turning to our Q2 results, as expected reduced patient visits and inventory dynamics were both a drag on otherwise solid total prescription trends. Revenue declined 2% compared to Q2, 2019 and we estimated revenue was negatively impacted by the reversal of largely all of the $250 million of stocking related to COVID-19 that we experienced in Q1. While most existing prescriptions were maintained, new patient prescriptions declined in Q2 relative to pre-COVID-19 baselines. We estimate this impact to have been about $250 million across the portfolio.  Taking into account current trends, we are on track to deliver the financial goals we established for 2020. The strength of our new products, our ability to scale them worldwide and our productivity agenda position us well to continue to deliver robust business performance and to create shareholder value.  Moving to slide five, you\u2019ll see the full list of key events since our last earnings call. Before, Josh discusses our financial results, just a few comments about the executive orders that were announced last Friday. We all share the goal of making medicines more affordable and accessible to patients and believe concepts such as rebate reform and the sharing of savings within the eligible 340B patient population offer real opportunities to lower the out-of-pocket costs for patients quickly.  However, as I've noted before, the concept of international price indexing is a bad policy. This policy will have almost no benefit to patient out-of-pocket costs, but together with reimportation we\u2019ll most assuredly have serious negative consequences for patients for the safety of our supply chain and for the future of innovation. So now is the wrong time to introduce sweeping government actions that will at best distract and at worse, cripple the same industry that's racing to discover vaccines and treatments to defeat COVID-19. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John to review our Q2 results in more detail and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020. Josh Smiley : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Moving to slide six and seven, our non-GAAP financial performance in 2Q and during the first half of 2020 was impacted by COVID-19 across many lines of the income statement. As Dave mentioned, revenue declined 2% this quarter compared to Q2, 2019. It was negatively impacted by COVID-19 in two ways. First; largely all of the $250 million of COVID related stock in Q1 reversed as excess supply in the channel and in medicine cabinets was consumed and Q2 closing inventory returned to historically normal levels.  Second, reduced patient visits due to COVID-19 resulted in lower new prescriptions across many of our brands, which we estimate had a negative impact on Q2 revenue of approximately $250 million as well. We estimate this impact to be a temporary step down in market size, which we expect will return to pre-COVID levels over the balance of the year, with the pace of recovery varying by therapeutic area.  Given the stocking and destocking seen between quarters, our first half performance of 7% sales growth in constant currency is a more accurate reflection of underlying performance. Gross margin as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 79.6%, a decline of 140 basis points versus Q2, 2019, driven primarily by the negative impact of price, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment. Moving down the P&L, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 9% this quarter compared to Q2, 2019, as reduced marketing and travel meeting expenses were only partially offset by investment in virtual tactics. Research and development expenses declined 1% as a pause in clinical trials have shifted activity and expenses to the second half of 2020.  In total, operating income decreased 2% compared to Q2, 2019. During the first half \u2013 sorry, I'm just having a technical issue here. We just had a system problem. So in total, operating income decreased 2% compared to Q2, 2019. During the first half of 2020 operating income increased by 14% as revenue growth outpaced operating expense growth by 500 basis points. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28% during the second quarter and 29.1% for the first half of 2020.  We continue to adapt the way we allocate resources to efficiently the operating environment, where the threat of COVID-19 is likely to be disruptive for a sustained period of time. We are expanding our virtual capabilities to support executing our strategy and are committed to our 2020 full year operating margin target of 31%. Other income and expense was income of $447 million this quarter compared to an expense of $32 million in Q2, 2019. This quarter\u2019s other income was primarily driven by the increase in value of investments in Asian biopharma companies, as well as previously private companies that went public here in the U.S.  We have investments across a range of private and public biopharma companies as a part of our external innovation strategy and these investments allow us to nurture emerging science and access potential new medicines and novel modalities. As we regularly highlight, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Our tax rate was 13.4%, an increase of 340 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven by the mix of our earnings in higher tax jurisdictions and a lower net discrete tax benefit than last year. At the bottom line earnings per share increased 26% in Q2 as a sizable gain on public equities more than offset the decline in operating income. During the first half of 2020, earnings per share increased 29%.  On slide eight we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue. Worldwide revenue declined 2% during Q2 as volume growth of 6% was offset by price. Foreign exchange had an additional 1% negative impact on revenue growth. During the first half of 2020 revenue grew 7% in constant currency and volume grew 13% and price declined 7% or 5% excluding the impact Alimta and Tyvyt had in China.  U.S. revenue decline 3% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 4% was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality and Verzenio. As mentioned earlier, we saw destocking at the wholesaler and patient level due to COVID-19 that contributed approximately $200 million of negative impact during the quarter. In addition, we estimate reduced new prescriptions due to COVID-19, negatively impacted Q2 revenue by approximately $150 million.  Pricing was an 8% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, impacted by predominately changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Humalog, which was driven primarily by favorable Medicaid adjustments in the prior period and unfavorable commercial adjustments in the current period. Then to a lesser extent by higher growth across the portfolio and lower net price segment, and increased rebate to maintain our strong commercial access, which was partially offset by reduced copay program utilization for Emgality and Taltz as a function of improved access versus last year. As we previously discussed, our quarterly pricing trends in the U.S. fluctuate based on delayed invoicing from customers, seasonality of copay assistant and our obligations during the coverage gap in Medicare Part D.  Excluding the impact of the onetime Humalog adjustment and focusing on trends that impact our business going forward, we saw an underlying pricing trend of low single digit decline in Q2 versus Q2, 2019 and this is consistent with our current expectation of mid-single digit price decline for the year, with the underlying low single digit net price decline, combined with one-time adjustments in the first half of 2020 and modest effects of COVID-19 in the second half of the year.  During the first half of 2020 U.S. revenue increased 5% versus last year, volume grew 11% and price declined 6%. We are encouraged by the improving demand trends in recent weeks and more normalized shipping trends. As we conclude 2021 U.S. Contracting negotiations, we remain confident in our strong commercial and Medicare Part D access across the portfolio and our ability to maintain this going forward.  Moving on Europe, revenue declined 4% in constant currency as price and volume declined by 2% each. Strong volume growth from Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz was offset by volume declines from Cialis, Forteo, Olumiant, Strattera and Humalog. We estimate European revenue was reduced by approximately $50 million due to COVID-19 related destocking in Q2, and roughly $35 million due to COVID-19 related lower new prescription. Despite fluctuation across quarters, the underlying trends are very strong as Europe posted volume growth of 11% during the first half of 2020 as our new products continue to scale.  In Japan revenue declined by less than 1% in constant currency and 4% volume growth was more than offset by government mandated price decreases effective April 2020. In addition, we estimated reduced new prescriptions due to COVID-19, negatively impacted Q2 revenue by approximately $35 million. The solid volume growth of Verzenio, Trulicity, Olumiant and Cyramza were the key contributors to growth, partially offset by the increased competition for Forteo and the impact of generic Strattera.  In China, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, driven by 50% volume growth, largely offset by price. Volume and price were both affected by the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs, which substantially increased access for patients to these important cancer medications.  Outside of the oncology portal in China we saw a rebound in new patient initiation and in person customer interaction as the pandemic's impact began to moderate. Our newest lunches, Trulicity, Taltz and Alimta are seeing good uptake in Humalog, Cymbalta are again exhibiting solid growth.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 7% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth drivers. Strong performance from Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio was partially offset by decreased Cialis volume. Revenue was negatively impacted by COVID related reduced new prescription, by approximately $25 million, which was more than offset by the sale of the legacy product in Asia.  As shown on slide nine, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered over 12 percentage points to volume growth this quarter. The strong volume growth, volume trend in our key products was partially offset by a mix of competition and lower utilization of post-LOE products; Forteo and Cialis, as well as reduced [inaudible] royalty from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim that we announced last year. We exit the first half of 2020, pleased with a 16% year-to-date volume growth of our key products that delivered despite a challenging environment. Slide 10 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total these brands generated nearly $3 billion of revenue this quarter making up 54% of revenue. While 12% volume growth from key products in Q2 is robust, the negative impact on new patient starts from COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 related inventory movement across borders were a drag on growth in the quarter. We put both of these impacts to be transient and we're seeing new-to-brand prescriptions recover in June and July. The underlying business is robust and while COVID-19 has impacted our therapeutic areas differently, our product specific trends within the market backdrop are strong. In diabetes, Trulicity remains the market leader in the U.S. GLP-1 market with over 45% share of total prescription. While new-to-brand prescriptions for the GLP-1 class were 32% less than pre-COVID-19 levels at one point during Q2, activity is trending in the right direction and now fits at around negative 16% for the week ending July 17. Total prescription trends have slowed some, but we're still robust to the class and grew by 27% in Q2 compared to last year. As the class leader, Trulicity is well positioned for future growth, and we look forward to regulatory action later this year on the higher doses of Trulicity. We expect the potential launch of additional doses to be an important option to allow patients to realize benefits, while extending the duration of therapy on Trulicity.  And another large impact, growing diabetes class Jardiance maintained market leadership in the U.S. SGLT2 class, with over 57% share of total prescription. The SGLT2 class saw a similar magnitude of reductions as the GLP-1 class for new-to-brand prescriptions, as new prescriptions where 38% less than the pre-COVID-19 levels before recovering some in June and July. Current weekly trends are probably 15% below pre-COVID-19 levels. Jardiance continues to be the catalyst for class growth in new and total prescriptions, growing over 12 percentage points faster than the market in Q2, with 32% growth versus last year. We're excited by the recently announced positive results of Jardiance in patients with heart failure and EMPEROR-Reduced trial and look forward to the EMPEROR-Preserved trail readout in 2021. We estimate the addressable market from each trial is up to $3 million additional patients in the U.S., adding a potential new source of future growth for Jardiance.  In oncology, Verzenio continues to show positive trends in the metastatic setting as U.S. share of the market in new-to-brand prescriptions continued to increase about 20%. While new-to-brand prescriptions for the CDK4/6 class were more than 30% below pre-COVID levels of 1 point in the quarter, Verzenio fared better at negative 19% and the most recent week of new-to-brand prescription is above the pre-COVID-19 average.  Verzenio had positive momentum as the monarchE trail result adds to the compelling existing data package. We look forward to presenting these data at a medical meeting later this year.  Tyvyt, our immuno-oncology product in collaboration with Innovent in China posted another strong quarter of performance and was the biggest driver of China's 50% volume growth in Q2. Tyvyt was added to the national drug reimbursement list in January this year and we anticipate strong sales momentum in the second half of 2020. We expect Tyvyt to continue to be an important driver of growth in China.  Our newest oncology medicine Retevmo had a strong launch despite the viewing during a challenging external environment. We are encouraged by early demand signals and initial customer feedback on the impressive safety and efficacy profile is very positive. Our sales force and medical science liaisons are actively engaging with 6,000 lung and thyroid specialists through virtual tactics, and our existing relationships with this customer base are leading to a high quality interactions and increased brand awareness for this first in class medicine. While still early in the launch, we are excited about the fast start and continue to believe we have the best-in-class products. In immunology we saw strong new-to-brand trends with Pulse early in Q1, followed by a sizable but more gradual impact of COVID-19. Compared to pre-COVID levels, new-to-brand prescriptions across immunology declined 36%. While this category has also been slower to recover, the most recent weeks have showed improvement in trend. However, new-to-brand prescriptions for the total market are still 21% below pre-COVID levels.  Taltz continues to compete for leadership in Dermatology new-to-brand share of market and rheumatology trends are encouraging, although growing from a smaller base. Total Taltz prescriptions grew 11% in Q2 compared to Q1 and 35% versus Q2 2019. We remain confident that our compelling data package of head-to-head trials and recent approval in non-radiographic axSpA will deliver growth in a competitive field of immunology.  In migraine we've also seen a more prolonged decline in new-to-brand prescriptions due to COVID-19. New-to-brand prescriptions in the injectable CGRP class have been 15% to 20% below pre-COVID levels since late April and through July. Emgality\u2019s share of market remains strong with over 38% of new and total prescriptions within the class. Although new-to-brand trends have been impacted by COVID-19, class growth for total prescriptions was robust in Q2, increasing 64% compared to last year and 12% versus Q1, 2020. Given the importance of primary care physicians in driving growth, with the return of active promotions from multiple competitors, we expect class growth to reaccelerate in the second half of 2020.  Also in migraine or acute therapy REYVOW is significantly impacted by the lack of patient visit and the in-person customer interactions related to COVID-19. While uptake so far has been modest early in the launch, we\u2019ll make investments to drive awareness and focus our promotional efforts in the coming quarters to drive uptake. While the field is competitive, we continue to believe our portfolio of both acute and preventative treatment with two mechanisms of action is a differentiator for our migraine franchise. On slide 11 we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first half of 2020 we invested over $4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned almost $2 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and the dividend.  We remain well capitalized and have the ability to access debt markets at attractive rates. We expect to continue to enhance our long term growth by acquiring first or best-in-class pipeline assets and do not anticipate COVID impacts regarding travel and market uncertainty to affect our efforts. Before we provide an update on our 2020 financial guidance, slide 12 provides an overview of the composition of our U.S. business led by payer segment mix. This is the topic of frequent interest to investors and is permanent [ph] as we monitor the currently high levels of unemployment and the potential for that to negatively impact our business. Based on growth sales during the first half of 2020, within our existing business, commercial plans make up the largest portion at around 40%. Medicare Part D is the second largest segment at approximately 20%, mainly due to our diabetes portfolio. Government and hospital segments make up roughly 15%, Medicaid is around 10%, Medicare Part D is nearly 5% and then non-contracted business uninsured and cash make up the remaining 10%.  So as we continue to monitor and analyze the potential impact of unemployment, causing people to lose their commercial insurance and potentially shift to Medicaid, our modeling suggests this will have a modest impact in 2020 and is contemplated in our financial guidance range.  We expect these trends to have a larger impact in 2021 and the magnitude will be driven by the size and duration of unemployment in the U.S., the quality of commercial or ACA Exchange Insurance plans, displace of employees move from, the majority of our products as newer products have smaller net pricing spread between Medicaid and commercial plan, and government stimulus or relief plans that may keep patients on commercial insurance.  While there is uncertainty on how all these factors will play out, at this time we anticipate increased utilization of Medicaid versus commercial insurance to be a moderate headwind to revenue in 2021 of approximately $200 million. This approximation contemplates peak U.S. unemployment in the low double digits in 2020, a gradual recovery in 2021, to high single digits percent unemployed by year end.  We do not have an estimate on the impact of the executive orders on 2021 at this point, but given the uncertainty around them and our modest exposure to Part B, we expect the near term impact to be limited. Given our view of 2021 pricing negotiations, we still expect mid-single digit price impact across the portfolio in 2021.  So now moving to slide 13, you'll find our updated 2020 financial guidance. This is based on the best estimates at this time and similar to how we approach Q1. We are balancing transparency and insight into the current view of the business, with the uncertainty we are all facing surrounding the extend and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key assumptions supporting our updated guidance include healthcare activity returns to normal levels in the second half of 2020 as doctors utilize Telehealth for in-person visits to see patients despite potential additional COVID-19 outbreaks.  The recovery in new patient prescriptions improved in the U.S. reaching and then growing above pre-COVID-19 levels by Q4 for most brands, noting the trends will differ regionally and by brand; price headwinds from increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased U.S. unemployment continue to be modest; clinical trial sites remain open and active in enrolling patients and promotional spend in the second half of the year constitutes a mix of in-person customer interactions, direct to consumer advertising and investment in supporting digital promotion. While uncertainty remains regarding the continued spread of COVID-19 and the resulting impact on the pace of economic recovery around the world, we believe healthcare activity will continue to be a priority and that patients and physicians will find ways to access healthcare.  We believe the stocking and destocking activity observed in Q1 and Q2 is largely washed out and we are encouraged by the demand trends and more normal shipping patterns we're seeing with our customers. As a result we're maintaining our revenue range, recognizing additional closures in the healthcare system could cause us to revisit that range later in the year.  Moving down the income statement, we are lowering our gross margin as a parent of revenue to be approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis. This reduction reflects changes in geographic mix and lower realized prices. We expect our GAAP gross margin to be 78%. We are also lowering our range from marketing, selling and administrative expenses by $200 million to reflect savings from reduced travel meetings and in-person promotional activities, which are all partially offset by investments in digital capabilities. Our range for research and development expenses is unchanged. We expect savings associated with temporary pausing of clinical trial starts and enrolment to catch up in the second half of 2020 as we resumed activity in Q2. Of note, we can see positive data in our neutralizing antibody treatments for COVID-19 that supports product development. We plan to fully invest in registration of clinical trial and further scaling of manufacturing capacity.  Under this scenario our research and development expenses are likely to be on the high end of our range as Lilly is self-funding all of these programs. We believe these investors are important to help combat the impact of the global pandemic.  Our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue goal of 31% remains as a reduction in total operating expenses offset through slightly lower gross margin percentage. We're updating the range for other income and expense the $350 million to $500 million of income, reflecting gains in our equity portfolio as seen in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this number is of course subject to volatility in the capital markets.  Now turning the taxes, we're reducing our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to approximately 14%, driven by the net discrete tax benefits we booked for the first half of the year. So earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $7.20 per share to $7.40 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.48 per share to $6.68 per share.  Q2 was certainly an atypical quarter. As I highlighted earlier, COVID impacted our financial results in a number of ways. However, our confidence in the strength of our underlying business and our demonstrated ability to overcome challenges gives us the conviction to reaffirm our robust outlook for sales growth and productivity.  So now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19, a summary of key data disclosures in Q2 and a pipeline update. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Josh. Since our last call we\u2019ve had major lifecycle readouts for three of our most important new medicines; Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. All three were positive, all represent clinically meaningful advances for patients and all should help drive continued growth for these important brands. I\u2019ll speak briefly about each, as well as the Phase 3 readout from mirikizumab, a molecule still under development.  In addition to advancing our existing R&D portfolio, we have devoted significant efforts to creating and testing potential therapies for COVID-19 and here too we have made good progress this quarter. Before I go through the pipeline update, I'll provide an update on our COVID-19 therapies.  Moving to slide 14, we provide an overview of the active programs we are pursuing to treat or prevent COVID-19. These programs have moved with unprecedented speed and hopes of finding new medicine to help blunt the impact of the virus.  Baricitinib our JAK inhibitor has two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The anti-inflammatory activity observed by baricitinib in other diseases is thought to be potentially beneficial in treating COVID-19.  The first trial is investigating baricitinib in combination with remdesivir as part of the NIAID\u2019s Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial and we expect to have data from this trial within the coming months. The second trial is Lilly sponsored and is assisting baricitinib as monotherapy. We expect results from this trial later this year.  Second, we are pursuing a Phase 2 trial of an antibody that targets Angiopoietin 2, which has been observed to be elevated in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. Based on trial enrolment we now expect to have data in-house this fall to inform next steps.  While these two efforts may inform treatment of symptoms of COVID-19, the approach I\u2019m most excited about is virus neutralizing antibodies for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, both a single antibody therapies and in combinations. We currently have efforts ongoing with LY-CoV555 which arose from our collaboration with AbCellera and with LY-CoV016 which we licensed from Junshi Biosciences. The development status is summarized on slide 15.  Both the antibodies have completed dosing in their Phase 1 studies with safety and PK results that support advancing the molecules. Neither Phase 1 study was designed to collect efficacy data, that is a 555 trail that only enrolled six patients per dose and O16 enrolled only healthy volunteers. 555 is further along in development and is progressed to a large dose ranging Phase 2 study in ambulatory patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Here we are focused on reducing viral load. The study is enrolling quickly, and we should have data to report by Q4. This will be our first opportunity to share human efficacy data from the neutralizing antibody program.  Based on safety and tolerability data gathered to-date, as well as taking into accounts the gravity of the unmet medical need here, we plan to initiate registrational studies in the coming weeks, even in advance of having efficacy data. We've been in studies across several different patient populations including a Phase 3 study for prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long term care facilities, as well as additional registrational studies for potential treatment indication in both the ambulatory and hospitalized settings. Once underway, the timing for data disclosure from these trials will be highly dependent on patient enrollment and any intern efficacy and safety data we may see. In addition to the monotherapy trials I describe for 555, we intend to test the combination of O16 with 555, in case such a combination is needed to combat viral resistance. We look forward to producing additional data for both programs and we\u2019ll provide updates as we achieve program milestones or data become available. We continue to invest in manufacturing for these potential therapies at risk and we are focused on ramping up our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible.  While developing treatments for COVID-19 is an important priority for Lilly right now, we also continue to advance the rest of our pipeline, to help people with diabetes, immune disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer.  One particularly exciting development this quarter was the positive interim readout of the MonarchE trial, assessing the use of Verzenio to reduce the risk of recurrence in (HR)-positive, HER2-negative high risk early breast cancer. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to show a benefit in this setting, where another competing product failed at our T-cell analysis.  Our conviction and the differentiation of Verzenio from the competition continues to increase based on important data, including safety and tolerability data and mechanism of action that have allowed for continuous dosing and therefore continues target inhibition. This is a unique feature of abemaciclib.  Clinical efficacy that support use even as a monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer, another unique feature of abemaciclib. The demonstrated benefited overall survival in the metastatic setting in combination with fulvestrant, something not all CDK4/6 inhibitors have been able to show and most recently, positive result in the adjuvant setting, another unique feature of abemaciclib. These data continue to support our convictions, but not all CDK4/6 inhibitors are the same. The positive results in MonarchE could significantly increase the opportunity for Verzenio. Looking at the MonarchE study clinical pathological criteria for enrolment, we estimate that approximately 20,000 patients in the U.S. would match these criteria. This represents a roughly 50% increase over the current addressable market in metastatic breast cancer. Our market projected to reach almost $7 billion in 2020. In addition we anticipate duration of therapy in the adjuvant setting will be longer. We plan to submit this data by the end of the year to regulators around the world and to present them at a major medical meeting in 2020.  Moving to slide 17, we also presented important Trulicity data at the virtual ADA and ENDO meetings this summer. In the on-treatment analysis the 3 milligram and 4.5 milligram doses of Trulicity demonstrated statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1C reduction and weight loss versus the currently approved 1.5 milligram dose at 36 weeks. These doses could allow our patients to receive additional clinical benefits and stay on Trulicity, but still experiencing Trulicity\u2019s ease of use. We look forward to U.S. any EU regulatory action on the additional doses of Trulicity later this year.  At the virtual ADA we also share data which builds upon the existing body of evidence demonstrating the simplicity of the Trulicity patient experience, combined with its powerful efficacy.  In this real world analysis of patients after a minimum of six months of follow-up in the U.S., Trulicity demonstrated significantly higher adherence and persistence compared to two other weekly GLP-1. In addition, significantly fewer people discontinued treatment on Trulicity compared to other agents. This real world evidence complements the robust clinical data generated for Trulicity and provides further support for why Trulicity is the market leading GLP-1.  Moving to slide 18, you can see our select pipeline opportunities as of July 23. Movements since our last earnings call includes the previously mentioned U.S. approvals for Lyumjev, Retevmo, and Tauvid. The U.S. approval of Taltz for non-radiographic axSpA and Cyramza for EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer, the initiation of the Phase 3 tirzepatide cardiovascular outcome study SURPASS-CVOT, the advancement of three new Phase 2 programs, the initiation of three Phase 1 programs and the attrition of our first generation KRAS G12C molecule.  While we were excited about our initial KRAS program, we observed unexpected toxicity in the clinic that precluded further development. We are working to understand the mechanistic basis for the toxicity and we are exploring a backup program.  Moving to slide 19, we provided an update on our 2020 key events that occurred during the quarter. In addition to the previously mentioned approvals, initiations and pipe in progress, we submitted Alimta [ph] in the U.S. for atopic dermatitis. As Dave mention earlier, we also announced positive phase 3 read outs for Jardiance in heart failure and mirikizumab in psoriasis. Beginning with Jardiance, we were optimistic about the likelihood of success in heart failure based on compelling CV data seen in diabetic patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We were pleased to see a positive outcome for the first heart failure trial to read out EMPERIAL-Reduced and will present the data in August at the European Society of Cardiology and submit to regulators later this year. We look forward to additional Jardiance data readouts, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the EMPERIAL-Preserved trial in 2021 and the chronic kidney disease, EMPA-KIDNEY study in 2022.  We also noticed a positive readout from mirikizumab phase 3 in psoriasis, including success on the primary and all key secondary endpoints. It's particularly encouraging to see such robust data from mirikizumab in a head-to-head trial, since trial of such disease are the gold standard for comparing agents.  Indeed, we had a number of positive head-to-head trials with Taltz in psoriasis and now we\u2019re pleased to see mirikizumab demonstrate superiority versus percentage at 52 weeks on both about passing 90 and passing 100.  Despite growing a competition is psoriasis, Taltz remains an excellent option for patients that delivers clear skin fast. These new data suggest that mirikizumab also has a consensual to be a meaningful treatment for people living with psoriasis. We look forward to submitting mirikizumab in this indication and importantly, these data further our conviction in IBD, where we see the biggest opportunity.  Given the relative priority of indications, we've been staging our investments in psoriasis. We work on going to prepare for the psoriasis submission and plan to submit in the second half of 2021. Accordingly, we've also provided an updated timeline for the phase 3 data of mirikizumab and ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. We now expect the topline results production for ulcerative colitis in the spring of 2021 and for Crohn's disease in 2022.  Since we announced the pause of new trial starts and enrollment in many programs back in March, I'm pleased to report that we\u2019ve re-opened enrollment in the vast majority of clinical trial and we are again initiating new trials.  As we partner with clinical trial sites going forward, we made a number of changes to how we run clinical trials that allow for many chances to be completed virtual. These two capabilities have come from necessity, but are also improvements on the way clinical research is conducted and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue going forward.  These are challenging times in drug development, but Lilly has demonstrated we have the creativity to adapt to the new environment and we're committed to bringing new medicines to patients. Dave, back to you for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks Dan. We\u2019re mobilizing our resources to pursue treatments of devastating diseases is a natural part of our history and our company's purpose, on a separate note I think all major employers are realizing we have a bigger role to play in the fight against systemic racial injustice and as a corporate leader in diversity inclusion, Lilly is committed to using our platform to speak up, speak out and work towards solutions to eliminate the racism and inequities that African-Americans and other minorities have experienced for far too long.  We are stepping up to bring people and organizations together to acknowledge the trauma of racial injustice, understand its many forms and create lasting change. To underscore our commitment to positive action, we also announced a pledge of $25 million and 25,000 employee volunteer hours over the next five years. The funding in volunteerism will be directed toward combating racial injustice and inequality primarily here in Indiana and we plan to partner with other businesses and community groups to achieve our goals.  While there\u2019s nothing easy about the road ahead, we can no longer accept systemic bias in any of its forms and the time for platitudes is now behind us. The time for meaningful actions, specifically by the corporate community to drive lasting change is in fact now, so a busy quarter.  Let me conclude with some closing comments on our progress in the first half of the year. As expected, our business experienced headwinds this quarter based on reduced new patient starts and changes in inventory we highlighted earlier this year. With that in mind, we are pleased that in the first half of 2020 we delivered strong volume driven revenue growth of 7% worldwide in constant currency.  We are cautiously optimistic about the recovery of both healthcare activity and prescription trends and expect both to accelerate during the second half of this year. We continue to find innovative ways to ensure our patients have access to their medicines and that we can support physicians and hospital systems as they provide care.  Our operating margin improved 200 basis points over the first half of 2019 and we made exciting progress on our pipeline this quarter. We saw three top line phase 3 data readouts from important clinical programs. We had five U.S. approvals for NMEs and line extensions and achieved a number of other clinical milestones that Dan just highlighted.  The COVID-19 global pandemic continues to be a disruptive force in the way we all work and live. Lilly and the broader pharmaceutical industry are working hard to develop new medicines to treat and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We anticipate this disruption will continue till vaccines and new medicines can be used to manage the spread of the infection. While near term challenges do exist, we remain confident in the long term outlook for our company and the strength of our fundamentals. Lilly and Lilly people will continue to rise to the challenge and I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to combat the global health crisis, social and economic crises we currently face.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin who\u2019ll moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Dave. We\u2019d like to take questions from many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Kevin, if you can please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now go to the first question and that will be from Seamus Fernandez, Guggenheim. One moment please sir. And sir, now your line is open. Seamus Fernandez : Yeah, can you hear me? Kevin Hern : Yes, yes. Seamus Fernandez : Okay, great, thanks. So just a couple of quick questions. You know first for Dan. Dan could you help us understand a little bit more about the timing of your CoV-2 antibody data you know and also just wanted to get a little bit of the scientific discussion around your choice of pursuing a single antibody.  I know that the AbCellera technology is unique, but just wanted to have a little bit more of a discussion around that. I think that would be helpful for investors as we think about the choice of the single antibody. I know you've talked about manufacturing as a driving choice there, but obviously the efficacy is paramount, so we just wanted to get a full understanding of that dynamic and that choice and how you hoped the study is going to read out. And then you know secondly, just as we think about the margin dynamics in the second half of the year, Josh I was just hoping that you could help us better understand the directional trajectory you know of how you're expecting the margins to shape up in the second half. How much of that is driven by meaningful revenue acceleration versus you know just an ability to kind of manage the expense line. Thanks. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Seamus. Dan and then Josh. A - Dan Skovronsky : Great! Thanks Seamus for those questions about the COVID-19 antibodies. Maybe just starting with timing, you know of course the timing of data disclosures depends on how best trials enroll and what the data show. We're committed to getting important information out to the public and the scientific communities as quickly as it's available. With respect to the phase 2 trial, that is focused on viral load, I think this is going to be the first and probably a key indicator of potential efficacy for this approach, and I commented that we expect to have that data to disclose from this 400 patient phase 2 trial in Q4, but again, that just depends on how best we can enroll these patients.  Your second question there was around the rational for a single antibody versus two or three or cocktails of even more antibiotics have been proposed, and specifically you have to look around efficacy. So I think we and others have looked at monotherapy versus combination therapy in a variety of preclinical models for the disease and looking at neutralization of the virus infection of human cells for example. And what you\u2019ll find is that combinations don't offer efficacy groups. A single antibody can generally neutralize the virus just as well as combinations of antibody. The reason that people sometimes try combinations of antibodies, because they're worried that over time resistance could emerge. So I don't expect to see any efficacy booster, efficacy denumeration for having a combo or monotherapy in clinical trials.  What we\u2019ll be looking for instead is whether or not there's an emergence of resistance. There are some factors that make that somewhat less likely here. I think the extremely high potency of 555 and its ability to effectively neutralize virus very, very quickly may decrease the risk of resistance. We've done some primary studies and we've not seen resistance emerge in those studies at all. But we'll be watching patients carefully and we have the combination therapy that will move forward as a backup if resistance is seen. The advantages of monotherapy are obvious and you commented on them. It\u2019s simply that if you have one antibody, you can manufacture twice as much as a combo of two antibodies, three times as much as three antibodies. In a situation like this, I think they are just starting a tradeoff that might indicate maximizing manufacturing capacity is the key objective and so that's where we're heading here. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thank Dan. Josh? Josh Smiley : Thanks Seamus. So if we look at our guidance for the year and think about the margin progression in the second half of the year, just a reminder, you know sales on a constant currency basis grew 7% in the first half and our operating income percentage was a little bit over 29%. So to get to the 31% target we have for 2020, we\u2019re obviously going to see margin expansion in the second half of the year, but I think it's pretty straightforward.  When we look at the sales range that we have, you know picking midpoints or wherever you want to pick, we\u2019re looking really at something close to 7% or 8% growth in the second half of the year. So while we expect an acceleration in sort of absolute sales on a half to half basis, it\u2019s not that much of a stretch from where we are. We think a little bit of a pick-up probably in gross margin in basis points and that's just a function of more normalized geographic impact. As you know we saw more of an impact in the U.S. in the first half of the year than outside the U.S. We expect those things to normalize a little bit in the second half of the year and we\u2019re not anticipating any one-time pricing impact either up or down, so we see a little bit of a benefit there. But the big piece will come on the OpEx side. I mean it's not from additional sort of cost saving moves, you know our guidance range we provide for getting and picking wherever you want to pick in that range, a couple $100 million or so increased investment in absolute dollars in combination of SG&A and R&D in the second half of the year. So it's really just the absolute sales benefit that we'll see in the second half against a lower absolute increase, but still an increase in OpEx. That gets us to something over 31% in the second half of the year. Put that together and that puts us at 31, because most of these things are certainly in our control.  As I mentioned earlier, and as Dan\u2019s talked about on COVID, we're going to invest fully you know behind those opportunities that is contemplated in our guidance range and to the extent we\u2019re higher on OpEx, you know at the higher end of the range, it\u2019s going to be the \u2013 primarily be because of you know seeing good data and continue to move fast there, but we\u2019re confident in the margin expansion opportunity into the second half of the year for the reasons I just mentioned. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Kevin, next caller please. Operator : And that will be from the line of Geoff Meacham, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Questions, I just had a few. On Verzenio I know we have yet to see data details, but can you speak to the real world duration of therapy today in metastatic and then what you would expect from the monarchE setting.  And then a quick drug pricing question for Dave. I know obviously you spent a lot of time on these issues, but you know what are the hurdles to getting IPI implemented and when you look across the Lily portfolio, can you speak to the category that may be more impacted from the executive order, other IPI rebates, etc. Thank you. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Geoff. We\u2019ll go Anne for the question on Verzenio and then Dave on IPI. Anne White : Well Geoff, thanks for the question on Verzenio and the duration question is an important one and something that we're really excited about as part of the additional opportunity in EBC, and so we do expect the duration of treatment to be longer than the metastatic setting. And to your question, what we've seen in the RWE in the metastatic setting is about eight months.  Now we\u2019ll need to see what that actually is once the patients are being treated upon approval in the adjuvant setting, but obviously we're encouraged. The fact is the treatment duration in the study itself was 24 months. So we do expect it to be much longer than the eight months that we see in the metastatic setting. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Dave? Dave Ricks : Yeah, thanks Geoff. Well, I mean you know we all observed last Friday's announcements. I think mostly these are not perceiving new ideas, so my statement\u2019s maybe a repeat from prior calls. But on IPI specifically, you know this is being proposed under the CMMI model, Affordable Care Act, so that by itself is probably a problem. It just seems to regulate the entirety of the U.S. position infused market via that mechanism, and you know you expect the industry to vigorously challenge that authority here as to create new authority.  But if implemented, and we have yet to see the tax by the way. I'm not sure the White House has put that out yet, but let's assume it's something like the 2018, a blueprint proposal. We are relatively under exposed to this idea, because it affects part B physician infused drugs. Today you know the two material medicines fit that in our portfolio, Alimta and Cyramza. Of course Alimta, we expect a patent expiry in spring of \u201922, so you have a time window impact that\u2019s quite short. And Cyramza, which is obviously longer and a meaningful product, but a part of our growth story but not a cornerstone of it. Going forward, of course if we looked at future medicines in the pipeline, there are you know infused medicines in immunology and notably in Alzheimer's should those succeed that you know you'd be concerned about. But I think drug companies have more ability to navigate on future products than they do one past \u2013 products launches in the past, because you can affect your primarily European pricing outlook, perhaps with constrained demand in Europe, but focused on a common floor price for the U.S., so you know we can navigate it.  That said, it's a horrible policy and I think we'll \u2013 it sends a wrong message at a time when this industry is working literally day and night to help us all escape from COVID-19. Do we really want to be talking about this disruptive force and the most well capitalized companies that are least affected, biotech which you know we're not part of that small company group, but they will be severely affected and investor interest in many of their companies could drop precipitously. I think that would be a real loss for what is an industry that's basically U.S. based. So we'll fight it hard and hopefully it won\u2019t come to be.  On rebate, again this is an idea we've pursued before for some time, as well as frankly you know we're not disappointed by the 340B pass through idea that was presented as well. We think that the patients who drive the volume, that plans negotiate discounts on should benefit from those discounts.  Frankly as they do in every other part of the healthcare system except medicines, so that we think cost sharing and copay should be based on net price not list and these ideas for that. Again, lots of barriers to implementation on those as well, as your other groups who oppose them, but we\u2019ll continue to support that concept of sharing the savings. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. Geoff, thanks for your questions and next caller please? Operator : Tim Anderson, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : I have a commercial question on CDK 4/6 class. So Pfizer\u2019s hyperensive market leader, but it is the only CDK 4/6 that failed to show survival benefit informal phase 3 trials in metastatic, of course the fail in adjuvant. Did Lilly think that the metastatic share Brent [ph] has is materially at risk. The competitors like Verzenio where realistically the stickiness to the segment either said that its real world studies that show an OS benefit well protected, but wondering what your view is? So it\u2019s really a question on the metastatic segment. But then on to Tirzepatide, how would you characterize your level of confidence that the first upcoming phase 3 results, were going to be data that really wows investors, like the phase 2 trial results did. Its notable that the analysts already carry about a $5 billion estimate for Tirzepatide in a consensus model. Kevin Hern : Thanks Tim. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on the CDK 4/6 class and then Mike Mason for the question on Tirzepatide. Anne White : Well, thanks for the question Tim on Verzenio and we believe we've seen really positive trends will Verzenio in the metastatic setting and I think josh mentioned those in some of the intro, and we\u2019ve really capitalized on the positive overall survival data from one or two in the combination with that strength. And so we\u2019ve seen versus Q2 2019 is worldwide growth of 56% in revenue and U.S. growth is 35%.  And then if we looked globally, we now had 49 approvals worldwide and I think probably an important metric is the Japan NBRx share of the market now, it's 58%. So we\u2019re seeing a very strong launch in Japan, and so we believe obviously that with specifically significant survival data, that's really the gold standard in this class and so we believe that more and more physicians will be trying Verzenio and we\u2019ve seen that in the continued increase in the NBRx and so we'll continue to share that message.  We believe that this is the best-in-class agent and I think it just goes to that whole picture of the differentiation that we see with Verzenio over time and I just think that that will shift physicians\u2019 minds.  Mark has the results from monarchE as Dan mentioned, really do differentiate it from both CDK 4/6 and then we've got the statistically significant results, not just in the overall population, but then in the hard to treat population, those with visceral disease and primary endocrine resistant. And again, you didn't see that with some of the other CDK 4/6\u2019s.  So I think we\u2019re starting to feel pretty strongly and I think physicians are starting to agree with us that we have a differentiated agent here, and so you\u2019ll continue to see us press in the metastatic setting, because we have that survival data, and now we get to make the move into the other trend setting. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Mike? Mike Mason : Okay, for tirzepatide we\u2019re glad to see that your wowed by our phase 2 data and for patients struggling with type 2 diabetes. You know I think the best thing to really do is to go back and take a look at the phase 2 clinical studies. I mean we saw at the 50 milligram dose up to 2.4% A1C reduction and weight loss up to 12.7% versus placebo in just six months of starting. So we're excited to see how tirzepatide can perform in this patient population and longer studies in phase 3. There's nothing to tell us that we won't see you know exciting data coming out of the phase 3, we don't have any new information that suggests otherwise, so we are incredibly confident about tirzepatide, not only in type 2 diabetes, but also we're excited to see its potential in Nash [ph] and obesity. So our enthusiasm remains very, very high. Thank you for the question. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Mike. Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : And that\u2019s Umer Raffat, Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Thanks so much for taking my question. Dan, I'm just trying to reconcile the positive commentary around your COVID map heading to registrational trials. First is perhaps lack of any data, efficacy data visibility for phase 1 and if you could possibly speak to any trend that you've seen already, that'll be really helpful. And then on KRAS, I might have missed it, but if you could just add some more color on whether you ran into a therapeutic index challenge before efficacy kicked in and if you could speak to what's the highest dose you actually dosed patients with on your KRAS, because it seems like other KRAS users didn't really have any efficacy until a very high dose and all of it kicked in at a certain dose, so it will be really helpful. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Umer. Dan, you\u2019ll take both of those? Dan Skovronsky : Yeah, sure. Umer, thanks for both those questions. So on the COVID map, you should be asking about the rational going into registrational studies without having seen efficacy data; its not something we usually do. You're right, of course here it\u2019s \u2013 as I said the gravity of the situation and then look at it with which we desire to test these therapies, that have driven us to that decision. You asked about sort of trends that might have encouraged us from the phase 1 study and unfortunately the answer is we don't have anything to talk about. We had one phase 1 study that was with healthy volunteers, so that they didn't have COVID-19, nothing was due there. The other was so small and in the hospitalized patients six patients per dose group and I think what we saw there is basically what you would expect across doses and placebo.  All of the patients actually did really well and got better and left the hospital. That's not atypical for a phase 1 study here that populations of physicians typically pulled into those studies are some of the better patients who might be at the end of their disease course. I wouldn't expect antibodies in any case to have much effect in people whose viral load is already low and their immune system is already clearing the disease, so that's where we are.  I think the phase 2 study on the other hand is patients who are early in the disease course. They are just within a few days of getting diagnosed. My expectations go up high and in many cases the increasing viral loads in the absence of therapy and it goes here to show that the therapy decreases the viral loads. So that's important read out, but as I said, we\u2019ll have started the phase 3\u2019s by then. On KRAS, this is an issue of off target toxicity, so it's not related to it. The KRAS target itself is our view, that does therefore killed the therapeutic index and not possible to proceed with that drug. I don't think we at this moment could give details on the exact nature of the toxicity or the highest dose that we tested, but we did feel we could proceed based on the doses at which we saw that tox and we're trying to resolve that in the backup program, make some preclinical models for the toxicity and take care of it now. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Umar, thanks for your questions. Next caller please? Operator : Andrew Baum of Citi, please go ahead. Mr. Baum, your line is open now. Andrew Baum : Hello! Can you hear me? Kevin Hern : Yes. Andrew Baum : A question on U.S. drug price reform. There are a number of life oppositions. Obviously the effect of order referencing paper form, which obviously Lilly has supported, but it requires a positive CEO score in order to move forward.  The first question is, do you think there's any possibility that could be achieved given the history of the CEO score the belief required of an overall reduction in pricing through market based competitions to get there and the CEOs reflect that, so that's number one. And number two, an alternate proposition has got bipartisan support in the Senate, but is stopping from reaching the Senate floor by O\u2019Connell. I know you have some concerns over that bill, but as a potential way forward to mitigate a more deleterious solution on either of the potential options going forward. Can you see this progressing? Many thanks. A - Kevin Hern : Thanks Andrew. We\u2019ll go to Dave for both of those. Dave Ricks : Yeah, thanks Andrew. On the EOs you\u2019re talking about read every form and the pass through and the history here is as you pointed out, the CEO score was extremely negative. In our math largely driven by the one assumption you noted, which is that rebate value which essentially grew back to manufacturers and thus raised premiums. It's a deeply flawed assumption. Of course we\u2019ll compete, but the whole idea would be to move the basis competition from sort of discriminated prices that are private to list price or other means to deliver pricing directly to consumers discounts that pass through for instance.  So that of course requires industry actors to change their practices and that's not something that can be coordinated or messaged very well due to the antitrust laws. So we're sort of in this catch 22 on committing to deliver on sharing the savings, but not being able to do that publicly.  I think that's a problem. I mean it\u2019s particularly a problem for legislation. Of course the executive order method has other problems in terms of legal power, but if enacted under administrative rules, you know there isn't necessarily a requirement to square the budget, so savings can be assumed in other ways and there's a different authority doing the math. That said, I think there are headwinds on this point, both within the administrative executive branch, as well as on the hill. Nonetheless it's the right thing to do and I think we need to continue to push for ways that everyone would have confidence that the industry would compete in a way that would lower consumer out-of-pocket costs. I can tell you that's the goal when we advocate for this policy, and we need to find ways to provide that assurance I think to get movement. You talked about Senate finance and Grassley reintroduced a version of his bill to try to make one last push. I believe his chairmanship is ending in any case at the end of this Congress, so it's understandable why he's doing that. I don't think that that package has much of a chance to advance. There are always ways stars get align and there\u2019s a number of health extenders do at the end of this Congress, but it's a pretty big piece of legislation to throw on an extenders package. The only possible way is that it does produce a positive budget impact in terms of use to pay for other things, but probably you don\u2019t need the whole package. So I think that's still a narrow path and the most likely scenario is that these EOs can't take the force and don\u2019t take force prior to a new presidential term, a new congression, Congress sitting and the Senate finance doesn't go anywhere either nor does HR3. I think that's sort of a probable planning scenario. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. Andrew thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : That will be from the line of Louise Chen of Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is, is there any way to quantify the operating margins, what we would have seen in the first half \u201820 without R&D COVID spending and also headwinds of sales from the pandemic? And the second question I had was, how do you think about tirzepatide as a single solution for diabetes, NASH and obesity. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Louise. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and then Mike for the second one. Josh Smiley : Thanks Louise. I think in the first half as I mentioned, our operating margin was 29.1%. I think if you add back some of the lost prescriptions, but then also keep in mind we had some savings associated with promotions, you know we\u2019re probably closer to 30%. We said as we came into the year, we expected margin expansion through the year. So that\u2019s still on track, but yeah we\u2019re probably off by somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points or something there. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh. Mike? Mike Mason : It\u2019s a great question on tirzepatide and I think we have a, just a phenomenal opportunity to not just be able to provide glucose control for those living with Type 2 Diabetes, but really affect their overall metabolic health. And so I think the contributions of both GLP and GIP can provide the opportunity to really provide improved metabolic health across Type 2 Diabetes, obesity and NASH that are related. And so it's a great question and I think it's a good opportunity for us to expand our focus beyond just helping someone living with Type 2 diabetes, better control their glucose. So a great question and obviously an area that that we will focus on. There will be people living with Type 2 diabetes that are in our NASH and obesity studies. Dave Ricks : Maybe just add to that, it goes maybe without saying, to help say it, the current utilization of GLPs in the total diabetes population in developed markets is something like one in eight or one it 10 patients. And so the hope here is that we can rearrange the priorities and the sequence of treatment in a way where this powerful category in here are duel acting GLP, GIP could be used earlier and more broadly to manage disease outcomes in a very different way. Today Type 2 diabetes disease is a failure and perhaps this technology could help doctors and patients find success much earlier in the disease course. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike, Davis. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Great! Thanks for taking the questions. Was wondering on another one of Verzenio, if the MonarchE date is going to be an ESMO or Antonio Breast, and if you think penetration in the adjuvant setting will be higher, lower or the same as in the metastatic setting over time.  And then Josh, just on contract when you talked about how those discussions are wrapping up now. Anything notable in terms of Trulicity or Taltz that we should consider as we think about those contracts for 2021. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Terence, we\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on MonarchE and then Josh around the contracting. Anne White : Yeah, so thanks for the question Terence. So on the presentation we will be presenting at a medical meeting later this year. Unfortunately I can't confirm which one yet, but we will be presenting at the meeting this year. As far as on the penetration, well that\u2019s I think what\u2019s exciting about this opportunity, is that we are the only CDK 4/6 to have positive results in the adjuvant setting. And so I think our penetration for the high risk patients, which is the population that we had in MonarchE will be extremely high.  So as we\u2019re hearing people ramp even to the top line opportunity, we're seeing that there's a lot of enthusiasm for having CDK 4/6 this setting, and so we look forward to sharing those results as I said later this year. Again, we see I think Dan and others mentioned in the introduction, we see this as an opportunity of only about 20,000 patients here in the U.S., as we matched our criteria in the study to the Sierra database.  So I think we see a pretty significant opportunity. It's really probably half again of what we have in the metastatic setting, which has been significant. So to answer your question, we do expect strong penetration in this space over time. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Josh? Josh Smiley : As you know Terence, we won't sort of talk specifically about individual contracts or anything at this point. But I think from what we have seen, first to go back to the earlier comments, we see a pretty similar pricing environment in 2021 to what we're seeing here, which would be modest net price decline, meeting we are providing slightly more rebates than what we're anticipating in terms of list price increases and then we couple that with the other dynamic factors that we mentioned. I think if you think about Trulicity, we've said sort of you know expect something plus or minutes 5% net price declined over time. I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re viewing next year. It\u2019s a very competitive environment of course that we are focused on maintaining access, not looking to trade price per share or anything like that. So I think those negotiations are going as expected.  With Taltz, we\u2019ve been focus on upgrading our access and so to the extent that were able to do that, you'll see that as a net price decline potentially but compensated for by increased access. Again I think we're happy with the progress we're making this year and continue to focus on improving where we can for next year. But overall, again I\u2019d say the general trend is we have fierce competition in the classes we\u2019re in, but we're focused on maintaining at least the access we have today and you know when we have the chance upgrading in areas like immunology. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh. Terence thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Next will be Chris Schott, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great! Thanks so much for the questions. Just maybe first on Verzenio, you highlighted 20,000 patients potentially in the US. Maybe just give us similar metrics about how you're thinking about the size of the eligible population in developed ex-U.S. markets?  And then second question, very helpful color in terms of kind of a mix of unemployment headwinds for 2021. Any updates in terms of how you're thinking about potential international price pressures from some of the budget deficits we are seeing globally? Is that a \u201821 headwind to think about as well or is that going to take a little bit longer to manifest itself? Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks Chris. We\u2019ll got to Anne for Verzenio and then to Dave on the international question. Anne White : Great! So thanks so much for that question on the Verzenio eligible population. So as I said in the U.S. about 20,000 eligible patients, which is about 10% to 15% of the HR positive, HER2- EBC positive. Outside the U.S. the pathology is similar and we estimated. So we estimated patient numbers in Europe about 10% larger than the U.S. and then Japan is about one-fourth of the side of the U.S. So I hope that answers the estimate questions outside the U.S. Dave Ricks : Great! And on international pricing, I think we\u2019ve talked about this before, but we don't have that many proxies for this kind of situation, but what we do know is economic activity, particularly in Europe and Japan has fallen like in the U.S. Tax receipts accordingly and if we use 2008 as a proxy, really took almost three years for the policy implications of that to show up in drug pricing health budgets. I think that\u2019s natural because there's a lag in tax receipts and then there's a lag in policy making in response to it. I would expect that to happen, and the normal things that occur are clawback mechanisms and methods to keep the medicines budget within some proportion of the health budget. I think that will be a headwind the industrial will face over the next two or three years.  I would say though that, if history follows, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, because Europeans in particular were successful at capping drugs, spending growth in the early part of the last decade. The burden of that tends to follow \u2013 fall disproportionately on older products that are scaled and perhaps with more competition in the categories, whereas as newer products I think actually weren\u2019t really affected. They are more driven by helping technology assessment and the procedures to get an initial price and they don't really drive much budget pressure versus end of life. As you know, we continually advocate for more biosimilar and generic adoption in these markets is the first lever to pull and so I think also for products they are supposed to buy similar in generics you probably would see more pressure on the back end of this as well. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Crist, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : The next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Thank you and thanks for taking the question, so a couple if I can. So one, just on the margin discussion and specifically on SG&A, I was wondering if you have any comments you can share just in terms of your more virtual promotional efforts here the past few months, and a sense of how productive they\u2019ve been and we\u2019re just trying to get a sense as you think about going forward, is your spending in SG&A going to be less than what you are thinking before you go to more of a hybrid model, what you expect within a year or so, your SG&A spending would be essentially; would have been before the pandemic?  And then the second one is just maybe more on the business development side, just given some of the volatility you are seeing, [inaudible] COVID and also drug pricing. Do you have change as to how you\u2019re thinking about potential licensing or acquisitions in terms of size and also curious in terms of therapeutic areas, are there any sort of areas where you feel like more need or desire or capacity to bring in additional assets. Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks Vamil. We\u2019ll go to Dave for your first question, and then Josh for the second on BD. Dave Ricks : Yeah Vamil, for some now we've been on a journey to build out the capabilities to reach customers where they want to be reached and have relevant information at that time, as well as around launches and key data readouts to be able to expand our capacity beyond just the sales channel to reach customers.  That has proven pretty useful through this pandemic and I would say overall the conditions which as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are variable around the world in terms of being able to safely send reps in the field and actually even be able to be let into medical buildings and facilities. I think there's a constraint there. So we\u2019ve leaned into this, we've accelerated some of the plans we had to increase volume and the richness of this capability.  Overall, I think the results are \u2013 I think we prefer to run the hybrid model everywhere where we have sales reps and these capabilities, where we can't send sales reps these capabilities have been useful. Is it as productive? I think it's certainly more efficient and it's more scalable. Whether it's as impactful, I think we\u2019ll need to watch through time. We have different markets we serve and I can say that in specialty markets where you get a smaller number physicians and you can target your efforts extremely well. We mention Retevmo launch on this call, which is a kind of a first thing for us was an approval and launch during the pandemic. I think we are pretty pleased with the progress there.  On the other hand, primary care brands, you know it's a little more challenging, because the way these practices are run and the variability and physicians accessibility. So I think the whole industry is probably learning this, but on the other side of this we\u2019ll have a much more enhanced capability and you can bet we are spending huge amounts of time on a global basis lifting that up now in a way that's a pretty rigorous. So you know more to come there. Productivity to be seen, efficiency yes, effectiveness, you know we probably see a lot of variability right now. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave, Josh? Josh Smiley : Yes, so on business development our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to focus on acquiring potential first-in-class or best-in-class projects or products in our therapeutic areas. There's a high bar there and we've had great progress in our internal pipeline, but we remain committed to finding those kind of opportunities. We have \u2013 you know we are generating very strong cash flow. We got good investment grade ratings and good liquidity, good access to capital markets. So even with all the disruption related to COVID, I don't see any change for us and then our ability to interact with you know smaller companies or access potential projects hadn't changed. That\u2019s not impacted by COVID. So it's really just a function of finding the right opportunities and ensuring that we can structure the deal in ways that create value for both sides and will continue to focus on that. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Next is Carter Gould of Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Hi! Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two for Dan. First, on the baricitinib studies in COVID, can you maybe just sort of frame sort how are you thinking about the study, your level of confidence in light of some of the other agents repurposed from RA that had failed, albeit a 3 month JAK inhibition. And then as far as on the N3pG antibody side, are sort of timelines still in intact? Should we still expect the data readout early next year and any commentary on how you're thinking about the hurdle? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Carter. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yeah sure, thanks. On baricitinib, of course we're encouraged and the reason we did this trials is based on preclinical data around the mechanism of action of baricitinib and I think the clinical effects of the immune-modulating in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has been next as you pointed out, but the [inaudible] have also been some promising efficacy signals and even success, so of course with dexamethasone.  So I think we just have to wait and see how this works. Treating patients in a hospitalized setting is important. If we can reduce like the stay or decrease mortality, that will be an exciting result and maybe a stopgap measure until we have the medicines that actually can fight off the virus. So like I hope the neutralizing antibodies will.  As for N3pG, yeah, we are still on the same timeline as we've always been. The trial will wrap up at the very end of this year, which means we'll have data internally and likely some kind of top line, just in the very start of next year. I think given that the size of the study, we have a reasonably high furlough rate and we are hoping to see a large effect size. We base that belief on the level of plaque clearingwe can get.We can get deeper and faster plaque clearance than has been shown with any other agent. So if clearing plaque is important stopping disease progression, we should have a strong effect.  It's noteworthy that we also designed this trial to select a very careful patient population based on the entire levels at baseline, so we also expect smaller standard deviation, because the population should have a more uniform progression. I\u2019d also note that we started the second trial N3pG already. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Carter, thanks for the questions. Next caller please. Operator : Next, Steve Scala of Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. When we see the data from monarchE, can you reassure us that the disease free survival improvement won't be an underwhelming 1% to 2%. Really seems excited about the data, so I would assume it's going to be stronger than 1% to 2%, maybe 3%, 4%, 5%. And then secondly, Roche announced last week that it will have data from a large Phase 2 trial of a TAURIEL antibody very soon. Should the Roche study fail, can you highlight any differences between the Lilly and Roche molecules and/or the study design that could sustain optimism for the Lilly program or if the Roche molecules sales should reassume that the Lilly molecule likely will follow a similar fate? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks Steve. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on monarchE and then Dan for the question on TAURIEL. Anne White : Well Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously we just shared the top line at this time, so I can't go into detailed data as you know, part of the data disclosure. But what I can tell you is that we do believe that the possible results from monarchE are clinically meaningful and will add to the existing body of evidence that\u2019s presenting, differentiated from other CDK 4/6s, and this is a major milestone for presenting you know and we believe does have the potential to change the paradigm of how early breast cancer is treated. So we really look forward to sharing the data with you at a meeting later this year. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yeah, thanks and with respect to TAURIEL antibody, again here, I just say we\u2019re still on track for the data readout. This will come in the second half of the next year. I'm excited about this mechanism, but we don't have clinical data yet. The Roche readout will be important and we\u2019ll be watching it carefully and of course on behalf of patients and the mechanism we\u2019ll be hoping for their success. But there are some differences as you pointed out, both in molecule and trial design that make read through more complicated. One I think important aspect of molecule design is that there's lots of different species of tau in the brain. There\u2019s a lot of soluble Tau that is monomeric and probably not involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease that can sop up antibody and sort of reduce the effective amount of antibody available to get the bad kinds of tau.  Our antibodies are designed specifically to bind the aggregated tau. So we think that should improve its ability to actually hit the target. Very high doses of these antibodies are generally used to overcome this soluble monomeric tau problem. So that's one difference between that Roche antibody and in fact all of the competitors and ours.  The second difference is there are on trial design and here again, we use our unique expertise in tau imaging and biomarkers to select a patient population that we think (a) will be more uniformity in its disease progression [inaudible] better and (b) be more likely to be responsive to Tau therapeutic. It\u2019s like these therapies will be effective \u2013 they are effective at stopping the spread of tau rather than removing pre-formed Tau and so I think it's important to have patients who are in the midst of the spreading tau, not patients that tau has spread throughout the entire brain. So we'll watch them carefully, but they'll be cautious on read through. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Navin Jacob, UBS. Please go ahead. Navin Jacob : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on some launch products. We talked about some baricitinib. Just wondering how that launch is going. What is the diagnosis rate for RET right now and where do you see that will reach over the next one to two years. And then, just time lines for Retevmo in ex-U.S. markets. And then separately with regards to your migraine franchise, just want to get some color how you view the CGRP market growing from here going forward, as well as tied to that Lyumjev, I know it\u2019s still early in the launch, but the launch does seem to be a little bit slower than some of the competitors out there. Just wondering what the dynamics that you're seeing in understanding that COVID-19 is also making things a little bit challenging in the neurology setting. Thank you so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks Navin. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question of Retevmo then Patrick on migraine. Anne White : Well, thanks Navin for the questions on Retevmo. So the launch is going well as Dave mentioned in his introduction and so we're encouraged by the early demand signals that we've seen with Retevmo, and his customer feedback on the data has been very positive. So they're impressed by the efficacy and safety data across multiple indications and lines of therapy that we're able to get into the label, and it\u2019s the largest obviously RET inhibition population that's been studied in 700 patients. We don't have Rx data to report yet, but we're aware of patient starts in a number of our top accounts, which is supported by the downstream channel orders. So it's clear that our first to market advantage is resulting in the treatment of patients who have identified even in previous testing. So that kind of leads to your question around diagnostic testing.  So what we've seen historically is that RET is showing up on panels probably about 30% of the time. So you\u2019ve hit on one of the key criteria\u2019s of the launch is to continue to drive that testing right up and so it's been very much a focus of our efforts, both to work with the pathologist out in the U.S. on making sure that they have RET on their panels now. We have a very actionable biomarkers for them to test against.  Our goal is essentially to eventually see testing rates like we see in some of the other targeted therapies, which approach 80%. Now the question that we\u2019ll all have to assess is how quickly we can get there, but our goal is to drive that up as quickly as we possibly can, and so that's a big focus of the launch.  And we have a partnership with Thermo Fisher and Illumina and other things in the works to really drive that up across the industry. Because we do believe that that's actually the best care for patients regardless they were treated with Retevmo or other targeted therapies that we want patients to get the right therapy for them.  As far as the time lines, so as you know we've submitted in Europe and so we are waiting regulatory action there. That submission was accepted at the beginning of this year, and then we looked to submit in Japan and China either late this year or early next, so still working with regulatory authorities there. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Patrick. Patrick Jonsson : Hey, thank you very much. Well the overall CGRP market continues to grow very nicely and when we look at from the market growth, year-over-year, we are about the growth of 64%, plus this last year.  While in Emgality he actually continues to significantly out-perform the market with growth of 151%. And even if you look at the last quarter, we see that CGRP market continued to grow with 12% despite the significant decline in terms of new-to-brand. And we continue to remain very confident in the future of Emgality and aiming for a market leadership in the preventive market and we see also strong market leadership, I think that in primary care where we have expanded our effort in 2020 and with quite a few new trail. So very, very optimistic in terms of the CGRP market for Emgality.  If we look from the Retevmo launch, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are not pleased with the performance so far, but we need to have in mind that we had approximately one month in the market place prior to we were hit by COVID-19 and we made the conscious decision to actually pull back from our promotional efforts, both in the field, as well as in terms of seasoning promotional growth.  We have started to start-up virtual proactive detailing and we remain very confidence in the molecule taking into account that it\u2019s the only one, but actually can offer a strong relief from the most painful physical symptoms, as well as the most problems in symptoms associated with the migraine, and we know there is a huge opportunity. Out of the 6 million people being treated in the U.S. today, 35% to 40% of those are not responding to the treatment, and in terms of efficacy really, with one single dose we believe we have the unique value proposition, but still work to be done, lot of work to be done. Kevin Hern : Thanks Patrick. Navin, thanks for your question. I think we have time for one more caller please. Operator : And that\u2019s from the line of David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Thanks very much. So I have two questions please. First for Dan. If you could just help us understand a little bit better regarding the AbCellera antibody 400 patient Phase 2 which was initiated mid-June. Just curious, given the primary endpoint is that day-11, why would results not be revealed until the fourth quarter. And then second for Josh, could you comment on the swings in other income. I guess it's really more on a go forward basis that you already discussed what happened in the second quarter just to maybe provide any modeling suggestions to us for modeling other income in future quarters? Thanks very much. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. We'll go to Dan and then Josh. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah Dave, thanks for the question on the timing of the Phase 2. Your right, it\u2019s a 400 patient study that initiated last month. It got up to a bit of a slow start. I think as we at that time, in the country the pandemic shifted in geographies, we shifted our efforts accordingly. It's now enrolling very, very quickly.  The timing of data disclosure depends on that rate of enrollment though. So it could in fact be sooner than Q4. I think I'm confident it will be by of course sometime during Q4 at the latest. As you point out, the day-11 time point is a critical point. So 400 patients enrolled and then 11 days later, need differential swabs and a viral assessment and then database lock and then analysis and reporting, all-in-all it\u2019ll just take probably a couple of weeks from the end of the study. So we'll keep investors updated and the community updated on the progress of the study. That's where we are today. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Josh? Josh Smiley : Thanks. On our OID, of course in the first half of the year and particular in the second quarter as I mentioned, what we're seeing there is the mark-to-market gains from the roughly $2 billion of investment securities we hold. Again, we hold these as a function of business development deals and venture capital deals to stay abreast of breaking science and obviously making good decisions there, at least as of Q2. We don't anticipate or we don\u2019t forecast gains going forward there. So really, if you keep that neutral Dave, what we are really thinking about then is, we are in a net debt position, so we pay interest costs on the debt and then that\u2019s the only way we see anything that\u2019s positive is if we see investment gains change.  So I think for modeling purposes, look at our sort of net debt position. We've got great rates again the debt and so it\u2019s pretty modest negative cost. But that's sort of what we assume and then you know any unusual items that flow through there, of course we\u2019ll report and we tend to just as you saw in Q2 let those upload though. But we are not anticipating anything significant in the second half of the year. So mostly you're just going to see the negative impacts of our net-debt position. Kevin Hern : Thanks Josh, David. Thanks for your questions and now we\u2019ll go to Dave for the close. Dave Ricks : Thanks Kevin. Well, we appreciate your participation in our earnings call today and a remarkable quarter and thank you for your interest in Eli Lilly.  Please follow-up with our IR team if you have any additional questions that we didn\u2019t address today and hope everyone stays well. We\u2019ll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day!",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Kevin Hern. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q3 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly USA; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. We're also joined by Sara Smith and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those noted on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in Lilly's latest form 10-K and subsequent forms 10-Q and 8-Ks. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It was not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for some opening comments. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. Q3 was another important quarter for Lilly and the pharmaceutical industry's progress in developing new medicines to treat COVID-19. I'm very proud of Lilly's work and we'll go into detail of the promising advancements made this quarter. However, I'd like to start by summarizing our overall business performance. Clearly, this quarter's financial results came in below sell side analyst projections. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I'll make a few high level comments on several factors that did impact our Q3 results. And then Josh will go into more detail later. First, as we've discussed in the past, the impact of price on revenue can be volatile in the U.S., as we make estimates for rebates and discounts, obligations during the coverage gap of Medicare Part D patient assistance programs and other liabilities. During Q3, the magnitude of adjustments was meaningful, predominantly related to our assumptions regarding our obligation during the coverage gap in Medicare Part D for Trulicity. While the impact was notable in Q3, this source of volatility normalizes when analyzing our results over the first nine months, as well as for the full year. In addition, while we are encouraged new prescriptions are trending toward pre-COVID levels, the recovery varies by class. We view this important -- this impact is transient, remain confident in the underlying business and continue to manage our operations to deliver success over the long-term. From an operating expense standpoint, we made significant investments in R&D to develop COVID-19 treatments. While we spoken before about our efforts to develop COVID-19 treatments, we've not quantified that investment level. In Q3, we were fortunate to see positive clinical data from multiple trials. And this activity had an impact of about $0.12 on Q3 earnings per share. Finally, after taking a pause on active promotion in Q2 to respect the impact that COVID-19 had on medical practices, we increased our investments in customer facing activity and direct-to-consumer marketing in Q3 in order to accelerate our growth. While this did create a step-up compared to our investment level in SG&A in Q2 2020 and versus Q3 2019, we believe our progress in Q3 sets us up for a strong finish to the year and to provide meaningful momentum into 2021. We have a number of opportunities to drive this growth through these investments in our existing commercial portfolio. These include our unique CD indication for Trulicity and the recently launched higher doses. Pulling through access wins for [Togs] and launching the recently approved non-radiographic axSpA indication and driving increased uptake of Verzenio through our differentiated data package, just to highlight a few. Looking at the underlying trends, in Q3, we delivered revenue growth of 5% or 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Despite disruptions on new patients\u2019 charts from the global pandemic, volume growth was solid, increasing by 9% versus Q3 2019. Our key growth products continue to be the catalyst for our business performance and made up over half of our revenue during the quarter. International performance in Europe and China was particularly strong, as constant currency revenue grew 9% and 10% respectively, driven by our newest products. For the first nine months of the year, our revenue grew by 6%, driven by 12% volume growth. This growth was delivered during a period of significant disruption. The ways we launch new medicines, execute clinical trials and manufacturer our products, have all been meaningfully changed during the pandemic, with some adjustments likely to remain as our business continues to evolve. We are proud of our efforts to ensure patients have access to medicines by maintaining our manufacturing plans in continuous operation and by developing potential new treatments for COVID-19. Operating margin as a percent of revenue was 26.2% for the third quarter. This is a decline of 230 basis points versus Q3 2019 but was depressed by $125 million that we invested in COVID-19 therapies during the quarter. Excluding these exceptional activities, operating margin was 28.4%. We have confidence in our outlook and expect to deliver financial results within our updated guidance range, with all lines at or above our original 2020 guidance, and to achieve our operating margin expansion plans, excluding our investments in COVID-19 treatments. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we remain well-positioned for a period of sustained growth and margin expansion. Turning to the pipeline. In Q3, we made meaningful progress advancing our late-stage pipeline and developing potential COVID-19 treatments, including FDA approval of additional doses for Trulicity for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, an important data readout for Verzenio in early breast cancer, approval in Europe for Olumiant in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, positive Phase 3 results from the ACTT-2 trial baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, positive results of our COVID-19 neutralizing antibody monotherapy in combination therapy. And we presented new data on a potential new indication for Jardiance in collaboration with Behringer Ingelheim. I'm encouraged by our company's efforts to develop potential new therapies to treat COVID-19 and working at unprecedented speed. This work would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of many employees of Lilly and the collaborative efforts across the industry, regulators and government. We continue to utilize external innovation and collaborations to augment our internal capabilities. This quarter we signed a number of business development transactions, including the global expansion of our TYVYT collaboration with Innovent. At the same time, we utilized our strong cash flow to return nearly $700 million to shareholders via the dividend. Moving to Slide 5 and 6, you'll see the full list of key events since our last earnings call. I would like to welcome Ilya Yuffa to our executive team as he assumes leadership for our Bio-Medicines business unit, a 25 year veteran with a tremendous breadth of experience across our organization from finance, business development and sales to Six Sigma, ethics and compliance and general management. Ilya has consistently delivered impressive results in successful larger roles -- that successively larger roles, which are prepared him well to lead Lilly Bio-Medicines. After serving as General Manager of Italy since 2018, Ilya has been leading Lilly's largest franchise U.S. Diabetes, where he played a critical role in the continued success of the market leading medicine Trulicity as well as Jardiance in the two fastest growing classes in diabetes. Ilya it\u2019s great to have you on our leadership team. I'd also like to thank Patrik for his energy, focus and execution that he brought to his time as President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. Given Patrik\u2019s strong record of successfully managing Lilly businesses in complex markets around the world, he is the right enterprise leader to lead Lilly USA and our global customer focused functions during this exciting period of opportunity and growth, as we look to continue to deliver new medicines to patients. Before I turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020, I want to discuss briefly certain events at one of our manufacturing facilities located in Branchburg, New Jersey. Late last year, our Branchburg plant underwent a routine FDA general surveillance inspection. The inspectors identified findings related to data handling and we received an official action indicated notice, as well as a follow up inspection this year. We have not received a warning letter or other enforcement letter from the FDA at this time. Given that this plant is among several worldwide that produces bamlanivimab or Lilly SARS-CoV-555, one of our COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies, I want to share more information about our response to these inspections. First, we are confident the issues raised during the inspections did not impact product quality or patient safety for bamlanivimab or for any other product manufactured at the Branchburg plant. Having said that, we and I take remediation of these data handling issues and our commitment to quality and safety very seriously. We engaged an external firm to conduct a comprehensive independent review of systems at the Branchburg site, and we were working diligently to incorporate suggestions for improvement to our procedures. We have also had this firm perform independent reviews of our manufacturing of bamlanivimab at Branchburg to examine our manufacturing batch records and quality documentation to corroborate our own batch release decisions as we submit for supply of bamlanivimab from Branchburg for the emergency use authorization we requested. We are confident in the material at this facility and frankly at all of our sites. Finally for our neutralizing antibodies, we have a robust global supply chain in place with five active ingredient manufacturing sites worldwide in addition to five additional drug product sites worldwide. Branchburg is one of the active ingredients sites. Once we are approved to do so, our resilient global network is well positioned to begin the supply as we help battle this global pandemic. Now, let me turn it over to Josh. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7 and 8, you will see our non-GAAP financial performance in Q3 and during the first nine months of 2020. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 5% this quarter compared to Q3 2019, as key growth products drove volume growth. Gross margin as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 79.1%, a decline of 50 basis points versus Q3 2019, driven primarily by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold and lower realized prices, partially offset by favorable manufacturing efficiencies and product mix. Moving down the P&L. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% this quarter compared to Q3 2019, as we invested meaningfully in direct to consumer marketing to augment our virtual tactics, increasing promotion to physicians and consumers in connection with increases in healthcare utilization around the world. As I'll discuss in our guidance in a few minutes, we see the absolute level of third quarter SG&A expenses as indicative of our fourth quarter expenditures as well, which keeps us on track for our full year ranges and modest full year growth. Research and development expenses increased by 6% in the quarter, driven primarily by our efforts to develop COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies and baricitinib for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, partially offset by lower development expenses for late stage assets. In total, operating income decreased 4% compared to Q3 2019 as increased investments, including COVID-19 related R&D expenses, exceeded revenue growth during the quarter. We expect the increased marketing activity and customer activation to drive additional revenue growth going forward. During the first nine months of 2020, operating income increased by 7% as revenue growth outpaced operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 26.2% during the third quarter and 28.1% for the first nine months of 2020. As Dave mentioned earlier, our investments in COVID-19 therapies represented investment outside of our normal business operations. So excluding R&D expenses of $180 million associated with these important programs, our operating margin during the first nine months of 2020 would have been 29.2% and consistent with our guidance, we expect continued improvement in Q4. We continue to allocate resources efficiently in an environment where COVID-19 is likely to have an impact for a sustained period of time. We've made the transition to a hybrid virtual and in person commercial model to support executing our strategy and we're committed to margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. Other income and expense was income of $159 million this quarter compared to expense of $25 million in Q3 2019. This quarter's other income was primarily driven by investment gains across our portfolio of public and private biopharma company investments as part of our external innovation strategy. As we regularly your highlight, this line can be volatile as public and private equity valuations fluctuate. We've received quite a bit of investor feedback on this item. So beginning in 2021, we will exclude the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures. We believe this will better align our non-GAAP results with our core business operations, allow for easier comparisons with our peer group and remove unpredictable volatility. This quarter, our tax rate was 15.5%, an increase of 380 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven by the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions and lower net discrete tax benefits this quarter versus the same quarter last year. While we expect some quarterly variability, we remain comfortable with long-term expectations of roughly 14% to 15% tax rate under the current US corporate tax structure. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased 4%. During the first nine months of 2020, earnings per share increased 20%. On Slide 9 and 10, we describe the effect of price, rates and volume on revenue. Worldwide revenue increased 5% during Q3 as volume growth of 9% was partially offset by price. Foreign exchange rates had 1% positive impact on revenue growth. During the first nine months of 2020, revenue grew 6%, driven by volume growth of 12%. Price was a 6% drag on worldwide growth or 4% if you exclude the impact of Alimta and Tyvyt in China. U.S. revenue grew 3% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 7% was led by Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio, partially offset by increased competition for Forteo and the impact on Tradjenta from the restructuring of the BI alliance. In line with our expectations, price was a 4% drag on US revenue growth. 3% points were due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Trulicity. 1% point was due to the net impact of increased rebates across the portfolio to maintain our strong commercial access, partially offset by modest list price increases. While typically we do not discuss detailed pricing dynamics for individual products, I will provide some additional commentary on the impact of price on Trulicity performance in Q3. In prior quarters, we assumed our Part D coverage gap liability would shift to later in the year due to short-term deferral of healthcare utilization caused by the impact of COVID-19 and the increased threshold for entry into the coverage gap. However informed by recent invoices from our Part D customers, we now anticipate similar patterns to prior years. So this resulted in updated estimates that led to a meaningful impact on Q3 results and a double digit drag on Trulicity\u2019s growth rate. Our estimated coverage gap impact for the full year though is largely unchanged. Excluding the impact of the one-time adjustments, Trulicity\u2019s price declined by high single digits in the third quarter versus Q3 2019 and low double digits for the first nine months of 2020. We expect a high single digit price decline for Trulicity for the full year. Last year, we guided toward a mid-single digit price decline for Trulicity. We expected this to be driven by increasing rebates rates to maintain our excellent access, partially offset by modest list price increases and modest growth in more highly rebated segments. As 2020 has unfolded, the negative impact of price on Trulicity growth has been higher than we expected, primarily due to segment mix. On Slide 10, we show the impact of segment next and rate on Trulicity growth in 2019 and 2020. While rate was a pricing headwinds, the net impact of modest list price increases and increased rebate rates has been mid-single digits or lower, which is consistent with our expectations. Moving to segment mix. While the commercial segment continues to deliver robust growth, lower net price segments have grown significantly faster. This depressed Trulicity\u2019s reported growth by approximately 7 percentage points in 2019 and 6% percentage points through the first nine months of 2020. This continued growth in 2020 exceeded our expectations and was primarily driven by Medicaid and to a lesser extent Medicare in other segments. Within Medicaid, we experienced formulary changes in key states, faster than anticipated pull through of access wins and expansion of total Medicaid lives this year. Trulicity currently has 45% share of market across all segments and continues to be the market leading GLP-1. We exited in Q3 with a similar share of market in the commercial sector segment. However, consistent with volume growth, we gained 4.5 percentage points of share in Medicaid in other segments since Q1 2019 and finished the quarter at a 38% share of market. It's worth noting that utilization of GLP-1 as a class is still immature and low market penetration suggests significant opportunity for additional growth across all segments. GLP-1s are used less in Medicaid and Medicare, and we expect disproportionate volume growth in these segments to continue. Although, these volume gains have a lower realized price than our commercial business, they do represent profitable business and are able Trulicity help more people living with diabetes. So as we project into 2021, we expect continued strong Trulicity access and performance across all segments with modest unit price declines and continued faster growth in lower price segments, to result in high single-digit total net price declines in 2021. However, I would note that this faster segment growth, which contributes to the net price decline, also shows up as higher overall prescription growth for GLP-1s as well. Our outlook for total US pricing trends remains unchanged and we continue to expect mid single-digit price declines for the full year in 2020, as well as moving into 2021. This mid single-digit price decline outlook includes, as we noted last quarter, a modest impact in 2020 from the affected increased US unemployment on segment mix, as well as approximately $100 million to $200 million of impact in 2021. Okay. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 9% in constant currency and volume grew by 10%, partially offset by price. Volume growth is positively impacted by Alimta in Germany due to our patent appeal victory and a court ordered injunction against generics that had entered the market, as well as Trulicity, Taltz, Olumiant and Verzenio. In Japan, revenue grew 1% in constant currency ad 5% volume growth was partially offset by government mandated price decreases that were effective March 2020. Japan revenue benefited from a one-time sale of Cialis, as well as good volume growth from Verzenio and Trulicity, partially offset by increased competition for Forteo. In China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency, driven by 51% volume growth, partially offset by pricing concessions from the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs. These programs help drive China\u2019s significant volume growth, which substantially increased access for patients to these important cancer medicines. We're excited about the momentum of our China oncology business and look forward to receiving regulatory action on Verzenio in the coming months. Outside of our oncology portfolio in China, recently launched products Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance and Olumiant, continue to have strong uptick. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth products, strong performance from Trulicity, Jardiance and Olumiant was partially offset by decreased Humalog, Forteo, Cialis and Humulin volume. As shown on Slide 11, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 13 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The strong volume trend in our key products was partially offset by a mix of competition and lower utilization of post-LOE product for Forteo, as well as reduced Trajenta royalties from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim announced last year. We end the first nine months of 2020 pleased that our key growth products have contributed approximately 15% year-to-date volume growth. Slide 12 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $3 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 52% of revenue. Though our key products are well-positioned to drive strong performance over the long term, we continue to see an impact from reduced patient starts due to COVID-19. In Q3, we were encouraged to see new patient starts recover off the troughs experienced in Q2 as the health system reopened around the world. While different classes have recorded different rates, most classes remain 10% to 20% below pre-COVID baselines. On Slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first nine months of 2020, we invested nearly $6 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D, including the addition of lebrikizumab in a number of early stage agreements. In addition, we returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and the dividend. We remain well capitalized and have the ability to access debt market at attractive rates. We expect to continue to enhance our long-term growth by acquiring first or best-in-class pipeline assets. And we do not anticipate COVID impacts regarding travel or market uncertainty to affect our efforts. Moving to Slide 14, you'll find our updated 2020 financial guidance and this is based on our best estimates at this time. Key assumptions supporting the guidance, include: Healthcare activity will continue the positive trends seen in Q3, returning to historical levels as doctors utilize telehealth or in-person visits despite additional COVID-19 outbreaks; New patient prescriptions will continue to improve in the US; Pricing headwinds from increased utilization of patient affordability program and changes in segment mix due to increased US unemployment will continue to be modest; and, promotional spend will constitute a mix of in person customer interactions, direct-to-consumer advertising, and investments in digital promotion. While uncertainty remains regarding resurgent waves of COVID-19 and any resulting impact on the pace of economic recovery around the world, we do believe healthcare activity will continue to be a priority and that most patients will find ways to access healthcare. So based on these assumptions, we're maintaining our current full-year revenue range. At the low end of the range, year-over-year sales growth in Q4 would be 8% to 9%, which while a step up from our third quarter growth rate, is supported by current volume trends and our expectations of more limited price impacts in the U.S. Achieving the higher end of the range likely requires some moderate sales from our COVID antibody, which we believe is possible but of course not certain at this point. Moving down the income statement. Our gross margin as a percent of revenue is unchanged on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are narrowing our range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses to $6 billion to $6.1 billion. We are narrowing our range for research and development expenses to $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, with investment in COVID-19 treatments of approximately $400 million for the full year likely to push us to the high end of our range as Lilly continue to self fund these programs. We believe these investments are critical to help combat the global pandemic. We're noting that our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue goal of 31% excludes our substantial investments in COVID-19 treatment and any associated revenue with them. Inclusive of these costs, we expect an operating margin of approximately 29%. While these investments put near-term pressure on our operating margin, they continue to be the right decision for our company and for society. In post launch, we do expect these therapies to be accretive to our operating income. We're updating the range of other income and expense to $450 million to $600 million of income, reflecting additional gains in our equity portfolio seen in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, this number is subject to volatility of the capital markets. Turning to taxes. We're maintaining our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance at approximately 14%. Earnings per share are unchanged on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40. As I noted with the revenue range, our EPS totals in Q4 will be highly dependent on COVID sales, which is why we're maintaining a pretty broad $0.20 range as we head into the fourth quarter. We exit Q3 well positioned to continue delivering revenue growth and productivity, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud of the investments we were making to help combat COVID-19 and are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to overcome challenges. Based on our current outlook for Q4, we believe we'll exit the year with strong underlying momentum for 2021. So I'll now turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19, a summary of key data disclosures in Q3 and an overall pipeline update. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Josh. Since our last call, we've made meaningful progress developing potential treatments for COVID-19, advancing key assets in our pipeline and presenting practice changing clinical trial data at major medical meetings. I\u2019ll begin with updates to our COVID-19 viral neutralizing antibody program. Then I'll provide an update on the full pipeline. And I'll finish by highlighting key events since the last quarter. Moving to Slide 15, Lilly is testing single antibody therapy, as well as combinations of antibodies in several trials across two different patient populations; first, is the treatment of recently diagnosed ambulatory patients; and second, in the prophylactic or preventative setting amongst nursing home residents and staff; a third, more severely ill population, i. e. hospitalized patients, has been studied in the ACTIV-3 trial only. This clinical trial is being run by the NIH and is the only study evaluating the efficacy of bamlanivimab, also known as LY-CoV555 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Based on an updated data set from the trial reviewed yesterday by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, no additional COVID-19 patients in this hospitalized setting will receive bamlanivimab. The board\u2019s recommendation was based on trial data suggesting that the addition of bamlanivimab to remdesivir and other treatments used in the hospitalized setting is unlikely to further help hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover from this advanced stage of the disease. In this updated data set, differences in safety outcomes between the bamlanivimab and placebo groups were not significant. Importantly, all other studies of bamlanivimab remain ongoing, including ACTIV-2, the NIH sponsored study in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. BLAZE-1, Lylly\u2019s ongoing Phase 2 trial in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting, which is studying bamlanivimab as monotherapy and in combination with etesevimab, also known as LY-CoV016. And BLAZE-2, Lylly\u2019s Phase 2 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff in long-term care facilities. While there was insufficient evidence from ACTIV-3, the bamlanivimab improved clinical outcomes when added to other treatments in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We remain confident based on data from released BLAZE-1 study that bamlanivimab monotherapy may prevent progression of disease for those earlier in the course of COVID-19. While the results in hospitalized patients were disappointing, we don't expect this to affect our chances of success in prophylaxis or in early treatment. And we think the patients, physicians and staff participating in all clinical trials of our neutralizing antibodies, including ACTIV-3. Regarding the Lilly sponsored COVID-19 neutralizing antibody program, we made key advances in the third quarter, which include : We initiated BLAZE-2, the Phase 3 trials studying post exposure prophylaxis for residents and staff in nursing homes; We reported proof of concept data for bamlanivimab monotherapy in BLAZE-1, demonstrating a reduction in hospitalizations and ER visits in the outpatient setting; We reported that the combination therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab met the primary and secondary endpoints at an interim analysis of BLAZE-1, significantly reducing viral load and symptoms, as well as meaningfully reducing hospitalizations and ER visits in the outpatient setting. And we submitted a request for emergency use authorization to the FDA for bamlanivimab monotherapy in higher risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19. We were particularly encouraged to show that neutralizing antibodies can help people clear virus more quickly improve symptoms and most importantly, prevent serious medical outcomes, like hospitalizations and ER visits. Notably, the pooled data of monotherapy and combination therapy showed a reduction of hospitalizations and ER visits of greater than 75% across all patients. In addition, the monotherapy and combination therapy had an even larger effect size in high risk patients, defined by body mass index ratio. We've now dosed approximately 1,000 trial participants with bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab, and we've shared safety and tolerability data from more than 400 patients in the monotherapy and combination therapy arms of BLAZE-1 on our call earlier this month, where we noted that monotherapy and combination therapy were both generally well tolerated with no significant safety concerns. No clinically meaningful differences and treatment emergent adverse events were observed across the treatment groups and the majority of treatment emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. And there have been no drug related serious adverse events reported thus far. We continue to recruit patients in BLAZE-1. While the FDA is still reviewing our request for EUA for monotherapy, we will soon be ready to request emergency use authorization for combination therapy and we intend to submit that request to the FDA as early as November. Another achievement this quarter as part of our efforts to develop potential treatments for COVID-19 was the positive outcome of baricitinib in the NIH sponsored ACT-2 trial of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Baricitinib in combination with remdesivir significantly reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes. The numerical decrease in mortality compared to remdesivir alone was also demonstrated. These results were most pronounced in patients receiving oxygen. Based on these data, we submitted a request for emergency use authorization for baricitinib to the FDA, and global regulatory discussions are ongoing. With two submissions to the FDA this month for request for emergency use authorizations and with our neutralizing antibody combination therapy providing the potential for a third in November, I'm particularly proud of the progress we've made over such a short period of time to rapidly develop potential new solutions to aid physicians and patients in the battle against this pandemic. Moving to Slide 16, you can see our select pipeline opportunities as of October 20th. Movement since our last earnings call includes approval for Trulicity alternative dose, approval for baricitinib in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, the previously mentioned initiation of the BLAZE-2 Phase 3 trial, the advancement of two immunology programs into Phase 2, the initiation of two Phase 1 programs and the termination of a Phase 1 diabetes asset and termination of our Ang2 antibodies Phase 2 proof of concept study in COVID-19 due to futility. We also saw results from the Phase 2 trial of Mevidalen, our D1-positive allosteric modulator in patients with lewy body disease. While we were disappointed that the study did not meet its primary cognitive end point at week 12, Mevidalen did show encouraging motor and non-motor benefits, and we are evaluating the next steps for this program at this time. In addition, Pfizer and Lilly have been informed by the USFDA that the agency intends to hold an Advisory Committee Meeting, likely in the March 2021 timeframe to discuss the tanezumab application. As a result, the FDA's review will obviously extend beyond the current December 2020 PDUFA date. However, the FDA has not provided a new action date. The agency communicated that its review of the application is ongoing and has not requested any new clinical studies to be completed at this time. Pfizer and Lilly will continue to work with the FDA as it completes its review of the application. Moving to Slide 17, we provide an update on our 2020 key events. The first nine months of 2020 have been incredibly productive, as highlighted by a significant number of positive key milestones with only a few exceptions. We've delivered on the key events that we outlined back in December 2019 and we've added several more. Most notably since the last earnings call, we've had regulatory approvals for important new indications and line extensions for Trulicity, Taltz and Olumiant. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we also presented results from EMPEROR-Reduced trial in patients with heart failure with reduce ejection fraction or HFREF. Jardiance demonstrated 25% reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. In addition, Jardiance had a positive effect in key secondary end points, including first hospitalization for heart failure and an exploratory renal composite end point. EMPEROR-Reduced included patients with and without diabetes. And these data are encouraging to expand the use of Jardiance in patients with HFREF. They also add to the existing body of evidence showing that cardiovascular and renal benefits of Jardiance, as first demonstrated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We're on track to submit these data to regulators later this year and look forward to the EMPEROR-Preserved trial in HFpEF in 2021. We also presented important data for Verzenio in early breast cancer at the virtual ESMO meeting this quarter, confirming that Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to demonstrate a benefit in this population and the first advancement for these patients in almost two decades. Verzenio showed 25% reduction in risk of cancer recurrence at two year landmark analysis. Verzenio also reduced the risk of distant metastases by 28%, an essential objective for any novel therapy in HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer, as distant recurrence is currently an incurable event. This is an important observation that bodes well for overall survival, since according to published literature, improvements in distant relapse-free survival have been shown to be a leading indicator for improved overall survival. The monarchE study is ongoing. Study participants will remain on trial and continue to be followed, and additional results will be presented in the future. As we stated previously, we intend to submit for regulatory review by the end of the year. We anticipate a standard review time line with the FDA. While there have been many positive pipeline events already this year, we still have two important readouts to come yet this year and a number of updates that will occur during the first half of 2021. Before year end, we'll present additional data from the Phase 1/2 BRUIN study for LOXO-305, our BTK inhibitor. We'll also have top line results from SURPASS 1, the first Phase 3 trial to readout from the tirzepatide Type 2 diabetes program. SURPASS 1 is a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial. We look forward to sharing these data in the coming months for this important program that we believe will raise the bar for treatment expectations for patients with Type 2 diabetes. We have a lot of momentum in R&D at Lilly, which will carry into 2021 where we have a number of additional data readouts, including the remainder of the registrational Phase 3 tirzepatide Type 2 diabetes trials; Phase 3 data for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis; Phase 3 data from lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis; Phase 3 Jardiance HFPEF data; Phase 2 data from two Alzheimer's trials, including an important readout from our plaque-clearing antibody, denenab, expected early in Q1 2021. We remain excited about the potential of this molecule to make a real difference for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we look forward to multiple potential proof-of-concept studies from our early-stage portfolios in immunology, neuroscience, diabetes and oncology. We've risen to the challenge this year as we engaged in the fight against COVID-19. We showed our adaptability and commitment to developing medicines through innovative ways. I'm inspired by the indefatigable effort by our teams in their pursuit of new medicines for patients. Dave, back to you for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. 2020 has been a difficult yet remarkable year. Despite challenges and the resulting choppiness of our quarterly results, we've delivered volume-driven growth of 6% through the first three quarters of this year. Excluding investments in COVID-19 therapies, we've expanded our operating margin by 160 basis points compared to the first three quarters of 2019. We've made meaningful progress this year on our innovation-based strategy, launching three new medicines and a number of NILEX, delivering important data readouts for key pipeline molecules and developing and submitting EUAs for potential treatment for virus unknown to the world at this time last year. And over the next few months, we have several highly anticipated pipeline readouts on deck. We continue to look for opportunities to augment the future growth of our company through business development and then return excess capital to shareholders. While the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to challenge us, the growth products in our commercial portfolio, limited patent expiry in the next five years and margin expansion opportunities before us, as well as upcoming data readouts in the pipeline, I like our prospects. And I thank my Lilly teammates for persevering and performing amidst the year of challenges to continue to deliver meaningful innovation for the patients we serve. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We\u2019d like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : So my first question for you is, why didn't you lower or tighten your 2020 guidance and leave the antibody sales as upside? Are you having a high degree of conviction behind this Emergency Use Authorization, or are you seeing some positive trends shape up for the fourth quarter? And then my follow-up question is, what are your thoughts on the upcoming FDA AdCom meeting to review BIBS aducanumab? Do you think this will close the door on Alzheimer's drug development or herald a new beginning? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Louise. We'll go to Josh for the first question on guidance and then Dan to the question on the FDA Adcom. Josh Smiley : Yes, I think as we look at sales guidance and the implied Q4 absolute numbers we see the trends. Now, we're at the end of October. I think we feel good about the lower end of the range for sure, based on just commercial performance of our products around the world. We have submitted an EUA. Dan talked about the data behind that. So I think it's reasonable to include a potential upside associated with some sales of that antibody to governments around the world in Q4. Of course, it is uncertain. That is why we've kept the range. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Louise for the question on the AdCom. Of course, like everyone else, we'll be watching it with a great interest. But I don't think I can handicap it one way or the other. The way I see it, the important observation here is around the evidence that lowering plaques can lead to cognitive benefits in Alzheimer's disease. I think we've seen it across a couple of data presentations now. And that's what gives us confidence in our own donanemab, our N3pG antibody that's currently in Phase 2. Just as a reminder, this is a pretty large Phase 2. We've designed it with special care, enrolling a very homogenous group of patients so that it could be powered to show us an efficacy signal, if present. And we look forward to seeing that data early next year. Operator : The next caller is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : I have a question on tirzepatide, important event your first readout of Phase 3. Can you characterize your level of confidence that the Phase 3 results will wow investors kind of like the Phase II results did? It's notable that analysts already carry $5 billion number for this, which is a high number. And I'm wondering if you can talk about both efficacy and tolerability and safety relative to Phase 2 in terms of what you expect. I know that's asking you to predict how these readouts go, but it's what we have to do as investors. So it'd be great to get your best guess on that. And related to that question, how much data can we realistically expect that you'll provide in the top line press release? Mike Mason : We've never been more excited about our tirzepatide program. In our Phase 2 Type 2 diabetes studies, 43% of people on tirzepatide had reached a final A1c of 5.7%, which is normal A1c versus only 2% for the market leader, Trulicity. 34% of people on tirzepatide lost more than 15% of their body weight versus 2% for Trulicity. And tirzepatide will be delivered in the same patient-friendly device of Trulicity. Tirzepatide has the opportunity to become a foundational treatment for someone living with Type 2 diabetes that not only need A1c control but could benefit from significant weight loss, which brings additional metabolic health benefits. Further, we're very excited about what tirzepatide can do in obesity and NASH. As you take a look at the results from SURPASS 1, later this year we'll get the results. We'll issue a press release that will likely be top line results. We won't have full data, be able to do a full analysis that will come later at medical meetings in 2021. Operator : Thank you, and that will come from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : I have one for Dan and one for Dave, if I may. Perhaps, maybe starting with you, Dave. On the Alzheimer's A4 trial, you've previously expressed openness to possibly taking an interim analysis. I know you have two years plus a follow-up by now already, maybe three years of follow-up by next year. Is that something you're still open to? Just wanted to hear your thoughts. And then, Dan, there's a little bit of confusion on tirzepatide, perhaps in part because both the clin trials, as well as the Lilly slide suggest the trial had a primary completion in October. But when I map out when the last patient entered, which was first week of February and add in the 40 weeks, which is a primary end point, it doesn't look like the trials met the primary end point yet in all the patients. And it will probably be in November and then some time to announce this. So can you confirm if I'm off track there? Thank you very much. Dan Skovronsky : Of course, A4 is an ongoing trial in patients who are presymptomatic. They don't even have the symptoms Alzheimer's disease but they have amyloid plaques as detected by imaging. And we're testing solanezumab and now a higher dose of solanezumab can have a benefit in those patients. We haven't commented on whether or not there could be opportunities for an interim look here. And right now, we're just focused on the final analysis in that trial. With respect to the timing of the tirzepatide trial and the details on clinicaltrials.gov, I can just reconfirm what we said earlier on the call, which is that we expect to have that data and top line in coming months. It's obviously a major event for us. And you can assume that when we get that data, we're going to turn it around quite quickly. Operator : The next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert from Truist. Please go ahead. Greg Gilbert : I'm going to start with another one on Alzheimer's. Dan, I'm not sure to what degree you can comment on this, but I'm curious how interrelated your studies are and the agency's view of aducanumab. Maybe asked another way. Do you think the agency can act on their application without seeing your data, which is coming pretty soon? It seems to me that what you're bringing to the table is pretty important in the field. And then secondly, I know it's a little early. I was hoping you could talk to your growing confidence in the IL-2 approach since you signed that collaboration a few years ago. It looks like there's some additional data coming at ACR as well. Thanks. Dan Skovronsky : I think on Alzheimer's disease, your question is how will the FDA think about sort of a class effect here for multiple plaque lowering antibodies show the same result or if they show different results. I don't know. I mean I can't speculate on agency actions. But I can say that it wouldn't surprise me if regulators around the world did take sort of the totality of evidence approach in Alzheimer's disease, which could be across multiple molecules in different trials, to give confidence about a particular mechanism, in this case, of course, plaque lowering. Having said that, though, each molecule still have to pass a certain bar of evidence for benefit versus risk in the intended use population. I do think, though, that if ADI is deemed to have a positive effect and our drug ultimately has a positive effect, the convergence of those two events could bode well for both drugs. But there's a lot that has to happen before we get there, Greg. With respect to IL-2, yes, as this molecule progresses in clinical trials, we're growing more confident in the hypothesis that underlies this effort. This is a low-dose pegylated IL-2 that's meant to stimulate T regulatory cells without stimulating effector T cells. And we've now presented data from Phase 1 that should we have exactly that effect in a dose-dependent way. We can boost Tregs. And we hope that that will have a modulatory effect on autoimmune disease. Based on our confidence in the biomarker here and the mechanism of action, we've committed to starting a number of Phase 2 trials here in parallel to understand how these changes in regulatory T cells could translate to clinical benefits for patients in diseases like lupus or IVD or dermatologic disease. And so those trials are starting and we look forward to getting data from them. Operator : The next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Just my question is on Trulicity. It seems like there's two issues kind of impacting the quarter. The first was the timing of the doughnut hole impact and the second was this channel mix issue, if I was hearing you correctly. So I guess on channel mix, is the net of the unfavorable price, I guess, balanced against the higher volumes a net neutral versus your original expectations? Or is volume only partially offsetting this kind of mix issue that you're dealing with, I guess, on that product specifically? And then my second question was on margin evolution going forward. Should we be thinking about the 31% operating margin ex the COVID investments as your baseline to grow off of as we think about 2021 and beyond? Or should we still think about some kind of lingering COVID investments that could impact margins as we move through next year? Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Mike Mason for the question on Trulicity and then Josh for the question on margin evolution. Mike Mason : Overall, we're very confident about the growth potential of the GLP class and Trulicity. The GLP class is performing strong with TRx growth of 23% for the quarter during the COVID pandemic. Trulicity continues to hold market share leadership in the face of semaglutide with a 45% share of market. Overall, Trulicity grew volume 26% in the U.S. at a time when patient office visits for Type 2 diabetes remains 20% lower than last year due to the COVID pandemic. When you take a look at segment mix, what we're seeing is that Trulicity performed well in commercial and Part D, holding market share leadership and growing gross sales year-to-date at 29% in commercial and 44% in Part D. Trulicity segment mix was really driven by stronger than expected performance, both share and volume and growing lower priced segments like Medicaid. Even at the lower prices, Medicaid growth brings in profitable business for Lilly and helps people living with diabetes. I'll highlight one decision that we made. During the early stages of the COVID pandemic, we were concerned about people on commercial insurance losing their jobs moving to Medicaid and having to stop take Trulicity because we had lower access in Medicaid. We didn't think this dynamic would be best for people living with diabetes during the pandemic. Thus, we prioritize improving our access in Medicaid to help people living with diabetes. For example, we were upgraded on California Medicaid early in Q2. And we've seen Trulicity volume in California Medicaid nearly double this year, which is really great for everyone. I remain very excited and confident in Trulicity. Josh Smiley : On margin, yes, so we've tried to separate out the COVID investments this year, which we've mentioned will -- the expense will be in the range of $400 million for the year. As you know, we've been focused on 31% operating margin as a goal for 2020. And given the guidance that we presented, not including anything from COVID, we're confident we'll achieve that 31%. I think that's the right baseline to think about going forward on an overall basis. Now we will have COVID investments that move into 2021 as we continue the trials that we've already put up and running. Again, though, we are expecting, given the submission of the EUA and the data that we have that there will be, at some point, sales associated with those investments. I think if we look at just isolating the expense and the sales, we'll have to come back on that. We don't have prices or volumes or anything around the world. So I think the COVID piece in 2021, we will have some expense. But realistically, I think the way to think about our business is 31% operating margin, excluding the extraordinary COVID impact and margin expansion then in 2021 and really through 2025, as we've talked about. So I think COVID should help us, I think, from an overall economic perspective in that period, if the product or products are successful. But really I think the focus on long term margin expansion sort of cuts through anything that we see in the near term on COVID. And we're committed to those margin expansion plans that we've talked about pre-pandemic. Operator : The next caller is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : First, Dan, in the past, when you have referred to very low dropout rates in SURPASS 1, were you referring to analysis on an intent-to-treat basis? I fear Lilly is preparing us for solid data on an efficacy as demand basis but less compelling on an intent to treat basis? And then the second question is, it was said earlier in the call that Lilly has never been more excited about tirzepatide. I thought that was an interesting choice of words given the importance of the event and the lack of clarity on the status of the trial at this point. It implies that you're more excited than you were in Q2 or Q1 or any time between. So can you tell us if any member of management has any knowledge whatsoever of the results of SURPASS 1? Thank you. Dan Skovronsky : What we said with respect to people dropping out of our clinical trials was that we hadn't seen an effect from COVID-19. We were quite worried about that in the early days of the pandemic, when the tirzepatide trials have become fully enrolled and were some of the most important and largest trials that we've ever conducted, whether this new pandemic would cause people to stop participating in clinical trials and we didn't see a bump up in dropout rates. I think, though, what you're really interested in is people discontinuation from therapy, which could be different than dropout rates. And we wouldn't know that until we get the data from the trial. With respect to the two different analyses that we comment on the efficacy as demand versus the real intent to treat analysis. You're pointing out, I think that in Phase 2, there was a pretty big difference between these two analyses with the efficacy estimate showing better results than the pure ITT because a number of patients at the highest dose, at the 50-milligram dose, had dropped out due to adverse events. Like I said, we don't know what's happening in SURPASS 1 yet. But when those data come, it will be important to look at those two analyses. Our hope and the way we've designed this trial with a slower dose titration is to avoid discontinuations due to adverse events, which would show that a smaller gap between the efficacy as demand and ITT that we saw in Phase 2. Mike Mason : Yes. I can assure you that no one and any one at Lilly have seen the results as for SURPASS 1 yet. I think my confidence in tirzepatide from what we knew we've seen is, obviously, there's been a lot of attention on the dose titration scheme that we used in our Phase 2 and the dose titration study as well as Phase 3. We've used a more gradual titration approach in our Phase 3 trials. And as we've seen the readout of AWARD-11, as well as some of the novel step programs who used similar gradual titration, we saw that those schemes did work and that we\u2019re able to produce GI profiles that were acceptable. So that's the new data that we've seen, and we're very confident in tirzepatide. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Just had a few. Josh, on Trulicity, if I'm hearing you correctly, for 2021, you guys have gone from mid-single to high single-digit price declines, but for the rest of the broader diabetes portfolio and really, overall, is it still mid-single as an assumption? And if you have formulary wins for Trulicity in Medicare or Medicaid but at a lower price, what's your capacity to raise price down the road? And then second question is, just a real quick one to ask if you're seeing any sort of halo effect in the marketplace for metastatic breast share for monarchE currently, or do you think that's going to happen looking to 2021? Thank you. Josh Smiley : Yes, on Trulicity, I think as we think about 2021, we are looking at two separate pieces. I think the first is just the underlying unit price where we feel things haven't changed. We really see underlying unit price holding segments constant as being in that low to mid-single-digit impact. I think what we've seen now over two years is we're underestimating how fast segments like Medicaid can grow, and that's what Mike talked about. So I think given the fact that we continue to see good growth in Medicaid, the share performance and utilization is still lower than what we see in commercial and our strong performance in that segment, as well as, as we've talked in prior calls, we expect some Medicaid expansion. We're seeing a little bit of that now. We expect that to persist into 2021. That moves us from that mid single digit Trulicity price to high single digits. So it really is the fact that we do continue to expect faster segment growth in areas like Medicaid. All that being said, I think we'll continue to look at pricing as we have in the past. We price for the system we have today, which is modest list price increases and giving back a little bit more than that in rebates. That's what we've seen over the last few years. I don't anticipate that approach changing unless we have something that changes on the legislative side, if you get as an industry more toward a net price environment as opposed to high-growth rebates and net. But for 2021, we're sort of planning that those things, at least for the beginning of the year, won't change. Anne White : So Verzenio has had notable positive momentum right now in the currently approved metastatic breast cancer setting. And you can see that it's steadily gaining market share. We have monthly TRx of approaching 14% now, NBRx of approaching 23%. And then you saw some of the sales being posted, particularly worldwide growth of 49%. And we're now market leader in NBRx in Japan at over 50%. So definitely, momentum. And what we continue to do is really grow the number of physicians who tried Verzenio, and they continue to adopt with really a positive experience and they incorporate it more broadly into their practice. This I think is primarily capitalized on the positive overall survival data from MONARCH 2 in combination with fulvestrant. But we do believe that the positive results from monarchE are really providing them another strong example that Verzenio is differentiated from other CDK4/6 inhibitors. And even prior to those results, there was a steadily growing value of evidence that Verzenio is differentiated with the higher CDK4 selectivity, differentiated continuous dosing of monotherapy indication and then obviously, this OS data, not just in the overall population but in the primary endocrine resistance. So we do think we're seeing a shift in people's perception that this is a best-in-class opportunity, both in the metastatic setting and then potentially in the future as we bring it forward for a new treatment option for patients in the early breast cancer setting. So look forward to more work there. Operator : The next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for the question. So one question for Dave and then a question for Josh. So Dave, can you talk about key post election policy priorities for the industry? And what specifically Lilly hopes to achieve with the challenges to 340b? And then a question for Josh is if implemented as written, what would be the biggest impact on Lilly's corporate tax rate under the Biden tax plan? And is there a concern that this would have a significant relative impact on U.S. corporations like Lilly versus OUS corporations? Thanks. Dave Ricks : Of course, the landscape post election is not defined, so we'll need to wait for that to land before we get into too many speculations about the future environment. But I think we can say that as an industry, as we sit around the table and certainly here at Lilly, there's two basic problems in the US drug market that need to be untangled. One is the patient out of pocket cost problem, where we're really the only country on the planet that indexes patient out of pocket cost to list prices that that still happens in a highly prevalent way and actually, the rate of growth in high-deductible plans, including those on exchanges and ACA, is growing. So this problem is getting bigger, not smaller. Of course, we think the answer there is to have cost sharing at least be based on some discounted number much closer to actual price and perhaps all the discounts being passed through. There's other solutions, regulatory ones, other ideas we have, capping deductibles, reducing the amount a co-pay can be for any given transaction through regulation or other avenues. States have done that. And I think we do see good impact on affordability and persistence when that's done. So that's the highest priority for the industry. The second priority and you touched on 340b, is just reducing the amount of distortions in the system, which create artificial winners and losers and shifts money around health care based on sales, which is inappropriate way to fund things in our mind. We'd like to see that disentangled and that kind of services, as it relates to dispensing or formulary management, are based on something to do with the value of those services versus something to do with the drugs that are being dispensed. 340b is one example of that where high-priced drugs move through covered entities at huge margin increases. And those monies go to other purposes not related to drugs. Patients pay more and lose in that equation, and we certainly lose in that equation. So as it relates to 340b actions and other channel actions, we're interested in kind of decomplexifying that and making the system work a little bit better for not just patients but for sustainability of the pharmaceutical industry. So anyway, we'll focus on those things as we have been and we'll have to see what the tactics look like based on electoral outcomes here just a week away. Josh Smiley : I think, first, the tax system that we have in the US now does help us compete on a global basis for innovation. I think that's the biggest positive that we've seen. It is a complex system. But having a rate, an underlying rate that's more competitive with our European competitors allows us to attract innovation, keep it in the US. And you've seen that in some of the acquisitions we've done, including companies like Loxo, we\u2019re more competitive when we're competing against OUS companies that have a low corporate tax rate in their countries. So we like that. I think as we look, though, to potential changes, I think the first thing I would say is there's -- having been through the last round here, there's a huge difference between what a high level plan is and how it gets implemented. And the details in that implementation are what actually drives the big point movements. I don't know that we could have sitting in 2017 predicted that we have a 15% rate, for example, as our long term rate here. So there's a lot of work to be done if there is any kind of future tax reform coming. Obviously, the underlying US rate looks like it'll go up. But I think we have a couple of advantages. No matter what happens we invest heavily in R&D among the most heavily of any of our big pharma peers. So we would hope and work to ensure that innovation is rewarded in any tax system going forward. And we have a pretty balanced manufacturing network. We make about half of our plants are in the US and half are outside the US. So I think we we're probably poised to take advantage of any changes that happen in the tax structure going forward. But there's no doubt that having a competitive sort of base rate for the US relative to our OUS peers is something that's, I think, really important for our industry. Operator : The next caller is Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Just regarding LOXO-305, can you share any perspective on the registration path for the drug in CLL and if a head to head trial versus IMBRUVICA is still on the table? Thank you. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. I think at this moment, it's premature to talk about registrational paths. But I can say that we look forward to releasing more data later this year. And I think as we release that data, that's an opportunity to update on our current thinking on the development plan. Operator : The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : I just wanted to clarify. So with respect to Trulicity, I believe you said that the volume growth was 26% in the quarter. Obviously, the reported U.S. sales growth was 5%, which suggests a 21 percentage point difference. So either way, if that's right, if you could just confirm it, if not, if you could just give us the correct figures. But then could you, for the difference, explain the components? So obviously, last year in the third quarter, the company had missed Trulicity sales expectations due to higher than expected rebates. So the company had a very easy comparison versus the third quarter of '19 for Trulicity. Yet, obviously, the sales disappointed this quarter. So if you could explain that 20% plus percentage point difference in terms of how much was due to rebates versus mix shift, et cetera, and then also help us understand why the mix shift was a surprise given the Medicaid wins that you articulated. And then -- well, actually, I'll just leave it at that. So if you could address those, that would be great. Mike Mason : As we take a look at pricing performance for Trulicity in Q3, when we take a look at the net impact of rebates to maintain access and list price that was 2% of modest headwind in Q3 of this year. Segment mix was 6% and then the remaining of that was due to onetime events due to coverage GAAP estimates for rebates and discounts. So that's the breakdown of performance for Trulicity in Q3. You may not have been on earlier. As we take a look at Medicaid performance, we're performing quite well in the higher-priced segments of commercial and Part D. We grew gross sales in commercial by 29% year-to-date and Part D by 44%. When we take a look at segment mix, it's really driven by higher than expected, Medicaid really have kind of a triple whammy going there, where as you say COVID is driving more people into Medicaid. We're also seeing that Medicaid in general, is growing for Trulicity because Trulicity's share is lower. And then we did make the conscious decision to win access in Medicaid, because we felt that we're going to see people going from commercial to Medicaid. And we had a lower access in Medicaid than we did in commercial. So we thought it was the right thing to do for patients in order to increase Medicaid, so someone didn't have to go off Trulicity if they lost their job during the pandemic. So that's the breakdown. We're very confident in Trulicity, both pricing and volume going forward. Operator : And next question will come from Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : So just two, please, one on tanezumab. I know you mentioned the AdCom. I believe that's a change from the [core one], the FDA is saying that they were not going to do an AdCom. I don't know if you have any insights you can share just on what may have changed to led to leave them to do the advisory committee meeting? And then second on maybe just going back to the Alzheimer's discussion from before. Obviously, a lot of focus on tanezumab early next year. I know you also have an N3pG in Phase 1 development. I'm just curious if you can maybe talk about sort of how that one is different from the one you have in Phase 2 to give us a sense of what you're trying to change their potential. Thanks. Patrik Jonsson : Well, thank you very much for the question. We were just updated by the FDA that the PDUFA date is no longer valid and that they are most likely planning to have an Advisory Board in the month of March. And actually, we don't believe this is necessarily negative, taking into account that we have a lot of data on tanezumab. And we have 39 clinical trials and more than 18,000 patients treated. So we actually think even an outboard could be beneficial. Dan Skovronsky : Vamil, thanks for the question on donanemab and the follow-on N3pG molecule, which you noted is in Phase 1. One of the things that we saw with donanemab was that we had a great PD effect. We could clear plaques quite deeply and quickly but we also had antidrug antibodies. The antibodies weren't at a level that they affected the PK of the drug because we're giving pretty high doses of the drug. Still, it's not optimal to have ADA against your drug. So we created a next gen N3pG that we hypothesize would have the same plaque clearing PD effect but not have antidrug antibodies. So that's the next one that you see there in Phase 1. If danetumab turns out to be a success, it could be useful to have a follow-on molecule that doesn't have ADA. I also point out that in addition to donanemab and that followed into N3pG molecule, the other Alzheimer's molecule we're really quite excited about is zagotenemab, which is our aggregate Taltz specific antibody and that will be reading out later next year. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Vamil, thanks for your questions. And now we'll go back to Dave for the close. Dave Ricks : Great. Thanks, Kevin. Well, we appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and your ongoing interest in Eli Lilly & Company. Please follow up with the IR team if you have questions that were not addressed today. And I hope everyone stays well during this difficult time. Take care, and we'll be in touch. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing services. You may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Kevin Hern. Please go ahead, sir. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2020 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Biomedicines; and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We're also joined by Sara Smith and Lauren Durfy of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. The additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019, and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our 2020 results. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. On our guidance call in December 2019, we provided a framework for how we are thinking about the 2020 to 2025 period, noting our expectations to continue to deliver top-tier revenue growth and operating margin growing into the mid-to high 30s while continuing to increase R&D productivity. As we met with investors throughout 2020, it was evident that while there was good insight into management's expectations for the next few years, investors were increasingly focused on our ability to grow in the second-half of this coming decade. In the past two months, we have begin \u2013 we have begun to deliver answers to that question, with positive data for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab, each with a chance to significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet medical need. We believe these are three of the most important and exciting pipeline assets in our industry and provide meaningful support for Lilly's growth potential beyond 2025. Together with Verzenio data in early breast cancer last summer, we have significantly reinforced our growth prospects for the midterm and upgraded them for the long-term. While these readouts drive incredible momentum for our future, I am also pleased with the way that we delivered in a complex and challenging 2020. Our 2020 revenue enabled us to exceed our midterm revenue goal of 7% CAGR from the years 2015 to 2020. Turning to the quarter. Revenue grew an impressive 22% versus Q4 2019, or 20% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 24 percentage points despite continued pricing headwinds and demand pressure from the effects of COVID-19. Excluding bamlanivimab, revenue grew over 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continue to drive this volume and our revenue, now representing 55% of our base business. We continue to advance our productivity agenda in Q4 as the combination of strong revenue growth and modest operating expense growth drove significant margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 33% with and without COVID-19 therapies, an improvement of roughly 650 basis points versus Q4 2019. With continued margin expansion for the quarter and full-year, excluding the impacts of COVID-19 on our business in 2020, we would have achieved our midterm operating margin as a percent of revenue goal of 31%. We're proud to have delivered nearly 1,000 basis points of operating margin expansion since 2016. In addition to the strong business performance, we achieved multiple pipeline milestones since our Q3 earnings call. These include the positive results I noted for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab; the FDA granting emergency use authorizations for bamlanivimab and baricitinib to help patients with COVID-19; the submission of empagliflozin for heart failure in people with reduced injection fraction in the U.S., Europe and Japan, this is done in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim; and the submission of Verzenio in early breast cancer in the U.S. During Q4, we put our growing operating cash flow to work, announcing a 5% increase in the dividend for the third consecutive year, as well as continuing to pursue external innovation to augment future growth prospects with the acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. This acquisition adds a promising new modality for Lilly by creating a gene therapy program that will be anchored by Prevail's portfolio of clinical-stage and late-preclinical-stage gene therapies across Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Moving to Slides 5 and 6. You'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. In November, we announced that Arti Shaw, our Senior Vice President and Chief Information and Digital Officer, will retire in the first-half of this year after 27 years of service to Lilly. She's been an invaluable member of our Executive Committee and a leader who really models our values. In addition to leading the development of our digital information strategy, she has developed and mentored talent throughout the organization and demonstrated a deep care for the patients we aim to serve. I want to thank Arti for her many contributions to Lilly. And now, I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q4 and full-year results. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Slide 7 summarizes our non-GAAP financial performance in Q4 and 2020. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 22% this quarter compared to Q4 2019 and increased 7%, excluding bamlanivimab sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 130 basis points to 78.6%. Excluding the impact of bamlanivimab revenue and the related manufacturing costs, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79.9%, in line with Q4 2019 performance. Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 8% as reduced activity due to COVID-19 and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. R&D expenses increased 16%, driven by investment in COVID-19 therapies. Net of COVID-19 expenses, baseline R&D was relatively flat, and total operating expenses decreased over 5% compared to Q4 2019. Operating income increased 53% compared to Q4 2019 as revenue growth far outpaced expense growth, resulting in operating income as a percent of revenue of 33% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 therapies, operating income grew 34% in the quarter and the operating margin for our base business was 32.7% for Q4. Other income and expense was income of $477 million this quarter compared to income of $206 million in Q4 2019, driven by investment gains on public equities. As we noted in our Q3 earnings call, beginning in 2021, we will exclude the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures. We have posted a supplemental investor workbook for Q4 on that basis to enable you to have an apples-to-apples comparison as we move into 2021 and compare to 2020 non-GAAP performance. Our tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 180 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by net discrete tax items in both quarters. At the bottom line, net income increased 58%, while earnings per share increased 59%. Net of COVID-19 therapies, net income and earnings per share increased 43%. Moving to Slide 8. You can see these same non-GAAP measures for the full-year. In spite of the ongoing demand impact from the pandemic, we grew the top line at 10% or 6%, excluding bamlanivimab. Excluding COVID-19 therapies, our operating margin expanded by 300 basis points contributing to 30% EPS growth while continuing to invest behind our newer products and pipeline. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 20% in constant currency during Q4, driven by strong volume growth of 24%, partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest impact on revenue growth. U.S. revenue grew 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7%, excluding bamlanivimab. For the base business, volume growth of 11% was led by Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. Pricing was a 5% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter driven primarily by increased rates to maintain excellent access, partially offset by modest list price increases, largely for diabetes, and to a lesser extent, by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Taltz, which was driven by the access win at ESI. Segment mix was not a major driver of U.S. price performance in the fourth quarter as increased utilization in more highly rebated government segments was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment primarily for Trulicity and Humalog. Like Q4, the full impact of price was also a headwind of 5%, consistent with our 2020 expectations for a mid-single-digit net price decline in the U.S. While the midterm price trends are stable at present, given the increasing variability in payer mix, we expect to see quarterly variability in our U.S. price impact during the course of 2021. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 12% in constant currency driven by 9% volume growth and a favorable impact from price. Volume growth was led by Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the continued uptake of our key growth products across Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021. In Japan, revenue decreased 10% in constant currency driven primarily by decreased volume in post-patent expiry products, Cialis and Forteo, as well as by a modest pricing headwind due to the government-mandated price decreases that went into effect in March 2020. Japan is experiencing the impact of countercyclical patent expiries with Cialis, Strattera and Cymbalta LOEs impacting growth in 2020 and likely in 2021. In China, revenue grew 31% in constant currency driven by 57% volume growth driven by Tyvyt and partially offset by pricing concessions for the government-sponsored programs, which drove Tyvyt significant volume growth. We are excited about the momentum of our China oncology business, and we are looking forward to continued growth for Tyvyt and the launch uptake for Verzenio. We're also pleased that Trulicity and Olumiant were added to the NRDL as of January 2021. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 6% in constant currency driven by strong volume from Trulicity and Olumiant as well as three percentage points of growth coming from bamlanivimab sales to Canada. The same information for our full year revenue is at the bottom of the slide. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. These newer medicines delivered nearly 14 percentage points of growth this quarter, with bamlanivimab also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth in our key products was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as by reduced Trajenta royalties from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehring Ingelheim. This impact will sunset as we move into 2021. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.6 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 55% of our base revenue. Amidst the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we are encouraged by the performance of our key growth products in 2020. Trulicity grew 23%, adding nearly $1 billion last year to finish with over $5 billion in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in the U.S. and exiting 2020 with a nearly 47% share of total prescriptions amidst the reacceleration of growth for injectable GLP-1s. Taltz grew 31% to nearly $1.8 billion in revenue, outgrowing the U.S. market in both dermatology and rheumatology and entering 2021 with best-in-class access that provides a strong foundation for long-term growth. Jardiance crossed $1 billion in sales for Lilly's share revenue in 2020, ending the year at nearly 60% of total SGLT2 prescriptions in the U.S. and driving encouraging growth for the class, as we look forward to the regulatory action for FrEF and the readout for HFrEF this year. And Verzenio revenue grew nearly 60% in 2020 to over $900 million, significantly outgrowing the CDK 4/6 class growing six percentage points in total prescriptions while nearly doubling new-to-brand share of market on the heels of positive data readouts for overall survival in metastatic breast cancer in 2019 and early breast cancer in 2020. Our key growth products will continue to drive Lilly's strong growth outlook in 2021. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2020, we invested over $8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after-tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, we also announced a 15% dividend increase for the third consecutive year, demonstrating our confidence in the outlook for the Company. We are focused on utilizing the strong cash flow our through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. We will remain active in assessing bolt-on acquisitions or in-licensing, where we can create shareholder value and enhance our future growth prospects. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are affirming our non-GAAP guidance, and we've updated our GAAP guidance to reflect the impact of the Precision Biosciences, Merus and Asahi Kasei agreements, which with reported earnings per share for 2021, now expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.75. The impact of the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics will be updated on our next quarterly call and will only impact Lilly's GAAP guidance for 2021. There will be no change to our 2021 guidance for R&D expense or non-GAAP EPS as a result of this transaction. As we move into this New Year, and as we noted on our guidance call, we continue to experience suppressed demand due to the pandemic with several key therapeutic classes still below our pre-COVID baseline. We remain committed to ensuring we are doing our part to limit COVID-19 exposure for physicians, patients and our employees as cases surge in the U.S. and around the world. At present, most of our HCP interactions in the U.S. and many other major markets are virtual. While this may have a near-term impact on new-to-brand performance, we continue to believe our approach is the appropriate posture as we support health care professionals navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccination to enable a return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. In addition, our year-end 2020 inventory build was approximately a $120 million higher than Q4 2019, which was driven by 2019 having a lower-than-typical year-end stocking. This primarily impacts our diabetes products as well as Taltz and Alimta. We anticipate this inventory will burn off in Q1 2021 like normal historical patterns. As I noted on our guidance call, we also experienced significant COVID-19-related stocking benefit of roughly $250 million in Q1 2020. Given those divergent year-over-year inventory trends, we expect inventory patterns will have a negative impact on revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the first quarter of 2021. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our full year outlook for 2021 and have increased confidence in our mid- and long-term outlook given our recent high-quality pipeline readouts. So, now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Josh. We had an exciting start to 2021 as we read out positive results for gentimab in the Phase 2 Trailblazer Al study. Lilly has spent more than 30 years dedicated to finding solutions for Alzheimer's disease, and we are proud of our progress in advancing the science and providing hope for patients and their families suffering from this devastating disease. On Slide 14, you can see our key takeaways from this exciting trial. We are encouraged by the strong efficacy results, where in a relatively small study, we overcame the scale of the study with precision on patient enrollment and a very potent and effective plaque-clearing drug, becoming the first-ever disease modification study to hit statistical significance on its primary endpoint, with a slowing of decline by 32% relative to placebo as measured by the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale. ADAS is a clinical composite tool, combining two well-accepted measures in Alzheimer' s disease : ADAS-Cog 13 for cognition; and ADCS IADL, Instrumental Activities of Data Living, for function. While the study was not powered for assessing multiple endpoints, we're very encouraged by the consistent improvements observed on all pre-specified secondary endpoints for cognition and function compared to placebo though ganitumab did not reach statistical significance on every secondary endpoint. The consistency across time points and across statistical methods was very encouraging, particularly the disease progression model, which is becoming more accepted by the scientific community. In addition, we saw rapid and deep amyloid plaque clearance for ganitumab-treated patients who, on average, showed an 84 centiloid reduction of amyloid plaque at 76 weeks compared to a baseline of 108 centiloids. Since below 25 centiloids is a negative amyloid scan, this means that the average ganitumab-treated patient had a negative scan by the end of the study. Finally, the safety profile was consistent with observations from Phase 1. Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities or ARIA were observed, which is consistent with plaque-clearing antibodies. In the ganitumab treatment Group, ARIA E occurred in 27% of treated participants with an overall incidence of 6% of patients experiencing symptomatic ARIA E. We look forward to sharing the full results of Trailblazer AS at the ADPD 2021 virtual meeting on March 13, and we plan to have an investor call at 11 a.m. on March 15. We hope to reproduce and extend these exciting findings in our second pivotal donanemab trial, TRAILBLAZER ALS 2, an 18-month study which began enrolling patients last year. At present, the study is expected to complete enrollment later this year with nearly twice as many patients as the first TRAILBLAZER trial. We'll be engaging regulators to finalize the patient numbers and statistical plans for TRAILBLAZER 2, and we hope the exciting results from TRAILBLAZER 1 will increase patient interest and expedite enrollment. TRAILBLAZER 2 was designed last year prior to TRAILBLAZER 1 data. And while the design is similar, at that time, we incorporated a few differences, including CDR sum of the boxes was moved to the primary endpoint for this larger trial, while ADAS becomes a key secondary endpoint. We added a high tau group and we include a blood-based screening for enrollment using the P-tau biomarker. We look forward to sharing the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data and discussing next step for ganitumab with regulators. Moving to Slide 15. As we discussed in-depth on Tuesday's call, there've been a number of developments for our COVID-19 antibodies since our last earnings call, which I will highlight only briefly now. In November, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab as a treatment for COVID-19. We also submitted a request for EUA for bamlanivimab and antisemab together, which remain under review based on Phase 2 data from the BLAZE 1 trial. Since the EUA for bamlanivimab, we've shipped approximately 1 million doses. We will have over 1 million additional doses available through mid-2021 for use around the world. This week, the U.S. government committed to purchase 500,000 of those additional doses by the end of March. Should any EUA be granted for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, we expect to be able to supply in collaboration with Amgen up to 1 million doses of antisemab for administration with bamlanivimab together by mid-2021, with 250,000 doses available already in the first quarter this year. In just the past eight days, we've shared Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 2 prevention trial where bamlanivimab showed up to an 80% reduction of risk of COVID-19 for nursing home residents; Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 1 trial for eisemanab together with bamlanivimab, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization or death among high-risk COVID-19 patients, providing further support for the EUA request for their joint administration. Importantly, there were no COVID-19-related deaths in the antibody treatment arms from these two pivotal data sets. After having seen these results, Lilly has decided we will no longer conduct placebo-controlled studies in high-risk patients. Initial results from the ongoing BLAZE 4 Phase 2 trial provide viral load and PK/PD data, which demonstrated that lower doses, including bamlanivimab 700 milligrams and tiseramab 1,400 milligrams together, are similar to the 2,800 milligram doses of those antibodies administered together. We expanded the BLAZE 4 trial to also evaluate the administration of bamlanivimab AB with VER-7831 in collaboration with Vier and GSK, reinforcing our commitment to collaborate across the industry to treat current and future strains of COVID-19. And yesterday, we received authorization from the FDA to update preparation and administration instructions in response to feedback from frontline nurses and doctors to enable flexibility, which can reduce infusion times considerably. These updates can shorten infusion times to as little as 16 minutes. We're pleased with the potential impact our neutralizing antibodies can have, and we're working diligently to make them available to patients around the world. While the exciting progress with donanemab and the COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies has dominated Lilly's news in the past few weeks, we have continued to robustly advance the rest of our pipeline. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 27. Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the submissions Dave noted for Jardiance and Verzenio, the submission of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 in Japan, the initiation of a Phase 3 trial for empagliflozin in post-myocardial infarction patients. The movement of two pain assets into Phase 2 and the introduction of eight new Phase 1 assets, including our first clinical assets from two new modalities for Lilly : the siRNA molecule, ANGPTL3 from our collaboration with Dicerna and two gene therapy molecules from Prevail. In fact, we ended 2020 with a total of 17 new Phase 1 starts for the year, surpassing 2019's total of 16 first human doses, which was the highest number of new clinical starts for Lilly in a decade. Considering the significant challenges we faced in 2020, including temporarily stopping the initiation of new clinical studies, this is a remarkable achievement. It speaks to the resilience and determination of our R&D organization during challenging times. Moving to Slide 17. We show a final tally of how we finish 2020 versus the key events that we expected to occur. Since our guidance call in mid-December, we had submissions for selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan, Jardiance for heart failure for reduced ejection fraction in the United States and Verzenio for early breast cancer in the United States. The sea of blue checkmarks emphasizes the sheer quantity of pipeline advancements in 2020. However, my take away from the year past is that I'm delighted with the quality represented here, including potentially practice-changing data for type 2 diabetes, for hematologic tumors; for early breast cancer, the launch of a first-in-class RET inhibitor; as well as the emergency use authorizations for two medicines to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud of the significant achievements delivered in 2020. As we transition into 2021, I'd like to note that Josh Bilenker will be leaving his position as CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly to explore other interests and endeavors. We're grateful to Josh for his contributions to human health, both at Loxo and in his time with Lilly. We look forward to working with him in a consulting role. I'm very pleased to announce that Jacob Bernardin is assuming the CEO role, continuing to work alongside Nisha Nanda and David Heyman, ensuring leadership continuity in maintaining the strategy and operating model for Loxo Oncology at Lilly. Jake is a very highly talented leader, and this move allows him to continue to grow his responsibilities for the benefit of Lilly and Loxo. Moving to Slide 18. You can see the expected events for 2021, including the donanemab data and upcoming disclosure I previously mentioned. A number of other major readouts are expected this year, including the remainder of the tirzepatide Phase 3 program, where we are looking forward to building on the SURPASS 1 data we disclosed late last year. The Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's, in a trial similar in design to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several potential Phase 3 readouts in immunology; and the results of empagliflozin for HFrEF. Based on the recent high-quality pipeline data readouts for ganitumab, tirzepatide and LOXO-305, we entered 2021 optimistic by the impact these assets could have on patients. And we're focused on discovering and developing more new medicines to help patients. Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Well, thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we made in 2020. 2020 was a remarkable year as Lilly worked to fulfill its purpose in new and important ways. In addition to many contributions in the fight against the global pandemic, our business grew 10% in 2020 driven by strong volume growth from our key growth products launched since 2014. These products now account for more than half of our revenue for the first time. We continued our productivity journey, delivering nearly 300 basis points of operating margin expansion for our base business. We made significant progress on our innovation based strategy, with LOXO-305, tirzepatide and Verzenio early breast cancer readouts, delivering potential category-changing data. While January's donanemab top line success was a first in Alzheimer's. With EUAs for bamlanivimab and Olumiant to combat COVID-19 and bolt-on acquisitions of Dermira and Prevail book ending the year, the past 12 months have been an exceptional example of Lilly's success in leveraging internal and external innovation. We returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase, and we will have another meaningful dividend increase, which we announced in December, reflecting significant confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. All of this was accomplished against the headwind of a pandemic that is still raging. While the New Year does not free us from that near-term challenge, our long-term outlook has never been stronger. This concludes the prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Kevin for the Q&A. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many colors as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Tony, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple. Dan, on donanemab, I know you're planning on having regulatory discussions, but beyond expanding TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, is it reasonable to start a third study just to expand the safety database in the treatment experience? And then, Josh, you mentioned you're still seeing commercial impact from COVID. What would you say are the franchises that were mostly affected in 2020? And maybe just review your assumptions for normalization of some of those in 2021? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Geoff. Dan and Josh? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Geoff. Your question is whether we'd consider starting a third donanemab study to improve the safety database. No, we haven't considered that at present. Of course, as we said, our next step is to discuss the dataset we have with regulators. I think if we determine that we need more patience, the place to do that is a TRAILBLAZER-2 study. With respect to additional studies, I think, there could be opportunities to explore other populations and we're working through those possibilities right now, but we don't see that that necessary for this current population. Josh Smiley : Thanks, Geoff. I think when we look across our therapeutic areas, it's relatively consistent at this point that we're still not quite back to new to grand prescriptions in key areas, like immunology, pain and diabetes, although the diabetes numbers are looking stronger as we get here into January, but I think we're still seeing some suppressed demand. Physicians have, I think, in most markets has figured out how to see patients safely, and we're seeing nothing like what we saw back in April and May in the U.S. So, I think we just have to be cautious as we get into the first quarter and realize that the more complex treatments have some higher degree of variability against them and that includes starting new patients in areas like migraine. I think maintenance has been good throughout the pandemic. So, we do expect it, as we get through the first-half of this year, we'll see returned to fully normal levels. But I think it's fair to assume that in the first quarter, we'll still be, in many of the therapeutic areas a little bit below pre-COVID baselines in terms of new prescription starts. Geoff Meacham : Thanks, guys. Dave Ricks : Probably worth mentioning, Geoff, as well as Durham, because I think that one also, you see some suppression in new patients starts, not affecting our share anything but just the overall volume in the category. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Geoff, thanks for your question. Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple on donanemab. Investors are naturally wondering what the odds are that you could file for approval based on this first Phase 2 trial. To me, it seems highly unlikely given the size of the trial and the different subgroups, but just wondering, if you can share your latest thoughts on that? And then, Dan, your view of the need to continue to knock down what is sometimes described in the industry as toxic oligomers, which is what you might achieve by giving monoclonal chronically well after patients have already seen plaque normalization? Kevin Hern : Hi, Tim. We'll go to Dan for both of those. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Tim, so your first question is on the possibility of approval from a single study in Alzheimer's disease. Look, we - in general, we don't disclose our back and forth with FDA or other regulators. In this case, of course, we said that next steps are discussions with regulators. So clearly, that hasn't happened yet. Still, we understand the regulatory threshold traditionally has been adequate and well controlled trial that means more than one trial. In this case, we have a single adequate and well controlled trial in Alzheimer's disease. That, as I said, has not been the standard in this area. Of course, in other disease areas, notably in oncology, drugs can be approved from a single trial, usually, that's an accelerated approval. Usually, it's a group that's well defined by pathologic characteristics and biomarkers. Usually, there's dramatic pathologic response as well as clinical outcomes. Of course, that's also true in the case of this donanemab trial, but again, oncology is quite different than Alzheimer's disease. Your second question was on the question of toxic oligomers. It's long been unclear what is the toxic species of a beta, is it monomers? is it oligomers? Is it plaques? This antibody was designed to be exquisitely specific for amyloid plaques. We don't think it binds oligomers. And thereby, the efficacy \u2013 therefore, the efficacy we see here seems to imply that it's the plaques that are the toxic species rather than the like oligomers. However, we can't rule out that these two things are in equilibrium with each other and perhaps by clearing plaques, you remove oligomers as well. Kevin Hern : Thank you, Dan. And Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. Dan, in the prior studies, the IADRS DAS endpoint, the composite they use in donanemab, it didn't correlate very well with CDR sum of the boxes. But I did find it interesting that the most recent EXPEDITION3 trial for solanezumab did have high concordance between this new composite versus CDR sum of the boxes. I guess what I'm wondering is how should we be thinking about whether IADRS versus CDR sum of the boxes correlate closely or not? Or is it more a function of the more recent trials where CDR does, in fact, correlate very closely with IADRS? I'm thinking about that heading into your donanemab trial. The other one I had is, you have this tau antibody Phase 3 coming up this year. Maybe if you could remind us how's this tau-mab similar or different than some of the other ones because the progress on this target has not been quite good to date. And I saw your trial was pushed out a little bit as well, but it'd be very helpful to have any color? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Umer. Dan? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Great, thanks. Umer, for your first question on IADRS and its correlation with CDR. Look, when we think about an endpoint for any clinical trial, there's really two things that make an endpoint, a good endpoint. One is the statistical validation behind it. So in other words, is it reliable across different patients across different time points, across different trials, we put together a lot of data that support that. Second, is it meaningful for patients? And in this course - case, of course, we believe that that's inherently true. This is a composite of two things that are widely used, both thought to be important and meaningful ADAS-Cog and activities of daily living, obviously, activities of daily living inherently meaningful for patients. Now, why do we pick IADRS versus CDR to be the primary outcome of the study? That should be obvious, it's because we believe that IADRS would be more sensitive for measuring decline and therefore more sensitive for measuring a drug effect. That's based on all of that statistical validation data that we did. If ADAS and some of the boxes were perfectly well correlated then ADAS couldn't be better, couldn't be more powerful. And yet, I'm telling you that our assumption going into this trial was that it would be. So of course, different outcomes will have some correlation, but they won't be perfectly correlated. Based on what we saw in this trial, I think we haven't changed our thinking on outcomes, and we still think ADAS is a very valid and important outcome for Alzheimer's trials. Of course, that's a discussion to be had with regulators in the scientific community. With the zagotenemab, this is our anti-tau antibody. Just as donanemab was a different type of anti-amyloid beta based on its specificity for plaque, zagotenemab is a different kind of anti-tau antibody. It's highly specific for aggregated tau. Now, we think that's particularly important in the case of tau because there's a lot of soluble monomeric tau, and tau antibodies, like any other antibody, not much of it gets in the brain. So if you have a lot of monomer and a little bit of antibody, it could sop up all of your antibody and not have left to go after what we think is the more important species, aggregated tau. So, we'll have to wait and see. Of course, this is a field that is younger than anti-amyloid therapies, but we've taken a lot of things we learned from anti-amyloid, applied them to anti-tau, and we're quite looking forward to getting that data later this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Two questions. Investor expectations are quite high for donanemab in terms of sales potential. Lilly knows the full data for TRAILBLAZER and also the largely failed A-beta antibody landscape better than any other company. Based on what you've said, including that donanemab will be a driver in 25 3 30, it sounds as though you are fully comfortable with these multibillion-dollar expectations. Is that the conclusion you want to leave us with? Secondly, LOXO-305 looks like it could be best-in-class in oncology, and the safety looks favorable. Has Lilly rolled out non-oncology indications for 305, potentially MS, or perhaps for the sister BTK that you also have? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Dave for the first question and then Dan for the second one. Dave Ricks : Yes. Steve, I mean, we don't comment on analyst models or forecast, and we never would. So I can't directly answer your question. I guess what I can say is, we've invested in Alzheimer's for 30-plus years and spent a lot of money, as you point out, mostly failing, because there's a huge unmet medical need, and we believe that investment is justified based on the size of market. But we're not able to say today, donanemab is the answer, has a path to market, et cetera. We're not saying any of that. We're looking forward to the ADPD presentation coming up. The field will survey that data and make your own conclusions. And we need to talk to the FDA in a formal way about the path forward, and then we'll get to sales forecast later, but it's just not possible to answer a question like the one you asked. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Dan? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. The second question, more straightforward. LOXO-305 is a really uniquely specific reversal BTK inhibitor with great drug properties. That's why it's generating such remarkable data in oncology. You're asking a question that we thought a lot about, which is, could this also translate to being a highly differentiated molecule in immunology? I think in this case, we would not pursue the same molecule. I think this is down the road far enough in oncology. This will be an oncology molecule. But you raised the question of whether we'd be interested in generating a sister molecule, as you said, for immunology indications. That's certainly something we are considering. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Risinger : Congrats on the update. I have two questions, please. First, when do you expect to have clarity from the FDA on whether Lilly can file with the single small Phase 2 trial on donanemab? And then second, would Lilly consider changing the primary endpoint for TRAILBLAZER 2, which is currently CDR sum of boxes? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Dan? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. Thanks, Dave. Your first question is on the potential for filing, which I think we addressed before. We haven't had those discussions with the regulators. Of course, we move quickly to understand the data and schedule discussions with regulators around the world. As I said before, the regulatory standard is adequate and well-controlled trials, so two trials there. But certainly, we'll be interested to hear what regulators say. Kevin Hern : And the second one is, can you see the change over the primary endpoint? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Oh, yes, yes. Sorry, Dave. So the second question there is would we change the endpoint. Yes, of course, we can consider it. I think we look at the totality of data that we get from TRAILBLAZER 1, and that will inform our decisions, as well as conversations with regulators. But so far, we haven't seen anything that leads us to make that decision to change it. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Dave, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Daniel Ziment : This is Dan on for Terence. Just one from us. On LOXO-305 that you could discuss if you believe there's a path to filing for approval on the Phase 1/2 data? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Yes. So, we'll go to Anne White for that one. Anne White : Well, thanks, Terence, for the question. And we're obviously very excited about the data, both in CLL and CL. And so we do have ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential for accelerated approval. Obviously, in this place, the single-arm accelerated approvals for heme malignancies can be challenging. And so that really require -- was going to require further discussions with regulators. So we can't commit yet on submissions, timing or which indications, but be assured that we'll continue those conversations. And we couldn't be more excited about the data, as Dan mentioned. I think this molecule really started as a molecule focus on C41 mutations, and then as we saw the data and the performance in the broader populations remarkable. So, we'll keep that with conversations going, and we'll keep you posted. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Dan, thanks our next question. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Just one on donanemab and then just one other one. What are your thoughts on the high-tau population? I guess just based on what you saw from TRAILBLAZER, is there a strong rationale the drug could also work in some of these patients? And maybe just give us a sense of what percent of patients in TRAILBLAZER 2 we should expect to come from that group? Then my second question was just did make some changes to your 340B program reimbursement last year. Maybe just remind us the scope of that business in your portfolio. And have there been any either challenges or push backs with the implementation of that? And how we should be kind of thinking about 340B as we go through 2021? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Dan for the first question and then Josh on 340B. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Got it. Thank you, Chris, for the question about the high-tau population. A notable feature of the TRAILBLAZER trial is that we excluded patients who had too much tau in their brain. We believe that people who have the highest tau or it's spread throughout their brain are past the point of no return at least for an amyloid-directed therapy. Of course, as we fully analyze this data, and hopefully, even in time for the upcoming presentation, we'll understand what we're seeing in this current data set with respect to baseline tau levels predicting response to therapy, as we see that, that could lead us to be either more excited or less excited about including high-tau patients in TRAILBLAZER 2 study. And so that is something that is still very much open. As we see that data and understand it, we could think about changing the design there. In terms of the percent of patients that are impacted here, it sort of depends on how you cut it. If you start with all of the early Alzheimer's patients, plus -- mild AD plus MCI, that's about 4.5 million in the U.S. and double that in Europe and Japan combined. Many of those patients with amyloid negative. We've shown that before. So you take about one-third out for that. A small fraction of them will be amyloid positive but no tau at all. We didn't include those patients. And then a slightly larger fraction will be in that tau high group. So once you've excluded all those patients, we've said it's sort of 30% to 45% of that mild AD to MCI population that would meet these enrollment criteria in TRAILBLAZER 1. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Josh? Josh Smiley : Chris, on 340B, what we said is if you look over the last 10 years, the 340B segment has been among the fastest-growing, certainly across the industry but for our business as well, and it rivals the size of Medicaid in our U.S. business, so about 10% of the business now. Of course, the change we made was to go back to the legislated intent and to provide the discounts to the actual hospitals that provide care and to exclude contract pharmacy that have grown overtime And when we look at that business, it's probably about half of the businesses in these contracted pharmacy. So that's where we've made the change, to not provide the pricing there. Now, we do have a process where those contracted pharmacy can apply and we've said for insolence, as long as they can demonstrate that they're passing on the entire pricing that they're still eligible to participate. When we look at all that together, we knew that that's where we implemented in September. We knew there would be challenges, and we're seeing those challenges come, but I think in terms of patient impacts, we haven't seen much yet. So, we're seeing the fact that the discounts are being provided as per our change, but we don't think it's impacting patient care at this point. So everything we're seeing so far is consistent with the decision we made. We knew it would be a difficult decision to implement. We knew there would be some customer concerns. We knew there'd be legal challenges, but I think what we saw in the fourth quarter is consistent with the guidance we've given for 2021, which is that we would expect this portion of the 340b program to moderate in growth and provide a two to three point price tailwind for us in 2021. So I think we're on track for that at this point. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : So I just wanted to follow up on the one donanemab question, which is, Dan, can you just give us a little bit of color on the magnitude of blinding in this study, given the fact that patients obviously had almost absolute clearing of their amyloid plaques? And your confidence that the behavior of the placebo arm was consistent with the benefits of monitoring both tau and amyloid? And then the second question, just wanted to get a bit of an update on Verzenio and how Verzenio is tracking relative to your expectations. I think we're starting to see fits and starts, I guess, to some degree in terms of capturing incremental market share. But directionally, it seems positive. Just trying to get a sense of where Lilly thinks the uptake could go in metastatic disease? And then, how ultimately an approval of the adjuvant opportunity can impact sales or your market share going forward? Is that really the big driver? Or are you already seeing meaningful changes in metastatic market share? Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dan for the first question and Anne for the second. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thank you, Seamus, for those very thoughtful questions focused on that blinding of the study. We said before that TRAILBLAZER 1, we carried this study out with the quality that we typically use for regulatory pivotal studies, fully blinded, double-blinded study. You raised the possibility that there could be some unintentional unblinding as a result of amyloid clearance. We don't see that that's possible. Patients don't know or feel the clearance of amyloid in their brain directly. And investigators wouldn't have seen that the results of the PET scan themselves. The other potential in any Alzheimer's study for in over blinding is ARIA E because sometimes that is something that can cause a side effect. And we commented on the 6% of patients that had symptomatic ARIA E or so. I think that's certainly an important analysis, I think, in every study in Alzheimer's disease is to look at the drug effect with and without ARIA patients. And certainly, that's something that we hope to have complete and be able to share in March. And then finally, you asked about the behavior of the placebo arm. That's a great question. Really, when we saw this data that was the first thing I wanted to look at. Sometimes, you have small studies that look promising. It's because your placebo arm did worse than typical. And here, we said -- we've communicated a high level of confidence and encouragement based on the data. So that excludes that possibility. This placebo arm is not behaving aberrantly. That's not what's driving the effect. Again, we'll get into the details of that in March, but very, very pleased with the performance of the placebo arm here. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Anne? Anne White : Yes. Thanks for the question on Verzenio. So as you noted, 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically meaningful data for Verzenio. And then our shares, as a result, I think, continue to improve. While obviously, no CDK is yet approved in the EVC setting, we do think that this readout is particularly drew attention to the market class. So that said, we're really confident that the current trends are a result of our strong execution and our focus on NBC and then the -- particularly logistically significant OS data, which a key competitor in the space didn't have. As we compare Q4 '19 to Q4 '20, it was really a remarkable period of growth, as you said, for Verzenio. We saw TRx increase of 6% worldwide revenue growth of 57% and U.S. growth of 36%. And what we're hearing pretty repeatedly now from thought leaders is that they're seeing more and more that Verzenio is a differentiated agent. So obviously, we've shared that in MEMS, we feel we have higher CDK4 activity than -- versus others, differentiated continuous dosing, a monotherapy indication, and then obviously, the data that we saw in MONARCH 2 with the primary endocrine-resistant population. So I think all of that is really playing into the growth that we're seeing in the MVC market. And so, we'll expect to continue to see our growth -- our share market grow in that space. On the adjuvant side, as Dave and others mentioned, we did submit to the FDA in other areas at the end of last year. So we look forward to regulatory action later this year. This market size is significant in the fact that it's probably an additional 50% if you match our entry criteria, 50% increase to our current metastatic market in this high-risk adjuvant population. So that's significant. And what's also significant is the duration of treatment will very likely will be longer than a metastatic setting. So patients in the study are treated for 24 months. And right now, we're seeing patients stay on for months on average in the study. And many of the patients are still on study, so I think that number will continue to get longer. So that duration of treatment offers upside as well. But we're incredibly excited about the data. We're looking forward to bringing it to patients as soon as possible. Thanks for the question. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Seamus, thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions. First, on donanemab. On the issue of whether potentially donanemab could be submitted on the back of the Phase 2 data set that you have. Could you talk to your level of preparedness, particularly manufacturing, given the anticipated demand, but also to the P tau blood test that will potentially be used to define the patients? I'm just trying to understand where you at because there is a scenario by which you could be on the market sooner than perhaps that many may believe. And that's an open observation rather than reflecting any particularly personal view. And then second for Anne, could you talk to your BTK inhibitor 305? I know you're hiring medical liaisons already, which in hematology would suggest that you're optimistic about being able to file in the second half. From your understanding of the community nature of practice for CLL, given the very high tolerability of the drug and the strong efficacy even without a randomized trial, do you believe that this drug could take significant market share in the first BTK refractory or intolerant setting? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Andrew. We'll go to Dan for the first question and Anne for the second. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Andrew, you raised an excellent question on all the work that needs to be done to prepare for ganitumab. We actually initiated manufacturing preparedness before we had this data. So, this is something we do at Lilly. We always prepare for success. And so at the same time, that our manufacturing colleagues we're ramping up the anti-COVID antibodies, we asked them to also prepare for donanemab. So that is well underway, and I like what's going on, the progress we're making in manufacturing there. The diagnostic ecosystem also needs work. We started that both ramping up imaging and proceeding along with opportunities to bring the phospho-TAL blood test to more patients. That's both underway, again, started before we had this data and then, of course, is useful whether we're successful in coming to market or whether any other anti-amyloid drug comes to market. So, those are preparations that we're certainly taking. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Anne? Anne White : Yes. Thanks for the question on 305. So with the MSL population, it's important to remember, this arm of our company talks about the work that's going on in our -- across our portfolio. So this is not just related to 305, but we have other assets in the portfolio that may be heading in this space. So I wouldn't read too much into that, its normal operations to make sure that we're covering the portfolio. But obviously, they do get many questions about 305, the excitement that's out there in treating physicians. And importantly, we have a number of large Phase 3 trials that are starting as well. And as you know, that field force helps us identify high-quality rates to include in those programs. As far as CLL, obviously, the story there is incredibly exciting, and we do think that we have a real contender here. Particularly what we're interested in seeing is what has been seen in the past, certainly in the area of oncology, is that drugs that have a meaningful treatment effect on the same target pathway in patients who have relapsed tend to have sometimes an even more pronounced effect in that first-line setting. And so that's the upside here that is the potential for LOXO-305 is that first-line setting. So this year, we're actually planning to initiate, as you know, four global clinical studies, and three of them are in CLL. And obviously, two of them are in the BTK-pretreated patients, but one is in that really in a head-to-head setting and looking at head-to-head with ibrutinib in CLL. And obviously, this is a riskier study to do. We still feel very confident in the later-line setting, but we do have a belief that this molecule has a lot of potential in the first line, but hence, doing the trials. So obviously, as I said earlier, I can't comment on the regulatory likelihood. Those are ongoing conversations with the FDA. But regardless, we know that in this space, you need randomized clinical trials to really reach the patients that we wish to reach. And so that's -- the intention is to do those trials regardless. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Gregg Gilbert : On the COVID antibodies, Dave, I realize the latest data is quite fresh. But to the extent you're worried that there could be disconnect between the power of the data and the speed of uptake, is there anything that Lilly plans to do proactively to help move this along? I was intrigued by your comments on the prior call about some well-known hospitals being slower than other hospitals to get trained and ready. And I think that was even from before this latest data set. And then maybe for Josh, on that call, it sounded like the upper limit of $2 billion in your guidance is not necessarily set in stone if demand picks up. What's the practical limitation from a manufacturing standpoint as it relates to 2021 for the antibodies? Thanks. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Greg. And we'll go to Dave and then Josh. Dave Ricks : Okay. Yes, I'll comment. Dan, jump in. I mean we've -- since the beginning, we've been working with health care systems and physicians across the country to enable uptake of the antibodies. I guess it's, in some ways, a test of what happens when you don't have the normal commercial preparation and rollout. This was done via government channels under an EUA. And you see big differences in adoption rates, and I highlighted that it seems to be an inverse relationship between the places you think about advanced medicine and who's actually using this. One of those barriers clearly is conviction on the data. So, I'm really pleased with the data we announced in the last week, and I think it will, has to, increase conviction. And this is also -- there's a class effect here, too. And the fact that other antibodies are demonstrating promise in different settings adds to that data and I think will build confidence. So hopefully, that will change. There's two endorsements as well we hope will change : one is NIH, the other is the Infectious Disease Society. That said, there's tons of practical problems with at scale, infusing people with COVID-19 that have been completely worked out by numerous health systems and not worked out by many, many others. So we work quite a bit with state departments of health, et cetera, to share those practices. The best practice is chart flagging upon positive COVID-19 for at-risk patients, scheduling of appointments, dedicated facilities and staff for high-throughput antibody administration. Where that's happening, they're using a lot of material. And you can almost see actually a reduction in health care utilization. So we're actually running an experiment like that in New Mexico to actually prove it as well as with UnitedHealthcare. But I'm optimistic that we'll see the rate of use grow. It moved from about 20% in December to about double that now. We hope to see more progress going forward. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. Josh? Josh Smiley : Yes. Thanks, Greg. So what we've said for this year is guidance range for COVID antibodies is $1 billion to $2 billion. And of course, there's a lot of uncertainty in that. Although with what we've announced this morning on the call, the next agreement that we've signed with the U.S. government, it's probably high probability for $1 billion in the first quarter. That's just the purchase agreements that we already have. I think then to get past that, we have -- based on what we've already committed to in terms of manufacturing, probably about another 500,000 banliminivab doses available in the first half of the year in monotherapy and one million combo. So if we sold all of that and it's weighted heavily towards the U.S. or high-income countries, you could get above $2 billion. But we don't have an EUA with the U.S. government or any other government for the combo yet, and there's a lot to still play out, I think, in terms of vaccine and where these products can be utilized. If we get into the second half of the year, I think we can continue at the pace of production of million-plus doses available per quarter. I don't think the manufacturing piece is going to be as much of a barrier in the second half of the year if we stay on the course of vaccines and otherwise. So clearly, we could be above $2 billion for the year. But there's a lot of uncertainty, and we'll continue to monitor this number and provide updates as we have more agreements and more approvals. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Greg, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Congratulations on nice result, and I will continue on the tradition of asking one question about donanemab and one other. So on donanemab, I guess the bar that you can see from the FDA is one kind of well internally correlated trial and data support elsewhere. When you look at your program, it looks like the support you could provide is from removal of plaque from earlier trials. And I guess the question for you is, is the understanding that plaque removal is related to clinical benefits solid enough that you can use that as early approval based elsewhere? As for a non-donanemab question, I was going to go back to the 340B prices. The signs are increasing from data there might be an action on this issue before the end of 2021. I just want to kind of confirm that you have not assumed in your model got full impact for the entire year, but there is some sort of a partial year assumption or some sort of a partial impact that you've modeled in. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Dan and then Josh. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Ronny. It's a really good question that you're asking, which is how strong is the biomarker evidence here? And how can that be used to support regulatory decisions? I certainly think that's the direction the field is going. So in other words, when I look across all of the trials that have read out, again, this is the first plaque removing antibody that has had a positive study that hit its primary endpoint on the pre-specified statistical analysis. But even the other ones that didn't do that, when you look across the totality of evidence, you get a sense that there's a correlation between plaque removal in general and better cognitive performance. Here, we have probably the most significant plaque removal, the fastest, deepest plaque removal and a very meaningful clinical effect. So it's another point in this sort of dose response curve comparing amyloid plaque removal and cognitive changes across different trials. As that gets filled out further and further by additional experiments, I think amyloid plaque removal could someday become an important surrogate that could aid in the regulatory approval of drugs. Are we there today? I don't know. That's a question for regulators and for the field and something that we certainly have believed in for many years and will continue to take up. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Josh? Josh Smiley : Thanks, Ronny. As I mentioned earlier, we've guided to a two- to three-point price benefit in 2021 as a function of the 340B changes that we've made. We've been very clear on 340B that the reason for the change is that we're providing discounts that patients don't get. And we want the program needs to be reformed and cleaned up. So our assumption is in 2021, there will be changes. Whether -- and as I mentioned earlier, we also have mechanisms for contract pharmacies to get the discounts. We want to ensure that patients' insulin can get the pass-through discount. So we're assuming in our 2021 guidance that -- not a full financial benefit for the full year that there will be changes in modifications through the year, either as we try to work to ensure patients get the benefits of the discounts or if there are some administrative or legislative changes. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Ryan, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : So I also have a couple on the Alzheimer's theme. So one, just on the second Alzheimer's TRAILBLAZER 2, an issue we've seen with other CNS drugs, maybe not as much in Alzheimer's, but you get these positive results. Everyone gets excited. But then the second trial, you might have to manage more of the placebo response or improperly getting patients into the trial. So I'm just wondering if there's anything you're doing differently or more carefully to make sure for the second trial, you don't have patients who may be getting to the trial that otherwise shouldn't have? Or you say being to manage the placebo response, especially when the endpoint is a sort of clinical rating scale like a CDR sum of the boxes? And then my second questions are unrelated, but I guess partially related to Phase I. You mentioned that to more from where you terminated. I'm just wondering if you can share any details behind that decision. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Vamil. We'll go to Dan for both of those. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Vamil. It's a good point you raise. Of course, the placebo effect getting stronger in second trials is something that's been seen a lot in psychiatry and sometimes in pain studies. As you pointed out, I'm not sure it's such a strong effect in Alzheimer's disease. One thing that encourages us here and I think would allow us to see a strong signal even if there is some of that here, is -- maybe two things that encourage us. First is the magnitude of the effect that we're seeing overall, which, as I said, hits test given in the small trial and TRAILBLAZER 2 is much bigger. Second is the consistency across endpoints and time points and statistical methods. That gives us additional confidence as well. With respect to your second question, which was the tau more for the Alzheimer's program here with AC immune, we decided to pursue other promising tau from our candidates from AC immune's research platform. And therefore, we terminated this Phase 1 molecule. That's probably all we see right now. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Congrats on the progress. Dan, I guess I keep up the trend of Alzheimer's first. I guess just can you talk first around your longer-term view towards combination approaches with donanemab, particularly with an anti-tau inhibitor? And then you had good momentum across the pain portfolio in the quarter, and you've got a number of Phase 2 studies reading out with your epiregulin antibody. Any color there on your level of confidence? And if those data represent the key inputs regarding a get-go novocaine decision to Phase 3 or will you need additional Phase 2 work, longer safety data? And any commentary on how you see that coexisting with tanezumab if that's approved? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Carter. Dan? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Great. Carter, two good interesting questions. So on combination of purchase for Alzheimer's, I do think that's what the future holds. One of the really neat things about donanemab is that we just treat until amyloid plaques are removed. This is not a drug that we anticipate patients will be taking for the rest of their lives. Once they're clear of amyloid plaques, we stop treatment with this drug. We know from prior data that plaques don't come back. So you can imagine clearing a patient amyloid plaques and then treating them with another mechanism. That could be complementary, for example, in anti-tau drug or an immunomodulatory drug for Alzheimer's disease. So that's certainly something that we're considering and quite likely will pursue in the future. Thanks for noting momentum in the pain space. This is an area that is just so underserved by the pharmaceutical industry. I think there's a variety of reasons including regulatory thresholds, that have held back investment in an area that represents one of the greatest unmet medical needs. This is why patients -- number one reason why patients see doctors because they're in pain. And we know the drawbacks to current therapies. So we designed a platform pain study, which actually tests -- can test multiple molecules against multiple indications, And we can keep funneling molecules in and get results out. Depending on the strength of the efficacy here, that will inform next steps, but we're confident that this study is well designed to whether we have meaningful treatment effects or not. Of course, a holdback in pain, as I said before, is the regulatory bar, which is heavily weighted towards safety. And typically, that takes a large number of patients to discharge. Certainly, tanezumab, a perfect example of that with so many patients studied and a well-understood signal here on both efficacy and potential safety that needs to be resolved for the FDA. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Carter, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : Next question comes from Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Kerry Holford : Just a couple left from me, please. Firstly, on Prevail. I wonder if you can talk however more about their decision to acquire here. What strategy is this particular gene therapy platform versus others? And when might we see the data readout for the lead assets? And indeed, when might we see these potentially come to market? And then my second question is just more housekeeping in nature. You talked about a stocking benefit in Q4. I think it was $120 million. Could you detail which drugs that impacted primarily and whether you'd expect an unwind into the next quarter? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Kerry. It's Dan for the question on the Prevail acquisition and then Josh on the stocking question. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Kerry. We're really excited to have Prevail join Lilly. This is a really great gene therapy platform. Why we picked -- and a great team. Those are clearly two of the reasons why we picked Prevail. Also, I think there's just a natural synergy with the work we do at Lilly. We're extremely strong in neuroscience. We have a deep commitment to the space. And therefore, as we thought about what's our entry point into gene therapy, and we believe gene therapy will be an important treatment modality across therapeutic areas in the future, it made sense to enter gene therapy to begin our efforts here in neuroscience. Prevail has got two exciting programs in the clinic already. One is for Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations, and it\u2019s a GBA1 gene transfer. There's a lot of phase validity to that kind of approach, and we're looking forward to seeing data from that. The other similarly well-validated target here in frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. And that's also, I think, exciting. In terms of time lines to market, I think it's -- these programs are still very early. We're just in the first few patients here, and we'll have to see what the data showed in port of those time lines. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Josh? Josh Smiley : Thanks, Kerry. Yes. On inventory, what we've said is if you look at 2020 inventory in the U.S. inventory levels versus Q4 of 2019, we're $120 million higher. We're not concerned about that. 2019 was an unusually low year when you just look at days of stock. So the $120 million is in line with our expectations. But now as we look into Q1 2021, we do expect that $120 million will burn off. And it's across the portfolio. But as you would imagine, Trulicity is one of the products. We see a little bit extra in Taltz, and I think some of this is a function of the anticipation of increased volume for Taltz as a function of the ESI win that'll go in -- that went into effect on January 1. And we also see some on Alimta. We did see some purchasing patterns through the year in oncology. I think some of which was related to the pandemic and some delays in infused products, but those are probably the two biggest products where we see this on. So we would expect that $120 million to burn off in Q1 as it normally does. The other piece, though, that we want to make investors aware is, remember last year in Q1 we saw a $250 million build in inventory on a worldwide basis. This was as customers were stocking up in anticipation of the walk-downs that were coming with the pandemic. So I think if you put those two things together, the $250 million build last year and what we assumed to be $120 million burn this year, that's about $370 million of headwind when you just do year-over-year compare in growth, and that's -- could be up to six points or something. Again, it's not a concern to build into how we think about the year, but we do want to remind investors on that piece. Now -- and I think throughout the year, we're going to have some strange compares. Remember that we sold $871 million in bamlanivimab in Q4, we expect to have significant sales this year as well. So we'll tease all that as we go through. But on the underlying base business, you should expect to see an inventory negative growth effect in Q1. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Josh. Kerry, thanks for your question. And we'll go to Dave now for the close. Dave Ricks : Great. Thanks, Kevin, and to the team. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's call, and of course, your interest in Eli Lilly. 2020 was a strong year for the Company, and we anticipate an important year in 2021. A lot of questions related to Alzheimer's today. We're excited about that as well. But just a reminder, we have upcoming readouts for tirzepatide with sustained two, three and five over the coming weeks and months as well as a number of readouts this year in our immunology portfolio for baricitinib, lebrikizumab and mirikizumab in important indications. The Company has a broad and diversified set of opportunities ahead for additional innovation for patients. With our strong lineup of marketed products as well and this industry-leading pipeline, we believe we continue to be a compelling investment. So thanks for dialing in. Please follow-up with the IR team, if you have any additional questions and hope everyone has a great day and a great weekend. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Kevin Hern. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. And we'd also like to welcome Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly, who will be joining us today and moving forward to answer your questions about discovery and early-stage oncology efforts he's leading. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave -- sorry, we're also joined by Sara Smith and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.  During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Forms 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our results from the first quarter of 2021. David Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Lilly entered 2021 focused on expanding our reach to over 45 million patients by scaling our key growth brands around the world, continuing the advancement of our pipeline following a very successful 2020 and increasing productivity in the SG&A line while investing in research for sustainable long-term growth. We are pleased with the progress we've made on these objectives in our first quarter while also delivering hundreds of thousands of doses of our COVID-19 antibodies to patients to help the continued fight against COVID-19. As we unpack this quarter's results, we will attempt to give you a clear picture of the underlying trends in our core business.  We recognize this quarter was noisy, catching the increased consumer stock in from the Q1 2020 in our quarterly compare and increased COVID-19 therapy R&D spend in 2021. These items, coupled with the FX rate movement and a number of changes to U.S. government purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies throughout the quarter, make for a longer earnings call and press release. And we realize, for those keeping score on sell-side model accuracy, perhaps some disappointment. Nonetheless, underneath all of that is a strong and growing core business for Lilly and a significant number of positive, even compelling pipeline readouts in the quarter to support long-term growth across all of our core therapy areas. And we continue to expect top line growth and margin expansion to accelerate throughout this year.  This quarter, revenue grew 16% compared to Q1 2020 or 13% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume, which grew 17 percentage points. As previously highlighted in Q1 2020, we had roughly a $250 million COVID-19-related inventory build that is impacting the year-over-year comparison. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, our core business grew 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continued to drive volume and revenue growth and now represent 52% of our core business in Q1 2021.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 75.4% in Q1 and 78% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 27.5% for the quarter and 30.1% excluding the FX impact. While foreign exchange on international inventories sold has a modest effect on our Q1 -- on our results in 2019 and 2020, in the first quarter of 2021, we experienced over 250 basis point of negative impact on our gross margin and operating margin. Recall that is purely a noncash accounting item.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our Q4 earnings call, including the Phase III initiation of pirtobrutinib, formerly known as LOXO-305; and for additional obesity studies in tirzepatide's SURMOUNT program; the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as a treatment for COVID-19; positive Phase III results from tirzepatide's SURPASS-2, 3 and 5 trials in type 2 diabetes; and positive Phase III results for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and baricitinib in alopecia areata.  About a decade ago, Lilly made the decision to enter into and invest in immunology with the Phase III initiation of ixekizumab, now known as Taltz. Since then, we have added Olumiant in rheumatoid arthritis and several new indications with first or best-in-category data for Taltz and Olumiant in rheumatology and dermatology. This year, we see further expansion of our immunology strategy with the successful completion of Phase III studies of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The first IL-23p19 antibody medicine to demonstrate results in this setting.  We're also excited about lebrikizumab's potential to differentiate from Dupixent on itch, sleep and safety, primarily in conjunctivitis, in what is an increasingly large and growing class with meaningful unmet medical need. And we anticipate multiple Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab later this year in monotherapy and in combination with corticosteroids. We look forward to potentially reaching increasing numbers of patients in difficult-to-treat immunology conditions in the coming years.  We also entered into several business development deals, including the in-licensing of a RIPK1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals and the divestiture of QBREXZA, which along with lebrikizumab was part of the Dermira acquisition last year. We also distributed nearly $800 million in dividends this quarter with the share -- dividend per share increasing 15% versus last year.  Moving on to Slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. We announced plans to host a webinar to provide an overview of the company's commitment in the areas of environmental, social and governance for the investment community, for media and the general public on May 4, 2021. Additionally, we announced 2 planned retirements of long-tenured executives and several additions to our leadership team. I'd like to thank Myles O'Neill, President of Lilly Manufacturing; and Melissa Barnes, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, for their leadership and service to our company. We also extend a warm welcome to Edgardo Hernandez, who will be succeeding Myles; to Alonzo Weems, who will succeed Melissa; and to Diogo Rau, who will be joining Lilly next month as Chief Information and Digital Officer, succeeding Aarti Shah, whose retirement was announced last fall.  Finally, we announced the appointment of Anat Ashkenazi, our CFO. Anat has a deep experience, having been the CFO of every part of our value chain. For the last 4 years, Anat has a large -- has led a large portion of our finance organization with all of our divisional CFOs reporting to her as well as our accounting and financial reporting team, our corporate strategy group and our business transformation office. During this time, Anat worked closely with me, our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors to develop and implement our annual business and long-term strategic plans. I have no doubt that Anat will perform extremely well as CFO of Lilly and expect no changes in our priorities, our strategy or execution, given her significant involvement in all those areas.  Anat, welcome to our leadership team, and I'll turn the call over to you for our Q1 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 summarizes our non-GAAP financial performance in the first quarter. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 16% this quarter compared to Q1 of 2020 or 7% when excluding the COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit, representing a good momentum for our core business.  Last year, with the health and safety of our employees, patients and providers in mind, we shifted from in-person interactions to primarily virtual interactions and began 2021 with few sales reps in the field in the U.S. We feel good about our capabilities to work with providers virtually and are encouraged as we exited Q1 2021 with the majority of U.S. reps back in the field. As we navigate the early stages of the recovery, we're focused on operational excellence in both virtual and in-person environment and are pleased with the volume and share growth in key brands despite continued pandemic-related headwinds for several classes.  As we look at gross margin, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 490 basis points to 75.4%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78%, a decrease of 260 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable product mix driven largely by sales of COVID-19 antibodies and, to a lesser extent, by lower realized prices and revenue.  Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2% while R&D expenses increased 21%, driven primarily by $220 million of investments in COVID-19 therapies. Net of the COVID-19 expenses, R&D increased 5%, driven by continued investments in our late-stage pipeline.  Total operating expense growth was less than 3% compared to Q1 2020 when excluding the investments in COVID-19 therapies. Operating income increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 27.5% for the quarter, a decline of 250 basis points compared to prior year. This decline was driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Other income and expense was income of $35 million this quarter compared to expense of $73 million in Q1 of 2020, driven primarily by a benefit related to favorable European patent settlement for Alimta. As we noted previously, beginning in 2021, we are excluding the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures and have provided revised figures for 2020 in our investor workbook to enable year-over-year comparison on that same basis.  Our effective tax rate was 10.8%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods was reduced by net discrete tax benefits with the larger net discrete benefit reflected in the first quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 16%. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the first quarter of 2020 while revenue decreased slightly, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Adjusting for the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, the core business grew 5% in the U.S. These results were driven entirely by volume, led by Trulicity and Taltz, partially offset by a mid-single-digit price decline. Pricing was a 6% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, driven primarily by Taltz' improved access and corresponding higher contracted rates, partially offset by a modest list price increase. Excluding the impact of Taltz' win at ESI, we experienced low single-digit net price decline in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021. We noted on previous calls that we expect that Taltz would experience price headwind in Q1 beyond general rate pressure with the improved access position. There were two pieces of the ESI impact. The first existing patients already covered through medical exceptions were moved to the newly contracted rate, a onetime step-down in prices as we move through 2021. In addition, we were pleased with the update for new patients at ESI at the contracted rate and we expect that, that population will grow meaningfully over time.  There is always a near-term impact when we have a step -- a significant step-up in access. And this win nearly doubled our commercial access. We're encouraged by the volume growth we saw in the first quarter and believe Taltz will return to net sales growth in the second quarter, which should continue to accelerate as we move through the year as the volume growth from the major access upgrade outpaces the related pricing headwind.  Beyond Taltz, segment mix was not a major of U.S. price performance in the first quarter as increased utilization in the more highly rebated government segment was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment, primarily for our diabetes portfolio. While mid-term trends are stable at present, given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported net price changes. We also expect Taltz' price impact to moderate as we move through the year and overall, low to mid-single-digit total net price decline in the U.S. for the full year.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 15% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the impact of Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking, revenue grew 5% in constant currency despite lockdowns in a number of European countries and driven primarily -- entirely by volume growth for Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021. In Japan, revenue decreased 8% in constant currency, driven entirely by decreased volume for Cialis and Forteo. Net of the impact for those post-patent expiry products, Japan grew 5% in constant currency, driven by Verzenio, Jardiance in collaboration with BI and Olumiant.  In China, revenue grew 26% in constant currency, driven by 32% volume growth, primarily from Tyvyt and, to a lesser extent, our diabetes portfolio. We're excited about the momentum in China as our business has accelerated significantly the past 2 quarters. Tyvyt continues its strong growth, Trulicity and Olumiant are now in the NRDL and we look forward to launch uptake for Verzenio. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by continued erosion of Cialis.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. Despite the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit impacting year-over-year growth, these newer medicines delivered over 9 percentage point of growth this quarter with COVID antibodies also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as insulin, whose volume growth was also meaningfully impacted by the Q1 2020 stocking benefit.  Slide 10 highlights the contribution of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated approximately $3.1 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 52% of core business revenue. We are particularly encouraged by Trulicity's performance. 3 years ago, Trulicity was the #2 injectable GLP-1 in the U.S. market at roughly 40% share of market. Weekly scripts for the class were approximately 180,000 and a new weekly injectable entrant had just launched. Since that time, Trulicity has become the most prescribed GLP-1 in the U.S. with a 48% share of the injectable market in a class that is now twice the size at roughly 360,000 weekly scripts.  Trulicity continues to have the highest adherence of any diabetes medication, oral or injectable, with the additional dose of 3 and 4.5 milligram providing the potential for Trulicity to both extend the time on therapy for existing patients and compete for new patients as demonstrated by the new-to-brand share of market having increased more than 4 points since the launch of these additional doses in September 2020. As we start 2021, we are pleased with Trulicity's ability to outgrow the injectable class and establish all-time highs in new therapy starts as well as total market share.  We see meaningful opportunity for continued robust class growth for GLP-1s as they are still less than 1 in 10 diabetes scripts and have significant opportunity for further penetration in the first injectable space as well. With more positive readouts from the tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes this quarter, we remain focused on sustaining Trulicity's leadership position, accelerating class growth and providing continued innovation in the incretin space.  On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1, we invested nearly $3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditure and after-tax investments in R&D. In addition, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders via dividend. We are focused on utilizing our cash flow -- our strong cash flow to develop the next wave of new medicine through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed in-licensing of the RIP kinase 1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals. We will remain active in assessing the in-licensing opportunities as well as bolt-on acquisitions, where we believe we can create shareholders' value and enhance our future growth prospects.  Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 12. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We continue to support health care professionals, navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccinations to enable return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. Despite some therapeutic class still at or below pre-COVID baselines for new therapy starts and the highlighted inventory impact on year-over-year growth, we are confident in the performance of our core business. We are increasing our full year revenue outlook by $100 million to reflect the FX benefit realized on the top line in the first quarter. We are, however, narrowing the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue from approximately $1 billion to $2 billion to $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the year. Based on the rollout of the vaccine across major markets, current antibody utilization rate, existing U.S. government bamlanivimab supply and the transition to only supply bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in the U.S., we believe this update range contemplates a variety of potential scenarios. We recognize that situations across the globe can evolve quickly, and we'll plan to adapt as required moving forward. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.6 billion to $27.6 billion. Our outlook for gross margin percent remains unchanged with the impact of COVID-19 antibodies diluting our total gross margin percent by approximately 100 basis points.  For research and development, we're increasing our range from $6.5 billion to $7.7 billion to $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. This reflects an increase of $100 million in COVID-19 antibody expense to support the advancement of a third antibody, LY-1404, as we continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic and approximately $300 million on the core business, driven by investments in donanemab for the expansion of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-2 study and the initiation of the new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER Alzheimer's 3 in asymptomatic Alzheimer's patients. Our investments in donanemab is consistent with our R&D strategy to continue to bolster our pipeline to ensure long-term growth, and based on the strength of the data, invest meaningfully in innovative molecules that we believe have the potential to deliver practice change in data that could significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet need. We're increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $100 million to $200 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlement in Europe I noted earlier, while our GAAP range is now income of $150 million to $250 million, which reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first quarter. We are lowering our effective tax rate to approximately 13% to reflect higher discrete tax items in the first quarter and a lower base rate. We're lowering our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 31%. The decrease in operating margin is driven entirely by the decreased investments in Alzheimer's for donanemab. Our longer-term margin expansion remains unchanged as we expect continued operating margin expansion to mid- to high 30s. Our GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 26%.  Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share is now $7.80 to $8. The increase on the lower end of the range reflects the net benefit for the core business related to the changes to OID and tax rate as well as increased revenue, offset by increased R&D for investments in donanemab. The reduction in the upper end of the range reflects the narrow revenue range and increased R&D expense for COVID-19 therapies. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.03 to $7.23, which reflects an increase to acquire the IP R&D related to completed business development transactions, other specified items related primarily to asset impairments, COVID-19 inventory charges and acquisition and integration costs as well as the benefit from net gains on investments in equity securities. We're confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while also delivering operating margin expansion in mid-teens EPS growth.  As we move forward, I would encourage you to look at trends in our core business for the first half of the year, given the significant variability we saw across the period in 2020. As a reminder, revenue performance in the second quarter of 2020 was impacted by the reversal of largely all the $250 million COVID-related stocking benefit from Q1 of 2020 as well as an additional $250 million due to the significant decline in new patient prescription as health care utilization decreased and systems temporarily closed down in the face of a surging pandemic. As we look at underlying volume and share trends across our key products, we are confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first quarter only furthers our conviction in our mid-term and long-term outlook for continued revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. 2021 is clearly off to a very positive start for R&D at Lilly with strong pipeline progress already and more potential catalysts on the way. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting results from tirzepatide's first 4 top line readouts from the Phase III SURPASS program, including the strong results from SURPASS-2, the head-to-head trial with semaglutide 1 milligram. This program is aptly named as we've seen tirzepatide surpass our expectations through these initial readouts, displaying significantly greater hemoglobin A1C reduction, weight loss and percent of patients reaching normal glucose levels than any GLP-1 on the market. On Slide 13, you can see impressive performance in the efficacy estimate analysis in glycemic control for tirzepatide with each dose demonstrating superiority in each trial across a range of patient populations, comparators and background medications. The clear highlight is the impressive A1C reduction of the 5-milligram dose across each of these 3 -- each of these different patient populations while the higher doses provide additional glucose control up to and surpassing 2.5% A1C reductions.  Moving to Slide 14. You can see how tirzepatide performed across all 3 doses in terms of patients achieving HbA1c below 5.7%, the normal glycemic level seen in people without type 2 diabetes. We believe this is an exciting finding that may reset expectations for the impact diabetes medications could have for patients. Using the efficacy estimate analysis across SURPASS-1, 2 and 3, we see about half of the patients on the 15-milligram dose of tirzepatide achieve this remarkable level of Hba1c control.  In SURPASS-5, which focused on patients on background insulin glargine, 62% of patients on 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved this level of A1C compared to only 3% of patients in the placebo group. Remember, this is a patient population on background basal insulin with an average duration of diabetes of over 13 years. Achieving this level of glucose control in such a population is something that prior to GIP/GLP-1 agonists like tirzepatide, we did not even contemplate as possible.  On Slide 15, we show the efficacy estimate analysis for weight reduction across the 4 studies. Here again, we see levels of efficacy that previously were thought unobtainable with incretin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients. As we and others have discussed, studies like AWARD-11 and SUSTAIN FORTE have begun to show the limit of what fully hitting the GLP-1 mechanism can accomplish for weight loss and A1C. There appear to be diminishing returns as doses of GLP-1 alone fully saturate the GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism and a flattening of the dose response curve occurs.  And then you look at this slide, including importantly, SURPASS-2. And you can see quite clearly that there's something different going on here as the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist is beyond the flattening of the dose response curve of GLP-1 performance, which we believe evidences the power of adding in the GIP mechanisms. Highlights from these studies include the 15-milligram dose delivering 14% weight reduction in SURPASS-3, noting here weight gain of 3% on insulin degludec comparator, the 15-milligram dose nearly doubling the weight reduction of semaglutide 1-milligram in SURPASS-2 and strong performance from the 5 and 10-milligram doses with statistically superior weight loss, even as high as 11% on the 10-milligram dose versus placebo or active comparators.  We're encouraged that in these 40 and 52-week studies, we haven't yet seen the weight loss curves plateau on the higher doses. It's really exciting to think about how tirzepatide could potentially perform with the longer duration of treatment that we'll see in future studies. We had a lot of confidence in the efficacy data coming out of Phase II. But there was a lot we didn't yet know about safety and tolerability. Recall, for example, that the primary Phase II trial had only about 200 patients on therapy and patients were only on therapy for 26 weeks.  As we look at Slide 16, we've been pleased to see through these 4 SURPASS readouts that the overall safety profile was similar to the well-established GLP-1 receptor agonist class and the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related and mild to moderate in severity. We're particularly encouraged by the potential impact of the optimized dose escalation scheme, and accordingly, by the tolerability profile observed in the Phase III program, which improved greatly in comparison to Phase II, including the lower rates of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting that we've seen, consistent with what we saw in Phase III studies for other well-tolerated and highly used incretin therapies, including our own Trulicity. In addition, we're pleased with the discontinuation rates due to adverse events, which have ranged from 3% to 11% across doses in these studies.  Stepping back from the data a bit, we're excited about the safety and efficacy results across all doses, but perhaps especially so for the efficacy of the 5-milligram dose, which has performed well in each study, including showing superiority to semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2 on both A1C reduction and weight loss. I think these data show that the 5-milligram dose could be a great first incretin that can potentially deliver best-in-class efficacy with tolerability that is as good or better than other leading incretins. So we have the low maintenance dose of 5 milligrams that, if approved, could potentially be appropriate for many patients with physicians knowing they could have higher doses available as they continue management of disease.  Tirzepatide could provide patients with the opportunity to set treatment goals that might surpass what was previously thought possible in type 2 diabetes, both in terms of getting patients to normal glucose control, which has never been contemplated as a potential treatment goal, as well as for impressive weight loss with the highest dose of tirzepatide having roughly double the weight loss of semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2. Today, type 2 diabetes is largely a treat-to-fail disease.  With these results, tirzepatide, if approved, could potentially provide doctors options to enable early control of glucose and weight. This has the potential to translate to improved levels of end organ protection and a more meaningful reduction in disease complications that has yet been seen. We'll be testing this potential for tirzepatide in ongoing and planned studies in diabetes, obesity, heart failure and NASH. Accordingly, we've now initiated SURMOUNTs-2, 3 and 4 for tirzepatide in obesity and top line results from SURMOUNT-1 are expected next year.  Moving back to diabetes. The top line readout for SURPASS-4, which is in a high cardiovascular risk population and we believe will provide an important contribution to our CV safety assessment, is the gating trial for global submissions in type 2 diabetes. Completion of this trial has always been contingent on accruing a prespecified number of CV events. We've achieved the necessary events, which triggers bringing patients in for final treatment and safety visits before moving the trial to completion. Based on this update, we anticipate a top line readout by the middle of this year. We look forward to disclosing the results of SURPASS-1, 2, 3 and 5 at the ADA 2021 Virtual Meeting, which will include a 90-minute ADA symposium featuring these results the morning of June 29.  While we're excited with the progress of tirzepatide, we think innovation in the incretin space is not over. At ADA, we'll also be discussing preclinical and Phase I data for our glucagon/GLP/GIP triagonist, also known as GGG, which we're pleased to announce we'll be moving into Phase II later this quarter. We've previously commented that in this space, we have a high bar for progressing molecules in development, one that has been raised recently by tirzepatide. While it's still early, we're advancing GGG to Phase II based on our belief that it could exceed the benefits seen with tirzepatide. With our GGG molecule, we expect to see even more weight loss than what can be achieved with tirzepatide while preserving glucose-lowering efficacy. In addition, due to glucagon's direct action on the liver, we'd also hope to see benefits in NASH. Consequently, our ambitious Phase II program is designed to evaluate GGG for obesity, type 2 diabetes and NASH.  In addition to our next-generation incretins, we're also very excited by our novel weekly insulin, basal insulin-Fc. Thanks to Lilly's work on Trulicity, weekly incretin therapy is now the standard of care in the GLP-1 space. And together with tirzepatide, we hope incretin-based therapies will become the standard of care in the first injectable space for people with type 2 diabetes. For those people who need basal insulin therapy in addition to their incretin therapy, we'd like to make weekly insulin therapy possible, ultimately avoiding daily injections completely. We'll give an update at ADA on our novel weekly basal insulin. We plan to have an investor call in the morning of July 1 to discuss the data releases at ADA for tirzepatide, GGG and weekly basal insulin.  While the progress in our diabetes portfolio is compelling, Lilly has continued to advance the rest of our pipeline this quarter. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 23 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. In addition to the progress on tirzepatide I just discussed, major developments since our last earnings call include progress with donanemab on multiple fronts. In terms of data, we presented detailed results at AD/PD showing donanemab met its primary endpoint, significantly slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo on the integrated Alzheimer's disease rating scale, a composite measure of cognition and daily function in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. And data from secondary analyses showed donanemab consistently slowed cognitive and functional decline with ranges between 20% and 40% in all secondary endpoints with nominal statistical significance at multiple time points compared to placebo.  On the clinical front, as we discussed in detail on our call last month, we expanded TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 to be a Phase III study, and it's now enrolling quickly. And today, we're announcing that we will start a new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease. This trial is anticipated to begin enrollment later this year. Our goal here is to enroll patients who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have any clinical symptoms. The study will have development and progression of Alzheimer's disease symptoms as the primary endpoint. And we anticipate it will take approximately 3 years from completion of enrollment to reach a sufficient number of events. We'll be testing if a short course of donanemab treatment at the start of the trial can prevent progression in a substantial fraction of patients over the subsequent several years. These types of trials are extremely challenging to enroll and conduct. But here, we're buoyed by our expertise in biomarkers, including both PET scans and importantly, our plasma P-tau217 assay.  On the regulatory front, based on feedback from the FDA, we currently do not see a path forward for near-term submission and approval based on the first TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study alone. As you know, the unmet need in Alzheimer's disease is significant. So while we remain focused on speeding up enrollment and completion of our second pivotal study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, we are continuing to actively engage with the FDA and are fully exploring any opportunities for early submission.  Another highlight this quarter was the initiation of pirtobrutinib\u2019s Phase III program with study start in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as monotherapy. We're also proud of the continuation of our work against COVID-19, including a planned transition from bamlanivimab alone to the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for the treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S., accomplished by first gaining Emergency Use Authorization for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in February and then our request for revocation of the EUA for bamlanivimab alone, which FDA subsequently granted.  We also submitted bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for regulatory review in Europe. And we initiated the evaluation of bamlanivimab with VIR-7831 in collaboration with Vir and GSK as well as started trials with a new, potentially broadly neutralizing antibody, LY-1404, in collaboration with AbCellera in case new combinations are needed to fight variants. We announced top line Phase III results evaluating baricitinib on top of standard of care, which did not meet statistical significance on the primary endpoint for treatment of COVID-19 but did result in a significant reduction of death from any cause by 38% by day 28. And baricitinib received regulatory approval in conjunction with remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 in Japan. Our work on tirzepatide, donanemab and pirtobrutinib brings great potential for patients in the long term and is highly prioritized at Lilly. Our work on COVID-19 is another clear highlight, where we moved quickly to help address an unmet medical need in the midst of a pandemic. We're optimistic though that this need will wane in the coming years. Beyond these significant efforts, there's been progress across many other commercial stage and clinical stage assets.  Starting in oncology, we're pleased with the approval of selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer in Europe. We're also pleased that the results of monarchE, our adjuvant breast cancer study, are now submitted in Japan, along with Europe, China and the U.S. As you know, the primary endpoint for the study was invasive disease-free survival, which we hit at the interim analysis. As anticipated, this hazard ratio continues to strengthen over time as more events have accrued. Important secondary endpoints for the study include distant relapse-free survival and overall survival.  For the U.S. submission, the FDA has noted, and we agree, that the OS data are immature and thus unreliable as we shared in the JCO publication last year. FDA has, therefore, asked us to see an updated OS analysis during the review cycle to determine that OS is trending in favor of Verzenio. Given the robust distant relapse-free survival data, we're highly confident that the overall survival data will eventually reflect and reinforce the survival benefit. But it takes time for these events to accrue, especially in the adjuvant setting.  In immunology, we have positive Phase III readouts for baricitinib in alopecia areata, a disease with significant unmet medical need, and we look forward to regulatory submissions starting in the second half of this year. We also announced that the FDA extended the review period for baricitinib for atopic dermatitis by 3 months, another disease where we think JAK inhibition could potentially alleviate important unmet medical needs.  With mirikizumab, we reported positive Phase III results in ulcerative colitis in the 12-week induction study, hitting the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to seeing the maintenance data early next year. We also have updates to mirikizumab psoriasis program. While the OASIS program generated positive results with safety and efficacy similar to other IL-23p19s, we believe the psoriasis market is well served with highly effective treatment options, including Taltz.  Lilly's immunology strategy is to focus our new molecules and indications on areas where patients have significant unmet needs, not merely adding new options or leveraging commercial presence to create a space, where effective solutions like Taltz already exist for patients. Therefore, we will not pursue submission of mirikizumab in psoriasis, but instead, we'll focus our efforts on the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease indications, where unmet medical need is higher and where we believe the potential of the IL-23p19 mechanism to create a new standard of care is greater.  In addition to late-stage progress, our early-stage portfolio continues to advance with the introduction of 5 new Phase I assets and the attrition of 2. In addition to the progress we've made in just the first few months of the year, we anticipate important developments for the remainder of 2021, including the final readout for tirzepatide's Phase III type 2 diabetes program, SURPASS-4, noted earlier; Phase III results for Jardiance in HFpEF and for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis; regulatory actions for Jardiance for HFrEF, Verzenio in the adjuvant setting for ER-positive breast cancer, baricitinib for atopic dermatitis and tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain, where we previously noted our disappointment in the outcome of the Tanezumab Advisory Committee; the presentation of Phase I data for our oral SERD; the initiation of Phase I for a BCL-2 inhibitor and for KRAS G12C inhibitor; along with the filing of an IND for our next-generation RET inhibitor later this year as we announced at AACR; and the Phase II readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's disease.  We believe our continued pipeline success drives increasing visibility to meaningful long-term growth, and we look forward to continued progress across our portfolio in the coming quarters.  Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. David Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made to start the year. Amid several moving pieces in a challenging health care environment, we are excited by the momentum we are seeing. Our business grew 16% in the first quarter with the core business growing 7%, adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue and last year's COVID-19-related inventory stocking benefit. Our top line growth continues to be strong, driven strongly by volume across our key growth products, which account for more than half of our core business. Net of the significant impact from foreign exchange on international inventories sold, our operating margin was in line with our expectations as we continue to expect operating margin expansion throughout the year and further expansion in years to come. We made significant progress developing new medicines with many more data readouts expected this year. Advances for tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, Verzenio, mirikizumab, Retevmo and Olumiant, serve as a reminder of the breadth and depth of opportunities we have to sustain robust long-term growth. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders, being increased dividend, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business.  I want to say thank you to my Lilly teammates, whose commitment to excellence and dedication to our purpose of bringing innovative new medicines to patients is inspiring and drove these accomplishments amidst ongoing pandemic headwinds. While our people, health care providers and patients continue to face near-term challenges associated with COVID-19, our long-term outlook is as bright as ever.  This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. [Operator Instructions]. Toni, can you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session? And then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : I've just got two on the pipeline. I guess, first, on Verzenio, did I hear that you mentioned FDA is looking for updated OS data as part of the review? So I was just wondering when you'll have that data. And does that push out approval timelines in any meaningful way that we need to think about?  And then the second one I had was on tirzepatide. I guess, in light of the data you've seen from the SURPASS studies, does that -- has that changed how you think about what patient populations you'll focus on from a commercial standpoint or your go-to-market strategy? And I guess, as part of that, as we think about tirzepatide coming to market, do you expect substantial switches from Trulicity? Or is tirzepatide growth more about new patient starts and kind of expanding the market? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Anne for the Verzenio question and then Mike on tirzepatide. Anne White : Well, thanks, Chris, for the question on Verzenio. And so we will be delivering this data set to the FDA without delaying our standard review timing. We can't really comment on what the FDA will do with the data or the application, but these discussions are progressing as planned. Important to note, as the data matures, I think, as Dan said, given the strength of the DRFS hazard ratio, remember, it was a 0.687 haz ratio with a very strong p-value, we are highly confident that the OS will trend in favor of Verzenio. So really, what we believe we're discussing is when that will occur.  So obviously, as I said, we can't comment on the discussion with FDA, but we do look forward to working with them on bringing this medicine to patients. And maybe just a comment to reference how immature this data is. At the time of the interim analysis that we published in JCO late last year, there were 39 deaths in the abema arm and 37 in the control arm. So that makes it really challenging to interpret this data when there's over 5,000 patients in the study. Thanks for the question. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Mike? Michael Mason : Chris, thanks for your question. No, the tirzepatide results have not changed the way we want to position tirzepatide in the marketplace. Obviously very pleased with those results. We're also just really blessed to have both Trulicity and tirzepatide. Our goal will be to maximize our entire incretin portfolio. Trulicity has established a strong market position. And I think the best data to support that is just how we've been able to grow share of market in the face of Ozempic and Rybelsus. So it has a strong position in the marketplace and that will remain.  But now as we think about tirzepatide, the dual incretin mechanism, that GIP component is really a game changer. Dan went through the results, but we just haven't seen the ability to return to someone living with type 2 diabetes, whether they're late or early, someone with type 2 diabetes progression, back to normal A1C. In fact, we were able to get 50% to 60% people back, it\u2019s really incredible. Also weight loss at the highest dose, up to 14%. So when you just take a look at that and you take a look at the fact that 90% of people who live with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, they can really benefit from early treatment with type 2 diabetes.  So the real question is why would you want to put them on something else early on? And why would you want to wait for them to have those benefits? So we see tirzepatide has the potential to really transform the market, driving earlier use of incretin, in particular tirzepatide's dual mechanism, and really expand the incretin market. So I think tirzepatide will clearly win some new patients that would have went on to Trulicity. You have some people who were maybe not performing well or not -- or needed more efficacy that will go on to tirzepatide. But clearly, our focus will be to profoundly change and disrupt the type 2 diabetes marketplace by driving earlier use of incretins with tirzepatide. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Also have two pipeline ones. Just want to get your perspective on mirikizumab, the decision to focus on just IBD. You have good head-to-head data in psoriasis. So is it more of a commercial focus? Or is it that you want to focus more on Taltz and psoriasis? And then in Alzheimer's, you'll have zagotenemab data in the second half of this year. How are you thinking about the opportunity to combine potentially with donanemab? I wasn't sure what steps need to happen prior to thinking about that type of trial? And maybe from a regulatory perspective, what do you think would be a gating factor? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Geoff. We'll go to Ilya for the first question and then Dan for the question on Alzheimer's. Ilya Yuffa : Great. Geoff, thank you for the question. On mirikizumab, really as we see the greatest opportunity for unmet need for patients and we've said all along, we believe that mirikizumab has the greatest opportunity in GI, in IBD, in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We were pleased with the LUCENT-1 results. And so we're looking forward to seeing the maintenance data at the early part of next year.  In terms of psoriasis, as we take a look at the market and unmet need, we do continue to believe that Taltz is the gold standard and best in disease and believe that really is a market well served. And so the decision from a portfolio standpoint is to focus our efforts in places where we believe we can have the greatest unmet need. And GI is where we're focused for mirikizumab. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ilya. Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question on zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody. Before I come to combinations, maybe I'd just handicap this Phase II trial quickly. The pro here in favor of tau is clearly genetic validation and pathologic validation of the target. It's a great target for Alzheimer's disease. The cons here that we have to acknowledge is data from other companies' tau antibodies, which hasn't been particularly promising, and the difficulty in hitting the tau target in the brain. Now we have a differentiated antibody here that binds just aggregated tau, so perhaps there's reason to think we could get different results.  We're certainly eagerly awaiting those data in the second half of the year. And you're exactly right, if we see efficacy, combination would be an important consideration here. For sure, the general theme of combining an anti-amyloid drug with an anti-tau drug is a good one, particularly when you have a drug like donanemab, where you can completely clear amyloid plaques with a limited duration of therapy and then perhaps at that moment, intervene with an anti-tau drug. I do think that's the future. It's something we're actively considering, pending, of course, data on the tau antibody. Operator : Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Vamil Divan : Maybe one on Taltz. Maybe just a little more clarity or color on the pricing dynamics there. You mentioned you're kind of expecting a return to net sales growth in the second quarter and then accelerating. I'm just trying to think about it as we think about the full year dynamics. I don't know if you'll give product-level guidance. But how do you think about sort of the kind of full year comparison for 2021 to 2020? I assume you're still expecting growth for the year as a whole, but if you could just sort of clarify. And is that contract with ESI, I'm not sure, is that a full year contract? Or does that go beyond 1 year? I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of pricing dynamics in 2022 and 2023 and if we should expect another step-down. And then one quick follow-up just on the comments around TRAILBLAZER-3. I don't know if you can maybe just share a little more in terms of the number of patients you're looking to enroll in that trial, just so we can kind of get a sense of how long the enrollment might actually take. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Vamil. We'll go to Ilya for the question on Taltz and kind of the full year picture and then Dan on TRAILBLAZER-3. Ilya Yuffa : Sure. So on Taltz, first, let me just say we're really pleased about the progress we're making on Taltz and the growth that we're seeing with the step-up in access upgrades, ESI and beyond. And so as we take a look, even though that we've had some price impact in Q1, there are some elements there where we have a number of patients that were on medical exception that are now in the rebated contract that we have with ESI. Of course, we're also seeing an increase in overall volumes with ESI. What's encouraging is that we're not only seeing improvements in overall volume based off of switches, we're also seeing significant improvement in our new therapy starts.  And so we're, in dermatology, now the leading share in dermatology with over 19% share. And then in rheumatology, we're almost doubling our share from previous year. And so as we think about the year in terms of growth, we do believe we'll get to net sales growth in Q2, and we'll continue to accelerate that volume growth throughout the year. The contracting that we have for Taltz is -- goes beyond 1 year. And so we're encouraged about the volume growth of over 20% now, and we continue to see encouraging signs in the market. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ilya. Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Vamil, for the question on TRAILBLAZER-3 and our enrollment goals here. We probably don't get into too many details here, but we are, of course, expecting to -- this to be a large trial involving thousands of individuals, but yet we also set very ambitious enrollment goals. And while we don't have all the details planned out on how to achieve this, our goal is that we should be able to enroll this trial in about a year. That's pretty exciting to contemplate.  And Alzheimer's prevention trial is something that makes great sense, given the science and the biology here and what we know about the onset of Alzheimer's disease and its relation to years of having amyloid plaque in the brain. But there have been 2 major drawbacks that have not made these trials really very practical. First is finding the patients. That has gone from impossible before our introduction of amyloid PET scan to possible but really hard with amyloid PET scans as we experienced firsthand in the A4 trial to now something that's eminently feasible with our advent of the plasma tau -- phospho-tau217 assay. That's a huge advance that just unlocks this trial.  The second is if you think about this population, which is not experiencing symptoms, is a bit younger than an Alzheimer's population and introducing a therapy that is likely an infusion that they take for the rest of their lives, that's also a pretty significant hurdle. Again, we've, I think, abrogated that risk with donanemab in a limited treatment duration to give lasting plaque clearance, so excited about the TRAILBLAZER-3 trial. Operator : Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : So just, first off, a question for Dave. Dave, as you think about some of the various proposals that are in Congress currently, could you just give us your thoughts on the tax proposal? And maybe Anat could give a little bit of the potential implications for Lilly. And then separately, there's obviously a lot of controversy swelling on drug pricing. Just wanted to get your sense of the proposals that are out there currently and if the industry is poised to or ready to step up with a more reasonable proposal.  And then just the second question is on the JAK inhibitor space and Lilly's opportunity with lebrikizumab, particularly in atopic dermatitis. There's a bit of a compare and contrast. Only Lilly, I think, has both potential opportunities in this space. I think there's a lot of speculation that there is going to be a safety update from the FDA, if not a full safety panel. Hoping, Dan, that you could give us a little bit of your thoughts in that regard. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus, lots to unpack there. We'll start with Dave on some of the policy, maybe Anat on the tax piece of that. And then we'll go to Ilya on kind of what he sees from a JAK and lebrikizumab standpoint. David Ricks : Yes, Seamus. Look, on tax, this is a live discussion, of course, because the president has introduced a number of ideas on corporate tax changes. I guess we join a growing chorus of large companies who oppose, that means to raise revenue, especially when the stated policy goal of the infrastructure plan is to build back the economy. Of course, private money and corporate actions make up the vast majority of the investment that could or would occur. And taxing that seems like a bad idea, maybe the opposite idea from the bill itself.  Within the bill, maybe just a couple of general comments, and we can follow up if we need to. There's the nominal rate discussion, which, of course, when we say moving from 21% to 28% is moving toward the middle of the pack, is not true because, of course, in the U.S., we have state-level income tax. It would really put the U.S. at the highest developed economy in terms of corporate tax rate.  Additionally, we're the only major economy that taxes overseas earnings of its domiciled companies and changing the so-called GILTI tax, foreign minimum tax, really is punitive to our home companies in multiple ways and is something that would have a disproportionate effect on pharmaceutical companies. And so both these actions don't make a lot of sense to us and we oppose. We would favor things like looking at funding the IRS, so they can collect taxes from all the people that don't pay, including businesses and other items that could be pay-fors, we certainly support infrastructure in many ways.  On drug pricing, this has been pushed out a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised if we see HR 3 being debated soon, but as you may have read, apparently it won't be part of the second package from the White House. That's good because HR 3 and those concepts are really set to take a huge piece out of the industry, do nothing for patient out-of-pocket affordability and really derail the innovation machine that is the only reason we're escaping from the COVID-19 pandemic. So we will oppose that with every ounce of our being as pharma.  That said, we are all for changes to the system that make out-of-pocket costs go down for patients. There are a lot of ways to do this within the system that the industry is willing to put pay-fors on the table. This is much more around the contours of maybe what we saw with Senate Finance or the reported proposals made in the 11th hour of the last administration. We will table those ideas. We are tabling those ideas. And I think probably in the second half, you'll hear more about that.  We think there's a great opportunity to improve affordability and strengthen the health care system and really address health care inequities as well that occur because people who are of lower economic means, people of color, women are disproportionately affected by bad insurance design and bad benefit design. We can shore those up and make the health care system work better for everyone. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Ilya? Ilya Yuffa : Yes. Seamus, so thank you for the question. As you noted and what we said on the call is that we're quite excited about our progress in immunology as a whole. And if we think about the growth opportunities within immunology, atopic dermatitis is one catalyst for the company, both in what we believe in Olumiant's success but also lebrikizumab. In terms of the question around JAKs and FDA decision, I won't speculate on any decision the FDA may make. But it's safe to say that the delay across all JAKs in atopic dermatitis and other indications suggests that there's a broader review on JAK safety. We feel that Olumiant has a robust safety profile. And with dermatology being more safety conscious, we do believe that Olumiant has a very good prospect to compete in this space, especially after topical failure. And then lebrikizumab is one to watch out for, for the second half of the year. As we get more data, well, we feel like we can compete and differentiate versus Dupixent. And so long-term prospect and catalysts for growth are very good for having both mechanisms. And we also see catalyst for growth in alopecia areata, a very -- to be first in disease with Olumiant. And so we feel very good about our chances to not only compete but also to have significant growth and have meaningful outcomes for patients. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : So first question I had for you was on lebrikizumab. What do you think will differentiate your products from others that are already approved and those in development? And do you plan to pursue lebrikizumab for any other indications? And then second question is on LOXO-305 plus LOXO-338. What do you think your competitive advantages are here versus others that are trying to do the same thing? Kevin Hern : Great. Thanks, Louise. We'll go to Ilya for the first question and Jake for the second. Ilya Yuffa : Yes. Louise, thank you for the question about lebrikizumab. In terms of area differentiation, the focus for lebrikizumab is not only to look at the efficacy on skin but also one of the more impactful symptoms related to atopic dermatitis is itch. And so we believe we may have the opportunity to differentiate an itch, which also has impact on sleep. And we believe that lebrikizumab may have a better safety profile. So that's where we believe we can differentiate. And so we're excited to get the results for lebrikizumab at the back half of the year. In terms of new indications, I think it's early to take a look at any new indications. We're obviously evaluating opportunities to grow lebrikizumab. But our full focus right now is making sure we have success in atopic dermatitis. David Ricks : Ilya, just to jump in on top of that, of course, there will be a dosing convenience and dosing certainty benefit with lebri as well. Kevin Hern : Thanks. Jake? Jacob Van Naarden : Thanks for the question, Louise, about pirtobrutinib, LOXO-305 and LOXO-338, the BCL-2 inhibitor. I think as it relates to differentiation, I'd point out a few things. First off, obviously, as I think you and others know, pirtobrutinib itself is a differentiated BTK inhibitor that we believe affords certain advantages in combination. Obviously, we need to prove that clinically, but that's our hypothesis right now. So that sort of stands on its own. The LOXO-338 program, the BCL-2 inhibitor, we'll be putting into the clinic this year. And obviously, important that, that drug meets its human pharmacology goals so that we know that it itself is on track as a drug. Should that prove to be the case, which we expect it to, we will then look to combine these 2 agents.  I think when you look out at others that are combining BTK and BCL-2, the latter largely being venetoclax, I think what you see is a very fragmented landscape of asset ownership across companies, and as a result of that, some -- oftentimes perverse incentives about how to combine those drugs and where. We think it's important that if you have a new and differentiated BTK inhibitor like we believe we do with pirtobrutinib, we thought it was strategically important to own our own BCL-2 inhibitor. And so we think we'll be really the only player in the field who owns both agents outright. So that, to us, is a key differentiating feature downstream. But it's still a bunch of hoops we have to jump through to enable that combination. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : All right. I guess, first, for Dan or Mike, you guys posted details of the SUMMIT study of tirzepatide and HFpEF recently. And I think the design, size and time line were all surprising relative to expectations, so I guess getting to a readout much faster than some have had expected. Can you maybe just walk through some of those key design choices and the extent regulators have bought in, and also confirm that that single study would be sufficient for approval in that setting? And then also historically, Lilly has done a -- I think, done a better job of sort of franchise building in certain areas than some of its peers. Now with sort of mirikizumab derisking data, can you talk around how you're thinking about building around the GI portfolio? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Carter. We'll go to Mike for the question on tirzepatide and Ilya for the question on miri. Michael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question on the SUMMIT trial. We're bullish on the opportunity for tirzepatide in HFpEF. When you look at that, it's really a large unmet need with nearly 4 million people living with HFpEF heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalization in the U.S. When you look at it scientifically, you do see that there is a BC-related HFpEF phenotype that we believe that tirzepatide can play a large role in helping out. And so that's what really drove our investment in SUMMIT. And I think the team has done a nice job of coming up with a creative approach that will provide, I think, robust data for payers and clinicians to make that decision. So I think we're very confident in this -- in both our clinical trial design as well as the commercial opportunity. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. We'll go to Ilya for the next answer. Ilya Yuffa : Sure. Yes, Carter, listen, as you noted, in terms of building franchises across immunology, we've built up our scale in dermatology and excited about increasing number of treatments there, the same with rheumatology in the hope for finding lupus as well. And then in GI, mirikizumab will be our first entrant into GI with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. And then we do have a pretty robust pipeline in both Phase I and proof-of-concept studies, in particular, IL-2 conjugate that we're studying for ulcerative colitis as well. And we look forward to bringing out new treatments across all three of those areas in the coming years. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : A couple of questions. On Verzenio and the CDK class more broadly. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the U.S. in terms of rebating for this oral oncology category? My understanding is that the level of rebates may be stepping up. And I'm not sure which company or companies are driving that. Maybe it's Pfizer driving that as they try to hang on to market share. But what's the outlook for gross-to-net price trends in this category?  And then on Tyvyt, your PD-1 from Innovent, a Chinese company, you note that you'll file for approval in non-small cell lung in the U.S. this year. It's really hard for me to see how you gain any share with this product, given what would be a limited label and given payer and prescriber dynamics, where in things like Part B, you can't really compete on price. So what's realistic to expect with this product from a commercial perspective, not only U.S. but another Western markets like Europe? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Tim. We'll go to Anne White for both of those. Anne White : Well, thanks, Tim, for the question on Verzenio. So I think, as you're mentioning, it's an incredibly competitive market with the CDK4/6s. And so we and others continue to do what we need to do to make sure that patients get access to the right medicines. So we have obviously a strong strategy there. I can't comment on the specifics, but we do see competition. And really, what we're seeing -- I think you're seeing in Verzenio, what we're seeing is an incredibly nice trend growing in Q1.  As you saw, we had positive momentum with the U.S. strong share growth in March and we saw TRx of over 17% and NBRx of over 28%, so -- and this is despite, as you've noticed, a modest year-on-year TRx market decline. So I think what we're seeing is both from a payer strategy but also very much from a data strategy, we're seeing that Verzenio is growing its share nicely. And so I like how all of our different programs are coming together.  And obviously, the data in AZURE breast cancer reinforce the growing awareness that these medicines are different. But what really has been the focus for our execution has been capitalizing on positive OS data and making sure that people are aware of that and we're seeing more trial, more adoption as we go through that. So very pleased how all of our strategies with Verzenio are coming together.  On Tyvyt, yes, I mean, as you mentioned, it's a competitive space, obviously. And while I can't really comment on our commercial strategy prior to approval, you can be reassured that we're looking at ways to differentiate and really add value to this innovative class of medicines. So obviously, we know that there's certain commercial approaches we'll have to take to capture share as really a late entrant in the field, but we see opportunity here.  And obviously, this deal made sense with the partnership that we've had with Innovent and we're committed to the U.S. submission this year. And so more to come as we look to launch the product and share that strategy and how we intend to make an opportunity here. But as you said, I wouldn't assess this as a large opportunity for Lilly, but an opportunistic one that we think makes sense, it makes sense for patients globally and driving value for them. Kevin Hern : We'll move to the lightning round, so we can try to get everyone in. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : Yes, a question for Dan on Verzenio and the monarchE filing. As you outlined, the survival data is thankfully going to take a long time to mature. Is the answer that the FDA is looking for more about further maturation of progression-free survival or -- sorry, disease-free survival? Just given the historic precedence of the PENELOPE-B data with palbociclib, where you have separation that then coming together, isn't that really what the FDA wants, given if you're waiting for survival, you could be waiting for a very long time indeed? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Andrew. Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : I'll just take it quickly. No, Andrew, it's -- the focus here is on the overall survival. On the distant relapse-free survival, as we commented, the curves are not coming together, they're actually separating more. It's improving as we get more events. So I'm not aware of any concerns around that. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Stephen Scala : I think it was stated that the number of CV events in SURPASS-4 has been reached, if I heard that correctly. If that's correct, then it looks like the study is going to achieve its endpoint earlier than expected. So my question is, is that either confidence-building or concerning? Are you worried COVID-19 cardiovascular effects may have impacted the accrual of events? And if tirzepatide trends worse than insulin glargine, can you still file? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Mike on that. Michael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. No, we have no concerns. We will -- we have reached the number we needed to complete the trial. We're getting patients back in. We'll have that data, should start to see top line in May, and we'll release that information in -- before the end of the quarter. We're very, very excited about tirzepatide and very confident in its CV profile. I'm looking forward to seeing the SURPASS-4 data. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : I was just wondering on monarchE, if there's any possibility of an NCCN listing before the FDA action? And then can you give us an update on the Retevmo launch dynamics this quarter? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Terence. We'll go to Anne for the question on Verzenio and Retevmo. Anne White : Thanks for the question. So on monarchE and NCCN, I really can't comment for them. So obviously, we feel that this data is incredibly impactful. I think one of our thought leaders call it the most notable development in HER2-positive breast cancer in the last 2 decades, but we'll just have to wait and see what NCCN decides to do.  And then on Retevmo, the launch is going well. So we had a virtual launch in May, we finished 2020 with $37 million in sales, and we see positive momentum in Q1. So we've had a great engagement with customers. Unaided brand awareness is strong. So we're quite pleased. And this is an incredibly important medicine, as you know, in some patients, over an 80% response rate, so great response from the customers. I'm very enthusiastic about what we're seeing so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Aaron Gal : So we are seeing you adopting cost-conscious strategies on both Taltz and on mirikizumab. And I was kind of wondering, if you're going to look forward 5 years, where do you see immunology pricing then goes in terms of dollars for you? It's right now in the low to mid-30s, the way we can see it. 5 years here from now, are we going be in the mid-20s, under 20, 30-plus? Where do you see the band of pricing looking like? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Ilya for questions on immunology pricing trends. Ilya Yuffa : Yes. Ronny, thanks for the question on immunology. In terms of our focus, it's -- let's not -- conscious is more related to looking at opportunities for growth. We have a long runway for Taltz. And so we do believe that Taltz is kind of at the foundation of our immunology strategy. We have numerous head-to-head studies in real world evidence to suggest that Taltz is a best-in-disease treatment. And as part of our growth strategy looking at mirikizumab in GI, we do believe that within the next 5 to 10 years, we can, across multiple mechanisms in those 3 specialized groups, dermatology, rheumatology and GI, have significant growth and become a top-tier immunology company. In terms of pricing, I think it's -- they're all very competitive fields. And so our goal is to have great evidence and create access opportunities for patients that need these treatments. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Kerry Holford : Just on the COVID antibodies, I wonder if you can just discuss the disconnect between your lower 2021 term guidance and the higher associated R&D spend. And with that context, do you have a budget cap in mind for your ongoing COVID investments? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Kerry. We'll go to Anat for that. Anat Ashkenazi : Sure. Thanks, Kerry. Let me start with the budget. So we did increase our guidance for the COVID antibody investment from $300 million to $400 million to $400 million to $500 million. And the investments that we've announced this morning is really to address the growth in variants that we see globally and looking at additional antibodies that could address that. The lowering on the high end of the range, really it relates to the changes you've seen here in the U.S. government as well as what we see globally in terms of progression of the disease, but -- and this is one I know that is more challenging to forecast, given that there's not a lot of TRx data or data for you to look at, and we'll continue to update obviously with every quarter. David Ricks : And maybe just to add as a mindset thing, we didn't get into this because we were thinking about margins or business profile, it was to be useful during the pandemic, which is still going on, obviously, raging in other parts of the world. One other driver for the top line is that increasingly, we'll be selling our products into lower-priced markets or giving it away because that's where the disease is. And when the pandemic period ends, I think we can then take a different look at this enduring business, but we're not there yet. So we're making the investments we need to, to be useful and selling the product where it's needed at the price structure we had previously announced, which is heavily discounted in low GDP markets. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Dan, last we spoke in mid-March, it seems like you hadn't had a lot of regulatory discussions on donanemab, but it does feel like you've had them now. So I'm curious, the FDA feedback on the new endpoint, iADRS, as well as the Bayesian analysis. And also very briefly, on CD73, there's an interesting emerging signal in some of the other CD73s in pancreatic setting. I noticed you guys discontinued, would love to find out any additional color. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Umer. Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, sure. So FDA feedback is -- has been continuing, I should say. We had some and it continues to come. I think our view here is unchanged. We previously said that the FDA has concerns around iADRS because it combines cognition and function. And there's always a risk that you could have a positive signal on iADRS driven by cognition with no benefit on function or function going the other way or vice versa. And that wouldn't be acceptable for approval of a new drug. So that's the risk there. On the CD73 Phase I termination, I don't have additional comments. Operator : And last question comes from Gilbert with Truist Securities. Gregory Gilbert : Dan, on tanezumab, is the outlook any more hopeful than the optics of the AdCom vote? And can you comment on where pain fits into your overall R&D priority list at this point? Daniel Skovronsky : Sure. Gregg, thanks for the question. Pain is still a really important unmet medical need. Clearly, the regulatory bar is high here in terms of safety. And we saw that from the Tanezumab Advisory Committee meeting, which was a pretty decisive outcome there and one that we were disappointed in. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Gregg, thanks for your question. Back to Dave for the close. David Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate your participation in today's call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. 2021 has been -- has begun with good momentum in our underlying business. We remain focused on executing our innovation-based strategy to bring new medicines to patients and create value for all our stakeholders. As we continue to scale our diverse commercial portfolio, complemented by a pipeline of industry-leading opportunities, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment.  Thanks again for dialing in today. Please follow up with our IR team if you have any questions we have not addressed on today's call. Hope everyone has a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2021 earnings call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly. We are also joined by Lauren Zierke, [indiscernible] Sara Smith of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Forms 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.  As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our second quarter results. David Ricks : Thank you, Kevin. Q2 of last year was the peak of the pandemic\u2019s negative impact to our business. And one year later, I'm proud of the innovation and resilience displayed by my Lilly colleagues to deliver against our objectives in new ways, while also mobilizing to develop treatments to help combat COVID-19. Looking at Q2 2021, we were encouraged by the increasing worldwide vaccination rates, as well as the underlying environment in most of our major markets. COVID-19 related stocking in Q1 followed by destocking in Q2 of last year, complicates quarterly performance comparisons. Therefore, looking at revenue growth in the first half of 2021 better reflects the underlying trends in our business. On today's call, we will provide year-over-year comparisons for both Q2 and the first half of the year. In the first half of 2021, we delivered 11% growth in our core business. This excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, this was buoyed by strong volume driven growth across key brands in major geographies, including the U.S., Europe, and China.  Turning specifically to Q2, revenue grew 23% compared to Q2 2020, or 20% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 22 percentage points. As previously highlighted, in Q2 2020, we saw reversal of the $250 million pandemic related product stocking which occurred in Q1 2020. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue, the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking and the sale of Cialis in China, our core business grew 12% for the quarter, up from 7% in Q1 on the same basis.  We were pleased to see sequential top line growth in the core business this quarter, signaling that healthcare systems continue recovery from the pandemic and the strength of our underlying business. Key growth products continue to drive our revenue growth and represent 54% of our core business this quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.3% in Q2, or 79.7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding the FX impact, our gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 29.4%, representing an improvement of nearly 140 basis points. We were pleased to see operating margin expand year-over-year and we expect continued expansion in the second half of this year.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our earnings call in April, including receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation for donanemab and announcing our plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway; announcing positive Phase 3 results for tirzepatide SURPASS-4 trial with planned global submissions of the SURPASS program for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes by the end of 2021; obtaining approval for Jardiance in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim for HFrEF in Europe; and announcing positive Phase 3 results from the EMPEROR-Preserved trial for Jardiance in HFpEF, the first and only successful trial for this patient population; and initiating Phase 3 trial results for pirtobrutinib in mantle-cell lymphoma, tirzepatide in HFpEF and Verzenio in HR+ HER2+ early breast cancer, and now, prostate cancer.  We also continue to augment our pipeline with business development deals and announced the acquisition of Protomer Technologies. We welcome the Protomer team to Lilly and are excited to bring this technology to our diabetes pipeline. As we believe glucose sensing is one, maybe become the next generation for insulin treatment to improve the quality of life for people living with diabetes.  Lastly, on financials, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in the quarter and authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion in stock in addition to the $500 million authorization remaining under our 2018 share repurchase program. Moving on to slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including a May webcast, which highlighted our updated environmental, social and governance strategy and our sustainability efforts, as well as the launch of a new ESG website to serve as a comprehensive resource to provide increased transparency regarding the company's ESG goals and progress. Further, as part of our goal to become carbon-neutral in our own operations at our manufacturing plant in Kinsale, we recently inaugurated a new solar field, which is now the largest in Ireland. We also announced donations of COVID-19 therapies at no cost to low income and lower middle income countries, heavily impacted by the pandemic, and are proud of the impact we\u2019re having around the world, as we work to combat COVID-19. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slides 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the second quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 23% this quarter compared to Q2 2020 or 12% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for our core business. Given the COVID-19 related stocking, and destocking seen between Q1 and Q2 of 2020, our first half performance of 11% revenue growth or 8% in constant currency, excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue is a more accurate reflection of underlying performance, and the sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue growth better represent the strength in our core business. Sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 for core business, increase in vaccination rates in many major markets, and the majority of our sales reps now being back in the field, suggests the recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We're particularly pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio in the U.S. grew nearly 6 percentage points in share total prescription exiting June, compared to the prior year. While Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance increased their leading market share in the same period, while class growth accelerated. These products along with other key growth products represented 54% of revenue in the core business this quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 30 basis points to 79.3% in Q2. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven primarily by unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, gross margin as a percent of revenue grew 60 points this quarter. Total operating expenses grew 18% this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16% as the base period in Q2 2020 included a meaningful reduction in direct-to-consumer marketing and customer-facing expenses as health care system closed. R&D expenses increased 20% driven by investment in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including pirtobrutinib, tirzepatide, donanemab and lebrikizumab. In Q2, we also invested approximately $85 million in COVID therapy\u2019s R&D bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $300 million year-to-date. Net of COVID-19 R&D investment, operating expense growth was 18% compared to Q2 of 2020, and 10% for the first half of the year. Operating income increased 29% compared to Q2 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 29.4% for the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by revenue growth outpacing expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the second half of 2021. Other income and expense was income of $5 million this quarter, compared to expense of $57 million in Q2 2020, driven by income from European patent settlements for Alimta.  Our effective tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 350 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods were reduced by net discrete tax benefit, with the lower net discreet tax benefit reflected in the second quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 29% in Q2, and 22% year-to-date or 30% and 24%, respectively, in constant currency.  On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. And we are encouraged by the growth seen across most of our major geographies. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue, and the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking, the core business grew 8% in the U.S., up from 5% in Q1 on that same basis. These results were driven entirely by volume laid by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Pricing was a 1% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, with increased rebates to maintain excellent access and higher growth in lower net price segments, largely offset by lower utilization into 340B segment, changes for estimates to rebates and discounts, and to a lesser extent, modest list price increases. The year-to-date price decline of 3% in the U.S. is in line with our net price expectations for the full-year.  Specific to Taltz in the U.S., performance for the quarter was in line with the expectation we described on the Q1 earnings call. And we were pleased to see a return to net sales growth this quarter, as volume gains more than offset price decline. Taltz Q2 performance benefited from a favorable change to prior estimates for rebates and discounts, and COVID-19 related inventory destocking last year. Excluding these items, Taltz still returned to double-digit growth in the second quarter. We believe the net price decline for Taltz in the first half of 2021 represents the underlying full price trend, and that continued volume growth will drive net sales acceleration in the second half of the year. While midterm price trends are currently stable, given increasing variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business.  Moving to Europe, revenue grew 27% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the negative impact of Q2 2020 COVID-19 related customer buying patterns, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven entirely by volume growth, primarily for Trulicity, Taltz, Alimta and Olumiant. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth in the second half of this year, excluding the expected impact from the loss of exclusivity for Alimta. In Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency, driven primarily by the launches of Olumiant and Emgality. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by the decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. But our key growth products grew 21% in Q2 in Japan, and represented approximately 50% of the business there. Recent surges of COVID-19 cases continue to negatively impact recovery in Japan. So, we currently expect improved revenue growth in the second half of the year, based on the uptake of newer products. In China, revenue grew 106% in constant currency, primarily driven by the divestiture of Cialis and the launches of Tyvyt and Trulicity. Excluding the impact from the Cialis transaction, our revenue in China grew 35% in constant currency. We are excited about the continued momentum in China as sales of new medicines have accelerated significantly in the past 3 quarters. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 5% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate volume effect on revenue for our June year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies, except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 17 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.5 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 54% of our core business revenue in Q2. We're encouraged by the strength of our key products in Q2, collectively up over 34% compared to the same period last year. Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance, all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are now tracking above pre-COVID-19 new-to-brand prescription baseline in the U.S. across all major therapeutic areas, with the exception of oncology and the CGRP antibody class, which we expect will continue to recover in the second half of the year. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first half of 2021, we invested $5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of after-tax investments in R&D, business development and capital investments. In addition, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchase. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we will continue to fund our growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline and seek external innovation to augment our future prospects as well as returning capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. While the COVID-19 pandemic is still impacting countries around the world, the pace of recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectations in Q2. New-to-brand scripts in most of the classes in which we compete with are tracking above pre-COVID baseline in the U.S. and health care systems in most major markets are largely returning to normal as we enter the second half of 2021. We are increasing our full year revenue outlook for the core business by $200 million to reflect the strong performance and favorable impact from foreign exchange. We are, however, lowering the top end of the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue by $400 million and confirming the bottom end of that range. Moving forward, we expect COVID-19 antibody revenues to be less of a factor, as demonstrated by Q2 revenue declining to $150 million from $810 million in Q1. As variants are growing, we recognize the situations across the globe can evolve quickly and we plan to adapt as required. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged at approximately 79%. On a reported basis, we've lowered guidance for gross margin percent to approximately 75% to reflect the impact of COVID-19 antibodies' excess inventory charge due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from the U.S. and international government and near-term expiry of COVID-19 antibodies inventory. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. However, investment in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches could push us towards the top end of our guidance range for both R&D and SG&A. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance is now expected to be approximately 30%, driven by lower COVID-19 antibody revenue. However, it remains approximately 31%, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Our GAAP operating margin is now expected to be approximately 24%. We are increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $0 to $100 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlements in Europe I noted earlier. And our GAAP range is now income of $375 million to $475 million, which also reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, our expected tax rate remains unchanged. And on a reported basis, we've lowered our expected tax rate to approximately 12%. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share remains unchanged at $7.80 to $8, while GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.73 to $6.93, primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 antibody inventory charge, the impact of equity investment gains and the Alimta patent settlements in Europe. We are confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while delivering mid-teens EPS growth. As we look at the underlying volume and share trends across our key growth products, we're confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first half of this year strengthen our conviction in our midterm and long-term outlook for continued top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. 2021 has clearly been a productive year for R&D at Lilly, with continued strong progress in our pipeline and more potential catalysts on the way. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting several updates for our late-stage pipeline. I'll start with donanemab. In Q2, the first amyloid lung agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway based on plaque lowering, which we believe reflects a shift in policy and sets a new path for Alzheimer's drug approval in the U.S. Lilly has long been an advocate for using biomarkers for amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles to identify patients for treatment and to monitor their response to therapy. We were pleased to see the FDA's conclusion that improvements in brain pathology are appropriate surrogates for clinical efficacy of Alzheimer's drugs. Based on data we've seen to date, we believe donanemab clears plaque faster and deeper than previously seen with other therapies and achieved complete plaque clearance in a majority of patients in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ after only limited duration of dosing. On the basis of the clinical evidence for donanemab, we were pleased to have received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. At the Alzheimer's Association International Conference last week, we shared additional important analyses from donanemab TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Briefly, I'll highlight several findings. First, we shared detailed exploratory statistical analyses comparing a variety of methods beyond MMRM and DPM, as summarized on Slide 14. We are pleased to see that these new analyses showed consistency of effects on primary and secondary outcomes across all statistical methods. Notably, all of the new analyses conducted showed good separation of treatment from placebo with statistical significance achieved for most endpoints at nearly all relevant time points measured. The robustness of the treatment efficacy across analytical methods increases our confidence in the potential clinical benefit of donanemab. While all statistical methods evaluated showed similar results, we note that the Bayesian disease progression model, DPM, closely reflected the raw observed data with the smallest standard error of any method. These results reinforced our hypothesis that DPM is a preferred analytical method for Alzheimer's trials. Additionally, we shared new data showing a relationship of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline, as shown on Slide 15. To our knowledge, this is the first time such results have been available. When we initially reported the results of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we commented that at a group level, patients treated with donanemab showed both statistically better plaque reduction and statistically better slowing of cognitive decline at 18 months. But patient-level correlations between degree of plaque reduction and magnitude of slowing or cognitive decline were not significant. Now using a more sophisticated PK iADRS exploratory analysis that uses all of the available time course data, we showed a highly significant relationship between degree of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline with P less than 0.001.  The Conrado model, shown here, was published in 2014 and is the result of efforts from the Coalition Against Major Diseases, CAMD, which collected placebo data from 15 randomized trials, including almost 4,500 participants. We introduced a treatment arm and incorporated percent amyloid plaque removal into this model to generate these results. And we believe this is important support for the use of amyloid plaque reduction as a surrogate for clinical efficacy. Notably, these data suggests that full clearance of amyloid plaque is required for highest efficacy as model results predict that patients achieving a 100% clearance of amyloid plaque could have more than 40% slowing of disease progression. Moving to Slide 16. We show an exploratory analysis looking at the effect of donanemab's plaque clearance on development of tau pathology. Tau pathology is an exciting biomarker since measures of Alzheimer's disease tau, unlike measures of amyloid plaque, have been correlated with clinical measures of cognitive and functional decline as noted here. Importantly, we have previously shown that donanemab-treated patients had slower accumulation of regional brain tau pathology than placebo-treated patients. This is an important finding because the amount of brain tau pathology is an excellent predictor of subsequent cognitive decline, a finding we observed with solanezumab in EXPEDITION3 and reproduced once again in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Now we've extended these results to show that the donanemab-treated patients who achieved complete clearance of amyloid plaque by 6 months had the most marked slowing of tau spread with nearly complete abrogation of progression in the frontal lobe. This reinforces our hypothesis that both deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance are required for optimal drug efficacy. With this new data we presented last week, we have now linked degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of clinical benefit as well as degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of benefit on brain tau pathology, which is itself linked to clinical benefit. As displayed on Slide 17, we have just recently obtained data with our plasma tau biomarker, phospho-tau217. These new data demonstrate that amyloid plaque clearance with donanemab also resulted in reversal of the typical increases of phosphorylated tau seen in the blood with decreases from baseline of more than 24% and a change from the untreated arm with a P-value of less than 0.0001. This highly significant effect was seen as early as 3 months following initiation of treatment and could reflect a combination of less tau spread in the brain as well as less neuronal damage, which could account for tau leakage into the periphery. You can see on the right side of the slide that the effect on plasma tau is also correlated to a degree of plaque reduction with nearly every patient on treatment who achieved substantial plaque clearance showing flat or declining plasma phospho-tau. We are delighted to see the potential utility of P-tau217 not just for diagnosing disease, but also for monitoring treatment efficacy. We believe this could be another important contribution to the Alzheimer's field. Finally, on Slide 18, the significant relationship between plasma P-tau217 reduction and the slowing of cognitive decline is shown. This additional biomarker for efficacy links the donanemab mechanism of amyloid plaque clearance with positive effects on both clinical outcomes and tau pathology. These data suggest that patients who achieved a 30% decrease in P-tau217 from baseline showed more than 40% slowing of disease progression. The 3 main findings I just discussed. One, the consistency of clinical benefit across statistical methods; two, the correlation of plaque lowering the clinical benefit, the patients who achieved the greatest plaque clearance. I mean, the greatest opportunity for benefit; and three, the correlation between achieving complete plaque clearance and beneficial effects on tau pathology seen in the brain and measured in the periphery, which themselves are predictors for clinical benefit, strongly support the efficacy of donanemab and give us confidence that the remarkable levels of amyloid plaque clearance achieved by donanemab could translate into a meaningful breakthrough for patients. Moving to Slide 19. Accordingly, we've announced that we plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway before the end of this year based on data from completed studies, supplemented by additional safety data from the ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. We remain focused on enrolling TRAILBLAZER-2 with the aim to replicate the positive results of TRAILBLAZER-1. Replication is important to overcome skepticism in the field. We hope that TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 will generate important confirmatory data for patients, physicians and payers and help us understand how to make sure the right patient gets the right duration of therapy at the right stage of disease. We are pleased to announce today that we have closed screening for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, with an adequate number of subjects now in the trial's screening process to fully enroll the study. Given that conducting and processing and imaging studies used during screening take several weeks to complete, we expect that the final subject to complete screening procedures and receive their first dose of donanemab or placebo by the end of the third quarter and the study will complete 18 months later. Given this progress in enrollment, we are confident that we will achieve the number and duration of drug exposures needed to appropriately characterize the safety profile of donanemab, allowing for regulatory submission by the end of this year. Discussions with the FDA are consistent with our prior statement supporting a submission before the end of 2021. I also want to provide a few comments on how we believe the national coverage determination opened for monoclonal antibody therapies targeting amyloid by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may impact Lilly and donanemab. We believe this NCD is a clear opportunity to focus treatment on the patients most likely to benefit from amyloid plaque-reducing therapies. This would align with our goals, which have long been to use advanced diagnostic tools to identify the right patients that can benefit the most from amyloid-reducing therapies. We're particularly encouraged that our progress with the plasma P-tau217 assay could open up broader access to diagnostic tools. Still, despite the advances in diagnostics and the promise of donanemab, we acknowledge the current skepticism in the national discussion. And we hope that each drug will be evaluated by payers and prescribers based on its own data. This could be particularly important given the data I've shared today, which suggests that the degree of donanemab's amyloid plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit. In summary, we look forward to submitting donanemab to the FDA later this year with the potential to bring a robust amyloid plaque-clearing agent with limited treatment duration to market for early symptomatic Alzheimer's patients in 2022 with potential replicated clinical efficacy results expected in 2023. Transitioning now to Verzenio. On the last earnings call, we commented that FDA had asked to see an overall survival trend in favor of Verzenio in the monarchE trial in adjuvant breast cancer. We also noted that the OS data set is quite immature in the overall population, which makes interpretation challenging. We have now provided to the FDA additional data from the monarchE study, and we were encouraged to see continued strengthening of the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival, IDFS, as well as consistent benefit in the key secondary endpoint of distant recurrence-free survival, DRFS. Of note, with this continued follow-up, we can now confirm this benefit extends beyond the 2-year Verzenio treatment period. We look forward to disclosing this new analysis at a medical meeting this fall. Our discussions with the FDA have focused on the prespecified subpopulation of patients with high Ki-67 index, a marker of increased cell proliferation. These patients have more aggressive disease and higher risk of relapse and thus are more mature for overall survival analysis. This group, which makes up approximately half of the monarchE population, are demonstrating an overall survival trend that favors the treatment arm. And based on FDA feedback, we expect an initial approval in adjuvant breast cancer in this population before the end of the year, in line with the current review cycle. Importantly, since the IDFS and DRFS hazard ratios favoring Verzenio are similar in patients with high and low Ki-67 index, we expect that the OS trend first seen in the Ki-67 high population will, in time, be replicated in the broader study population. We hope to expand the label to the entire enrolled population in the future once we see more overall survival events in the broader population. To date, regulators outside the U.S. have not raised the same questions on overall survival. Finally, moving to Olumiant. We shared in July that the FDA will not meet the PDUFA action date for the supplemental new drug application for atopic dermatitis. This delay is related to the FDA's ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. Patient safety is critical to Lilly, and we continue to further evaluate baricitinib's safety profile with ongoing randomized and observational safety studies. We're confident that the efficacy and safety data for baricitinib support a favorable benefit risk profile for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA during the remainder of the review process. We do not have additional information on timing or specific action date from the FDA, but we see potential for regulatory action for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. later this year. We're committed to bringing Olumiant to market in the U.S. to help meet the needs for people living with atopic dermatitis. Slide 20 shows select pipeline opportunities as of July 30, and Slide 21 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several additional major developments since our last earnings call and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In May, we shared the positive results for tirzepatide in SURPASS-4 and announced that the SURPASS program met regulatory submission requirements for evaluating cardiovascular risk and confirmed our intention to submit a registration package for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes to global regulatory authorities by the end of 2021. At ADA in June, tirzepatide was a large focus as we shared detailed data for the first 4 studies from the tirzepatide SURPASS program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These results support our belief that tirzepatide may represent a substantial improvement in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, with early and unsurpassed improvements in A1c and body weight reduction across doses. We remain on track for global regulatory submissions before the end of this year. We are also excited about tirzepatide's opportunity across multiple indications, including cardiovascular outcomes, obesity, NASH and heart failure. In Q2, we initiated SUMMIT, our planned Phase 3 study for tirzepatide in heart failure. In July, we achieved an important milestone with Jardiance as the first and only medicine to achieve a primary endpoint for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. The EMPEROR-Preserved Phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint and demonstrated significant risk reduction with Jardiance for the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in adults with HFpEF. This is a significant breakthrough for patients, and we're proud of what we've achieved here in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim. We look forward to presenting detailed results from this study at the European Society of Cardiology on August 27, and we expect to submit this indication to regulators later this year. We also received approval in the EU for Jardiance HFrEF in June and expect regulatory action in the U.S. and Japan later this year for this indication. Additionally, we've advanced our GGG tri-agonist into Phase 2 for diabetes based on the promising data we shared at ADA, which supports the potential for differentiated efficacy from tirzepatide with respect to body weight while maintaining glycemic control. We also started 2 Phase 1 studies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Lastly, we removed one of our oral GIP/GLP Phase 1 molecules from our pipeline. In oncology, we also continue to make important progress. Starting with Verzenio, we've initiated 2 Phase 3 studies since our last update. As planned, we've initiated an adjuvant study for HR+ HER2 breast cancer. And we are announcing today that a result -- as a result of a favorable blinded interim analysis for our Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we've also initiated the Phase 3 portion of this adaptive study. This action was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC. The IDMC reviewed interim efficacy and safety data and concluded that the results met the prespecified expansion criteria based on radiographic progression-free survival and recommended advancing the study to the registrational Phase 3 stage. While Lilly remains blinded to the study, we are obviously very pleased with this development and have already begun dosing patients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial. Given that the expansion of Phase 3 includes the cohort of patients who are in the Phase 2 study, these data remain blinded and we will not be disclosing these at medical meeting. On the development front in oncology, we also made progress with pirtobrutinib and our oral SERD. We've initiated the Phase 3 study for pirtobrutinib in relapsed/refractory MCL monotherapy, executing on our commitment to a robust Phase 3 program for this molecule. Regarding oral SERD, we announced our plans to begin a Phase 3 study later in 2021 based on the Phase 1 results we shared at ASCO in June that showed an efficacy and safety profile in line with our expectations. In addition, we've now achieved the first human dose for our next-generation KRAS G12C inhibitor. Lastly, in oncology, we announced that the FDA has accepted our submission of sintilimab for non-small cell lung cancer. This submission is an encouraging start for our collaborative efforts with Innovent to make sintilimab available in countries beyond China. In neurodegeneration, in addition to donanemab news I just shared, we anticipate a Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab later this year and note that our GBA1 gene therapy asset from PREVAIL started a Phase 2 study in type 2 Gaucher disease. For immunology, we do not have additional significant updates in Q2 but we're looking forward to the Phase 3 readouts of lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis and baricitinib for lupus later this year. We also submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in Japan. Lastly, we're moving our COVID-19 antibody therapy, LY-CoV1404, now known as bebtelovimab, into Phase 2 to address viral variants as part of our ongoing commitment to help combat COVID-19, if needed. To recap, Q2 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, and we're excited about a number of further readouts and important milestones coming later this year, reflecting continued advances on behalf of patients suffering from disease. Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. David Ricks : Thanks a lot, Dan. I appreciate that. Before we go to the Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during this quarter. We've seen strength in our core business in the first half of this year and increased momentum in Q2. This is driven by strong volume-driven growth across key brands in most major geographies. We're pleased to see sequential top line growth this quarter as well as year-over-year margin expansion. We made significant progress developing new medicines, and Q2 was another positive quarter for our pipeline as we announced plans to submit tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes and donanemab in Alzheimer's disease later this year as well as an approval for Jardiance in HFrEF, and as Dan outlined, positive results in HFpEF. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and completed $500 million in share repurchases, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are quite confident in our long-term prospects. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to share -- also like to share that we will hold a live investor meeting this December to highlight our R&D pipeline and progress for investors. We will also provide our initial 2022 guidance at this meeting. Given the limited physical space available, this event will have an accompanying webcast. We're hopeful that we can host this event in person, but are watching the evolution of the pandemic closely and we'll adjust accordingly to a virtual event, if needed. Our IR team will be in contact in the coming weeks to issue invitations and provide more logistical details on this meeting. Now let me turn it over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Lois, can you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Maybe, Dan, I was just wondering if you could elaborate at all on your comments regarding your discussions with the FDA on donanemab. It sounds like they're consistent with your expectations. But any more color you can provide if they've actually signed off fully on your plans to file the BLA? And then how much additional safety data would they want to see from the ongoing TRAILBLAZER-2 study? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Terence. Dan? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Sure, Terence. Thanks for that question on donanemab and FDA and safety. In June, when we got the Breakthrough Therapy designation and we announced our expectations to file the BLA by the end of the year, that was based on our current understanding of the situation. Since then, things have progressed and I would say I'm even more confident now than I was then, that we should have an adequate package to support a complete submission by the end of this year. That includes, of course, our confidence that we have enough safety data to support a full evaluation of the benefit/risk of this drug. I think given limited duration of dosing, that helps as well as given the near completion now of enrollment in TRAILBLAZER-2. So it's our intent then to use combined safety data from the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies as well as an early look at safety data from that ongoing Phase 3 study to support the package. Now of course, with any ongoing study, there's always risk. We don't know what that safety data is going to show. If it's consistent with safety data we've collected prior to the study, then I think we should also be confident that, that would support a positive benefit/risk assessment and put us on track to launch next year, as we said. Operator : And the next question is from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Aaron Gal : Two, the first one, I'll stay with donanemab. You have kind of suggested in your comments there that there will be a good chance to use some of the biomarkers that you are developing in the early commercial use of donanemab. Can you talk a little bit about what markets do you expect to have proved by when? And how do you see the -- essentially, the entire patient passage through the use of donanemab going forward? And how does it differ from other amyloid \u03b2? And second, Basaglar seems to have a bit of a price drop this quarter. Can you discuss a little bit what you're seeing here? What are you expecting with the approval of the first interchangeable biosimilars? Any impact there? And as we go forward, how should we think about that franchise? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Dan for the questions on donanemab, and then Mike Mason for the questions on Basaglar. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Ronny, for the question on biomarkers and their commercial use. Of course, this has been an area of great progress and great investment by Lilly. We continue to put a lot of emphasis here. I think objectively, you wouldn't have had the progress that we're seeing now in Alzheimer's disease had it not been for the ability to select patients for treatment and follow their response treatment with biomarkers. We don't see that as a research-only application. That should be available, those kinds of tools, to patients in the clinical -- who are being clinically treated for Alzheimer's disease in the future. So the status of the tools right now is both of the PET agents, the tau PET imaging with Tauvid that we use in the amyloid PET imaging with Amyvid. Those are both, of course, FDA approved and availability is somewhat limited right now, particularly for Tauvid, but could quickly be scaled with the launch of donanemab in the future. The third agent, which is probably the one that will be the most accessible to patients is the phospho-tau217 assay. Just as we continue to work on that assay, we're more and more impressed with its performance, its ability to identify patients, and even as I've shown today, track their progression. So this could be an answer for patients in the near term. We'll work hard to make that available. The bar is often lower for in vitro diagnostics and in vivo diagnostics. And I think there's good potential there. You asked about the patient flow once all these things are approved and available and presumably, that happens around the time that donanemab launched but not before. I think it would make sense and fit with medical practice if screening starts with some sort of simple cognitive exams by a physician to assess the patient's eligibility to early Alzheimer's, then they would move on to probably a blood-based test like phospho-tau217. If that's positive, that could either be a basis for treatment depending on if data support that or that could triage patients to PET scans for further evaluation. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Now to Mike for the questions around Basaglar Q2 performance and Semglee interchangeability. Michael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question on Basaglar. The performance that you're seeing in the second quarter of '21 has primarily been driven by pricing pressure and volume pressure in the Medicaid segment for Basaglar. Let me give you a little bit of color on how the Medicaid segment works. There's really 2 different types of states : those that have one signal unified preferred drug list across managed Medicaid and fee-for-service; and then others that have 2 different kind of unique preferred drug list across fee-for-service and a different one for managed Medicaid. What we've seen with Basaglar is when states decide to transition from having 2 preferred drug list to a unified preferred drug list, the economics for the state tends to favor the long-standing brands like Lantus. And so at that point, you see if we have one estate for -- in a managed Medicaid, you'll see the transition back to Lantus. So that's what you've seen driving our Q2 performance. Also in the managed Medicaid space, we have seen some pricing pressure there from Semglee that has required us to put more rebates on the -- in order to preserve volume for that. Now let me turn to kind of -- well, first of all, before turning to Semglee, know that the trends for Basaglar are fully baked into our guidance for the remaining part of 2021. Now let me turn to Semglee. First of all, understand that Semglee has gained interchangeability just with Lantus, not with Basaglar. So we don't anticipate any immediate impact on Basaglar. If you look at Semglee performance to date, they've captured about 2% share of market on the TRx and about 1% of new treatment starts. And the vast majority of that has come from Medicare Part A, which is hospitals, and the Medicaid segment. If you look at the price point for Semglee, it's currently at $99 per vial and about $150 for 5 pack of pens.  And with the move to interchangeability, we really support any actions that help patients with diabetes have more affordable out-of-pocket experience, which is why anyone, regardless of insurance status, is eligible to buy their monthly prescription of Lilly insulin for $35 or less through our Insulin Value Program. The Insulin Value Program has helped lower the average out-of-pocket costs for a monthly prescription of Lilly insulin, which also requires -- or includes multiple vials or insulin pen packs to $28.05 in the face of raising health insurance deductibles. So it's great that people living with diabetes has access to many options to lower their out-of-pocket costs. Thanks for the question. Operator : And the next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : A couple of questions. Just your general thoughts on subcu dosing with antibodies to plaque, does that offer meaningful differentiation? At a high level, the benefits would seem quite obvious to being able to dose a drug at home. But some argue that it falls outside of a Medicare Part B framework, so maybe docs would be more inclined to stick with an infusion. And I believe you originally did not pursue subcu because you're worried you wouldn't get enough drug across the blood brain barrier. Roche has shown us that they can achieve that. So can we expect Lilly might also pursue a subcu? And would this require a formal Phase 3 study looking at plaque reduction as a primary endpoint? And then last quick question, why wouldn't something like P-tau217 become a separate meaningful revenue stream in its own right for Lilly? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Tim. We'll go to Dan for all those questions. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. Thanks. No, it's a good question and line of questions here on subcu dosing for anti-amyloid therapies. Probably 2 factors that we have taken into account in addition to the ones you mentioned. First and most important is efficacy for patients. And I think all of the data that we have so far suggest and support the notion that deep and rapid clearance is key here. And so if you're going to go to subcu dosing, it's important to make sure you do get enough drug in so that you can quickly get patients to clear. That's not going to always be possible with every drug. I think the second consideration with subcu dosing is the duration of therapy. So if it's a limited duration of therapy, the difference between IV and subcu, if it's once a month for 6 months, that's not a big difference between IV and subcu. Whereas if it's for the rest of your life, maybe that is a bigger difference. Finally, with respect to our plans for subcu, I do think it's an important option to offer patients, notwithstanding the previous comments, even for a limited duration therapy, some patients may prefer it, assuming you can get the same kind of efficacy. I think with donanemab, that's unlikely to be possible, and we're not pursuing it given the doses we need and the formulation we have. However, we have a second-generation antibody here that we call N3pG4, which I think is quite likely to be viable in a subcutaneous presentation. And that is our focus of development around N3pG4. My expectation around that is that it should be able to show comparable amyloid plaque lowering with subcutaneous dosing as donanemab does with IV dosing. If so, given the similarities between the drugs, we would seek an accelerated approval pathway for that drug in the future as sort of a subcutaneous version of donanemab, although it is a new enemy. Your second question was around the phospho-tau assay and whether that's a significant revenue stream. It's certainly conceivable and we haven't sort of thought through all of our commercial plans around that. But really for Lilly, and it may be significant for some companies, I think for Lilly, though, our focus is on removing barriers for treatment to patients. And so as we think about how we position diagnostics and therapeutics in the marketplace, our focus will be on really making sure that most patients possible can get treated appropriately. David Ricks : And maybe just a comment -- thanks, Dan, Tim, on the access and payment environment, I think our priority at Lilly is always going to be how to make it easier for patients to get to a therapy and then we solve for value on the back end. There are clearly benefits in the short-duration treatment, like Dan said, with donanemab in a Part B. They're going to be watched closely by their physicians initially anyway. There are real and important side effects, which require imaging analysis for this class of drugs. And so it's an intensively managed disease. But through time, as we've seen with other classes, as comfort level will rise in primary care, in particular, in using therapeutic antibodies to treat Alzheimer's, a more convenient form available at our local pharmacy, perhaps for self-injection or injection by a caregiver, would be preferred. So our plans line up with -- in pursuing both those channels, although in early days, probably the intensive nature of the treatment and specialist nature will favor the infusion. But we're committed to both, and we're solving for patient convenience at the end of the day. Operator : The next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just one on donanemab and then one on Verzenio. Just I guess my bigger question on donanemab is, how are you thinking about the role of A\u03b2 antibodies maybe prior to definitive cognition data being available? So I guess do you see cognition data significantly expanding the market opportunity for these products? Or do you anticipate we're going to see broad usage, even in the event, let's just say, the additional cognitive readouts you see on donanemab were less definitive than what we saw in the Phase 2? I'm just trying to say, do you think the whole market at this point is just going to move to plaque regression or reduction or at least cognition is still very important, I think, in terms of the commercial opportunity? My second question was on the Verzenio update. I just -- just a 2-parter here. Just when do you think you'll have that incremental OS data for the other 50% of the population? And how hard is it to identify these higher-risk patients as we think about maybe the initial commercial opportunity in adjuvant? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Dan for donanemab, and then Anne for the questions on Verzenio. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. So your question is -- maybe I'll break it in two parts. The first part is like how important is in the near term to have additional cognitive benefit data for amyloid plaque [lung] drugs. And then in the longer term, what happens if the confirmatory studies give a negative surprise. So in the short term, I'd just clarify that we have compelling clinical efficacy data for donanemab. The only trial that's going to be successful, a positive Phase II study and its primary endpoint showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, that's different, unique and exciting, published in the New England Journal, that's exciting. And I think that will be helpful even before we have the confirmatory data, being in that unique position. There will be some physicians, I'm sure, as are today, who still say, I don't want to use a drug until I have cognitive data. Fine, for those physicians who are willing to make that link between the surrogate efficacy data and the Phase II data in donanemab, if you believe that lowering amyloid plaque is the good thing to do, you're going to want the drug that lowers amyloid plaque the most. And I think that's an exciting aspect of donanemab as well. But then we come to the confirmatory studies. I think surely everyone have to acknowledge if for multiple sponsors, multiple drugs are all clearly negative, that would be a bad thing and we would retreat and say that this was a wrong way of thinking. I think that scenario is extremely unlikely. I think the most likely scenario is probably a mixed picture. Some drugs will be better than others. Some trials will reach significance, others might not. You've heard me speak about the confidence in our trial, but we have to see the data. I think in that scenario, that will strengthen -- that would be good enough to reinforce the notion that amyloid is an important surrogate and reducing amyloid is a good idea. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Anne, on Verzenio? Anne White : Yes. Chris, thanks for the question. And as Dan shared, we are incredibly pleased with what we're seeing out of Verzenio and the monarchE data and as he shared key endpoints, such as IDFS have continued to strengthen with further follow-up. And now we have two years of median follow-up. And so very pleased with that, and as he shared, we remain very confident there will be an OS trend favoring Verzenio in the broader population. So we would work with the FDA to expand our label to include these patients in the future. So obviously, this is event driven and so the timing of this will be determined by the event rate. So our next planned analysis is in the second half of '22, and this analysis will help us really further inform the timing of that final analysis. So as you commented, the overall survival data in the broader population is still immature. We still have less than 50% of the events needed to do that final OS analysis. But with what we're seeing, and again, strong performance in both the high and low Ki67, we remain confident to see this trend in OS favoring Verzenio to replicate. As far as Ki67, good news here is that this is really a familiar concept to physicians. It is already accepted as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. And it's really easily performed through an IHC assay, so very simple assay. And these are broadly available in the pathology labs. And the assay and the methodology that we used on monarchE is straightforward and proven to be accurate and really highly reproducible. So our belief is that oncologists will move to quickly adopt this in practice. And really, this clarity in patients with the highest risk, I think, will help to accelerate uptake in this setting. So we look forward to launching in this setting. Operator : The next caller is Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Surprisingly, I also want to talk about Alzheimer's today. Dan, I have three subparts. First, are you expecting to use interim data from your ongoing Phase III as part of the regulatory filing or during the review? Secondly, once the plaque is cleared, and I think 60% of patients have clearance by 12 months, what rate of onset of new amyloid plaque do you expect subsequently? And I'm just trying to understand your expectation on finite duration of dosing versus Biogen's opinion on continued dosing. And then finally, I'm also trying to reconcile the slide you showed on the nonlinear model, the Conrado model, suggesting a relationship between plaque decrease and a slowing in clinical progression. Are you saying there's a relationship? Or are you saying there's a causality? Because you might recall the New England Journal paper on your Phase II mentioned there was no association between plaque and clinical benefit at patient level 1, Biogen data suggested similar. Thank you very much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Umer. Dan? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. Three great questions, Umer. Thanks. So the first question, you asked if we'd use interim data, I commented that we'll take a safety cut of data in the right way to support that submission. We don't plan to support that submission or do we see the need to support that submission with any looks at efficacy data. We have adequate efficacy data supporting the plaque lowering, which would be the basis of submission and approval under accelerated approval. Your second question is once plaque clears, how long does it take to come back? We have some data on that that was also presented at AAIC. I didn't highlight it this morning. But what we found is that off therapy, there is very slow, negligible, really, regrowth of plaque. I think if you sort of extrapolate it out, it might take 14 or 15 years or something like that to regrow amyloid plaque. The average age of patients in this trial is 75. And remember, we haven't fully halted progression of disease. So that doesn't feel like a near-term thinking on redosing will be necessary to keep them clear. But we'll have the ability to follow patients for many, many years and confirm that. Finally, I think you've correctly summarized the situation, which is that in our initial analysis, we didn't see a correlation and now we are reporting that we do see a correlation. Why is that? And of course, correlation can't prove causation so it is just a correlation. So why do we see it now? I think what we learned was quite interesting. And that's that the amount of plaque you remove depends a lot on how much plaque you have to start with. So if you only have 50 centiloids of plaque, there's only so much you can remove. If you have 100 centiloids of plaque based on, you can remove a lot more. So that turns out to be a pretty important compound in these kinds of correlations. The people who are -- have the more severe disease, perhaps longer duration, lower cognitive performance, older age, they might have more plaque at baseline, you can remove more but they still might be the worst progressors than people who have lower plaque and you remove less. So, I think our thinking initially, and maybe the field thinking, was a little bit backwards on this to look for a straight correlation between change and change without adjusting for all of those important baseline covariance. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andrew Baum. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions please. Just going back to interim analysis for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ to not so much as used to support accelerated but to accelerate the readout for the full standard regulatory review, you're using a Bayesian disease progression model. Given that you're getting such a rapid clearance of Alzheimer's and that's linked to cognition in those patients who have that, do we have to assume that the follow-up is going to go out to the full 72 weeks? Or is there a possibility of early unblinding driven by efficacy in these patients? And then second, perhaps you could comment on the manufacturing capacity for donanemab as well as the regulatory outlook for your P-tau assay, assuming that you attain regulatory approval on the accelerators. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Andrew. Dan, we'll go to you for those questions. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. So Andrew, you've asked a follow-up question here, an important one, on the potential even in the face of an accelerated review for accelerated approval, rather, for plaque lowering, whether we'd still be keen to get that kind of data a bit earlier by pulling forward an interim on TRAILBLAZER-2. We haven't ruled that out. We also don't have plans at this moment in time. I think we just need to see where we are and where the field is. But really, the -- maintaining a pristine Phase III trial would probably be a pretty high priority, particularly if accelerated approval gives the path for patients to have access to the medicine, then it becomes less urgent to get that data faster. So that's our current thinking. We've been working hard to make sure we have manufacturing capacity. I feel good about where we are to support launch and growth of donanemab and hopefully someday enter PG4 even to follow that. With respect to the commercialization of a P-tau diagnostic, there are different paths forward for an in vitro diagnostic, including a lab-developed test, or LDT, which can be done in a centralized location, for example, under CLIA. And that's a pretty fast path and that's one of the options that we consider. Operator : And the next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first question I had for you is, how do you think about a potential outcome for the national coverage determination of monoclonal antibodies to treat Alzheimer's disease? And then second question is, how would you think about pricing donanemab if it is approved? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Louise. Dan? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. Thanks. Two sort of commercially focused questions on donanemab. I mean the first one on the national coverage decision, determination -- of course, that's important. When -- I think it was widely said that when the first approval came, it was quite broad an indication and then subsequently, the FDA working with the sponsor focused the patient population. I think there could still be opportunity for further focusing here. And that's one direction the experts at CMS may take. In that case, it could be requiring patients to have evidence of Alzheimer's pathology in the form of amyloid plaques or even tau pathology. As I said before, I think that matches our goals and what we think is right. It will take some time for that to play out probably over the next nine months or so and surely will be part of some of those discussions and share our data and thinking in the right way. And then on pricing, I think I simply say it's too early to comment on that. We have some time yet. Operator : The next call is Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Dan, you're popular today, so I just have a couple more for you. On donanemab, is there a hurdle that FDA has provided in terms of number of patients for safety, either for the filing or during the review? And then as the data from TRAILBLAZER matures, what is your estimate on what the duration of therapy benefit could ultimately be? And then real quick on tirzepatide. Just wanted to know as you guys complete the filing. At this point, what's the gating factor as you look at the different geographies and you prepare? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Jeff, we'll go to Dan for the donanemab questions, and then Mike Mason on tirzepatide. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. So with respect to the safety hurdle for donanemab or for any drug, really, it's having adequate exposures and duration of exposures in a broad population to be able to fully assess the benefit risk of a given drug. Now that's not a number that depends on the particulars of the drug, the population, of course, that you hope to treat the duration of therapy, of course, but also the particulars around the safety data and the efficacy data that you collect. So it would be nice and easy, I think, for sponsors and the FDA if there was a particular line in the sand that could be drawn. But as I said, it needs to be tailored for each drug. Based on our current thinking and analysis and discussions, as I said, I think we'll be there comfortably at the end of this year. Your second question was about -- I think it was about the duration of benefit as the TRAILBLAZER data mature. I commented on the duration of plaque lowering, which appears to be sustained. But I think, Geoff, you're getting at the duration of the cognitive benefit. We see a slowing of decline on average between that patients are still declining. You could ask, are the lines coming together or going apart? I think on some of the cuts to the initial data, there might have been a perception that the lines were not diverging at the later time points, I think, as I showed the additional statistical methods. And even as we look at the raw data, we're pretty comfortable here that we have lines that diverge over time. And therefore, I would expect that, that benefit of slowing would continue over time. But too soon to have real data on that. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Mike, on tirzepatide? Mike Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. Our Phase III SURPASS program for type 2 diabetes is done and completed. So the only gating factor here is how quickly we can summarize the data and submit to the regulators, which we plan to do by the end of the year to major global regulators. Operator : And the next caller is Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Maybe I guess I'll try to take another stab at the pricing question. I appreciate it's early, but it is sort of the elephant in the room. And just maybe if Dave and team could comment just on the appropriateness of the pricing benchmarks in the space already today in Alzheimer's, as you think about it. And then obviously, 3Q has tripped in the past around Trulicity dynamics. So just hoping, if you could just offer a little bit more clarity there on as you think about pricing headwinds into 3Q specifically? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Carter. So we'll go to Dave for the question on pricing for donanemab, and then Mike on Trulicity pricing dynamics. David Ricks : Yes. I appreciate the question, and we totally get the curiosity. There's, as you understand, probably lot of limitations of what we would say at this stage. One of the reasons for the limitation is really the ultimate label we have and the value we can demonstrate to customers is a key input at Lilly for pricing. And we have -- fortunately, the only study in the space that hit its pre-specified endpoint for disease reduction -- or disease progression reduction, and those are key. As we demonstrated at AAIC, we continue to cut that data. I think there was an earlier question about how we might differentiate in the NCD process, but that's one of them as we have this completed study with exquisite biomarker profiles of the product and can continue to elucidate what donanemab does in the brains of Alzheimer's patients in ways that perhaps others could not. And those are inputs as well. Finally, Lilly has been a leader in value-based concepts and really partnerships to make sure that the appropriate patients can easily access at low out-of-pocket cost or medicines. And we're applying that thinking to this problem as well in the U.S. as well as outside. Our goal isn't to just get an approval, but to make sure that all of the people millions in the U.S. who could qualify for it could access it on day one. So those are all inputs into that process and without throwing out a number here, which wouldn't be appropriate until we get an approval. That's how we think about it. Hopefully, that gives you some color behind the scenes. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. And then to Mike on Trulicity for pricing dynamics, pricing trends. Mike Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question, really nothing new to report on Trulicity pricing. At the beginning of the year, we gave guidance that when you take a look at the impact of increased rates and market, second mix and offset by lower utilization, 340B and modest list price increases, that for the year, we would see low single-digit price decline for Trulicity. That's what we're experiencing, so really nothing new to update at this point in the year. Anat Ashkenazi : Yes. Let me just add just more general comment on pricing movement through the year, and I know we've had numerous conversations on this. And it does -- there does tend to be some volatility throughout the year. We do tend to see as patient flow through the health care system, more pronounced impact from the coverage gap in the second and third quarter of the year. So you see that dynamic throughout every -- really every year, as Mike said. And we built those assumptions into our full year guidance in terms of pricing dynamics for the year. And obviously, as we have more color and insight, we'll provide that. But right now, as we look at the full year estimate for U.S. pricing dynamic, it's consistent with what we previously discussed in terms of overall erosion. You saw 3% for the first half of the year, which is what you should expect for the full year. Operator : The next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Great. So really wanted to kind of focus in on abemaciclib in prostate cancer and the update that was provided, I think in an abstract published at AACR, some of the details were provided with regard to the sort of threshold for moving forward as it relates to the hazard ratio. And it cites a hazard ratio of 0.64, 80% power. So with a P-value of 0.1 to, I think, continue advancing into the next stage of CYCLONE 2. So just wanted to clarify if that information is consistent and a driving force for moving forward, that would seem like a robust piece of information to have as we head into that. And then as incremental to that, just wanted to get a sense of the magnitude of the opportunity that Lilly believes this would represent for Verzenio going forward. And if there are, let's say, RB, so the retinoblastoma-related requirements for enrollment or any other biomarker requirements that could limit the size of the patient population. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the NCD determination, just wanted to clarify if the pricing of the initially priced product would have any impact on Lilly's ability to independently price its own product, and if that's part of the reason why Lilly has argued for the products being treated independently as part of the NCD rather than as a class. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. We're going to toss it to Dan first to start on Verzenio, and then Anne will follow to round that out, and then we'll go back to Dan for the NCD question. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. You're asking, Seamus, very smartly about the criteria to expand the study from our Phase II study to a Phase III study. I don't think we want to get into the very precise details on what that was. But you're correct that it was a very robust threshold. So we're excited to see that happen. We take Phase III starts very seriously at Lilly. We don't want Phase III failures. So when we have studies like this one, in any therapeutic area where we move from Phase II to Phase III without ever seeing the data, we set aggressive bars that data really have to match to move forward to Phase III. So you can expect that's what we did here. Anne for more detail. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Anne, for more detail there and also the magnitude of the opportunity we see in prostate? Anne White : Yes. I mean, as Dan said, we were incredibly pleased with this outcome and the recommendation by the DMC, and we set a very aggressive threshold on this adaptive design, and we're impressed that it met that threshold. And I think it just continues to be another example of how Verzenio differentiates from the competition. So the Phase III is open. It's already enrolling patients. We anticipate the results of the analysis in 2024. On the question on market size, so CYCLONE 2 is -- it's a metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer trial that really targets patients who have not yet received prior novel hormonal agent, so in earlier settings. So our initial research shows that the addressable market could be in the range of 25% to 50% of metastatic CRPC. So it's depending really a bit on how the market evolves with the use of NHAs in that earlier setting. So in the U.S., for example, based on that, we currently estimate between 7,000 and 14,000 patients would match that inclusion criteria for CYCLONE 2. And exciting in this space is that as long as being a high unmet need in a large patient population, there's also a long length of anticipated treatment duration. So this could be a treatment duration of up to two years or longer. So that's why we're particularly excited about this opportunity, is what it delivers there. There is no RB or other biomarker requirements in the study. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Dan, on NCD? Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Last question was on NCD and why did I say that we think we -- each drug should be evaluated on its own merits. Is that an allusion to pricing or something like that? No, my primary focus here is on the patient and the outcomes that a drug could deliver, which, even within the same class, could be different. Our theory and I presented data today to support that theory, is that the amount of amyloid you remove and how quickly you do that is important for predicting outcomes. If that's the case, you can easily imagine different drugs, even with the same class having different benefits for patients and some of those benefits may be above a threshold for coverage and others may not. That's conceivable. Not what I anticipate is the most likely scenario, but we want to be prepared for all scenarios here. Operator : The next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Thanks for all the updates on the pipeline. So maybe a couple sort of separate topics that have been covered more on the call. So for one on lebrikizumab, clearly that one maybe gets underappreciated a little bit. We got Phase III data coming up. Can you maybe just set some expectations and what you're hoping to see? I know you have a dosing advantage potentially with that product, but obviously, dupi's a pretty formidable competitor there. So maybe you can just sort of frame what you're hoping to see. And then tirzepatide, just one quick follow-up. I know you mentioned you started, I think you said, the HFpEF study for that product. Are you looking at that for HFrEF as well? I just -- I don't remember you mentioning that. And if not, I'm just curious why you wouldn't pursue that. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Vamil. We'll go to Ilya for the question on lebrikizumab, and then Mike for tirzepatide. Ilya Yuffa : Great. Thank you for the question on lebrikizumab. We're excited to -- for the second half of the year to see the data related to our induction phase for lebrikizumab across a number of trials. And so what we're hoping to see and expect to see is replicating some of the positive signals we saw in Phase II, where we have strong efficacy in skin itch, and we believe have a very good safety profile. And so we anticipate that lebrikizumab will have a very competitive profile versus DUPIXENT in a growing and a significant unmet need. And we see lebrikizumab being an important asset for us as we think about not only atopic dermatitis, but our overall presence and strength in dermatology and our growing immunology franchise. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ilya. Mike? Mike Mason : Okay. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have only announced a HFpEF study for tirzepatide, and that's currently all we're planning on announcing at this point. I think we're very confident in the opportunity of tirzepatide in the HFpEF. When you look at patients that have HFpEF, there's a large segment that also are obese and obesity is a [steep] phenotype within this patient population. So I think we feel good about our -- the results we've seen in our Phase II studies that give us, I think, confidence that we'll be successful in HFpEF. And so right now, our efforts are focused on HFpEF. Operator : The next caller is Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Two questions. First, on the Q1 earnings call, Lilly said in monarchE, there had been 76 events, 39 on abemaciclib, 37 on control. Can you provide an update with numbers on a like-for-like basis? And then secondly, on your oral SERD, did Lilly see potential for differentiation in the ASCO data? And if so, what differentiation did it see, particularly as competitor data and news flow evolves? Lilly has previously said, it would not pursue a me-too SERD. So I'm wondering what is different about yours. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Anne for the first question on Verzenio, and then Jake for the question on oral SERD differentiation. Anne White : Well, thanks, Steve. And as Dan shared, we're going to be presenting data from this recent analysis at a medical meeting later this year. So we won't be able to share further details and then, obviously, due to the embargo. But as you can tell, we are very pleased to see the data continue to strengthen in this latest analysis with more than two years of follow-up. As we stated previously, the overall survival data remains immature. So at this point, what I can share is we have less than half of the events needed, so less than 50% of the events needed for the prespecified OS analysis. So the data remains immature. Again, we were really pleased, even with that immaturity, to see that the patients with highest risk already had this favorable trend. But thanks for the question and look forward to sharing more at a meeting later on. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ann. Jake? Jake Van Naarden : Sure, happy to take the question on SERD. We're pleased with how the drug is performing clinically. It's doing everything that we expected it to do from a pharmacology safety and efficacy perspective. I think the data package that we presented at ASCO and that which we continue to see in the trial subsequent to ASCO, placed the drug in a vacuum on par with the best agents in development from our peers. But this is not a class of medicine that stands on its own period. This is really a development program. And I think as it relates to me-tooism, what I would say is that we're not interested in pursuing a me-too development program, and we stand by that statement. And frankly, our leadership position in breast cancer, in particular, with emerging Verzenio data as we've been talking about today, I think, put us in a unique position as it relates to this class of medicines. That all having been said, I also think we are a bit more cautious about the long-term role of SERDs in this landscape, and we're looking forward to some randomized data for the first time from some of our competitors later this year that I think will shed some light on where these drugs ought to fit in the overall treatment paradigm. Operator : And that comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Harrison : Great. I guess two for me. So first, just a follow-up with two parts on the Conrado model, one, do you know regulators view of this model? And then secondly, maybe if you can just explain what we're seeing in a little bit more detail, it looks like you're seeing about a 40% regression, slowing at 100% clearance. I assume this is over 18 months. Would you expect that to continue to compound? I'm just wondering why only sort of 40% slowing when you've cleared all the plaque. And then just a second follow-up on SERD, any plans to look at that in combination with CDK4/6 or other combinations? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Matthew. We'll go to Dan for the questions on the Conrado model, and then Jake on SERD. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Matthew, for the question there. No, we don't have a regulator's view on the Conrado model. But we're encouraged that this model was built, as I said earlier, by the CAMD -- by data from the CAMD consortium and has been around for a while and used for various applications. What we're doing here, though, to be clear, is checking a patient's progression against what we predict their progression would be. So knowing all of their baseline factors, how much would the predicted to have progressed had they not been on drug versus how much did they actually progress. And so that's essentially what you're seeing in the graph. You're right, even with full plaque clearance, there's still some progression. There's only a 40% decrease. Now that's as big an effect as anyone ever has talked about in Alzheimer's disease, but surely, over time, we're going to need additional therapeutics for Alzheimer's beyond just clearing the plaque, at least in this stage of disease. And I think that's probably where tau therapeutics come into play. So that's how we think about it. I think earlier in the disease course, it could be quite different. Perhaps if you get it early enough, you could have 100% disease slowing in progression and in essence, no Alzheimer's, but that is yet to be proven. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Going to Jake for that question on SERD? Jake Van Naarden : Yes, a question on SERD. Of course, we plan to explore combining our oral SERD with CDK4/6, in particular, with abemaciclib. We're doing that right now in the context of an expansion cohort of the Phase I/II trial, the same trial for which we presented data at ASCO has expansion cohorts that contemplate rational combinations, including with abemaciclib. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Jake. Matthew, thanks for your questions, and we've exhausted the queue. We'll go to Dave for the close. David Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. Thanks to Dan for answering all those questions. We appreciate your participation in today's call and your interest in the Company, of course. We continue to see growth with our broad commercial portfolio. And we have strong momentum across our core business supported by a breadth of brands and accelerating classes and robust growth across U.S., Europe and China. In addition, as you heard today, we believe we have a compelling pipeline with industry-leading opportunities, and we remain focused on bringing new medicines to patients and creating value for all our stakeholders. Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow up with Investor Relations team if you have any questions we have not addressed today, and hope you have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time to do require assistance during the call, please press star then 0 and an operator will assist you offline. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Kevin Hearn : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2021 earnings call. Kevin Hearn, VP of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO, Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer. Dr. Dan Skowronski (ph), Chief Scientific and medical officer [indiscernible] White (ph) President of Lilly Neuroscience, Jake Van Arden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and President of Lilly Oncology. Patrick Johnson (ph), President of Lilly immunology, and Lilly U.S.A. and Mike Mason (ph), President of Lilly Diabetes. We're also joined by Lauren Zerki Santueja and Sarah Smith of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.  Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Q and 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our third quarter results. David Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. Once again, Lilly had a very strong quarter growing our newest medicines around the world and continuing to advance significant potential new medicines in the late-stage development. While also building long-term opportunities through early-stage investments in technology and progress in early-stage programs. Q3 2021 was also a period where the resilience of our Company, our people and collaborators were tested by the pandemic. And again, they rose to the challenge on, personally recognize and thank my Lilly teammates for delivering such a strong overall performance. Innovating to maintain pipeline velocity, running our plans to meet the rapidly growing demand of medicines and continuing to serve our customers, whether be in person or online. Turning to our strategic deliverables on slide 4, Q3 revenue grew 18% compared to Q3 2020, or 17% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume. Volume growth was 17 percentage points. When excluding COVID-19 therapies, which includes revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew an estimated 11% for the quarter and year-to-date. Revenue attributable to our newer medicines grew over 35% and now represents nearly 60% of our core business this quarter, an important indicator for our long-term growth potential. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3 or 79.3%, excluding for the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, our gross margin decreased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, representing an improvement of over 400 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. And over 100 basis points of sequential improvement from Q2 of this year. We had a number of significant pipeline milestones since our last earnings call in August.  Including the FDA approvals for Verzenio and certain people with high-risk early breast cancer. And for Jardiance and collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Regulatory submissions for Tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes in the U.S. to which we applied a priority review voucher, as well as the EU, and Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We initiated a rolling submission in the U.S. for donanemab in early Alzheimer's disease and had positive Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. We also continue to augment our pipeline with these development opportunities as we continue to leverage external innovation to build our discovery capabilities with a focus on new modalities at Lilly. In Q3, we announced a research collaboration and licensing agreement with Lycia Therapeutics to utilize their proprietary protein degradation technology. Finally on financials, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend this quarter. Moving to slides 5 and 6, you'll a see list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including issuing the company\u2019s first sustainability bond with proceeds allocated toward environmental projects, including pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and renewable energy, as well as social projects to increase access to essential services and social economic advancement and empowerment.  We announced a series of leadership and organizational changes this quarter. Recent positive data readouts this year led us to the natural decision to increase our focus on immunology and NeuroScience and to unify the Loxo Oncology and Lilly Oncology organizations. We believe these changes enhance our ability to execute on a broad range of exciting commercial and pipeline opportunities. I'd like to welcome Jake Van Arden, to Lilly's Executive Committee, and look forward to Ann, Patrick and Jake continuing their leadership in their new roles. They'll be focused on increasing our competitiveness in their therapeutic areas and growing our existing medicines while also launching our late-stage pipeline of new medicines which could benefit patients across a diverse set of medical conditions.  Similarly, I'm grateful for Ilias (ph) continued leadership and look forward to him leading our growing international business. Finally, I would like to thank [indiscernible] for his impact on our Company across more than three decades of his commitment to patients, to development of our industry-leading commercial capabilities and his relentless focus on execution and mentorship of countless Lilly leaders. Kudo (ph) thank you for your service to our Company. We have a deep leadership venture at Lilly. They're smart, they're energetic and experienced. And I know they're as excited as I am to take Lilly to another level in the decade ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Anat to review our Q3 results and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2021. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the Third Quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 18% this quarter compared to Q3, 2020 or 11% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for core business, despite the impact of Alimta's OUS [indiscernible] We continue to be pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Paul's, Verzenio and Jardiance as our key growth products made up nearly 60% of our core business during the quarter.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined ten basis points to 79% in Q3. Favorable products mix excluding COVID-19 therapies, and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold were more than offset by lower gross margin on COVID-19 therapies. Total operating expenses grew eight percent this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased one percent while R and D expenses increased 17% driven by significant investments in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including the non [indiscernible], [indiscernible]and [indiscernible].  We also invested approximately $50 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q3, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately 350 million year-to-date. Operating income increased 37% compared to Q3 2020. And operating income as a percent of revenue was 30.5% for the quarter, an increase of 420 basis points compared to the prior year with sequential growth for second straight quarter. This increase was driven by revenue growth, outpace, and expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Other income and expense were expense of $7 million for this quarter compared to income of 10 million in Q3 2020. Our effective tax rate was 14.3%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year.  The lower effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2021 was driven by a mix of earnings and lower tax jurisdiction, partially offset by a decrease in net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2020. At the bottom line, we delivered strong growth as earnings per share increased 38% in Q3, 2021. On slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth, and we're encouraged by the growth seen across the world. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 26% compared to third quarter of 2020. Adjusting for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, revenue grew 14% in the US. This increase, driven largely by volume, was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, and Verzenio.  The higher net realized price in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Unfavorable changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Trulicity in the third quarter of 2020 and modest list price increases, partially offset by increased rebates to maintain broad patient access for our medicine. Our year-to - date U.S. net price decrease of 1% is in line with the low-to-mid single-digit guidance we gave last December, and our full-year outlook is consistent with those expectations.  Our 340B limited distribution program began September 2020, and so the fourth quarter of 2021 will be the first full quarter where its impact will also be including the base period when calculating year-over-year price changes in the U.S. Given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business. Moving to Europe, revenue grew 3% in constant currency, excluding the impact of the first full quarter of loss of exclusivity for Alimta. Revenue grew 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth, excluding Alimta. In Japan, revenue decreased 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by the decline of post-patent products. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. Now, including Alimta as well as the by -- by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our key growth products grew 12% in Q3 in Japan. We expect improved revenue growth in Japan moving forward based on the uptake of these newer products. In China, revenue grew 30% in constant currency primarily driven by continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity. We're excited by the significant growth we're seeing in China with sales of new medicine continue to drive growth there.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effects on revenue for our September year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove 15 percentage point of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products.  In total, these brands generated nearly $3.9 billion in revenue this quarter, and made up 58% of our core business revenue. We are encouraged by the strength of our key growth products in Q3, collectively up over 35% compared to the same period in prior year. Trulicity, Verzenio and Jardiance all continued to outgrow their respective classes. and we're pleased with Taltz growth driven by increased access. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2021, we invested $7 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays, and capital investments. In addition, we returned over 2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and have repurchased $500 million in stock.  We will continue to fund the growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline, seek external innovation to augment our future growth prospects, and return capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on slide 13, we're updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We're increasing the full-year revenue outlook by 200 million at the top end of the range, and 400 million at the lower end of the range to reflect additional COVID-19 antibody revenue. And the outlook for a core business. COVID-19 antibody revenue expectations are roughly 1.3 billion based on the existing U.S. government purchasing agreements for additional doses of etesevimab in Q3 and Q4. The net impact of these changes is an update revenue range of $27.2 billion to $27.6 billion, up from the previous range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. As we noted last quarter, investments in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches are expected to push us to the top end of our guidance range for operating expenses. Our reported and non-GAAP operating margin guidance is unchanged, Excluding the impact of COVID-19 antibodies, non-GAAP operating margin remains approximately 31%. Our non-GAAP ranges for other income and expense and our expected tax rate remains unchanged as well.  On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of 250 million -- 250 million, reflecting the impact of the charges associated with a repurchase of debt and net mark-to-market losses on investments in equity securities. In the Third Quarter of 2021, the 2021 effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 11% on a reported basis, reflecting the tax impact of the charges associated with the repurchase of debt and acquired IP R&D, as well as unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments in equity securities in the third quarter of 2021. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share has been raised to 795 to 805, while the GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.38 to $6.48. At our Investor's Day in December, we will share our initial 2022 guidance. Today, before I turn the call over to Dan for the R&D update, I'd like to provide a few reminders on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as we begin thinking about the next year. In Q3, we saw the initial impact of Alimta's OUS patent expiry in Europe and Japan. Next year, we will see its full-year impact, as well as the U.S. patent expiry, with limited launches from a single generic Company in Q1 before the full launch of generic entrants starting in Q2. As for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, we intend to reflect in guidance our expectations related to signed purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies. Currently we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 therapies in 2022 leading to more difficult year-over-year comparisons. As we do this year, we will provide commentary on our financials excluding the impact of revenue and certain expenses from COVID-19 therapies to enable more healthful year-over-year comparison of the performance of our core business [indiscernible] major use drugs price and reform, our 2022 and mid-term outlook continues to be mid-single-digit net price erosion in the U.S. and globally, is the impact of lower utilization of 340B segments moved into the base pace period as we enter Q4, 2021.  we continue to invest in our bright future as we advance promising R&D opportunities in scale up to support exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline. While these investments may pressure operating margin in the near term, they are critical to maximizing pipeline opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid to long-term. Now I will turn over the call to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. Like 2020 before it, 2021 continues to be a very productive year for R&D at Lilly. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll highlight several updates from our late-stage pipeline. Starting with Tirzepatide. We shared detailed results from tirzepatide SURPASS-4 Study at EASD this quarter. SURPASS-4 is the largest and longest surpass trial completed to-date. And we were encouraged by the continued hemoglobin A1C and weight control, which participants experienced even past the initial 52-week treatment period, and continuing up to 2 years. Looking at slide 14, this shows the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1C over time during the study. A1C reduction plateaued by roughly 24 weeks and was maintained at 52 weeks and thereafter, to 104 weeks across all the Tirzepatide doses. While in the insulin glargine comparator arm, A1C began to increase after 52 weeks. Durability of A1C control is a challenge for type 2 diabetes treatments. While the 104-week data isn't a definitive answer as to whether Tirzepatide could potentially offer even longer-term durable blood glucose control, these data certainly are encouraging. Moving to Slide 15, as you can see, weight loss plateaued at approximately 52 weeks and was maintained thereafter, such that at 2 years, weight difference at the highest dose was approximately 15% compared to insulin glargine. We've seen in previous incretin therapy trials conducted with GLP-1 s a further increased impact on weight reduction in participants with obesity without type-2 diabetes compared to studies in participants who do have type two diabetes, such as this one. It will be interesting to see if this trend also extends to the dual agonism of Tirzepatide, which has demonstrated weight reductions in type two diabetes trials beyond what has been shown by GLP-1s to-date. We clearly are excited about the weight loss potential here and we believe the data to date bode well for upcoming readouts in obesity, starting with surmount one which reads out next-year. Tirzepatide represents a new class of medicines.  And we're focused on continuing our significant investment for patients with type two diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders who may benefit from Tirzepatide. Moving to slide 16, today we announced the U.S. submission for Tirzepatide and Type II diabetes, and that we used a priority review voucher with the intention of bringing this investigational treatment to patients as quickly as possible. We are delighted that the continued progress for this novel dual agonist incretin and hope to obtain approval in the U.S. by the middle of next year. Moving to donanemab, we have several important updates for this program. First, in the U.S., we initiated a rolling BLA submission to the FDA for accelerated approval in early Alzheimer's disease.  We intend to complete the submission in the next few months and expect regulatory action in the second half of 2022. We've also completed the original planned enrollment of 1,500 participants for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2. And based on the pre -specified 18-month primary endpoint, expect to have topline results by the middle of 2023. We've added a separate single arm addendum for safety exposures to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which has already enrolled more than 300 patients and is continuing to enroll rapidly. This addendum will provide us with additional safety data to support the rolling submission. Moving to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, this is a prevention study for cognitively unimpaired individuals who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have clinical symptoms. We're excited to report that we have already initiated screening.  This pioneering trial has multiple novel elements to reduce research subject burden, including the use of our phospho-tau217 blood assay currently in development to help detect Alzheimer's disease pathology in the patient screening process. Video call technology for assessing cognitive function in the subject's home, and a large network of infusion centers that allow subjects to select the site most convenient to them in a decentralized clinical trial paradigm. We also announced today our plans to conduct a head-to-head Phase 3 study comparing donanemab to Aducanumab to assess superiority of brain amyloid plaque clearance in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  The co-primary endpoints will evaluate complete amyloid plaque clearance as measured by [indiscernible] pure FAT and PET scan, and will assess superiority on bringing amyloid plaque clearance in the total population, and also the intermediate [indiscernible] population. This study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4 is expected to begin enrollment this year. And we expect to share primary endpoint data in the second half of 2022. We're encouraged with the progress we've made with the [indiscernible] and with its potential to positively impact patients with high unmet medical need. We have of course, followed progress in the Alzheimer's disease landscape since our last call, and are watching closely as CMS 's national coverage determination process plays out. We're committed to facing the challenges of effectively communicating donanemab 's, clinical data, and value proposition and to ensuring that the diagnostic and patient management ecosystems are adequately well - prepared. Given the current environment, we think it's reasonable to have modest expectations for the scale of patient impact for anti-amyloid therapies available under accelerated approval prior to the readout of their definitive Phase III data. Assuming potential accelerated approval for donanemab in the second half of 2022, are expected TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 phase three readout by mid-2023 would follow quickly, meaning the window of accelerated approval without definitive Phase II data is likely to be brief. Assuming positive Phase three results, we should be confident in the mid and long-term opportunity for donanemab if approved. Moving on to Verzenio. In-line with the expectations I outlined last quarter, we were pleased with Verzenio 's recent FDA approval as the first and only CDK4/6 inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy, for adult patients with HR-positive, HER2 -negative, node-positive early breast cancer, who are at high risk of recurrence with the Ki-67 index of greater than equal to 20% as detected by an FDA-approved test. This approval in the Adjuvan setting represents the first new addition to endocrine therapy and Adjuvan treatment of HR-positive QAR2 -negative breast cancer in nearly two decades.  We're delighted to bring this important new treatment option to patients. Also, we recently shared updated data from the entire monarchE study at the ESMO Virtual Plenary meeting and co-published these data in Annals of Oncology. These data, which reflect additional follow-ups since our last public presentation, highlight the robustness and the effect size we're seeing for Verzenio in the Adjuvan setting. Notably, with a median follow-up of 27 months, we are pleased to see both IDFS and DRFS benefit extend beyond the two-year study treatment period. These data are not only important for patients, but also to help dispel concerns that the curves would come back together over time.  We're clearly observing -- we've clearly observed continued separation of the curves, if not expanding separation. Since the Adjuvan approval two weeks ago, there's been questions regarding why the FDA approval applied only to a subset of the study population. As previously communicated, overall survival was a secondary outcome measure for the monarchy study. And an important component of the FDA's review. But we do not typically publish immature overall survival data, we feel it's valuable to address these important questions about the difference between the enrolled study population and the approved indication. As a result, while the overall survival data remain immature, we do plan to publish the [indiscernible] data from the additional follow-up analysis, with cut-off of April 1, 2021, in a medical journal in the coming days.  These data will show what we have observed thus far for overall survival trends in the ITT population compared to the approved population. We'll continue to follow patients in the ITT population for more mature overall survival data. If positive OS trend emerges in the ITT population, we plan to work with regulators to expand our Adjuvan indication. Importantly, the collective results from Verzenio clinical development program have demonstrated a differentiated CDK4/6 inhibitor profile. And we look forward to continued investment in Verzenio for breast and prostate cancer and are excited about the opportunity to serve more patients.  Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 22 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. They've been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In oncology, in addition to the exciting news for Verzenio, we continue our investment in Pirtobrutinib Phase III program with an additional study starting chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including fixed duration Pirtobrutinib plus Venetoclax and rituximab in relapsed or refractory patients. We plan to start a study in first-line treatment compared to bendamustine plus rituximab before year-end. We prioritize this first-line study rather than the head-to-head study evaluating superiority compared to brutinib as we think this first-line study could provide a faster pathway to bring Pirtobrutinib to patients in the first-line setting.  We expect the head-to-head brutinib CLL study to start in the first half of 2022. We look forward to sharing updated dataset from the Phase 1-2 BRUIN study at a medical meeting later this year, we plan to provide a regulatory update for Pirtobrutinib at our Investor Day in December. [ inaudible 00 :28:55] our oral [indiscernible], also moved into Phase 3, with the start of its monotherapy study compared to Exemestane or fulvestrant's. Finally, we also publicly identified and presented preclinical characterization for two new agents at the Molecular Targets meeting this month. LOXO 783, which is a highly mutant selective allosteric PI3K alpha inhibitor, and LOXO 435 which is a highly isoform -selective FGFR3 inhibitor.  We look forward to filing IND for both programs in 2022 and subsequently moving them into the clinic. In Diabetes, In addition to the Tirzepatide update, we obtained U.S. approval for Jardiance and HFpEF, presented detailed results from the emperor preserved study at the European Society of Cardiology and submitted for HFpEF in the US and Europe. We're excited about the opportunity Jardiance has to improve outcomes for patients across type II diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. We also started Phase II studies for our GLP-1 non-peptide agonist in collaboration with Chugai in type II diabetes and In obesity, and look forward to sharing some Phase I data from this molecule in December.  In immunology, we were delighted to have multiple positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, and look forward to the readout of the maintenance data from the ADvocate 1 and 2 studies in the first half of next year, ahead of global submissions expected by the end of 2022. We're pleased with our progress in immunology this year with positive Phase 3 readouts for mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, and look forward to sharing more about our next-generation of early phase immunology assets in December. In neurodegeneration, our anti-tau antibodies Zachatenamab recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's. Zachatenamab failed to meet the primary endpoint and was unable to modulate tau spread in the brain. The placebo population progressed as expected.  While this negative outcome was disappointing. And we're discontinuing development for Zachatenamab, we remain committed to Tao as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease, and plan to continue studying Tao biology, including inhibition of tau aggregation with a small-molecule OGA inhibitor currently in the clinic. In the pain therapeutic area, in collaboration with Pfizer, we discontinued the global clinical development program for tanezumab, following receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for tanezumab in osteoarthritis pain and a negative opinion adopted by the CHMP.  And finally, the FDA expanded the emergency use authorization for Bamlanivimab and Aducanumab administered together to include post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To recap, Q3 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, continuing the positive momentum we've seen with a steady stream of significant pipeline advancements over the last couple of years. As we move closer towards our goal of delivering more faster best-in-class treatment options to patients in areas of unmet need. Now, I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks. David Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during the quarter. We have seen continued strength in our core business through the first 9 months of the year, with double-digit volume-driven revenue growth net of COVID-19 therapies and strong performance across key brands. We're pleased to see sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansions, as well as strong non-GAAP earnings growth. We have made significant progress developing new medicines. And Q3 was another important quarter for our pipeline as we announced the submission of Tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes, the initiation of a rolling submission for donanemab in the U.S. for early Alzheimer's disease, key life cycle approvals, and submissions for Verzenio and Jardiance, and positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab.We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends in Q3, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we move toward the close of 2021, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. While the past year has seen tremendous advances in our late-stage pipeline, at our Investor Day in December, we look forward to sharing information with you regarding the next generation of assets that we believe will enable us to sustain the flow of innovative medicines to patients and augment our future growth prospects. Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Louise, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then were ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Chris Schott, please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I guess the first one for me is just on some of the 2022 comments. know you're not giving formal guidance yet, but should we be thinking about margin expansion next year from the roughly 30% or so margins that are implied in this year's guidance? I'm just trying to get my hands around how meaningful of a step-up an OpEx we should be thinking about supporting new, these major new launches coming next year. And the second one was just one related to bibs rollout of aduhelm, it's obviously been a challenging launch.  Are there learnings here or just changes about how you're thinking about your go-to-market strategy for donanemab and I know Dan, you made some comments in the remarks, but should we be thinking about much in the way of revenue at all for donanemab. And I guess in that window between when it's approved and prior to Trailblazer, too, I'm sure a sense of again, just as you look at what's happened, there is there been surprises or changes in your thinking on the market. Thanks so much. Kevin Hearn : Thanks. Chris we'll go to Anat for the first question on 2022 margin expansion and then the on the thoughts about the uptake and outlook for donanemab. Anat Ashkenazi : Great. Thanks. So for 2022, we will provide further details and guidance in a couple -- in December, so not too far from now, and we'll provide additional carry on how we view the year and what investments and pushes and pulls we have going into next year. As you think about our margin expansion and the goals we've set out and we've communicated in terms of getting to mid-to-high 30s, in terms of margin expansion, we still have a clear line of sight to get there, and that's still our goal.  There will be -- but it's not a linear growth, so there will be years that are going to be stronger years, or we're going to be making specific targeted investments. And as you've seen us do this year with donanemab when we have strong convictions in the pipeline asset or when we're preparing to launch very promising opportunities and products, we will invest behind them. So think about this as still growing to mid-to-high 30s, but not necessarily in a linear fashion, but in line with investments we would need to make. Kevin Hearn : Thanks Anat. Ann. Anat Ashkenazi : Well, as Dan stated and as our competitor has shared, they've experienced there clearly is work to do to ensure that the diagnostic and the patient ecosystems are prepared for these medicines. And until there is definitive phase three data, we do believe that we should really expect modest use of these medicine. Now fortunately, as Dan said, for donanemab, this confirmatory data comes quickly in mid-23 for travelers are all too. And so this will be the opportunity to really help patients on a more significant scale. Now, some of the opportunities here, certainly pursuing accelerated approval is really important, both to provide early access. but also to let us begin addressing some of these infrastructure challenges ahead of the Phase three data. We need to build out the diagnostic ecosystem, particularly PET scans and blood tests. We need to make sure that there's adequate infusion capacity. And then very importantly, we need to ensure that there's reimbursements so that the appropriate patients can have access to donanemab. So these are going to be our areas of focus now through our phase 3 window. We're confident in our ability to address these infrastructure challenges over time. And I would say by clearing plaque faster and deeper, we believe that as well as identifying the right patients, we've optimized the chances for showing compelling benefits in the Phase III, which is we said is what was going to show significant uptake in the class. We continue to see the same opportunity for donanemab in the mid to long term once these challenges are addressed and the confirmatory data is available. Kevin Hearn : Thanks Ann.Chris Thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Jeff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeff Meacham : Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. I had two on Alzheimer's probably for Dan. For donanemab, would you expect completion of the rolling submission by the end of this year, and is there a regulatory threshold you need to hit in terms of the safety exposure, I'm just trying to think of the number of patients that you have to get exposed to it and then for Zachatenamab, what are the next steps here? Is it moving to another anti-tau asset altogether, or do you want to optimize monotherapy Zachatenamab, or maybe even move forward in combination with donanemab? Thank you. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Jeff. Dan. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Great. Thanks, Jeff for two good questions. The first is just on the timing of the completion of the donanemab rolling submission. I think you can assume we chose our words carefully here in the call prepared remarks on the timing, you're driving out like what's the regulatory hurdle with respect to safety exposures. You're right, that's the key gating factor on timing. You've heard we've enrolled a lot of patients in the clinical trials, including patients in safety addendum. So, we're extremely confident we'll reach that safety exposure hurdle.  I guess, looking forward, there's probably two risks or question marks. One is just around the timing of exactly when do databases get locked and data get cleaned and submitted to the FDA. So that's why we're a little vague on timing here. I think the second one of course that we don't know and won't know until all that data is in, is what are the safety that actually show. And so the assumption here, of course, is that they continue to be consistent with what we've seen in Phase 2. So if those things work out, then I think that'll be the opportunity to talk a little more specifically about the data.  With respect to zagotenemab, look, I think we have here a very potent anti-tau antibody designed against what we believe is an important species of aggregated tau delivered at a relatively high doses for any monoclonal antibody, and we were unable to slow the spread of tau progression in the brain. So as present, I don't see a path forward for this antibody and I would be reluctant to invest in really any anti -tau antibody, given what we've seen here, Tau is still a great target, it's just hard to hit it with a monoclonal antibody, I think, given that most of the tau that we care about is inside of cells. Jeff Meacham : Thank you. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Dan. Jeff, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : And then next caller is Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So my first question is, how are you preparing for the launch of Donanemab and Tirzepatide next year. And how should we think about the costs associated with that launch? And then 2nd question I had for you is, do you think it's the national coverage determination or the price of Aduhelm that is keeping doctors on the sidelines? Thanks. Kevin Hearn : Thanks. We'll go to Anat for the question on launch prep and the overall costs for both tirzepatide in donanemab how we think about that going into next year. And then we'll go to Ian for the question around the NCD and ADG home. Anat Ashkenazi : Sure. So as we're preparing to launch both these medicines, obvious 1 is in an area where we have significant commercial footprint, manufacturing scale up capabilities and the other 1 is an area we're currently building. So, we're investing in advancing both of these efforts forward preparing for potential launch of Tirzepatide mid next year, and then a regulatory decision on donanemab by the second half of next year. Those will be factored into the guidance that we will provide on December 15th as we go into -- as we go into next year. But rest assured we're building the commercial footprint that we needed to launch these effectively and leveraging the existing footprint we have as well. Kevin Hearn : Thanks Anat. Ann? Anne: Well, it's a good question that you've asked and I -- I do think there's a number of things that are challenged here. I think as you look at donanemab what's incredibly important is that we had a positive phase 2 study that cleanly met its primary endpoint, showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, as well we're able to share that we had limited duration dosing to plaque clearance and so we believe that this is going to be important for the decisions that physicians and payers make. So I believe the donanemab data is incredibly strong. And then as I said, following quickly the Phase 3 confirmatory data, which I think is important, and all of this being published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So as we're talking to thought leaders and physicians, I do believe that they see the strength of the data that we brought forward in donanemab, and I think that's been a challenge that they've had with some of the competitive space. So I do think that data is one thing on their minds. I think it's well the NCD is playing a role, obviously that will be resolved before we launch and that will be ready for any of the potential out comes there. And I have been working closely with them along the way to make sure that they understand the donanemab data, particularly the rapid clearing of plaques as well as the limited duration dosing that offers we think benefit to them as well. So, it's been a good conversation with them. So far, we really look forward to seeing what they have to say CMS has the same in January and then launching with the strong datasets as Dan said in the second half of next year. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Dan. Lousie, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Hi. Thank you. I have a couple of questions on the pending in CD by CMS. So 2 questions. First, it's commonly said that this upcoming decision will pertain to the whole ABA class. I struggle to see how that can realistically be the case, because that decision will be made on only 1 Company's mixed Phase 3 data, and there's still other really important informative Phase 3 datasets that are on the come. So wouldn't be NCD, whatever it is initially potentially be revised later as CMS has more information from these additional trials. And then second, if this is indeed a decision that pertains to the whole class, and presumably Lilly has a view on what will happen in January. Do you expect CMS will say that Aduhelm and the class more broadly should be covered in a way that will be commercially meaningful. One can envision that there could be lots of restrictions that might impact to limit the commercial market opportunities. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Sam, we'll go to Ann for those questions on the NCD process. Anne: Well, thanks. Good questions on the process for the NCD. So CMS has been clear that the NCD, as they are running the process is to cover the class. Now as I said, we are actively participating in the process, including we provided oral comments in July. And additional written comments in August, and we and I'm sure others as well have been meeting with CMS throughout the process to share our specific data and ensure that the differences in these medicines are understood. And so we've asked them really to evaluate each drug based on their own data. And this is, I think, as I said, particularly important considering that there are some differences between these. We share the data later in the air subsequent to the original readout that the degree of donanemab plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit which I know is very important to CMS in this decision as well as the limited duration dosing. So we really look forward to seeing what they have to say in January, and what readout will look like. We do acknowledge there's a lot of skepticism in the national discussion. And so we do really hope and we'll continue to influence that we think it's drugs should be evaluated by CMS, by payers and prescribers on their own data. It is possible that NCD, the NCD will narrow for the patients most likely the benefit that's a possibility out of this. But that's really aligned with the goals that we've had on our clinical trial designs, which has long been to use the diagnostic tools to make sure that the right patients are getting treatment. So we'll look forward to the readout in January. We'll continue to stay very engaged in this. And yes, I believe as additional data comes out, our data and others in the class, that this will continue to influence the process. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, An. Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : The noise coming out of Washington suggests that the Peter's Bill, some of the components of that are gaining traction on some of them are worrying components of price negotiations seem to be more and more limited. I just wonder if you could share any thoughts on what you think, just take the Peter's proposal on out-of-pocket carbs could mean to Lilly and the farmer in terms of increased volume without catastrophic coverage changes. And then second, could you comment on whether you're seeing mutualization of donanemab by the antibody drug antibodies that you see with prolonged usage. And is this one of the factors which is contributing to the finite treatment duration or is neutralization simply not a concern here? Kevin Hearn : Thanks Andrew and Dave for the first question and Dan for the second. David Ricks : Thanks, Andrew, for the question. Obviously, there's a lot of talking and discussing going on in Washington about how to Mig medicines more affordable. I think we've been pretty consistent in our view that both as Lilly and I think I can speak for the industry here we are for progress. We're not for the status quo and the centerpiece of almost every part of legislation being discussed which is I think good news for seniors is some reform to the Part D benefit. That is certainly highlighted in representative Peter's Bill. It's in HR-19, it was in the aggressive widen effort. It's I'm sure in the Senate Finance effort now, and I think that's good news. The contours of that are all kind of different, but the general idea is that industry would pay additional costs into the system, that that would reduce monthly out-of-pocket costs, both below and above the catastrophic phase cap -- catastrophic costs as well as eliminate the donut hole.  I think we're basically for all those things and we think that's a good set of initiatives. Where the debate sort of kicks in is around how to pay for that, or whether pay for from the industry should go to other healthcare priorities. And of course, we have clear positions on that. One piece of Peter's Bill we don't like is the retroactive CPI Cap. I think that's punitive and unfair. It also is disproportionate on some types of medicines versus others. So I think the industry is aligned, [indiscernible] we don't care for that. Although in general, the idea of a CPI regulator on forward price increases is something people have gotten used to talking about.  And then the thing we do, put our foot down and firmly opposed and why we're so against HR3 and other efforts, is taking money out of the pharmaceutical industry for other priorities. Isn't drug pricing a big enough problem? Why don't we take the money out of pharmaceutical industry and give it to patients who want to buy our medicines. And that's a position we've had for a long time. I think it's been a busy week and into next week, probably negotiating out this package, but we're hopeful that some of these messages are resonating and we could land with a Part D reform and modest impact on the industry so we can keep innovating for the future. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Dave, Dan. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Andrew for the question on anti-drug antibodies or ADA's. We do see ADA's with donanemab, they arise pretty early in treatment. There's no connection though with the ADA and our decision on fixed duration dosing. The reason for that is because the doses that we're using are so much higher than the level of anti-drug antibodies that we don't see an effect in our clinical trials that these doses of the ADA's on PK or importantly on PD, which is the plaque clearance effect of donanemab, so no connection there. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Dan. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities, please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks for the questions. So maybe first on the performance of Verzenio in the quarter and then your conviction that this market can accelerate moving forward now with the Ki-67 approval. We're hearing good things from physicians, but it just doesn't seem to be reflected in the opportunity that I think we all see ahead for Verzenio. And then as a separate question, I'm sure Mike Mason is tracking the opportunity in obesity very closely. Just wondering what feedback is on the types of patients that are going on to [indiscernible] at this point and how Lilly is thinking about the opportunity in obesity, given the attempted acceleration of the launch of Tirzepatide with the PRB. And obviously, that's in diabetes. but just wondering when we might see a full launch in obesity, given all the trials. Thanks. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Jake for the question on Verzenio and then Mike for the question on Tirzepatide. Jake Van Arden : Thanks, Seamus. So just starting with Verzenio performance in the quarter. As you probably remember, we had some stocking that happened in the channel in the second quarter, and so part of what happened this quarter is just a modest work down of that inventory. I think the fundamentals of where we stand in the metastatic setting continue to look really strong. I like where we are in terms of NBRX share hopping around 30% hopefully we can continue to grow that. I think that we still haven't seen the entire class of CDK46 inhibitors returns of pre - COVID levels of prescriptions. And so that's obviously an important lever for growth going forward. Probably levered to things like mammogram volumes and other types of preventative care measures that get patients diagnosed and into doctor's offices. But we continue to grow our share of NBRX within the market. Turning to Adjuvan, obviously, we're very excited about launching this medicine for men and women with early breast cancer specifically Ki-67 high patients. It's a real opportunity as I think you've probably heard say before. It's about 8,000-10,000 patients. It's obviously a smaller opportunity than the entire study population that we enrolled in monarchy. And as you know, we'll be looking -- again, next year will be the next analysis of survival to potentially expand to that broader population, should OS trend in the direction that we and FDA want to see to do that. But we have a great opportunity ahead of us. I think certainly it's growth from where we stand today. It's a brand-new indication of real size in terms of both patient numbers and duration. In many ways, that -- realizing that is also linked to the prior comments I made about patients returning to the doctor for preventative care to get diagnosed at levels, hopefully that return to pre -COVID. We don't need that obviously to make headway going into next year, but I think for the long term, it's important for patients to make sure they get into the physician's office to get diagnosed. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Jake, Mike. Mike B Mason : Hi, Seamus. First of all, you are 100% right. We're looking very closely at the obesity opportunity for Tirzepatide. We're very excited about the weight loss that we solve in type 2 diabetes patients, of up to 14% weight loss, and the potential of that being even higher in the obesity population. Obviously, just a massive unmet need 110 million Americans live with obesity. Only about 3% of them are treated with some type of anti-obesity medication. So we think the opportunity is huge to really help people who live with chronic weight management issues. Now, with our program, we have four trials in us surmount obesity registration program.  Our first obesity trial will read out next year or SURMOUNT-1 We're very excited to see that that should happen in mid next year. And then, SURMOUNT-1 2, 3, and 4, we'll get the day of those trials are on track to wrap up in 23. And then so when you look at our obesity submission and approval, it looks like our approval in 2024 is most likely outcome. If everything goes well as we expect in our SURMOUNT program. So very excited about -- with all these launches. I think they've done a nice job. I think not a surprise to us. We thought that what was holding back the current market was just the current products in the marketplace just didn't have clinically meaningful enough weight loss.  We thought if we had products on the marketplace that had clinically meaningful weight loss and those products were able to show good, clinical outcomes, overall medical outcomes for those living with obesity, that position for [ inaudible 00 :56:27] and payers would provide access for it. So it's not going to develop overnight, but we're very encouraged by the early launch and we go big, and just very excited about Tirzepatide 's opportunity. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Mike, Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Umer Raffat from Evercore, please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Dan, I was very intrigued by the donanemab versus Aducanumab head-to-head trial. And my question really was I understand the primary endpoints on amyloid plaque. But will the trial be able to gauge clinical efficacy on endpoints like CDR, some of the boxes. I ask because it's -- my understanding it's an open-label trial. And then secondly, I feel like there's been a fair amount of investor debate and perhaps confusion on what exactly is Lilly messaging on the Innovent PD-1 launch in U.S. And the sort of debate rages anywhere from Lilly will be a dominant player or not so much. So just so we're all on the same page, I guess, what are you guys expecting and do you expect it to be a meaningful PD-1 in the U.S. market? And if you could speak to your thoughts on whether data generated in Chinese patients would be a relevant commercial consideration for U.S. oncologists are not? Kevin Hearn : Thanks Umer. We go to Dan for the first question and Jake for the second. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks. Our question is whether the Nan members that it can amount trial head-to-head trial, will be powered to measure clinical efficacy outcomes. It will not be. It is a small and a shorter trial. So we won't be able to draw conclusions about that. But I'd point out that if we believe that plaque Luring is the appropriate surrogate and that question will certainly be answered in the next year to 18 months as we get data from a number of Phase three plaque-lowering drugs, so if it turns out that plaque lowering is an appropriate surrogate for predicting clinical efficacy, then I think that the degree and speed of plaque lowering could be the basis of comparison across different Alzheimer's drugs in the same way that surrogates in oncology to used to compare different drugs in a class, knowing that the long-term outcome trials would have to be extremely large and long duration, powered for clinical outcomes. I also sort of point out that we we're expecting here to have in the scenario where we're really excited about this, we're expecting to have a positive Phase 3 trial for donanemab, which in itself is a differentiator, I think from current competitors. So head-to-head on efficacy against Adjuvan may not actually be relevant. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Dan. Jake. Jake Van Arden : Hey, Umer, thanks for the question. So Sintilimab, the PD-1 inhibitor from Innovent, we brought in to the Company in terms of ex-China right explicitly with the intent to use pricing as a lever to disrupt the U.S. market starting with the United States and potentially moving to Europe as well. And as we've said publicly over the past couple of months, the intent there is really through price predominantly versus other mechanisms such as rebating etc. There are certain customers out there, certain practices, and care models for which this is going to be an attractive tool for lowering costs to their system. And Unfortunately for the way the system is designed today, they are going to be many channels for which a lower-priced option actually isn't appealing. And so as you -- your question was about whether or not we intend to be a dominant player? It's hard for me to say that with any degree of assertion today. We will be focusing, initially, on the segments for which this is an attractive option, given the way that their payer dynamics work. And today that's not a majority by any stretch, but that will be our focus out of the [indiscernible] should [ inaudible 01 :00:27] be approved. Onto your second question about whether or not the data package that's been generated for the agent will have issues with prescribers in the United States. Our market research today suggests this won't be an issue.  But obviously we haven't launched the product yet, we haven't gotten it approved yet, so I can't say that with certainty that our market research suggests it won't be an issue. But really in front of us initially is just getting the drug approved, and I think as you know, that's something we hope for in the early part of next year. But the drug will be subject to an advisory committee and we await the details of what that will cover. Umer Raffat : Super helpful. Thank you so much. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Jake. Umer, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Ronny Gal : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Two of those, first thing with Umar's points around Sintilimab in the U.S. Essentially two parts on this one. First, any comments about FDA change in policy and use in China only patient population as basis of Commission, the United States, we've heard some things and conferences that suggest that might be some change there. And second, on the same point, you've kind of talked about price as the dominant note here. I guess the question is more around you thinking process You know, pharma has struggled for a long time in commercializing low-cost products and innovative products to the same Company. If PD1 should have a low-cost option, why not pulp why not lebrikizumab why should those not follow a deep discounting strategy giving the clinical profile versus other products in the same class. And 2nd question, given the recent impact of interchangeable Lantus, can you discuss a little bit how the insulin their fast-acting insulin market is different, assuming we will see interchangeable products there, how are the features of the market differ? And would that also be a market which is more amenable to adopting any interchangeable insulin? Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Dave for the 1st couple of questions around low - cost entrants and FDA policy, and then we'll go to Mike for the question on the interchangeability of Lantus and how that can potentially [ inaudible 01 :02:41] a fast-acting insulin. David Ricks : Sure. Happy to. Maybe before we go to me, Jake do you have any comments on the FDA comments on China data? Jake Van Arden : Yeah. I think it's a good observation. We've observed the same thing. The tone from DC does seem to have changed a bit over the past 18 months on this topic. So I think we're hearing and reading in some ways, probably the same things that you guys are. We don't have a lot more information than that. And so we await again the regulatory decision from FDA as to the acceptability of the package. David Ricks : As it relates, Ronny, to the broader question about why not more everyday low-priced strategies in the main and pharmaceuticals. I mean, I think a couple of things come to mind here. First, I think in oncology in particular, it is infeasible quite often to run comparative studies. And so once an incumbent is established, it's very difficult to displace that incumbent. Maybe the one narrow exception might be what Jake highlighted with Sintilimab where you could have a more price-sensitive segment. And here we have analogous data from a different country that was conducted in a time-gap that was prior to other PD-1s being approved in that setting. And so that presents an opportunistic play.  We have of course also pursued this in insulin and Mike can comment on that in a second. But basically, our launch to the 30% discount to the other insulin glargine. We've pursued our own low-cost authorized generic of Humalog, now reducing the price to effectively 70% off the original brand. But here again, it illustrates the point Jake was making is that even in the retail side, it's not universally adopted. Today the half-price form of Humalog and the third off-price of insulin glargine that we provide have minority market shares and that's a little bit counter-intuitive. But of course, we all know the incentives of the supply chain which do tend to favor higher list price products, and that's I think where that shows up. Finally, you asked why don't we pursue this for our whole portfolio?  Well, I think the overriding thought for our portfolio was often to create differentiated datasets. And 1 thing different from [indiscernible] different from [indiscernible] and authorize generic, Humalog is that those aren't differentiated datasets. So they're more or less interchangeable. So when we create a new medicine, we're seeking to create something better. And in the main, that's how the system is set up and that favors typically an introductory price that's similar to other innovative competitors and then rebating and discounting to the channel to get formulary access and use. And that remains our main strategy.  Of course, if there were some big policy shifts that flattened gross to net or reduced, somehow, the incentives of intermediaries, we'd take a look at that. I think our goal would be to deliver lower cost points to consumers if we could. Right now, mostly the system rewards something else and that's how we are forward planning for the portfolio that Dan was talking about. Maybe Mike has any final comments on insulin and interchangeability. Mike B Mason : Yeah. Thanks, Dave. First of all, when we look at Semglee, it's only interchangeable with the reference product, which is Lantus, not Basaglar, so we do think it's going to have a more of an impact on Lantus versus Basaglar. I mean, you look at the mill time segments, that first reference product will be insulin aspart, not LifePro (PH). Now I think you also have to take a look at the assemblies interchangeable biosimilar. I think many stakeholders in Washington believe that Semglee interchangeable insulin would launch at a significant discounted price. Now, that hasn't been the case. The net impact of assembly\u2019s interchange will launch is actually the introduction of a higher-priced presentation, not a lower-price presentation. The new presentation is priced at $269 a vial versus $99 a vial of the original singly, which is a 273% increase. So I think what you're not going to see, at least what we haven't seen in the insulin biosimilar space is that the Semglee interchangeable will we're really disrupt the basal insulin market. Rather, what we'll do is allow it to compete and kind of their traditional healthcare system that we know have gaps which we talked about earlier and which we've been trying to fill with our insulin value program and the senior savings model. When you look at in kind of pivot to the mealtime insulin market, mealtime insulin is a bit more complicated. They require more presentations than what you see with a basal insulin. So, premixes are human insulin are also included on the contract. So I think the mealtime insulin is a little bit different than what you see on the basal insulin. But what we've seen to-date is that given [indiscernible] and our price point on interchangeability, we don't think it's going to be really disruptive to the system, but more work within the current system, which we feel that we can strongly defend. At the end of day, I think, to reiterate Dave 's point, I think it's better when we're focused on improvements. and with our Connected Care launch with BIF, with our weekly basal insulin, I think we're focused on really driving innovation and better patient outcomes. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Mike. Ronny, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Kerry Holford : Hi. Thank you. 2 questions [ inaudible 01 :08:42] price. The increase in demand this quarter. Was that [indiscernible][ inaudible 01 :08:53] When you [indiscernible] higher [indiscernible] So [indiscernible] just talk a bit more about the dynamics [indiscernible] [indiscernible] in any way the upcoming Adjuvan launch. Then secondly, on the Adjuvan Situation [indiscernible] has commented on that call earlier today that the the FDA has stated into them, to mentioned the base with an idea [indiscernible] will be sufficient as long as in their debt effect on the risk making a bad thing to your experience. There be more relaxed approach in the FDA. [indiscernible] I'm just curious as to why you think there might be anything that you can give there. Thank you. David Ricks : Kerry, you were kind of breaking in and out, but I think these are for Jake. And the 1st question, Jake, if you didn't catch it, was about quarter-on-quarter revenue And whether that was affected by pricing in CDK46th market or rather the stocking point you made earlier. And then I think the 2nd point was about IDFS versus OS in the FDA 's policy [indiscernible] that. Jake Van Arden : Yes. Thanks. On the 1st point, yes. I mean, the sequential quarters are really mostly related to the inventory stocking and destocking point that I made earlier. We haven't seen a ton of fluctuation in price. On your comment about Adjuvan, I can't comment on the back and forth that Novartis had with FDA, just obviously not privy to that. Though from what you -- the framing of your question, that actually doesn't sound particularly different than the conversation that we've had with the agency. As Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've of course, as you can imagine, gotten a fair number of questions from folks around the nature of the approval in the subgroup versus the enrolled population among RD.  And we'll be publishing in the coming days, the actual OS overall survival data that were part of the regulatory submission. You'll see what those trends look like in both the intent-to-treat population as well as the approved subset. And again, trends in one direction or another that you'll be able to interpret for yourself. But I don't -- from what I can hear, I don't think the Novartis feedback from the agency is all that different from what we've received. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Jake. Carrie (ph), thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities, please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a couple of other topics discussed as much. So one on Emgality. It feels like the CGR P markets has been impacted by COVID more than some others. Maybe you could just sort of give us a sense of the dynamics you're seeing there. And have you seen any impact from the oral CGRPs that have entered or preventing. Is that at any role on Emgality or on the class in the last few months? And then the second one just on the Jake side, obviously, a lot of focus on the FDA, their updates on that space. I'm curious if you have any updated timing around when you expect a new, final updated label for Olumiant in RA and/or a decision on the atopic dermatitis applications. Thank you. Kevin Hearn : We'll go to answer the question on Emgality and Patrick for the question on Olumiant. Anne: Great. Well, thanks for the question on Emgality. So at present, what we've seen is the total migraine prescription market has seen growth but it's driven primarily by the total acute new patient starts and additional concomitant use. With the injectable class, I do think that we're still experiencing headwinds from the pandemic and increased competition in the prevention space overall. We do see some variability of this across the markets, some OUS markets are returning really to pre - COVID growth levels. And while we've seen improvement in the volume of new patient starts, the CGRP MAB class in the U.S. is still about 13% below where we were with the start of the pandemic. So with the new competition and then appropriate treatment for acute and prevention, we're seeing that the market should continue to grow as patient's reengage in the system.  On your question on oral impact, I think it's still a bit early to -- early days in the launches to see how this has impacted the space in this way. So we'll watch that carefully. I think our belief is that with so many patients and so much unmet need, the opportunity for these medicines, particularly the MAB,remains significance. And obviously in the end it comes down to what's best for that patient and how we get them to their migraine-free days. And that's one place that we think we believe [indiscernible] has an advantage. So, we'll continue to watch this space. We continue to believe in the efficacy that [indiscernible]brings to the market. And so, you'll see us continue to push forward in supporting the product. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, An. Patrick? Patrick Johnson : Well, thank you very much. In terms of the question related to rheumatoid arthritis, the FDA has requested changes to the box warning for all JAK inhibitors to include serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and deaths. And we believe in life about its most likely that the JAKs will be placed off of the biologic source of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. And that's Mediamath Olumiant is currently played in the U.S. so we don't see any major impact on Olumiant driven by this change. When we moved our atopic dermatitis, we know about the FDA meets their PDUFA due to the ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. And we believe also here, it's most likely above the JAK inhibitors, will end up being placed off to the biologics. Despite that, we also recognize that atopic dermatitis is a very heterogeneous disease. And our clinicians have a use for more tools in the toolbox, but that's what we believe is most likely moving forward. And we would expect some regulatory actions prior to the end of this year. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Patrick, Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first for Dan, just coming back to the head-to-head study. I don't think I've heard you say yet the time period in which you going to be measuring these reductions in amyloid. I believe you did give up second half, '22 a timeline for reading out the result. But, should we be thinking about that as like a three-month or six-month time point or just the number of patients that get to below the lower limit of detection over some period. And then maybe for Jake, on the third class, I know you guys have expressed some cautiousness on the role of [indiscernible] -- in the treatment paradigm in the past, we started to see some of the later stage data roll out from some of your competitors. Wanted to get your latest thoughts there. And if we might start to see some of your third combination data from the original EMBER study before year-end. Thank you. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Carter. We'll go to Dan to the 1st question on the Aducanumab head-to-head and then Jake for the 2nd. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks for your question, Carter. I think you're appropriately pointing out that actually both things matter in terms of plaque clearance, how fast you clear the plaques, and also how deep you clear the plaques. I think in the fullness of time when we have Phase 3 readouts for multiple drugs that look at efficacy, I predict those would be 2 important predictor factors and how well a drug helps patients is, how quickly and how deeply it clears plaques. I think we have significant [indiscernible] there in both aspects with donanemab. So you can be sure we'll be looking at both of those things and reporting that out as I said in the back-half of next year. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Dan. Jake. Jake Van Arden : Yeah. Thanks for the questions about their old cert program. We're looking forward to seeing the radius Menarini data at San Antonio as I'm sure you are. That's studies. are a little interesting and that is very heavily enriched for ESR-1 mutated tumors. And so, we're interested in seeing the degree to which the effect size observed in the study was really driven by that enriched subgroup where you would expect an outsized effect size versus a drug like fulvestrant versus in the non ESR-1 mutant patients. I think that question has meaningful read-through as to the overall value of the class. If it's really just limited or driven by the ESR-1 mutants. I think that's a very different proposition than a true all-comer effect size. As it relates to the combination data of ours, that -- those are data we'll probably present next year. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Jake. Carter, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. First, is it not possible for Lilly to file Tirzepatide for obesity in 2022 on just the SURMOUNT-1 Trial with supporting weight loss data from the diabetes trials? Other follow-on indications for other drugs have been approved on one study, and SURMOUNT-1 is a trial of 2,400 patients, so it's a big trial. Second question, are you planning to use blood-based biomarkers such as P-tau217 as companion diagnostics with the -- or within the donanemab filing? I think you have used the [indiscernible] diagnostic in the Trailblazer trials. So wondering if that's part of the filing. Thank you. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Mike for the question on Tirzepatide and then Dan for the question on the [indiscernible] and submission of donanemab. Mike? Mike B Mason : Yes, Steve good question. We -- in our discussions with the FDA, we've agreed upon 4 trials for the [indiscernible]program that make up our submission for the obesity indication for Tirzepatide. As I said earlier, those will read out -- SURMOUNT-1 will read out next year, SURMOUNT 2, 3, and 4 readout in '23 and we'll submit and expect approval in '24. Based on conversation with the FDA, when we set our development program, that's the current plan. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Mike. Dan. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks, too. Good question on companion diagnostics and their role in FDA approval of Alzheimer's drugs. I think based on what we've seen with ADU are base case expectation here is that the FDA is operating under an assumption that standard of care now for Alzheimer's disease, if you are diagnosing efficient for Alzheimer should include BioMark or confirmation of disease. So for that reason, my guess is that they won't be -- BiMark won't be included in prescribing information as companion diagnostics. I would take the opposite position probably with payers where I think they are likely to be required before reimbursement for these medicines but that has to has to be worked out.  So those assumptions I just laid out sort of underlie our thinking about how P-Tau or Amyvid or any other biomarkers, CSF beta will be incorporated into labels, probably not a d into practice, probably yes. And so we're proceeding accordingly to make sure that P-Tau 2017 is as well as other biomarkers can be widely available around the same time as we launched donanemab, so that it can be incorporated into the standards of clinical practice. As a biomarker for detecting Alzheimer's pathology and trashing patients to therapy. Kevin Hearn : And thanks, Stan, Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Operator Instructions] Matthew Harrison : Okay. Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could comment on lebrikizumab and your sort of views on the market., and in particular, now that you've seen the Ox40 data from Amgen KK, if that has any impact on how you think about the longer-term potential of that market. Thanks. Kevin Hearn : Thanks. Matthew will go to Patrick for the question on lebrikizumab. Patrick Johnson : Well, thank you very much for the question. We're very encouraged by the induction that [indiscernible] lebrikizumab, where we saw more than 50% of patients treated with lebrikizumab achieving an EASI-75 and that we'll also met all the key secondary endpoints and we actually believe that we have an opportunity here to launch a best-in-class [indiscernible]]. And currently we are looking forward to the 52 weeks based on [indiscernible] top of 2022 and a potential submission the second half of next year. When it comes [indiscernible]? days, it doesn't change our outlook for lebri.  As I share, we believe we have a best-in-class IL-13. And we also believe that we have a very competitive asset with the market leader. And base d in a market that we know there is a big unmet need, and by logic, penetration is still very low, and we know that there is a need for many more medications and particularly with the heterogenous need in the marketplace. Kevin Hearn : Thanks, Patrik. Matthew, thanks for your question. We'll wrap up our Q&A. Go to Dave for our close. David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our Company. We continue to grow our broad commercial portfolio with strong momentum in our core business, supported by many key brands and accelerating classes. This is complemented by a compelling pipeline with industry-leading opportunities. And we remain focused on bringing new medicines to patients and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Thanks again for dialing in. And please follow-up with Investor Relations. if you have any questions we did not address on the call and hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q4 2021 Earnings Call. I\u2019m Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and President of Lilly Oncology; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We are also joined by Lauren Zierke, KentoUeha and Sara Smith of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave. David Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. 2021 was another outstanding year for Lilly as we delivered strong top and bottom-line growth and positive pivotal readouts for five important assets with the potential to launch in the next two years. As we move into 2022, we continue to build on this foundation and are determined to deliver on our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth, expand operating margins and innovate to develop and launch new medicines for patients that address significant unmet needs. Unpacking our 2021 performance on Slide 4, you can see the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables. Q4 revenue was 8% and was driven by volume growth of 11%. While when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the full-year. This volume-driven performance is attributable to our key growth products, which grew by 28% and now account for 61% of our core business in Q4. On our non-GAAP, gross margin was 76.1% in Q4, a decrease of approximately 250 basis points, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 antibodies, which have a lower gross margin profile. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%, representing a decrease of approximately 130 basis points as a result of the lower gross margin percent just mentioned. For pipeline milestones, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call, including additional positive Phase III readouts for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. The initiation of a rolling submission in the U.S. for pertibrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and our submission of bebtelizumab to the FDA for emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value and recently announced our plans to make significant investments in new manufacturing sites in both North Carolina and Ireland. These investments will bolster the resilience and capacity of our supply chain as we launch new products to drive meaningful long-term growth. In addition, this quarter, we announced a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities as we continue to augment internal discovery capabilities. Finally, on financials, we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fourth consecutive year. And in Q4, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed another $750 million in share repurchases. Moving to Slides 5 and 6, you will see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and COVID-19 therapy updates we are discussing today or that were part of the discussion during our December 15 Investment Community Meeting. So now I will turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full-year 2021 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q4, revenue grew 8% and revenue, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, increased 6%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Full-year revenue growth was 10% on that latter basis. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 250 basis points to 76.1% in Q4. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies, with shipments this quarter of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, also having lower gross margin profile compared to bevalinuzumab sales in the base period. Total operating expenses grew 5% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D expenses increased 7%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage pipeline opportunities, including donanemab, pirtobrutinib and tirzepatide, which were partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. We invested approximately $40 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q4, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $400 million for the full-year. Operating income increased 3% compared to Q4 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 31.7% for the quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points. This decrease was driven by lower gross margin percent, partially offset by lower marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Full-year operating margin was 29.9%, in line with our expectations. Other income and expense was an expense of approximately $7 million this quarter compared to an expense of $31 million in Q4 2020. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 10.3%, a decrease of 280 basis points driven primarily by net discrete tax benefits. At the bottom line, we delivered solid growth as earnings per share - 8% in Q4 and 20% for the full-year. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth seen across key geographies. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 13%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This growth driven by volume was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. The net price decline of 2% in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower realized prices for insulins, primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. For the full-year, our U.S. net price decrease of 1% was in line with our expectations. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4 declined 3% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta, revenue grew 11% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio. We are encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe, and expect continued growth excluding Alimta. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 14% in constant currency. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity including Cymbalta and Alimta as well as by the COVID pandemic. With key growth products now representing 56% of total Japan revenue, we expect to return to growth beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 13% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume from our continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity as well as the timing of supply for Cialis through the third-party selling the product. Q4 revenue growth was negatively affected by the updated 2022 NRDL price reductions on inventory already in the channel especially for Tyvyt. In 2022, we expect the NRDL price reduction headwind largely offset volume growth in Q1, but we also expect volume growth to accelerate throughout the year and exceed the impact of these price reductions. Moving forward, we are excited about the significant growth we are seeing in China, over 40% in constant currency in 2021, with improved access expected to continue to drive future growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by sales of neuro medicine. We continue to expect a mid-single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan. In China, the expanded NRDL access for our products should lead to significant volume increase, but also high double-digit decline in price. As a result, we expect total company net price decline in the high single digit in 2022. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effect on revenue for all 2021, which shows strong double-digit volume-driven revenue growth across most major geographies. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 14 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to bolster our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated over $4.2 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue. In Q4, these newer medicines grew by 28% and Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are particularly pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and the SGLT2 classes, where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders. We are also encouraged by the strong uptake of Verzenio we saw in Q4, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2021, we invested 9.3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately 3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.3 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to fund our marketed products and expected launches, invest in our pipeline, evaluate opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 13 is our 2022 financial guidance we issued in December. As I shared then, the financial impact from the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in Europe and Japan will continue in the first half of 2022. While the impact from Alimta\u2019s U.S. patent expiry will start with the limited launch from a single generic company in Q1 before the full launch of additional generic entrants starting in Q2. We expect roughly 375 million of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies in Q1 from the shipment of the remaining doses attributable to last November\u2019s U.S. Government Purchase Agreement. We continue to invest in our bright future, advance in promising R&D opportunities and preparing for exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline, which we believe will help drive top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline. Daniel Skovronsky : Thank you, Anat. 2021 was a remarkable year for Lilly\u2019s pipeline. We delivered positive data on 5 molecules : tirzepatide, tenenumab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, all of which have the potential to launch in the next two years, and we are excited about the potential of these molecules hold for patients. In addition, we launched and submitted several key new indications for in-market products, including important new indications for Verzenio and Jardiance. And also, we advanced our early-stage pipeline. Just a few weeks-ago, we provided an extensive R&D update across our therapeutic areas and shared our excitement about the next wave of innovation coming from Lilly. As a result, today\u2019s R&D update will be brief and focus on the progress we have made since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 31, and Slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2021 key events and potential key events for 2022. In Diabetes, with the recent submission in Japan, we have now submitted tirzepatide across all major geographies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We look forward to potential approvals for this important medicine this year. We anticipate U.S. regulatory action in type 2 diabetes as well as the top line readout from SURMOUNT-1, both by midyear. In Japan, we submitted Jardiance for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and received approval for Jardiance for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Moving to Oncology. We shared encouraging updated data at ASH for pirtobrutinib for both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. We continue to progress this molecule and initiated another Phase III study in first-line CLL comparing pirtobrutinib to chemoimmunotherapy. During our December meeting, we also announced the initiation of a rolling submission for pirtobrutinib for MCL in the U.S. We plan to complete this submission this year with anticipated regulatory action in early 2023, and we are excited to potentially bring this important medicine to patients on this accelerated timeline. For Verzenio, we received approval for high-risk early breast cancer in Japan for the Cohort 1 population study to monarchE and are pleased that this approval represents 90% of the intent-to-treat population. We have also made the difficult decision to terminate further enrollment in the Phase III study of Verzenio for HER2 positive early breast cancer in response to the changing treatment landscape and global enrollment challenges. Importantly, this decision does not change our commitment to and investment in breast cancer. In addition, we began a Phase III study for selpetatinib for the treatment of adjuvant RET-positive non-small cell lung cancer and we also dosed the first patient in the U.S. trial of our BCL-2 inhibitor. In Immunology, we announced positive top line data for our Phase III maintenance study of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. We are pleased that the study met all primary and key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to submissions in the first half of this year. We also announced positive top line Phase III results for lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, and we are encouraged that data to date has demonstrated a competitive profile for treatment of atopic dermatitis. We await maintenance data for lebrikizumab in the first half of this year in advance of global submissions, which are expected by the end of 2022. Moving to baricitinib. We announced last week that based on top line efficacy results from two Phase III trials, we have decided to discontinue the Phase III development program for lupus. For atopic dermatitis in the U.S., we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA, but do not have alignment with the agency on the indicated population, which could possibly lead to a complete response letter. We expect regulatory action for this indication very soon. Finally, we have submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in the U.S. and hope it will become the first medicine approved for patients living with this disease later this year. In our early phase immunology portfolio, we started a new Phase I study for CD19 antibody and we have discontinued our oral IL-17 inhibitor. Moving to neurodegeneration. In our early-phase pipeline, we announced that we have received breakthrough therapy designation for N3pG4, an additional amyloid lowering agent for which we intend to initiate pivotal trials by the end of this year. We have evidence that this therapy is completely and rapidly cleared amyloid plaque and we are exploring flexible dosing regimens, including subcutaneous dosing. For the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we also began a Phase II trial for our oglic/nacase inhibitor, an oral small molecule targeting tau. While donanemab has been a primary focus for investors, we are pleased with the continued clinical advancement of the rest of our neurodegeneration pipeline. Now turning to donanemab, in December, we initiated two additional Phase III studies, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, our prevention study for asymptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease; and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head plaque clearance study compared to add-a-helm. It has been less than one year since we published a positive randomized controlled TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, which demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits on endpoints of cognition and function. Since then, we have focused investors on the need for replication from our well-designed expanded Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which is now fully enrolled and expected to read out in mid-2023. While a lot has happened in this space during this last year, and more events are likely before we get top line results next year, what hasn\u2019t changed for us is the importance of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout and our confidence in both donanemab and the unique study design. Given the impact of this devastating disease, we believe that if TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 provides positive confirmatory data, we can\u2019t see a scenario where there is not global reimbursement, patient access and broad use of donanemab. We noted last year that we had low expectations for the use of donanemab during the period between potential accelerated approval and the availability of confirmatory Phase III data in mid-2023. We are disappointed with the position that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has taken in its draft national coverage determination decision, and those low expectations could now extend for some months beyond the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout if reconsideration of CMS coverage determination is required, given historical timelines for this process. While the accelerated approval pathway was instituted by the FDA to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, hence providing valuable access to more patients faster than what is available under clinical trials, the NCD is currently written essentially negates that patient benefit in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Still, we intend to complete our application for accelerated approval for donanemab yet this year, but we now move completion of the accelerated approval submission out of Q1. We expect further volatility and expectations as competitor Alzheimer\u2019s disease trials read out prior to our definitive data. We remain confident in the differentiation of donanemab and in our uniquely designed TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. And importantly, the long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Lastly, with respect to our progress with COVID-19 therapies. Earlier this year, we submitted a request to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelimumab for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 and for patients at high risk for progression of severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. This is the third antibody we have developed for the treatment of COVID-19, and authentic virus and pseudovirus assays demonstrate that bebtelovimab retains neutralization activity against Omicron as well as all other known variants of concern. We have produced several hundred thousand doses of bebtelovimab and stand ready to supply as needed if this antibody receives EUA from the FDA. In addition, we have also submitted a supplemental NDA for baricitinib for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and expect regulatory action by the middle of this year. Baricitinib currently has an EUA for this indication. We are proud of the therapies we have delivered to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to do our part as public health needs emerge. In summary, Q4 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly, capping what was an outstanding year of pipeline progress on behalf of patients. Now I will turn the call back to Dave. David Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2021. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We continue to invest heavily in our pipeline and made significant progress in 2021 generating positive Phase III data for five new potential medicines : tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab that we expect we will launch in the next two years. We also delivered positive data and launched important new indications for Jardiance and Verzenio, while we continue to bolster our pipeline through business development with a focus on new modalities. Finally, we returned $4.35 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fourth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase. As we move into 2022, we are excited to continue the progress of turning pipeline value into cash flow, starting with the potential launch of tirzepatide and the submissions of donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. These opportunities remind us that our purpose has never been more relevant and highlight the promise of turning science into treatments or cures for some of the most challenging human diseases like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s, cancers and autoimmune disorders. We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the lives of millions of patients who rely on us and are confident in our business outlook. So now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. [Operator Instructions] Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we are ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : So first, Dan, can you just give us a little bit of the thought process for pushing out the accelerated filing for donanemab, it certainly makes sense. But how much did the NCD actually work into that calculus versus needs or requests from the agency for additional data? And then the second question, just really wanted to get a better understanding of where you guys think this SURMOUNT-1 data sets, where the thresholds would be. We are seeing 68-week data from Wegovy coming in at about 15% to 17% in a non-diabetic patient population. Just wanted to get a sense of some of the pushes and pulls that we should be thinking about in the context of the SURMOUNT-1 data set. Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. We will go to Dan for the question on accelerated approval timeline and then Mike Mason on expectations for SURMOUNT-1. Daniel Skovronsky : Thank you, Seamus. It is a good question. Look, I think, as I said, the purpose of accelerated approvals to try and get medicines and to help patients faster. Without access, that benefit is mainly negated, unfortunately, and clearly, a very frustrating period for patients to have approval of a drug and no reimbursement. So the CMS draft NCD proposal weighed heavily in our considerations around timing and clearly reduces some of the ability to help patients faster than we were hoping for the accelerated approval. With respect to the other part of your question, which is how about requests from the FDA or new data or anything like that, there are none of those factors here. We haven\u2019t had such requests. So it is really about CMS and about our own team\u2019s ability to just get all of the data together and get the right amount of safety data compiled in a way that the FDA can analyze. So we will continue to work towards accelerated approval yet this year, but no longer in Q1. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. We are excited to see this SURMOUNT-1 data. There is good theory on why someone who live with obesity would have greater weight loss on a product like tirzepatide than those that have type 2 diabetes. Those theories tend to play out when we looked at the novo semaglutides step program where those who didn\u2019t have type 2 diabetes had six or seven percentage points greater weight loss than those that had type 2 diabetes. We don\u2019t know what it is going to turn out to be for SURMOUNT-1. We do believe that it is going to be higher in the non-type 2 diabetes patient than what we saw in the SURPASS studies. Good thing is we don\u2019t have to wait too long for those results. We expect those in the first half of this year. And so we will be patient and look for the results. And I think we will be excited by what we see. Kevin Hern : Thanks Mike. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : And the next caller is Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Aaron Gal : Hi good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one is around the N3pG4 in RLAD, you are starting a second agent fairly quickly. Can you talk about other distinguishing features for this product versus donanemab. Is it just that removes BlackFester, also the others? For example, is it removing preferentially parenteral plaque versus vascular plaque. And the second, you kind of mentioned your expectation for the NCD, but can you confirm to us that you do not expect the NCD to materially change in its final form versus a draft form? And if you can talk a little bit about the process of requesting a change to that entity once we have confirmatory data for the amyloid beta removing drugs. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Ronny. We will go to Dan for the first question on N3pG4 and then Anne for the question on the NCD expectations. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Ronny. On N3pG4, originally, we started working on this molecule because of antidrug antibodies that we saw and continue to see against donanemab. Because of those ADAs, we have dosed donanemab at pretty high levels and that, in combination with the formulation of donanemab, have precluded the ability of generating a subcutaneous dosing form. So that was an important consideration of those two things, I would say, for development of N3pG4. It binds the same epitope as donanemab, so our understanding and data suggests that it clears exactly the same types of plaques. That is important to us. I think we have seen compelling efficacy here in TRAILBLAZER from donanemab, and we want more of the same in the next molecule. So no differences here in type of plaque. I think speed of plaque removal, our expectations are it should be similar to donanemab, which is to say, quite rapid. And the big advantage here is likely to be around dosing and administration. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Anne? Anne White : Well, thanks, Ronny. We believe more than likely, the final NCD in April may not change very much. Really what matters most to us is ensuring rapid availability of donanemab for patients with that confirmatory Phase III data. And so that is going to be our focus with CMS. We believe that well-designed and controlled registration trials like TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 should certainly provide sufficient evidence of clinical benefit for donanemab and that the CD is not needed or appropriate for donanemab. We are also going to see confirmation with CMS really to your question, once this Phase III efficacy and safety have been established, that donanemab and other medicines with this level of verified evidence, would be fully covered by CMS, and we want that path for this coverage to be clearly laid out. As Dan mentioned, it may take some months after the Tyvyt 2 readout to work through that, we will certainly focus on that. We have been and will continue to meet with CMS to make our points known and to work through what that process is. And I think as Dan alluded to, what we believe is that with Phase III confirmatory data and ultimately, an FDA traditional approval, we cannot envision a reason why CMS would treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease differently than any other class of medicines. I mean this would really be unprecedented. And I believe the pushback from the patient community from their caregivers and from those that advocate for them would be significant and CMS would have, we believe, no choice but to change it. So our focus is on that Phase III data. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Ronny, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : The next caller is Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : His great. thanks for taking the question. Maybe one follow-up on ondonanemab and then one other 1 unrelated. So in terms of - obviously, I appreciate what you are saying around the accelerated approval and kind of changing your time line there. I\u2019m just wondering what TRAILBLAZER 4 and if there is any reason, I\u2019m kind of wondering what the rationale for that trial is now given the limited uptake of Aduhelm to this point, we will get data later this year. But I\u2019m just wondering if it makes - if there is any sort of change in strategy or thinking around the need for that trial? And what exactly that might accomplish? And then my second question is sort of unrelated. You mentioned around Olumiant, the updates from last week, but you also have submitted for alopecia areata. I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit about what you see for the potential, I guess, for the JAK class overall in that space, but also for Olumiant, specifically, just given obviously the safety concerns we have seen around that product in the class from before? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Vamil. We will go to Dan for the question on TRAILBLAZER 4 I and then Patrik for your question on alopecia areata. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Vamil. You raised a good point on TRAILBLAZER 4, which is a head-to-head against Aduhelm. Of course, there was a lot of excitement in patient interest and investigator interest in this trial because there is two drugs compared to each other. So on the other hand, as you point out, from a commercial perspective, the importance of showing superiority to Aduhelm may have dramatically diminished. But that is okay. We are still committed to doing this trial. I think from a scientific perspective, there will be important conclusions. We have a hypothesis, for example, that the more rapid and deep plaque clearance could lead to greater improvements on biomarkers. I think those kinds of assessments can only be done in a head-to-head study. So this will still be an important contribution to our overall understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Patrik? Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much for the question. When we submitted Olumiant for alopecia areata to the FDA late last year, and it is now submitted post the European and the Japanese regulatory bodies, but are currently no treatments approved by alopecia areata, we have an opportunity here to be first in disease with Olumiant. And we have been encouraged with the data that we have seen from both BRAVE-1 and BRAVE-2, both based upon physician assessment as well as self assessment by patients. And that is truly an unmet need in this space. We have currently approximately 360,000 patients diagnosed in the U.S., and we believe that at least 100,000 of those would be eligible for the treatment with JAK. And based upon the profile that we have seen from other assets, we believe that we can launch here with a competitive profile to help patients with alopecia areata. Kevin Hern : Thanks Patrick. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. Operator : The next call is Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Stephen Scala : Thank you. I assume that you are deep in labeling discussions on tirzepatide. What questions is FDA asking? Are you anticipating the label to read that tirzepatide is a first-line injectable or for use after other injectables fail? And since another very well managed diabetes competitor has had supply issues, I\u2019m curious where tirzepatide is being manufactured and whether the plant has been inspected. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. We will go to Mike Mason for both of those questions. Michael Mason : Thanks, Steve, for the question. The tirzepatide submission in the U.S. is going quite well. No surprises in that. We are not getting any unusual questions. We are confident in our supply and confident in our supply chain, we will be ready for launch. We did a comprehensive studies for our SURPASS-5 pivotal studies for the U.S. So I think that will give us a broad label and the label we need for success. So I think are progressing quite nicely. We are quite confident going into our launch. Kevin Hern : Thanks Mike. Thanks for your question Steve. Next caller please. Operator : The next call is Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Schott : Great, thanks so much. Maybe just following up on the tirzepatide front. Can you just help maybe also set some expectations of the launch as we think about 2022 into 2023? So maybe specifically, how long should we think about post approval until you would expect broad coverage of tirzepatide? And when we maybe compare and contrast, I guess the last large GLP-1s launch of Ozempic, are there similarities or differences we should think about as hint kind of stay on the market today, the data you will have, et cetera, just to help us - I think we all think about this is a great long-term opportunity, but more just the near-term dynamics with that. And then my second question was just on insulin in 2022. Can you just elaborate a bit more about how to think about the magnitude of price erosion we could see for that franchise relative to what we saw in 2021? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how different is the market dynamic, I guess, this year versus last? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We will go to Mike for both of those questions as well. Michael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. As we approach the tirzepatide launch, we will be planning for the long term and making sure that we set the foundations up strongly for long-term success. When you have a retail product like this that goes to nearly 100,000 primary care physicians as well as meeting broad access, there is little that you can do to really accelerate the launch in the first six months. We are also working to get access and having support programs so patients will have a good out-of-pocket experience at launch. And so I wouldn\u2019t look for the first six months to see a real accelerated uptake of net revenue versus other GLPs in that first six months. I think that, that will be a focus for us of just laying a strong foundations, be in patient focus, getting access, driving awareness through a broad subset of physicians that will give us that foundation to be successful long term. And then on insulin, when we look at the Q4 results, we did have a, in particular, a greater-than-usual decline in our price. And that was really due to kind of a double whammy effect. We have a significant adjustments from our gross sales to our net sales. And so if our estimates are off just a little bit, that could have a significant impact on our net revenues. And so what we saw actually was that in the comparison period, in Q4 of 2020, they experienced some positive onetime gains. And then in this quarter, we saw some negative onetime adjustments. So that is what led to what looks like a greater-than-expected net sales decline. I think for our portfolio, we have provided guidance that we would be at about mid-single-digit decline. I think we will see that greater for insulin than our net portfolio, but I don\u2019t see anything largely unexpected in 2022 versus where we have seen the trends over the last couple of years. Thank you. David Ricks : Maybe just to add something there, Chris, that is a dynamic as well as patient assistance. And as you know, Lilly has led over the last three years with a number of solutions to reduce out-of-pocket costs given the problems in the insurance markets. And those have been - in addition to the normal competitive dynamics in terms of gross to net, an important solution for patients actually out-of-pocket costs for - correct me, Mike, if I get this wrong, for patients in the U.S. dropped over the last three years from $34 to $21 per month on average for Lilly insulins. That is quite a bit lower than our competitors, but that does hit the price line for us, either through the now 70% off insulin lispro product, which is available or through the buydowns we do at the point of sale to $35 per month. So that is in the background. There is sort of a terminal quantity to that, but we have seen good adoption. And I guess the good news is patients are taking advantage of that and it is showing up and retaining volume, it does hit the net price line though. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dave. Chris thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next call is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alice Nettleton : This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. So a question on donanemab. The premise of donanemab is that you only dose to plaque negativity. However, to determine plaque negativity, you need a minimum of two PET scan and quite possibly three, maybe even more. The CMS draft guidance only covers one even if it ultimately gets revised to be more generous. If it doesn\u2019t also include increased coverage of PET scanning, then you could argue Lilly is uniquely disadvantaged versus competitors. Would be curious to hear your thoughts on this. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Alice. We will go to Anne White for that question. Anne White : Well, thanks. And as you said, we are pleased that CMS acknowledged that there is an important role for amyloid PET in patient identification. We certainly agreed to that as well. And using amyloid PET to monitor plaque reduction and then confirm clearance is incredibly important, we believe, for patients receiving these therapies. And incredibly important for the health care system because it provides clarity as to when you can essentially stopped dosing of medicine. Once you have cleared the target, we believe that is the time to stop dosing. And as you know, in our data, we have shown that 40% even clear their plaque in six months. So incredibly important and we believe that the value that, that brings to the health care system far outweighs any cost that it might bring. And we have done those analyses. So it is very, very clear that when you take into account all the costs of these medicines, the infusion, the safety monitoring, you are much better off with clarity of when that plaque is cleared and stopping dosing. It is a unique attribute of donanemab that we have certainly talked to CMS and others about and they have recognized. So we believe the value proposition here is quite strong and look forward to working with CMS to get the amyloid PET CED revised in the near future. Kevin Hern : Thanks Anne. Alice thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next caller is Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A question on lebrikizumab and then one on Verzenio. So on lebrikizumab, part of the premise in terms of differentiation versus dupi given the IL-3 mechanism is a lower instance of ocular events, particularly conjunctivitis, which are frequent with dupi and patient problematic. I know you haven\u2019t fully shared the data, but I wonder whether you could talk to whether the data will support that premise and positioning in the market. And then second, in relation to Verzenio, given you are now rolling it out for the adjuvant setting, could you talk to what are the key barriers to adoption among oncologists? Is it tolerability in the augment setting? Is it screening for the Ki-67 patients or some are financial factors and how can you resolve them? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Andrew. We will go to Patrik for the question on lebrikizumab and then Jake for the question on Verzenio. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Andrew. Based upon the data that we have seen so far, we believe that we have a competitive asset with a market leader for atopic dermatitis, and we were very encouraged with the efficacy results with more than 50% of the patients achieving at least an EASI of 75 and also consistent across all the different measures, IgAA, EASI9 and RS and met all the key secondary end points. Specific to your question on [indiscernible], we need to wait for the 52-week data. In the induction data, we didn\u2019t see any difference to existing biologics. But the cases that we saw were all mild to moderate and one/third of those had a history of chonictybitis and only a few of them discontinued treatment. So we are looking forward to the database lock of the maintenance treatment during the first half of this year. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Patrik. Jake? Jacob Van Naarden : Yes, thanks for the question. So I think as it relates to the key barriers to adoption, I think the biggest one in the overlay, and then I will get more specific is just that this represents really the first new standard of care in this setting in 20 years. And so there are just a lot of physicians who have entrenched behavior and comfort with what they are doing. And so the first barrier is really around education and getting a comfort level changing behavior. And so that - we have a lot of tactics in place to do that to make sure that the data on the agent are known and to answer questions that physicians may have. More specifically, you highlighted a few things that are good things to know, which is the Ki-67 testing requirement and the interpretation of those results and integrating them into patient selection is a new thing for docs in this setting. As well as the diarrhea management, which is a real phenomenon with Verzenio. We have protocols in place that allow it to be managed and it tends to be a short-term short-term side effect that can be managed. But there are a lot of physicians out there who have literally never written a prescription of Verzenio because they have been historically large Ibrance users. And for that segment, in particular, there is an education component to get them comfortable and ensure they are using the protocols that we think work really well for diarrhea management. That all having been said, we are happy with what we are seeing so far, but it is early days, obviously, in this launch trajectory. Kevin Hern : Thanks Jake. Andrew thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next call is Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoffrey Meacham : Just have a couple of quick ones. For tirzepatide in obesity, what investments have to be made to help evolve the payer attitudes towards obesity as more of a medical condition, obviously, it has a lot to do with benefit risk, starting with SURMOUNT-1 and you have a competitor leading the charge as well. And then the second question is for partibrutinib. Was the decision to file an MCL, was it based more on unmet need and the opportunity versus regulatory feedback? I want to get a little bit more clarity on that. And with the Phase IIIs and CLL not completing for at least a few years, was there more consideration for those towards an interim look being built in? I\u2019m just trying to think of the potential lag in commercial availability between the two indications. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Geoff. We will go to Mike for the first question and then Jake for the second. Michael Mason : Yes, it is a good question on BC and what is going to take to unlock and build that marketplace. When you look at historically, the agent just had kind of limited weight loss. And because of that, they didn\u2019t really drive good help outcomes and that limited access, limited positions from writing that. So we think, first of all, just having agent like tirzepatide that could have significant and clinically meaningful weight loss is the first step of the evolution of the marketplace and the interest in that and we have seen that in market research. And then we have got to begin to build the evidence to show that significant weight loss for tirzepatide will lead to hard outcomes. And that is what we are doing in our extended indication focus. We have announced a heart failure HFpEF study. We announced in December a sleep apnea study as well as an important morbidity/mortality study or MMO study that will look at hard outcomes for other potential outcomes like CV and others, we will give you more information on that coming up. We also have a chronic kidney disease mechanism of action Phase II study that will help demonstrate why tirzepatide may work for that patient population and doing work in NASH. And so I think it is important for us to demonstrate. I think we are confident that with the level of weight loss that we will see with tirzepatide, but that should lead to hard outcomes, that should then lead to earlier use of agent like tirzepatide to really slow and disrupt the progression of obesity and really turn this into a more of a preventive versus waiting for the heart outcomes to show. But that is going to be the evolution of it. We have got an extensive Phase III program in order to demonstrate the evidence we think we need to - in order to unlock and grow access over time. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Jake, on pirtobrutinib? Jacob Van Naarden : Yes. So the first part of your question around the decision to file for mantle cell, you framed it as what is an unmet need versus regulatory feedback. And the answer really is both. So we have had a longitudinal conversation with the agency around this indication showing them our clinical data at various snapshots over time. And we got to a point where we had agreement on the key components of what an NDA could look like from a clinical package perspective. And so that informed our decision to file. In other words, this was not a sort of unilateral Lilly decision. This was done very much in concert with FDA. And I think they and us realized the unmet need of patients in the setting and the potential proposition of pirtobrutinib there. Obviously, the ultimate approval is subject to an FDA review. So nothing is done until it is done, of course. As it relates to the potential lag between a mantle cell approval and CLL approval, I think it is just too early to really comment because the latter, CLL is really subject to the enrollment dynamics of the Phase III program. And it is just a little too early days for us to really say exactly which one of those studies will be the first to read out and when, because it is so enrollment kinetics-contingent. So over the course of this year, we will have a lot more information about that, I presume and be in a better position to prognosticate about CLL timing. Kevin Hern : Thanks Jake. Geoff thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next caller is Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on lebrikizumab. If it is approved, do you expect sales to come from share gains from DUPIXENT or new patient starts? And then second question is on pirtobrutinib. Do you see an opportunity for the drug in first-line treatment? And if so, do you think you need to wait for the head-to-head results before that becomes a meaningful opportunity for you? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Louise. We will go to Patrik for the question on lebrikizumab\u2019s source of business and then back to Jake on pirtobrutinib. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Louise. I think first and foremost, if you look at the atopic dermatitis state, it is pretty much where psoriasis was a decade ago. And we see a very low biologic penetration into those patients in need of treatment beyond topicals today. So we definitely see an opportunity to significantly grow the market in atopic dermatitis. But as I mentioned earlier, we also believe that we have an asset here, but it is very competitive with a market leader. So I would foresee that we will see an uptick both in terms of - driven by market growth as well as competing very successfully with the peak end. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Patrick. Jake. Jacob Van Naarden : So the pirtobrutinib opportunity we see primarily and certainly initially is in patients who have been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor or more. Obviously, we think there is a potential for the drug in the first line, and that is why we are running studies there. We have two studies that we are running in first-line CLL. One is, as you mentioned, a head-to-head study against ibrutinib. The other, which will take a long time to read out because of the natural history of the control arm. The other is a study we just recently started against chemoimmunotherapy. That study will read out much, much quicker. And, therefore, allow for the drug to be labeled in the first-line setting. And I think what we have learned, particularly from other newer entrants in this space is that you really need to generate a differentiating data set in some way, shape or form, and then have the labeled indications that allow physicians and patients to have choice. And I think, in particular, the Calquence acalabrutinib program has shown that you really actually don\u2019t necessarily need direct head-to-head data to suggest differentiation or for at least physicians to perceive differentiation in different drugs, so long as you have a labeled indication that allows for on-label prescribing and reimbursement. So one of the reasons that we initiated the first-line chemo immunotherapy study was to have a path to that first-line label more quickly and allow patients and physicians to make choices. Kevin Hern : Thanks Jake. Louise thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next call is UmerRaffat with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael DiFiore : This is Mike in for Umer. Just two for me. One on tirzepatide. If tirzepatide is priced at a slight premium over Trulicity on a list basis, that could theoretically mean a massive increase on a net basis. So given where prices are paid in government channels for Trulicity, can you remind us what percent of Trulicity is Medicare, Medicaid and VA? And how different is that price versus your commercial price? And switching gears to donanemab for TRAILBLAZER 3, I was wondering if you guys had finalized the stat methodology for assessing the primary endpoint. I know a little while back, you had a nice poster on TRAILBLAZER 2 showing how the primary endpoints were assessed by basin analysis versus MMRN. Just kind of remind us where - if anything has been finalized for the methodology for assessing the primary endpoint in TRAILBLAZER 3? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. We will go to Mike Mason for the questions around tirzepatide pricing and Trulicity segments in the U.S. and then Dan for the question on TRAILBLAZER 3. Mike? Michael Mason : Thanks, Mike, for your question. Obviously, I won\u2019t be able to talk in too much detail around the list price for next price for tirzepatide. Maybe the best way to answer your question is that typically for a new product, you tend to get commercial access first, then Part D, then followed by Medicaid and other channels. And yes, the commercial net prices are typically higher than Part D and Part D is typically higher than Medicaid. So you will see kind of the evolution of any retail product to be a higher net price at the beginning of the life cycle. And then as the lower - if you reach volume in lower-priced segments, you will see that decline like we have talked about over - with Trulicity over the last couple of years. Now we will have extensive patient support programs in the first six months for tirzepatide. So again, I wouldn\u2019t be looking too much at that for tirzepatide in the first six months. But overall, over the first couple of years, I think any product, you will see that dynamic. For your specific question on Medicaid, with Trulicity, that is currently around 10% of the volume. Thanks for the question. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question on TRAILBLAZER 3. It is a good question you have raised because this is a really interesting population. These are patients who have amyloid plaque in their brain, but they are still cognitively normal. So what kind of endpoint is appropriate for a population like that. In our view, we are looking at a progression metrics. So do they progress to a CDR rating that indicates that they now have impairment. So it is a bit of a binary outcome for each patient. Did they progress or did they not progress? And then you have an event-driven study with Kaplan-Meier type analysis. So that is how we are thinking about TRAILBLAZER 3 right now and probably we haven\u2019t published this timetable yet, but that may yet be forthcoming, and that study is currently enrolling. Kevin Hern : Thanks Dan. Mike thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next call is Carter Gould with Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : I guess just first for Dan. Maybe to clarify, I mean the language you are using around no longer Q1, I noticed - I guess you guys weren\u2019t explicitly confirming to 2Q. So just maybe just clarifying then, is that sort of time unknown, just still sometime in 2022? Or is it just going to kind of fill over by a couple of weeks or months. And then maybe for Jake, on Tyvyt, when we spoke in December, I thought you were pretty balanced. It is not even maybe negative on the prospects for approval based on some of the commentary around data coming out of China. Now that you have got the questions in hand, I don\u2019t know if your stance has changed or if you have any additional color to add. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Carter. We will go to Dan for the question on donanemab and then Jake on sintilimab in the U.S. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Carter. Exactly, you noted it correctly, which is that we are saying no longer Q1 and not providing a more specificity than that. We do anticipate completing the submission yet this year. I think importantly here, we are trying to take investor focus off of like the exact timing of accelerated approval, given our very limited expectations for the impact of that accelerated approval commercially. We are still pursuing it. We think there is some opportunity to help patients faster through it. But I don\u2019t think investors should look at that as a big commercial inflection point. It is really around our ability to communicate the TRAILBLAZER 2 confirmatory Phase III data and then work with CMS, hopefully, before that or immediately after that to make sure there is access once we have that confirmatory data. So that is the timing, I think investors should be focused on. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Jake? Jacob Van Naarden : Thanks for the question on sintilimab. So as you know, we have the FDA Advisory Committee meeting with Invent a week from today. Our position on the matter really hasn\u2019t changed nor have our expectations. But we believe that the risk/benefit of the agent is demonstrable on the basis of the well-conducted study and we believe the results of the study are indeed applicable to a U.S. population. And we will make our case in that respect a week from today. That having been said, we understand the stance of the agency may have changed or maybe we may have misinterpreted it a few years ago. And so will await the FDA\u2019s presentation on that topic and the feedback from the ODAC members. But we think this product, if approved, could be meaningful for patients in the United States as a result of our disruptive pricing strategy. But we obviously don\u2019t know if we will be able to execute on that. Kevin Hern : Thanks Jake. Carter thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next caller is Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Kerry Holford : Hi thank you. Two questions, please. Firstly, on Olumiant, I wonder if you could break out for us a proportion of sales in the quarter that were related to use in COVID and what your expectations are here going forth. And also whether you can expand on the discussions you have had with the FDA on the atopic dermatitis indication and why you think scale out could be forthcoming? If additional studies would it be required, would you continue to pursue in this indication? And then secondly, on the inflammation, we obviously have the positive headline data from the Phase III. So I\u2019m wondering when you will publish the full data and whether we will get to see that ahead of your filings. Kevin Hern : Okay. Thanks, Kerry. We will go to Patrik for those questions. Patrik Jonsson : Okay. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s start with Olumiant in COVID-19. If you look at the Q4 performance of Olumiant, I think you should assume that the underlying business in rheumatoid arthritis outside of U.S. and atopic dermatitis continue to be strong. And in the U.S., the trend hasn\u2019t changed either when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis. In the U.S., a significant chunk of sales from Olumiant is coming from COVID-19 in Q4 and a minor chunk outside of the U.S. as well. It is really hard to predict the pandemic, but we expect to see continued sales from Olumiant also in 2022 for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, at an enterprise level, we don\u2019t foresee it to be material. For your second question in terms of atopic dermatitis, let me first reinforce that we are very confident when it comes to the risk benefit profile of Olumiant across all the indications approved and studied. And we conducted eight Phase III studies for atopic dermatitis in U.S. and outside of the U.S. And those were conducted in patients, moderate to severely ill patients suffering from atopic dermatitis in need of systemic treatment. And that is really where we believe Olumiant is bringing the biggest benefits to patients early on in the treatment data time. While FDA currently has a position of saving Olumiant for the refractory patients where we see the incremental value of Olumiant to be quite limited. And if that doesn\u2019t change, it is likely that we will receive a complete response letter. And if so, we will continue to focus our efforts on the very successful launches that we have seen outside the U.S. for atopic dermatitis as well as a very strong rheumatoid arthritis franchise. We have - as well as preparing for, hopefully, an approval of Alopecia Areata in the U.S. and other markets later on this year. Moving on to mirikizumab. Yes, we had recently the readout of LUSN2 just prior to the end of last year. And we met the primary endpoint and all the secondary endpoints. And we didn\u2019t only achieve statistical significance, but also clinically meaningful difference when it comes to clinical, symptomatic, hetologic and endoscopic measures. And we have also conducted the first study ever with an IL-23 P19 where we have demonstrated reduced urgency, which we know is a major concern today for both clinicians, but mainly for patients. So therefore, we are looking forward to submit mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis during the first half of this year. And most likely become the first IL-23 19 in this very important space and we have a big unmet need and with a profile that we believe is very competitive versus both currently approved medicines and other biologics and JAKs in development. Kevin Hern : Thanks Patrik. Kerry thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next caller is Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. A question about the timeline plans for filing for dMAB. It is been an arena of influence from different parties agency, CMS, where it appears as if there is sort of instruction that have breadth of scope across multiple different antibody. So would you say that since we know that competitor data is upcoming for additional approaches later this year, does that impact your view on your approach and timing for filing a DMAB? And then a second question would be on tirzepatide, the anticipated transition in type 2 diabetes. Trulicity has been very strong. But can you perhaps give us a better sense about how you expect that transition to play out? I think broadly, there is confidence in the profile that tirzepatide eventually will succeed in continuing the franchise position in type 2 diabetes. But would you expect for the initial tirzepatide launch that to come primarily and importantly, from the incident population or will there be patient switching? A little insight into how that actual transition could play out in your view would be helpful. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We will go to Dan for the question around donanemab filing timelines and then Mike for the transition with Trulicity and tirzepatide franchises. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks Chris, you raised a good point with competitor readouts for amyloid-lowering drugs coming yet this year. We have to take into account expectations for those readouts. I think from our perspective, those readouts could be challenging. Obviously, we designed donanemab as a molecule or dosing strategy, our clinical trial strategy, including who we enrolled and what endpoints we look at in order to maximize the ability to see a positive signal. Other trials haven\u2019t done that. So therefore, it is obvious that we would think that those trials should have lower probability of success. . I think if those trials are not successful, competitor readouts fail either because see some of the boxes is just too noisy an endpoint. And that can go ways it could help or it could hurt. We saw that in the two aducanumab readouts or because they have too many patients who are outside the optimal window of tau pathology because they are not doing that or because they lower plaques too slowly. If any of those turn out to be correct and those trials turn out to be negative, I think that could further solidify CMS\u2019s reluctance to reimburse these drugs under accelerated approval. It doesn\u2019t really fundamentally change our thinking, though. As I said before, the key event for us is readout of our Phase III study. I think we have optimized everything for our chances of success. And regardless of competitor readouts, if we have a positive Phase III readout on top of our already first positive randomized controlled trial in TRAILBLAZER 1 that is a very good position for donanemab and our expectation is that is a drug that will become globally available to patients and highly used by patients. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question on Trulicity and tirzepatide. We are blessed to have both products. We are going to be taken, again, from a long-term perspective on tirzepatide and Trulicity. Our goal is to continue to grow the market in type 2 diabetes and then really expand the class into the obesity market. Within type 2 diabetes, our goal not only is to expand the market, but continue to expand our share of market within the market. . When you look at the way we promote our products, we take a very patient-centric approach to identifying those patients who could best benefit from a product like tirzepatide. In our market research as we put the profile of tirzepatide up against the six therapies, including Trulicity, both payers and health care professionals and people who live with diabetes see the superior profile of tirzepatide. When you compare that Trulicity, our Phase III trials that showed greater weight loss, better A1c control and it is in exact same device as Trulicity. So there is obviously interest in the product, and they do see it as a superior product from Trulicity. Now what I believe will happen is that we will grow our overall share, and you will get a portion of patients who may have gone on Trulicity or may be on Trulicity and maybe out of control who needs greater weight loss or greater A1c control and those patients will grow on tirzepatide. So we do anticipate that there will be some conversion from Trulicity over two tirzepatide, but our focus is really going to be making sure that we grow the overall class and grow the overall share of market for the Lilly Ancrogen franchise. We don\u2019t think it is appropriate to necessarily promote conversion of products, we are doing well on Trulicity. So it is not going to be a kind of internally focused conversion strategy. It is going to be very much a patient-focused product for those patients who are out of control or need additional weight loss tirzepatide can offer that. So we are quite excited about the opportunity to have two intro trends in our portfolio and grow the overall class. Thank you for the question. Kevin Hern : Thanks Mike. Chris thanks for your question. Next caller please. Operator : The next call is Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Alright. Well, if Evan is not there, the queue is exhausted. We will go to Dave for the close. David Ricks : Okay. Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation in today\u2019s earnings call and of course, your interest in our Company. 2021 was an incredible year for the Company, as we produced strong financial results and delivered important pipeline progress in each of our core therapeutic areas on behalf of the patients who rely on us. We entered 2022 with positive momentum and great focus on execution to deliver on the meaningful opportunities we have ahead of us. So thanks for dialing in today, and please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call. Have a good one. Take care.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q1 2022 earnings call. I am Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and President of Lilly Oncology; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We are also joined by Sara Smith, Kento Ueha, and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors including those listed on slide three. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. 2022 is off to a strong start with, solid volume driven revenue growth led by our key products and the new tirzepatide obesity data we announced this morning. We are focused on driving adoption of our newer medicines, preparing for key product launches, delivering several global submissions for potential new medicines, all the while advancing our pipeline to power the next wave of growth. We are pleased with the progress we saw in the first quarter. Before I get to our results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to address the tragic loss of life and the hardships we are seeing in Ukraine. Our Ukraine office is currently closed and operations are suspended. The safety of our employees and their families continues to be our top priority. We are working through logistical challenges in order to ensure supply of our medicines to those in need in Ukraine. Earlier this month, an initial shipment of medicines donated by Lilly including insulin arrived in Ukraine. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our partners, project HOPE and Direct Relief. Few of our clinical trial participants are in Ukraine. So while we are doing everything we can to ensure continuity of their medical care, there is minimal impact to our global trials. With regard to Russia, we have suspended investments, our promotional activities and new clinical trials there. Our Russian operations are now only focused on ensuring people suffering from diseases like cancer and diabetes continue to get the Lilly medicines they need. Should we generate any profits from our sales in Russia, we will donate them to organizations dedicated to humanitarian relief. Our revenue in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of our total company sales in 2021. Moving to our results. You can see on slide four the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue grew 15% or 17% on a constant currency basis and was driven by volume growth of 20%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta due to loss of exclusivity, revenue grew 10% for the quarter. This volume driven performance in Q1 is attributable to our key growth products, which grew 24% and now account for 61% of our core business. With long IP runways for many of these products and less than 10% of our 2022 revenue exposed to patent expiry in the next five years, along with the potential launch of five new medicines over the next 18 months, the durability of our growth outlook is quite strong. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 76.1% in Q1, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. Excluding revenue from COVID antibodies, gross margin was approximately 80% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, an increase of roughly 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by both higher gross margin and lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies. In our pipeline, we have several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including the U.S. and EU approval for Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, as well as a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee for an early start to the Phase III trial studying Jardiance for chronic kidney disease due to clear positive efficacy. The U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. The recent U.S. submission of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and a positive Phase III topline readout for SURMOUNT-1, the first of four global studies to evaluate tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight. Dan will talk in more detail later, but we are very excited with the results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-1 topline readout. We believe there is significant potential for tirzepatide to build off the impressive results we saw from our clinical program in Type 2 diabetes and help people with obesity, a disease impacting over 110 million people in United States and approximately 650 million people worldwide. Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease that causes over 2.8 million deaths globally each year. The economic impact associated with obesity is more than $1 trillion in the U.S. alone. We believe addressing obesity could make a difference in millions of people\u2019s lives, have a significant impact on public health and reduce healthcare costs. We are hopeful that we are entering a new era of obesity care, where people have medicines that can help treat their obesity and this is our first proof point on that journey. We continue to rapidly advance nucleic acid innovation at Lilly, building on our growing portfolio with the launch of the Lilly Institute for Genetic Medicines, a $700 million facility in Boston. We will develop novel RNA and DNA-based medicines, as well as push the boundaries of delivery technology to unlock difficult to treat targets in key strategic areas for us like neurodegeneration, diabetes and obesity. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends in the quarter and completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases. On slide five and six, you will see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates we are discussing today. Now, I will turn the call over to Anat to review the Q1 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q1, it is important to note that beginning this quarter, following directions from the SEC, presentation of non-GAAP measures will not include upfront charges and development milestones related to acquired in-process R&D and development. While this has no bearing on how we conduct our business, it will have an impact on how we represent -- how we present our non-GAAP measures. This change in presentation of financial results will have the effect of pulling into non-GAAP measures, certain charges that were previously reported owning our GAAP financial results. We expect this change will increase non-GAAP operating expenses and decrease non-GAAP operating margins and earnings per share. To help with year-on-year comparison of our non-GAAP measures, you can find a revised workbook in our Investor website, reflecting the updated presentation of our 2020 and 2021 results. Slide seven summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2022. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue grew 15%, excluding COVID -- excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue increased 10%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 70 basis points to 76.1% in Q1 2022. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold in Q1 2021, partially offset by increased sales of COVID antibodies, which have lower gross margin profile than the rest of our portfolio and to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Increase in manufacturing costs and logistics due to inflation had a modest impact on gross margin in Q1. Total operating expenses decreased 6% this quarter, which as a reminder, is now inclusive of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1%, while R&D expenses decreased 4%, driven by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of $166 million or $0.15 of EPS, primarily related to purchase of the Priority Review Voucher. In Q1 2021, acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were $312 million or $0.27 of EPS. Operating income increased 66% in Q1, driven by higher revenue, primarily due to higher sales of COVID antibodies, lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies, and to a lesser extent, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 33.4% for the quarter and reflects the benefit from COVID-19 antibodies revenue, as well as the negative impact of approximately 210 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Other income and expense was income of approximately $38 million this quarter, compared with income of $35 million in Q1 2021. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 10.3%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit this quarter, partially offset by decreased tax expenses related to the implementation of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act required to capitalize research and development expenses. As the bottomline, we delivered strong earnings per share growth of 63% in Q1, inclusive of approximately 1500 basis points related to lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 31% and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in the U.S. This growth was driven by volume, led by Trulicity, Verzenio, Jardiance, Olumiant, and Taltz. We experienced a net price decline of 1% for the quarter and continue to expect a mid single-digit price decline in the U.S. for the full year. As a reminder, a single competitor to Alimta launch in the U.S. in February and we expect broad generic entry in may result in a significant erosion of U.S. Alimta revenue. Moving to Europe, revenue in Q1 declined 13% in constant currency and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. We expect continued growth in Europe excluding Alimta. For Japan, Q1 revenue decreased 21% in constant currency, as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta. Key growth products now represent 65% of total revenue in Japan and we expect to return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency. The NRDL access has driven significant volume growth for newer products like Tyvyt, Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz, and has been partially offset by related price decreases. We expect this improved access to continue to drive future volume growth, more than offsetting the price decline. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent protective measures that are currently being put in place to control the spread of the virus highlight the potential for commercial impact in China in the near-term, particularly for infused products, like Tyvyt. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 29% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by $95 million in revenue from the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, as well as by increased sales of key growth products. We continue to expect a mid single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan, with the worldwide net price decline in the high single-digit driven by the expanded NRDL access for our products in China. As shown on slide nine, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 15% points of volume growth this quarter and continue to bolster overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated $3.9 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue, growing 24%. We are pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and SGLT2 classes where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders, as well as with the strong Taltz prescription growth. We are also encouraged by the significant uptake of Verzenio in Q1, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2022, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased 1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, as we continue to fund our key market product and expect the new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 12 is the updated 2022 financial guidance. As I previously noted, our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures will now include IPR&D and development milestone charges. For guidance, we will include charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of the earnings release and will not include any impact from potential or pending business development. We are providing information that should make this change as easy as possible to understand, as well as incorporate into modeling. As always, please let us know if there\u2019s anything else we can do to be of assistance as you navigate through this transition. I do want to reiterate that margin expansion continues to be priority for our team. Consistent with prior communication, excluding IPR&D development milestone charges, we expect to drive further non-GAAP operating margin expansion over time. Getting into the numbers underline our updated guidance, there is several items of benefits first quarter results, which are not expected to recur. These include approximately $1.45 billion of COVID antibody sales, U.S. Alimta revenue of approximately $250 million that will be impacted by multi-source generic entrants in Q2 and beyond, a favorable effective tax rate and a one-time benefit related to the resolution of cefaclor patent litigation in Canada. I would also remind you that as we look ahead to the second quarter, the Q2 2021 revenue benefited from the sale of Cialis rights in China, which will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our topline growth in Q2. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the guidance range by $1 billion to now be in the range of $28.8 billion to $29.3 billion, reflecting the additional revenue for bebtelovimab sales in Q1. While project an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate, we are expecting to offset it with stronger core business performance. We anticipate that any additional revenue from sales of COVID-19 antibodies to be limited begin in Q2 2022, while the U.S. Government has an option to purchase additional 500,000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than July 31st of this year, it is uncertain whether this option will be exercised, and therefore, it is not included in our guidance. Moving down the income statement, GAAP gross margin percent is now expected to be approximately 76%, while non-GAAP margin, gross margin is now expected to be approximately 78%. The majority of this 200 basis point reduction is due to the impact of Q1 bebtelovimab sales, which have lower gross margin and to a lesser extent an increase of approximately $100 million in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation. The range for R&D expenses has been increased by $100 million to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, driven by investment in our late-stage pipeline, primarily Alzheimer\u2019s clinical development and investment to advance to diagnostics ecosystem. Our guidance includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $521 million, reflecting Q1 charges of $166 million, with the remainder primarily related to a charge associated with the buyout of future obligations that were contingent upon development, regulatory and commercial success of our Meudon selective PI3K inhibitor. This guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transaction. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 200 basis points to approximately 28% and 30%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact associated with the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges to date. Given the accounting change for acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, in the inherent variability associated with such charges, our non-GAAP operating margin figure will not measure efficiency in the same way it has done historically. However, you contract our operating margin in the way you deem appropriate, knowing that we aim to expand operating margin over time, excluding acquired IPR&D and develop in milestone charges. Our Q1 2022 tax rate and EPS include a favorable impact from the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year is unchanged and assumed that this provision will be deferred or repealed over Congress, effective for 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repealed effective this year then we would expect the reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. It is notable that while this provision favorably impacts certain tax items, which decreased our effective tax rate, we expect it will increase our 2022 cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.5 billion. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.70 to now be in the range of $7.3 per share to $7.45 per share and lower our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.30. That $0.35 reduction are non-core -- in our non-GAAP EPS range includes the 55% decrease due to the year-to-date acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, partially offset by improved business performance of $0.20 attributable to the net benefit of Q1 bebtelovimab sales and increased investments in R&D. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. Let me start with today\u2019s exciting announcement. The positive topline results from the tirzepatide SURMOUNT-1 Phase III study. Participants without Type 2 diabetes who have obesity, or overweight with at least one co-morbidity achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 52 pounds. Tirzepatide is the first investigational medicines to deliver more than 20% weight loss on average in a Phase III study. Indeed most people on 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams of tirzepatide in this trial achieved 20% or greater weight loss and up to 63% of patients on 15 milligrams achieved this level of weight reduction. Obesity is a chronic disease that needs more effective treatment options to patients. We are working hard at Lilly to create new potentially innovative medicines, with the aim to modernize how this disease is approached. We hope that there is appetite can be Lilly\u2019s first such medicine and the SURMOUNT program has been designed to test just that. I will cover the SURMOUNT-1 results in more detail, but first let me quickly provide an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across six studies, four of which are global registration studies. On slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for those four global registration studies. All four studies compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo to provide weight reduction and safety data for people without Type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least one co-morbidity. SURMOUNT-2 will provide weight reduction and safety data for people with obesity or overweight with Type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program. And SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. We expect the remaining three global studies to read out in the middle of 2023. Note that dose escalation in the SURMOUNT program is consistent with that of the SURPASS program for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes with tirzepatide. Patients start with 2.5 milligrams of tirzepatide and move up every four weeks in 2.5 milligram increments to reach their target dose. In SURMOUNT-3 and 4, study participants who escalate go into the maximum-tolerated dose of either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, patients escalating the maximum-tolerated dose provides opportunity to evaluate the full potential for weight reduction. Studies vary in duration from 72 weeks to 82 weeks -- 72 weeks to 88 weeks and SURMOUNT-1 will continue through 176 weeks to evaluate whether tirzepatide can actually slow the time to onset of Type 2 diabetes in participants who had pre-diabetes at the time of entering the clinical trial. We believe this will be important additional information for patients and physicians. SURMOUNT-1, a large trial which enrolled over 2500 participants met its co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all pre-specified key secondary endpoints. On slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-1 study, where tirzepatide delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction in adults with obesity or overweight. With a mean baseline weight across the study of 231 pounds, this translates into a mean body weight reduction of 52 pounds on the 15 milligram treatment arm of the study. Along with the impressive results from the 10 milligram dose, which showed 21.4% mean body weight reduction, we were also very pleased to see how well the 5 milligram performed with a 16% mean body weight reduction also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimate. Moving to slide 15. Tirzepatide obviously achieve the second co-primary endpoint of driving at least 5% weight reduction, clearly the vast majority of subjects, including greater than 96% of participants in the 10-milligram and 15-milligram arms achieved this level of weight reduction. We are really excited that a key secondary endpoint is SURMOUNT-1 showed up to 60% of patients achieved at least 20% body weight reduction at 72 weeks, again using the efficacy estimate. This is compared to only 1% for participants who achieved greater than 20% weight loss on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Moving to slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-1 study. Tirzepatide was well-tolerated in study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for the treatment of obesity. As in the SURPASS program, the most common reported adverse events were GI-related, generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred during dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were between 4.3% and 7.1% for tirzepatide treatment arms, compared to 2.6% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates range from roughly 14% to 16% in the tirzepatide arms compared to over 26% for placebo. The minimal weight loss seen in the placebo treatment group combined with the observed placebo discontinuation rate of 26% demonstrates the limited efficacy of diet and exercise alone and highlights the significant unmet medical need for people with this disease. We will continue to evaluate the SURMOUNT-1 study data and are planning to present findings at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Of course, we plan to submit our manuscript to a top tier peer reviewed journal. As Dave mentioned earlier, obesity is a chronic disease impacting over 110 million Americans and there is great need for more effective treatment options. While our current alignment with the FDA is to complete the four SURMOUNT global registrational studies prior to submission, we believe the impressive results from SURMOUNT-1 warrant further discussion. Based on our existing robust dataset, we are looking forward to reviewing the data with the FDA and discussing the potential for an expedited path forward for this indication. Moving to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 27th and slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several other important developments since our last earnings call and I will cover these by therapeutic area. In diabetes, along with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim, we are proud of the expanded indication for Jardiance as a treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which has been classified as the single largest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine. Jardiance is now the first and only heart failure therapy to demonstrate statistically significant risk reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure regardless of ejection fraction. We also announced the Phase III trial study in Jardiance for chronic kidney disease will stop early due to clear positive efficacy. The recommendation was made by an independent data monitoring committee and while we have not yet seen results from this interim analysis, we are excited about the potential for this new indication and expect to share detailed results from the upcoming primary analysis at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Last month, we began dosing patients in the first of five Phase III trials for investigational weekly insulin basal insulin FC or BIF. The trial compares weekly BIF to insulin degludec where patients are currently treated with basal insulin. We intend to start the other four Phase III trials later this year. You also see we have advanced our long-acting Amylin receptor agonist to Phase I development in obesity. Shifting to immunology, we presented mirikizumab induction data from LUCENT-1 at the Europeans Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Virtual Congress, demonstrating superiority over placebo for the primary and all key secondary endpoints. These data show patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis achieved statistically superior rates of clinical remission compared to patients taking placebo, with nearly two-thirds of patients responding to mirikizumab. The results indicated improved symptom relief, including decreased bowel urgency and resolution or near resolution of inflammation. Building upon the positive outcomes from LUCENT-1, we look forward to sharing maintenance data from LUCENT-2 later in Q2. We are also excited to announce that we have submitted to the FDA and expect submissions in Europe and Japan in Q2. Mirikizumab has the potential to be the first-in-class L-23p19 inhibitor treatment for people with ulcerative colitis. Last month at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, we shared lebrikizumab monotherapy data showing more than 50% of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experienced at least 75% reduction in disease severity at 16 weeks. Additionally, at the revolutionizing atopic dermatitis conference, we shared data showing 70% of patients receiving lebrikizumab combined with topical corticosteroids achieved at least 75% improvement in overall disease severity. We believe these data could help establish a competitive profile for lebrikizumab and we are looking forward to further data from our maintenance studies in the first half of this year to provide insight into the durability of efficacy. Global submissions are expected by year end. Moving to baricitinib. The FDA review for alopecia areata is underway and we are pleased to note that the FDA has granted priority review designation. As expected, we also received a complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib atopic dermatitis indication, as we were not in alignment with the agency on the indicated population. Finally, in immunology, we have discontinued the Phase II study for IL-2 in all sort of colitis to do a lack of efficacy based on interim analysis. The safety was consistent with that observed in previous studies and this decision does not impact the ongoing or planned studies for IL-2 in SLE or atopic dermatitis, as each disease state evaluates a different clinical hypothesis. Moving on to neuroscience. In the National Coverage Determination issued earlier this month for monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid. We share the disappointment of patients and their caregivers, with this NCD, and we know more generally that the innovation in new medical areas really always starts with data that are less proven and more debated, and may proceed initially through regulatory mechanisms such as accelerated approval. We believe that Medicure\u2019s decision to CED in such circumstances is in conflict with FDA\u2019s and Congress\u2019s intent of expedited regulatory pathways and is likely to have a stifling effect on innovation for new medical areas, causing harm to patients that are waiting and in need of new medicines. That said, we are continuing with our rolling submission to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. We intend to complete our initial submission yet in Q2, enabling a potential regulatory decision in early 2023. We believe it would be beneficial for donanemab to obtain accelerated approval proximal to the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III readout in mid 2023, which would enable parallel discussions with CMS regarding outright coverage and expedited review time for full FDA approval. We believe that given the thoughtful and robust design of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, if the study is positive, it should meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS in the NCD decision. At that time, we will advocate for CMS to reconsider outright coverage of donanemab. As we have stated previously, it\u2019s inconceivable to us that one substantial evidence of clinical benefit has been established for any Alzheimer\u2019s medicine, people with the disease won\u2019t have access to it. Our view of the mid- and long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Shifting now to oncology with pirtobrutinib. We are also working on a rolling submission here under the accelerated approval pathway. In this case for mantle cell lymphoma. Here, we also expect to complete our initial submission in Q2. We received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the submission for sintilimab, which was in line with our expectation after the Oncology -- Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting earlier this year. Along with Innovent, we are assessing next steps for sintilimab in the U.S. Further in the oncology pipeline, we started two additional Phase III studies. The first is an additional study evaluating Verzenio in HR positive HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant following progression on a CDK46 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. The second is CYCLONE 3, evaluating Verzenio in earlier lines of prostate cancer. We have also advanced our next generation RET inhibitor to Phase I development and we have discontinued our Aurora A kinase inhibitor as we did not see sufficient monotherapy activity to warrant further development. Similarly, in our pain therapeutic area, we have decided to discontinue development of EPIREG and TGF Alpha, because it did not meet criteria for proceeding. Finally, as Dave mentioned earlier, the FDA authorized bebtelovimab for emergency use for certain non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Bebtelovimab neutralizes OMICRON including the BA2 sub limit -- lineage as demonstrated by sudo virus and authentic virus neutralization assays. As you can see, Q1 was another busy, but successful quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I will turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we have made this year. We delivered solid sales growth, driven largely by volume from our key growth products, which represent 61% of our core business. We continue to see opportunity for meaningful operating margin expansion over time, excluding the impact of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. We made significant progress developing new medicines with exciting advances, including for Jardiance and HFpEF, the EUA Authorization for bebtelovimab, the submission of mirikizumab and ulcerative colitis, as well as positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in obesity and Jardiance in chronic kidney disease. Finally, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We are committed to invest for the long term to advance promising R&D opportunities and support launches to bring groundbreaking therapies to patients diagnosed with some of the most challenging diseases facing human kind, like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer, cancer and autoimmune disorders. With the progress we have seen to-date, we remain extremely confident in our long-term growth prospects. Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Luis [ph], please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we are ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Louise Chen. Please go ahead and she is from Cantor. Louise Chen : Hi. Congratulations on the SURMOUNT data and thanks for taking my questions here. So I do want to ask you more in tirzepatide and SURMOUNT. How do you see the market landscape for obesity changing in light of your positive SURMOUNT data today? Is there an opportunity to file for that indication with the data and what\u2019s the larger opportunity for you here, is it Type 2 diabetes or obesity? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Louise. We will go to Mike Mason for those. Mike Mason : All right. Louise, thanks for the compliment upfront. We appreciate that. I think the market opportunity is, kind of remains what we thought before, we see it as a sizable opportunity and when we look at the just the massive numbers of people who live with obesity over 100 million people in the U.S., 650 million people globally contributes a burden of over $1 trillion globally. We do think it\u2019s a huge opportunity. It should be perceived as a -- and treated as a chronic illness. It not only has health implications. But if you live with obesity, it\u2019s a very visible disease unlike others that really brings with it some unfortunate stigma into society that really hurts individuals both physically and emotionally. And so there is a need to treat this disease. The market is not going to develop overnight. We have to increase awareness that this is a chronic disease that needs to be treated. We do need to establish and grow the access for it. So we are looking long-term to this. I think it\u2019s important for us to be able to build the foundation, build the knowledge that this is a chronic disease, get that appreciated by healthcare professionals and payers and then grow the market. So we are going to look long-term. We are investing obviously not only in tirzepatide but early -- many early assets, because we do think this is a need in the marketplace that we need to focus on, and obviously, we are quite delighted by SURMOUNT-1, not only the high dose. I mean, obviously, when we saw the 52 pounds of weight loss at the high dose on average, we were wowed by that, but I am also as excited about the 16% weight loss at the 5 milligram, because everyone -- we look at the averages, but there is no averages out there. Every individual is different and we need to have a medication that at different doses offer different weight loss and so I am very pleased about the dose profile and the weight loss profile across all the doses. As Dan said, we have originally on the -- on your filing question, we have aligned with the FDA on four trials for the SURMOUNT-1, 2, 3 and 4 program. But given the huge market need and given this data, we do think it warrants a discussion with the FDA about whether we can find a path to accelerate it to the marketplace to meet this need. The SURMOUNT-1 data is great. We also have over 4,000 patients in the SURPASS-5 Global Restoration studies that provides a lot of good information on the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in the diabetes population to go along with SURMOUNT-1. So we look forward to that conversation. I think when we -- when you look at, I think your last question was, are we more excited about diabetes and obesity. I think we are equally excited about both of them. Obviously, we will focus our attention on diabetes first, still a huge massive unmet need. We have unfortunately only half of people who live with Type 2 diabetes in good control. So we will focus on that and then we will focus long term on obesity as I have said earlier. So thanks for the question. Thanks for the compliments. Appreciate it. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Great. Let me offer my congratulations as well on the SURMOUNT-1 data. I have two questions. The first is just based on the timing of the acceptance of the tirzepatide BLA for diabetes, it seems like we are passed the window for the FDA to convene an AdCom panel. So just wondering if you agree or if the door is still open there? And then I was just wondering, probably a question for Mike, if you could share your latest perspective on commercial positioning of tirzepatide. Is this going to be a single brand or two separate brands and then how are you thinking early on, just high level thoughts about pricing here, is this going to be based on dose level or fixed as is with Trulicity? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Terence. We will go to Mike for both those questions. Mike Mason : Okay. Thanks for the question. I will answer your second question first on kind of our commercial positioning. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we will keep that to ourselves at this time, know that we will focus on maximizing the opportunity long-term in diabetes and obesity and we will make the right moves whether that\u2019s one or two brands. We will have dialogs with the FDA on the one versus two brands and it\u2019s too early to talk about that at this point. With regards to the AdCom, we don\u2019t anticipate an AdCom for tirzepatide. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Terence, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Also want to offer my congrats on the data. Just had a few on the obesity opportunity. Dan, a question for you, the market gating factor still looks to be reimbursement and access and I think that prevailing wisdom is that an outcome study will be needed. So, first, do you agree with that, and second, is if you do, how are you guys thinking about the size and scope of obesity outcome study? I wasn\u2019t sure if there is a benefit, of a point estimate of a benefit that you think could help drive reimbursement or for example bariatric surgery was a reasonable reference point? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. We will go to Dan and then, Mike, also invite you to weigh in on our MMO study. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks. Of course, we believe and there is really quite a bit of evidence that weight loss will lead to really strong benefits in outcomes across a variety of diseases. Obviously, cardiovascular disease is near the top of the list, but many others as well. We know a lot from bariatric surgery, which has shown that it can reverse Type 2 diabetes or prevent the onset of diabetes. It can reduce cardiovascular risk. It can decrease even mortality when you get weight loss. That\u2019s really in the range of what we saw in this trial. So we are excited about the potential to change those outcomes. Of course, as you point out, we have to demonstrate that. We will do that over time. But given where we are in our understanding of this disease process and given the depth of unmet medical need in obesity, I don\u2019t see that data as a gating factor for user reimbursement of the drug. Maybe Mike can offer more details on that. Kevin Hern : Mike? Mike Mason : Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Yeah. Thanks and thanks for the compliments on the data. Yeah. The -- I wouldn\u2019t look backwardly at the fact that with that obesity agents up to this point really haven\u2019t been able to secure good access, at the weight loss levels that you were seeing 5%, 6%, 7% weight loss. No one was able to produce or no one has produced health outcome benefits at that level of weight loss. So it makes sense for payers not opening access for those probably more cosmetic than true health benefits. But if you are looking at a product like tirzepatide that can deliver up to 22.5% weight loss, we do believe and there\u2019s good data out there to suggest that\u2019s going to really improve and lead to the good health outcomes. We have to produce that over time and we will do that. But I don\u2019t think that will limit us from gaining access in the meantime. I think when you look at novel access [inaudible] under at 20 million, 25 million, people who live with obesity in the U.S. having access. So I think we can continue to build on that. I think there was a real big win for obesity access recently with the Federal Health employees gaining access for obesity agents. So I think that\u2019s a important trend. Also understand that we are -- we have -- we are dedicated to produce a series of trials that we hope will demonstrate and we expect to demonstrate good outcomes with tirzepatide for sleep apnea, HFpEF, as well as our outcome study that will include cardiovascular. Now those are indications right now that do have access. So both Part D you take sleep apnea, for example, that has good coverage in both commercial and Part D. So we do expect that we show good outcomes there that for those people who have obesity and sleep apnea that we should be able to gain access for it. So we think we do believe that access will start off and where it is today and grow it over time. But we are committed long-term to build access and help people who live with obesity for the duration. Geoff Meacham : Great. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. Thanks, Mike, and Dan. Thanks, Geoff, for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the data as well. Do you -- I guess a couple of questions on tirzepatide. At first, do you see weight loss plateauing in the study, and if so, when did it plateau and then do you expect patients will stay on the drug once they have lost weight? I am trying to sense of just how you are thinking about duration of tirzepatide in obesity? The second question was on an accelerated filing in obesity. Just any clarity of when we could get more details on that? And then, finally, on the pre-diabetic progression to diabetes endpoint from SURMOUNT-1, I guess could diabetes prevention become a labeled indication or is this just more data that could come on label? Thanks so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We will go to Mike for all those questions. Mike Mason : Okay. I think that may have been more than two, but I will go through these pretty quickly. So, first of all, weight loss plateauing. I think we have to leave some of the data for our medical meetings coming up. So I will reserve that for that. We do believe that this is a chronic illness that requires a chronic treatment. So we do believe people will need to stay on the drug long-term in order to get the benefit. And then pre-diabetes, I look at that as an important population that tirzepatide could provide health outcomes for, so probably more about showing data where our segment could benefit from it versus having a labeled indication for it. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Mike Mason : And then -- okay. Kevin Hern : Sorry. Mike Mason : Go ahead. Dave Ricks : Go ahead. Kevin Hern : Next caller, please. Operator : Thank you. The next caller is Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Yeah. Thank you. Couple of questions, please. The long-term commercial potential diabetes helped by the co-morbidities, I mean, clearly, is there and I am sure it will be realized by you and your competitors. Could you comment rather on the trajectory near-term? You referenced the covered that novo has attained. But obviously they had a very expensive bridge program during that period, which makes it difficult to extrapolate what the real reimburse demand is. Separately, we are hearing that PBMs pushing back those patients that converted from the bridge to reimburse. So any comments you have on that will be helpful. And then, second, we had two late-stage failures with given you have first now at least in Phase III, as well as obviously having Verzenio. How are you thinking about how this impacts your development of your SERD program? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Andrew. We will go to Mike for the first one on the trajectory in obesity and then Jake for the question around SERD. Mike Mason : Yeah. As I said earlier, I do think it\u2019s going to be one that you are not going to probably spur now the gate on that. You will have a sizable segment but one that will grow over time. We will provide supportive care bridging programs, as you say at launch to make sure and support people so they can have a good experience and see the benefit to the weight loss. But we do think it\u2019s something that this is one that I would look at the obesity market, one that will establish, it will be decent size, but it will grow for the next decade or two. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Jake ? Jake Van Naarden : Yeah. Thanks for the question about SERDs. Our view of our program in the landscape hasn\u2019t really changed all that much in light of the recent announcements. Obviously, as it relates to the two most recent trial readouts, we have yet to see the actual data, though at least in one case there were some directional clues given by company management. I think largely speaking we saw those studies as sort of underpowered Phase II trials, and I think in many cases, what we are hearing qualitatively from those companies suggests exactly that. In other words, trends in the right direction but underpowered studies. Our initial second lines randomized trial that we are recruiting right now is a fully powered Phase III study. So if anything, we are actually more confident in that study winning than we were previously. But that\u2019s not really the -- that may be the first path to market for the agent and impactful for those patients In the late-line setting, but that\u2019s not really the ultimate I think most impactful place for the medicine, which is really in the adjuvant setting and we are working on the trial design there that we will talk more about later this year. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Jake. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the data. Just a quick question, Dan, this is a very large Phase III program that you are conducting for obesity and more broadly, but the statement that you will be pursuing a potential faster path to market with regulatory authorities on the basis of SURMOUNT-1 data is, it\u2019s certainly intriguing. How do you see the likelihood of success and is the real separation there the 20% threshold, do you really think that\u2019s the potential game changer or is it something else in the data that we have yet to see that you think is unique and compelling? And then, separately, just wanted to follow up on the -- your comments on the Alzheimer\u2019s side of things. I think you have said in the past that there are some issues as it relates to how we think about the impact or thoughts around other clinical trials. I am wondering how you are feeling along those lines and really just wanted to get your general sort of compare and contrast of the Lilly program versus some of those -- some of the other two programs that are coming later this year? Thanks. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. We will go to Dan for both of those. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. Sure. Seamus, I mean, let me start with tirzepatide and sort of the comments that I made on the regulatory path. The FDA has clear guidance on what\u2019s required to get an indication for anti-obesity drug and those guidance documents form the basis of our previous discussions in alignment with the agency. Our base case based on those has been and really continues to be the submission will require the full package of Phase III data from this trial -- from this program. On the other hand, as I said, I think, we were impressed and delighted with the data that we got from SURMOUNT-1. It\u2019s a very large Phase III trial as you pointed out and there are a number of elements here that encouraged us to open the door for additional discussion with the FDA. You asked what is it specifically. Maybe I will highlight two or three things. First, the efficacy, as you pointed out, the more than 20% weight loss is really unprecedented level of weight loss in the field and I think that\u2019s exciting for patients and addressing a very significant unmet medical need. Second is the safety and tolerability data that we got. I think there is a pleasant surprise there if you look at how well tolerated this drug was, how few discontinuations we had, and as I pointed out, more discontinuations for treatment on placebo made more than on the active arms of the drug, just indicating that people tolerate this why I want to stay on the drug and appreciate the weight loss benefits they are getting. So the very good safety and tolerability profile that we are seeing, combined with the extraordinary efficacy profile, I think, is a major step in that argument. The last piece, of ,course is that we don\u2019t see this data in isolation. This builds on a very significant Type 2 diabetes program, which of course, involves many patients with Type 2 diabetes and obesity and demonstrated safety and efficacy in that setting as well. So we will see how that goes and I think to circle back to Chris\u2019 question, when do we learn more, as we have discussions with regulators. If we learn more and we see that there is an opportunity for expedited path here, we will be as forthcoming with investors as possible. Your second question here was around Alzheimer\u2019s and where we are thinking about our profile versus competitors and when those competitor readouts, what are we going to be looking at. I think we have a number of design elements in TRAILBLAZER 2 that we spoke about previously that we think could be very important, probably, starting with our use of biomarkers to select patients not just amyloid positivity, but also win doing in on patients with intermediate tau levels. So these aren\u2019t patients who have too much tau in the brain, because we think there beyond the point where anti-amyloid drugs will help them nor are they patients with no tau in the brain because we think those patients won\u2019t progress even on placebo, and therefore, won\u2019t get benefit from a drug. So we think selecting those patients will give us the opportunity to see better efficacy in a more homogenous background. Second, we think we have a drug that lowers amyloid faster and to a steeper degree and that should translate to improved benefits. And then third is some of the statistical differences in our analysis plan focusing on a composited measure ADRS, which we are excited about and things should be more highly powered to see a larger effect size. So all of those things combined lead us to a point where even if competitors trials are negative, and I think, there\u2019s a reasonable chance one or both could be, we won\u2019t be discouraged. What I expect to see though is when we look at the totality of data from competitor readouts prior to ours, we will see evidence that lowering amyloid in general is having a positive effect on solving cognition and function. Even if some trials on some endpoints at some time points hit or don\u2019t hit statistical significance, I think it\u2019s that totality data that will encourage us, and then as I said, our trial\u2019s designed to hit. So that\u2019s what we are hoping for and that\u2019s what we expect middle of next year. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alice Nettleton : Hi. Thank for taking my questions and congrats on the data. This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. Hey, just on tirzepatide, so based on your product and novo to the go, the weight loss is impressive, but with based products that still about 30% to 40% of patients who placebo who don\u2019t achieve at least 5% weight reduction, which is quite a high percentage and it almost seems to suggest a resistance mechanism of some sort to circular. So is there any mechanistic rationale or predictability for those who don\u2019t respond? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. We will go to Dan for the question. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks for that question. I think you are right, in past studies of different medications for weight loss. There have been a lot of patients who didn\u2019t respond. That\u2019s not the case with tirzepatide. So we are really delighted that at the 10 milligram and 15 milligram dose, more than 96% of patients had at least 5% weight loss. So this drug is working to some extent in the vast majority of patients in this trial and nearly two-thirds of the patients at the highest dose are getting 20% weight loss, which is really a life-changing level. So I think you are right. Patients are -- have variable degrees of resistance to anti-obesity mechanisms. But I also think that this combination of GIP and GLP that we have in tirzepatide is such a powerful mechanism that it overcomes those resistant patients for the most part. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Alice, thanks for your question. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and by the way, congrats on the data. It\u2019s how I maintain my physique. Well, I am joking. So, donanemab, I have two questions. One, have you been able to finalize the stack line with FDA? And also given your confidence in donanemab, I am curious why it would not make sense to have a CDR Sum of the Boxes endpoint in there in TRAILBLAZER for the head-to-head versus. And then, separately, just a quick one, I noticed your slides mentioned the IL-2 conjugate in ulcerative colitis has been removed and I couldn\u2019t tell if it\u2019s being discontinued in that because this trial is barely started less than six months ago. So just thought I should clarify. Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks. We will go to Dan for all those questions. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Sure. So let me start with the Alzheimer\u2019s questions. I think we have been public about our stats plan. I think the focus on ADRS is well warranted by all of the data that we have collected by a pretty detailed statistical analysis, many of which have been published on past trials, which just show this is an outcome that performs better from a statistical perspective then things like CDR Sum of Boxes, while still capturing both function and cognition. So CDR is noisy and also appears unreliable. If you look across sister studies, for example, the two solanezumab studies or the two aducanumab studies, CDR Sum of Boxes can move in opposite directions in different studies whereas ADLs and ADAS-Cog, the two components of ADRS are much more reliable, move together show consistent effects. So that\u2019s where we are, I think it\u2019s an evolution of endpoints and we will do our best to justify that with regulators once we have our data. Why wouldn\u2019t we have CDR Sum of Boxes was the second part question. Well, of course, we do. It\u2019s -- will be a gated secondary for sure, and I think from our perspective, the worst case scenario is that we are held to achieving ADRS and CDR Sum of Boxes. That\u2019s okay. If that happens, I hope and expect that we will have a good chance to hit CDR Sum of Boxes. But, of course, we are going to put what we see is the least noisy, most reliable, most formative endpoint first in our statistical analysis, which is ADRS. With respect to IL-2, you are right. This was a pretty fast in and out in ulcerative colitis. We were pleased to enroll this Phase II study pretty quickly. We triggered interim analysis based on a certain number of patients with a certain amount of follow up and based on that analysis and pre-specified criteria, we do not see enough efficacy to proceed. So it fail that futility analysis. We dropped that indication, wind down that particular study in ulcerative colitis, but two other indications persist. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Umer, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : Next caller is Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. A couple of questions. The SURMOUNT-1 data was very impressive, but not a huge surprise. It must have been considered as a likely scenario by Lilly, yet Lilly\u2019s filing strategy has shifted. So, just to be clear, has FDA or other regulatory body encouraged Lilly to file early based on the SURMOUNT-1 results? So that\u2019s the first question. Second question is, were there any inventory movements or other unusual movements in the quarter? It seems that a number of your key drivers just missed at least our thinking. So I am wondering if it was inventory movements that accounted for that? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. We will go to Dan for the regulatory question then Anat for the question on inventory. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : All right. Steve, I think, you said, it\u2019s not a surprise. I think there are some things here that are quite a bit more positive than maybe most people would have expected. Certainly, the level of efficacy here that was achieved was I think higher than most expectations, as well as the tolerability. So the adverse events from nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, lower probably than what most people would have expected treatment discontinuations particularly lower. So I think on the whole, we have a data package that does exceed expectations. So it\u2019s really at the top end of the range of what we thought might be possible for a drug tirzepatide. So we are excited about that. Specifically, you are asking about regulatory interactions. We usually don\u2019t want to get into like back and forth on and things like that. But just to be clear, as I said before, our alignment with the FDA was around submitting when the full package is complete, and have not had discussions yet about what other options might exist in light of the state. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Anat? Anat Ashkenazi : So for the dynamics in Q1, we typically see dynamic associated with inventory build at the end of each calendar year in December and then following by inventory burn typically in the first quarter of each year. We saw the same dynamic here this year. We saw an impact on Trulicity and a number of other products, which you may be seeing in as you are looking at the year-on-year comparison. The other element, if you are looking at Taltz from a year-on-year perspective, we did see in Q1 in comparison to Q1 of 2021 reduction in script size. As you recall, last year we had -- we started our contract with ESI and the loading dose with associate with multiple devices that each patient started on. So this quarter we are just seeing a reduction associated with that year-on-year comparison. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anat. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is the Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe a couple more on the obesity side, if I could. So one, you mentioned the Amylin agonist that you have moved in the Phase I here. Can you just maybe talk about that? Is that maybe more of an insurance policy against four competitors you are working on, or do you expect Amylin could maybe come with some mechanisms additional efficacy and that was overseeing now with the blips and lots of issues at the time? And then, second, you talked about this a little bit before around the discontinuation and the duration. So can you just remind us what the current duration or average duration of therapy is with Trulicity and then maybe if you have any sort of current something that how you want or when you think patient may end up staying in a product like yourself? But then given the -- I think the superior profile, we are seeing for that either for diabetes and/or obesity? Thank you so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Vamil. We will go to Dan for the question on kind of early phase obesity and then we will go to Mike for the question around Trulicity duration and implications in obesity. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks, Vamil. You are asking about our long-acting Amylin agonist here. We have been interested in biology of other incretins and incretin like pathways for many years, maybe a decade now or more. Amylin is one of those pathways. We have worked on dual Amylin calcitonin receptor agonist. This is a pure Amylin agonist. We are exploring these and other similar mechanisms as complements likely to tirzepatide. I don\u2019t expect any of these mechanisms to offer this kind of weight loss, 22.5% weight loss. But I think it may be for some patients who desire even additional weight loss that you could stack one of these mechanisms on top of tirzepatide. But clearly, we have raised the bar and we will look through our Phase I and Phase II portfolio now with even higher criteria for progressing. I think to a new weight loss mechanism now is going to have to be in the very high 20s I think to be an exciting advance beyond tirzepatide. Maybe adding something to tirzepatide could accomplish that and offer the majority of patient\u2019s efficacy similar even better to a bariatric surgery. That\u2019s the next frontier. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Mike? Mike Mason : Yeah. Thanks for the questions. A very good question. The -- when you look at diabetes versus obesity, it\u2019s hard to compare, I think, to suggest that because the nature of the diseases that you will have like similar discontinuation rates or our length of therapy. When you look at when someone starts Trulicity in Type 2 diabetes, they only have a fraction of the beta cell health of someone who is normal before the onset and the run-up of pre-diabetes and diabetes has lowered the functioning of the beta cell and so what you have in diabetes is that beta cell health continues to decline and then at some point, you may have to go on insulin. We don\u2019t believe that it will have that same dynamic and obesity that the effect of weight loss with someone who lives with obesity is not going to have that same effect of kind of wearing off with the beta cell health that you see for Trulicity and our GLPs in diabetes. So we do believe that the weight loss will be more durable and that patients will be well motivated to stay on therapy. That said, it will be an area of focus for us to make sure that we learn why people stop taking obesity agents and we will do whatever we can to support patients during the entire length of therapy. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Justin [ph] on for Carter. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on all these exciting updates today. The first one looking at read throughs to heart failure. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the implications of this amount data on the ongoing summit study, given the weight loss is a predictor of outcomes there. Does the magnitude of weight loss that today increase your confidence in the outcomes of that study and then are there any interim analysis, we should be looking for at the summit? Kevin Hern : Okay. Thank you. We will go to Mike for those questions on summit. Mike Mason : Yeah. I mean, good question. I mean I think the strength of the SURMOUNT-1 data makes us confidence in the entire tirzepatide Phase III program for all indications and so, obviously, our hypothesis, one of the hypothesis was weight loss would help individuals with HFpEF, and obviously SURMOUNT-1 supported that. So we are confident in our HFpEF program for tirzepatide. I don\u2019t believe we have, and maybe Dan can lead into that question, off the top of my head, but I do believe we have any interim readouts on our heart failure study. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Mike, I -- we usually try not to disclose potential interims\u2026 Mike Mason : Yeah. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : \u2026 to preserve the integrity of the study. So sometimes we build those options and sometimes, we are not. But I totally agree that this weight loss sort of at the high end of expectations, as I said earlier, it\u2019s just got to increase our confidence in HFpEF. And of course, as we dig deeper, we will look at a number of biomarkers in the study, which could further inform cardiovascular benefits. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan, and Mike. Justin, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Kerry Holford : Oh! Hi. Thanks for taking questions. Please, another one just tirzepatide first. So is the compelling data today enabled an earlier filing in obesity, are you also now hoping to secure a quick review? Do you think that that was so you could get that as a supplementary filing or perhaps you would look to use the PLP that you purchased this quarter and can you also just confirm exact PDUFA date for the diabetes filing? And then my second question for you, Anat, on IPR&D and guidance. Clearly this cost could evolve yet if you make further acquisitions, collaborations and so. But can we expect you to provide visibility at the start of each year on what extent, what level of milestones you believe Eli Lilly will make in the year ahead? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Kerry. We will go to Dan for the questions around regulatory filing around tirzepatide and then again to Anat on IPR&D and guidance. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Kerry. Just to clarify, we didn\u2019t announce plans for an early filing, we just said, we are moving to the next step and discussing options with regulators. You are right we do have a PR that we have repurchased. We are excited to have a portfolio with -- rich with opportunities, both new molecular entities, as well as the new indications such as the obesity indication. We will choose based on regulatory path that are available to us and unmet medical needs and competition, of course, what\u2019s the best opportunities that factor on. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Anat? Anat Ashkenazi : Kerry, so on the IPR&D charges, while we are now building them into our non-GAAP actuals and we will provide information not just on the quarterly results, but anything, any business development transactions that have been signed between the end of the quarter in our earnings call. But you -- if you look even at our numbers from last year, these numbers are highly variable and highly unpredictable. So you can move from 40 million in one quarter to 400 million in another quarter or even zero. And when we issue guidance, it is practically impossible for us to provide any detailed view on what those charges will be, not knowing what business development transaction we will be signing. So what we will do is, as we have those, we will provide that information to the investment community every quarter. Typically if it\u2019s associated with the large business development transaction there will be a press release associated with it within the quarter. So you will be able to see and track that. But providing it as part of guidance is challenging, practically impossible actually to predict these. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anat. And Kerry had a question on the Type 2 diabetes PDUFA. We don\u2019t give PDUFA dates. We announce it in the quarter when we submitted it. But we -- as we said, we expect that by midyear. Thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I would love to know if you have any additional color to why we saw a higher discontinuation rate in the mid-dose of tirzepatide data. And then more broadly speaking, when you think about in the market between Trulicity and potentially tirzepatide, do you expect to switch patients over, how do you expect this two assets to coexist assuming approval of tirzepatide? Thank you so much. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Evan. We will go to Dan for the first question around tolerability discontinuations and then, Mike, for the second one on Trulicity and tirzepatide. Dr. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks. In this study, the tolerability of the 10 milligram and 15 milligram doses were pretty similar. So it\u2019s not surprising the treatment discontinuation rates could have been pretty similar. Of course, there is a little bit more efficacy on the 15 milligram dose, which is important driver to stay on therapy. So probably see the balance of tolerability and efficacy playing out a little bit better, perhaps, in the 15 milligram and the 10 milligram. But these are all pretty small rates of discontinuation, if you look at sort of mid single-digit rates of discontinuation for AEs. So that\u2019s really great. I think better than expected. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. And Mike, on Trulicity and tirzepatide marketing thoughts? Mike Mason : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our focus is going to be growing the class, as well as growing our share of market in the class. We will try to maximize the opportunity for our entire incretin portfolio. I mean what\u2019s most important is not necessarily switches for molecules, existing products, but more the new patients that are coming on into the incretin class and winning those new patients. And so, I think over time, we will get a mix between new patient starts and switches from other GLPs. But I think primarily, our focus is going to be on really driving tirzepatide wins of new patients coming into the class and so that will be our approach going forward. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike, and Dan. Evan, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. Two questions, if I may on tirzepatide and the potential for read across from Novo\u2019s outcome study that is the next data point I think in terms of thinking about the progress of this ultimate opportunity. Can you frame for us what you think would be your expectations and maybe level set what you think would be a bar there? I know that you mentioned that you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessarily a gating factor. That would be helpful. Second question on the post-final NCD for donanemab and the language that CMS used, do you have clarity from perhaps post the final NCD that your current program will adequately address what they believe to be sort of structural requirements for the kinds of studies that need to be conducted in order for CMS to contemplate full reimbursement of Alzheimer\u2019s therapy? Thank you. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We will go to Mike for just the thoughts on outcome studies in the competitive landscape there in obesity, and then Anne for the question on the NCD in the donanemab. Mike Mason : Yeah. Good question. We touched on this a little bit early, but I think, the -- we expect the Step CV study to be successful given the expected weight loss and what he has expressed. We think that will be important to continue to grow the class and for some payers winning access on it. So we hope that the Step program is successful, we expect it will be, and obviously, we have a very comprehensive Phase III program to demonstrate outcomes for obesity, we also are confident in. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Anne? Anne White : Yeah. Thanks for the question on donanemab. So, as Dan mentioned, our priority will be to advocate for reconsideration with the TB-2 Phase III data. So we do remain confident in donanemab and believe that TB-2 and our overall TRAILBLAZER program have extensive data and so as we review the requirements in the NCD, we believe our data should be sufficient to meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS if TB-2 as positive. Obviously, we will need to review this data with CMS and gain their agreement. So we will do that very quickly. Our intention is as soon as we have that data to request reconsideration for national coverage and we believe that having two positive pivotal trials should meet that high level of evidence. As far as CMS, we have engaged with them throughout the process and so we will continue to do so moving forward. And there\u2019s a number of statements in the NCD that we will see clarity on to gain additional clarity as we move forward. But, yes, we do believe that we should meet that high level of evidence, but pending those discussions with CMS. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Anne. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please. Operator : The next caller is Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and I guess I will keep going on the tirzepatide route. So a lot of you will have question in the duration of therapy. Have you talked to payers about once you reach a point, where maybe some of your co-morbidities are gone and you are on drug, if they are going to be still reimbursed therapy? And then the second question for you is, like, when you think about this data now that you have in-house is very robust. What new trials might you think about or new indications whether it would be obesity without comorbidities or other indications might you want to start, now that you sort of have this in-house and it\u2019s clear? Thanks. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Robyn. We will go to Mike for both of those questions. Mike Mason : Yeah. Good questions. And when we are having discussions with payers, they do -- they are excited about the obesity class, if we can demonstrate outcomes. And if they have a patient who has seen benefits from an anti-obesity medication, they actually want to work with us to make sure that those individual stay on therapy in order to get and maintain the weight loss they have seen and so I think there will be opportunities for us to partner with payers to ensure that we can maintain individuals on chronic medications. I think our expectation is that people do need to stay on tirzepatide long term in order to get the -- and maintain the weight benefits and we will be working with payers to make sure that we can maintain that weight loss, so people can get the outcomes that they need. Second question-- remind me, Kevin, what the second question was? Kevin Hern : Any new trials or indications as you see this data beyond what we have announced. Mike Mason : Yeah. I mean, I think, that we are going to talk about and in today\u2019s discussion obviously we will internalize this data. We will -- this is, as we said earlier, this is an important therapeutic area for us, massive unmet needs and one that we are looking to play the long-term game on. So when you put those together, we obviously are, we will be very thoughtful and aggressive and if we do feel that there is additional need for trials on tirzepatide that can provide insights to payers and healthcare professionals, we will do those trials. Thanks for the questions. Kevin Hern : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robyn, for your questions. The queue is exhausted. We will go to Dave for the close. Dave Ricks : Okay. Great. Well, thanks for joining today\u2019s earnings and tirzepatide call, I guess, and your interest, of course, in the company. It is an exciting moment for all of us. 2022 started in a similar fashion to how we ended 2021, with strong momentum across the business. We remain focused on executing our innovation based strategy, which of course, is to bring new medicines to patients and create value for all our stakeholders. With strong commercial execution complemented by a pipeline of industry-leading opportunities, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. So thanks for dialing in today and please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call and have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Thank you.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kevin Hern : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2022 earnings call. Apologies for the hour delay. We had some technical issues on AT&T side. So thanks for your patience. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; and nadashKanazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Scabronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Bilia Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Norden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrick Jansen, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Mike Spring ether, Kenzie and Warren Zirki of the Investor Relations team as well as Joe Fletcher, who will be taking over leadership of the IR team this month. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. We -- additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Ricks : Thanks a lot, Kevin. In Q2, we achieved a number of impactful pipeline milestones, including approval and launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., the FDA submission and acceptance of dononumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line results for lebrikizumab and EU and Japan submissions for mirikizumab. This pipeline progress underscores the breadth and depth of our exciting long-term outlook. Perhaps the headline story for Lilly in the second quarter was the launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., where initial uptake has been strong. We're hearing a great deal of enthusiasm from the field and we're excited about the potential for this new medicine to provide A1c and weight loss benefits to adults living with type 2 diabetes. We remain focused on gaining broad open access for Manzaro and expect the full impact of this medicine for patients and our business to be realized over time as that access is achieved. Turning to Q2 financial results and progress on our strategic deliverables, we saw a relatively flat top line performance in constant currency. As strong volume-driven growth for key products like Verzenio, Jardiance and Trulicity was offset by lower prices as well as for Alimta patent expiry in key markets around the world and last year's sale of Cialis rights in China. Volume for this quarter grew a robust 10%. When excluding revenue from Alimta, the sale of Cialis rights in China and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% compared to Q2 2021. In Q2, our newer medicines contributed 18% to volume growth and now account for 67% of our core business revenue which we believe, together with our robust pipeline is the most important indicator of the strength and durability of our growth outlook. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.8% in Q2, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% which includes a negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to acquire in-process R&D and development milestone charges. At our investment community meeting in December, we outlined 5 potential new medicines that could launch over the next 2 years which could serve as catalysts to driving top-tier growth through the decade. There have been important pipeline development since our Q1 earnings call for all 5, including the U.S. approval and launch of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for purtaprutinib in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. -- submissions for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis in the EU and in Japan, positive top line 52-week data for lebrikizumab in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And we also announced U.S., EU and Japan regulatory approval for Olumiant in alopecia areata. Last month, we announced plans for a $2.1 billion investment in 2 new manufacturing sites here in Indiana to support increasing demand for existing products as well as demand for potential new medicines in our pipeline. This announcement followed Lilly's recent investments in new facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Ireland and will further expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities such as genetic medicines. These investments underscore our confidence in the growth of our portfolio in the company. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders in Q2. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates. As previously announced in Q2, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to supply 150,000 doses of beptalizumab for approximately $275 million in an ongoing effort to provide COVID-19 treatment options for patients. Doses of beptalizumab valued at approximately $130 million were shipped in Q2 and the remainder of that order will ship in Q3. Today, we are announcing that in collaboration with the U.S. government, we intend to begin making beptilizumab available for purchase by states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor agreement. This will happen later this month which is prior to the anticipated depletion of the U.S. government's currently available supply. As we move from large ad hoc federal government purchases, the sales and distribution of COVID-19 antibodies to a broader set of purchasers, we will now integrate estimated sales into our forward guidance. As we have said previously, we don't see COVID-19 antibodies as a major long-term driver of growth for the company. Nevertheless, we will continue to do our part where we can to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic with the last monoclonal antibody treatment standing that neutralizes against the Omacron variant. Operator : And now I'll turn the call over to Anat, for a more detailed review of our Q2 results. A - Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We had a few notable items impacting the year-over-year financial comparisons. Foreign exchange rates had roughly 300 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as we saw Q2 revenue declined 4% or 1% on a constant currency basis. In Q2 of 2021, we sold our rights to Cialis in China resulted in $170 million of onetime revenue impact. And this quarter, we also saw the full impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan and have started to see the impact of multiple generic entrants in the U.S. [Operator Instructions] A - Dan Skovronsky : To send a message to another subscriber under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the stake to enter your own mailbox Okay. Nothing has been selected to send a message to another subscriber under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the stake to enter your own mailbox. I'll continue and hopefully, everyone can hear. Nothing has been selected to send a message to another subscriber under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the stake to enter your own mailbox. When excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Cialis rights in China last year to send a message to another seroantibody under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the start normal... A - Anat Ashkenazi : Okay. Hopefully, you heard I will repeat my last intent. So when excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Calistri in China in Q2 of last year and COVID antibody total revenue grew 6%, highlighting the solid momentum for our core business in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will accelerate in the second half of the year. Moving on to gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 50 basis points to 79.8% in Q2 of 2022. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by product mix and the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, partially offset by lower realized prices. Increase in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation had a modest negative impact on gross margin in Q2. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter which as discussed on our Q1 earnings call, are now inclusive of acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges following guidance from the SEC. -- acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges represented nearly 1,200 basis points of the Q2 OpEx growth. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4%, driven mostly by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 8%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of $440 million or $0.46 of EPS primarily related to a charge associated with the buyer of substantially all future obligations that are contingent upon the development, regulatory and commercial success of our mutant selective PI3K alpha inhibitor. In Q2 2021, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges were $43 million or $0.04 of EPS. Operating income decreased 32% in Q2, primarily due to higher acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.5% which includes the negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to these charges. Other income and expense was expense of approximately $13 million this quarter compared with income of $5 million in Q2 of 2021. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 14.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. The -- this decrease was driven by favorable tax impact related to the implementation of a provision of the 2017 Tax Act related to the capitalization of R&D expenses, offset by the tax impact of nondeductible development milestones. At the bottom line, earnings per share declined 32% this quarter to $1.25 per share. The most significant driver of the year-over-year decline was the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges which had $0.46 negative impact in Q2 of this year compared to $0.04 in Q2 of last year. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 6%. Excluding revenue from Alimta which declined significantly due to broad generic entry in May and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This volume-driven growth was led by Trulicity, Verzenio and Dorian. We experienced a net price decline of 8% for Q2, driven by lower realized prices for Humalog, ALIMTA and Forteo due to higher rebated segments, making slightly larger portion of the business, higher contracted rates and the list price reduction for insulin lives for injection this year. Lower realized prices for Taltz were also a driver due to the impact of changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, largely driven by favorable adjustment in the base period and to a lesser extent, continued pull-through of existing access. For the first half of 2022, net price decline in the U.S. was 4% and we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline for the full year. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q2 grew 1% in constant currency. Excluding revenue from Alinta which lost exclusivity in June of 2021, revenue grew 12% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, False and Verzenio. For Japan, Q2 revenue decreased 22% in constant currency as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta which both faced generic entry beginning in June 2021. Key growth products represented 69% of total revenue in Japan and grew 11% in Q2 on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue declined 32% in constant currency, driven by the impact of the NRDL formulary access, resulting in lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume for certain newer products, including Verzenio, Tyva, Trulicity and Taltz. We also experienced a price decline for Humalog due to the impact of volume-based procurement. We expect improved access to continue to drive future volume growth more than offsetting the price decline over time. With the latest COVID-19 outbreaks in China and to subsequent protective measures intended to control the spread of the virus, we have seen lower volume than we otherwise would have expected in Q2, particularly for infused products. For Tivit, we are also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency, primarily driven by increased sales of key growth products. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline in each of the U.S., EU and Japan and a double-digit price decline in China, resulting in a worldwide net price decline in the high single digits. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 20% or nearly 24% in constant currency, generating $4.3 billion in sales and making up 67% of our core business revenue. We continue to see further growth opportunities for these products. For example, we're extremely pleased to see the strong trajectory of Verzenio driven by the adjuvant indication, including recent acceleration in new to brand share of market. In the injectable incretin market, we see significant opportunity for further class growth as these medicines currently make up only 25% of total prescription in the U.S. branded diabetes market and have the prospect of expanding the market through the earlier usage for glucose control and weight loss in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Trulicity is experiencing accelerated demand in many international markets due to market growth and the limited availability of competitor GLP in select markets. We are working to meet this increased demand, while also implementing actions in select countries to manage growth and minimize patient impact. This outlook for Trulicity is included in our guidance. Lilly is thrilled to have both Trulicity which has the longest length of therapy of any GLP-1 and Mounjaro which could offer a step change in innovation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic indications as option in this class of medicine. Given the excitement and significant interest with the FDA approval of Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, I'd like to briefly provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing in terms of early launch. After U.S. approval in mid-May, our full scale launch began in mid-June. Our commercial team is prepared, energized and observing a high level of engagement across channels as we roll out a patient-centric approach to launching Monga for patients with type 2 diabetes. The financial results you see from Anjar today reflect significant utilization of samples were accepted and co-pay assistance program to get patients off to a strong start. Pierre negotiations are progressing as expected and we're taking a disciplined approach to establish Monza's access and are focused on delivering the same broad open access which we achieved for Trulicity. As we remain focused on strong execution, we're encouraged by the prescription trends from Mounjaro, including the most recent IQVIA data, shown over 20% share of market for new-to-brand prescriptions in the Type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class. We are also pleased to see that total Lilly-Ntabren share in the type 2 diabetes injectable incurring class has grown nearly 12 percentage points since the launch of Mounjaro. Given the heavy utilization of co-pay cards as we build out access for Mounjaro, prescription trends will likely provide a more accurate measure of launch uptake than net sales over the next few quarters. We are pleased with the initial uptake of Mounjaro which is at the high end of our contemplated scenarios. We do not anticipate supply constraints for the U.S. launch of Mounjaro and we will monitor U.S. uptake to determine the appropriate timing for OUS launches. As a reminder, over the last several years, we have made significant investments to grow our global manufacturing capacity to support Manja volume, including our new RTP side in North Carolina which will come online in 2023. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first half of the year, we invested $4.5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent as we continue to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook is unchanged. And -- it now includes an additional $400 million of headwind from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $700 million of FX headwind for the full year compared with our original guidance. This incremental headwind is offset by additional forecasted revenue from our COVID-19 antibody betolizumab which includes $275 million from the U.S. government agreement announced in June of this year as well as estimated revenue from the inception of non-U.S. government distribution that Dave mentioned earlier. As we look ahead, Q3 will mark the first full quarter impact of Alimta U.S. fab Nexi. In addition, Q3 of 2021 revenue benefited from Ilunion COVID-19 sales that will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our top line growth in the quarter. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged. While the range is unchanged, SG&A does include additional commercial investments for selected key growth products in the second half of the year. Our guidance now include acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of approximately $610 million, reflecting total charges in the first half of the year. We have had no material acquired IP R&D or development milestone charges at this point in Q3 and this guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transactions in the second half of the year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 100 basis points to approximately 27% and 29%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact attributable to foreign exchange rates and acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges to date. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of $500 million to $600 million, reflecting the impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during the second quarter. Our tax rate and EPS in the first half of the year still includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year assumes this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for 2022. We -- if this provision is not the further repealed effective this year, then we would expect a reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.34 to now be in the range of $6.96 to $7.11 per share and lowered our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.25 to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.05. The $0.25 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange rates as the impact of EPS of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges for selected -- and selected products are offset by impact of additional sales of baptilozumab. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. Looking across Lilly R&D, I continue to be quite encouraged by the potential we have to turn cutting-edge science into life-changing medicines for patients. This potential is becoming a reality in the late-stage portfolio, where I'll focus my remarks today. But also it's becoming more and more evident in our earlier-stage projects and I look forward to providing updates on some of these assets in future quarters. Given updates we provided at ADA in June, including detailed results from Surmont 1, I'll focus today's R&D update on the late-stage progress since our last earnings call more generally. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 1 and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover both of these slides by therapeutic area. Starting with Immunology; along with our partner, Insight, we're proud that Olumiant has now been approved as a first-in-disease systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata in the U.S., EU and Japan. Alopecia areata is a significant unmet medical need and we're delighted about what this medicine could mean for people living with this disease. We also announced top line data from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy maintenance studies in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis which showed 80% of lebrikizumab responders maintained improvements in skin clearance and disease severity at 52 weeks. Data supported both once every 2-week and once every 4-week maintenance dosing with consistent and durable responses. We believe the potential for a once every 4-week maintenance dosing regimen could be an important point of differentiation for patients and healthcare providers. Lilly's planning submission of lebrikizumab to the FDA in 2022, followed by submissions to other regulatory agencies around the world. Almirall has rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis in Europe and is planning for submission to the EMA in 2022. Shifting to mirikizumab. We presented results from the Phase III maintenance study LUCENT-2, at the DDW meeting. This study showed that for patients who responded to treatment on mirikizumab in the 12-week induction period, 50% of patients who received mirikizumab maintenance therapy achieved clinical remission at 1 year compared to 1/4 of patients randomized to placebo. In addition to the U.S. regulatory submission of mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis that we announced earlier this year, we have now submitted in the EU and Japan. Also noted here in Immunology is a Phase II start for a BTLA agonist antibody in SLE and our new KB103 inhibitor shown in Phase I. Our IL-2 conjugate is now listed under its nonproprietary name, RespegAltusleukin. Moving to diabetes. We're thrilled that Manjaris now approved in the U.S. is the first and only GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. We're pleased to have received a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union and we're hopeful for a full approval by the EMA later this quarter. We presented the exciting detailed results from Surmont 1, evaluating truzepatide for treatment of weight management and participants with obesity or overweight at ADA with simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. New data included an exploratory analysis that showed roughly 40% of patients achieved at least 25% weight reduction on the 15-milligram dose compared to less than 1% of patients on placebo. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in blood pressure and lipids as well as reduction in fat mass that was nearly 3x greater than that in lean mass. Encouraging data also showed that for those patients who had prediabetes at the start of the study, over 95% returned to normal glucose levels. The efficacy, safety and tolerability data in Surmont 1 exceeded our expectations. Based on our existing robust data set for tirzepatide, we've now engaged with the FDA and we'll have a meeting soon to evaluate whether there's a potential path forward to registration for chronic weight management based on Surmont 1, combined with data from the SURPASS program. We'll continue to communicate to investors as there are material updates. We continue to expand our clinical program for tirzepatide and we've now initiated our Phase III study evaluating tirzepatide for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. We also have become -- we also begun a new trial called SURPASS EARLY which evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of tirzepatide compared to standard of care when initiated early in the course of type 2 diabetes. Later this year, we'll begin surmount 5, a head-to-head study comparing weight reduction for tirzepatide versus semaglutide 2.4 milligrams. And finally, later this year, we expect to initiate Surmount MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study. Moving to our weekly basal insulin Fc, also known as BIF. We've now initiated a second Phase III trial Q2 which is evaluating BIF compared to DEGLIDEC in adults with type 2 diabetes who are starting basal insulin for the first time. Our Phase II GGG triagonist is now listed under its nonproprietary name, Retitrutide. Also in this area, 2 assets have now entered Phase I clinical development, our dual amylin calcitonin receptor agonist or DACRA and our PNPLA3-SIRNA. In oncology, we are announcing today that the FDA has accepted the filing for partabrutinub in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. Improved treatment options are needed for this challenging disease and we're encouraged that this potential new medicine could be available to patients in early 2023 -- in early phase oncology, we've moved our mutant-selective PI3-kinase alpha inhibitor into Phase I development. And finally, moving to neuroscience. We're also pleased to announce the FDA has accepted the filing for genimab for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and has granted priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. We continue to look forward to the top line results of the Phase III confirmatory study, Trailblazer ALS 2 by mid-2023 which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. You also noticed we're now referring to N3PG4 by its nonproprietary name Rimtenatak. We plan to initiate the Phase III program for remternatac in the coming weeks. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now, I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the second quarter. We're encouraged by the performance of our key growth products which now represent 67% of our core business. We expect to see this grow over time as we work to launch more innovative medicines like Manzaro. Excluding the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges, we expect to see operating margin expansion from both revenue growth and driving further efficiencies in our business. We saw significant progress in our pipeline this quarter with the approvals of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and Illumina in alopecia areata. We also saw progress on our next wave of potential growth catalysts with the FDA acceptance of danonumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line readout for lebrikizumab and additional submissions for mirikizumab. Finally, we returned $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. Looking to the future, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects as we are focused on developing groundbreaking therapies in areas of significant unmet need as well as driving exceptional execution for our recently launched medicines, so they reach patients who need them. Before we close, I'd like to comment as well. This is Kevin Hern last call as Head of our IR team. And before I turn the call over to him to moderate the Q&A session, I'd just like to thank him on behalf of our shareholders, our board and of course, our executive team and employees. He's done an outstanding job for the last 4.5 years, strengthening our relationships with -- the Street as well as being an ambassador to both convey the company's messages to shareholders but also inform management about shareholder perspectives. We wish him the best in his new assignment transitioning to a leadership role in our U.S. commercial group. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin for his last Q&A session. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Thanks for the kind words. I will definitely miss it. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so please emit your questions to 2 per caller. Louis [ph], if you can provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just have 2 quick ones. One on Mounjaro. I know it's pretty early in adoption but maybe just talk about the source of new starts, meaning are they GLP naive or experience? And then talk about the expected payer dynamics looking to 2023 -- and for Dan on tirzepatide, I know your regulatory discussions are ongoing in obesity but do you think you can also use the safety database from diabetes and other indications when you look to kind of NASH, sleep apnea, et cetera. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Geoff. We'll start off with Mike on Lazaro. And then Dan, if you want to comment on the regulatory for trispeidesaD. Mike? Mike Mason : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for the question. What we've seen -- first of all, we're incredibly excited about the very robust launch we've had with Manzaro. We're also excited about the source of business that we're seeing. 72% of Monday's is coming from new patients into the entrain class. We think that's very important for accelerating class growth and we have seen class growth both at total prescriptions, new-to-brand and NTS accelerate since BonCharles launch. Of the 28% of the volume that's coming from switches, only 30% of that is from Trulicity and 70% is from other GLPs. And so as a result, as Anat indicated earlier, we're actually seeing Lilly incretin share market growing which is the sign that we -- of a robust solid foundation that we're laying. And so the NBRx have increased our share by the Lilly share in the injectable market by 12% and new to treatment starts by 10%. So we're very happy. We're growing the class and the market share at the same time. Your second question around payer dynamics, it's going as expected for us. We're trying to stay very disciplined. I think our focus is to set ourselves up for long-term success, not short-term success. -- and that's what we're doing. So it's going as expected. So far, we have both commercial and Part D access on Express Scripts, Cigna and Humana formularies. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Dan? A \u2013 Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. You\u2019re pointing out that correctly that we intend to pursue a number of related indications for tirzepatide. Some of them have overlapping patient populations. Most of the indications we pursue have a base of patients that either have obesity as a pre-existing and sometimes causative condition such as obstructive sleep apnea or heart failure in people with obesity, other indications might be a mix of type 2 diabetes and obesity representing a large number of patients such as NASH. So where applicable safety exposures from similar proposition can be used to support submissions. Of course, some of those programs are staggered in time. And so by the time we get efficacy data of those indications, we\u2019ll also have quite likely the rest of the Samat [ph] program. But where we are today is quite a large and robust safety database from the entire COBAS program as well as SME. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan, Jeff. Operator : The next caller is Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just two for me. I guess just on the obesity opportunity. I guess, basin the feedback you've been getting on that surmountidata, I guess is there any change in terms of how you anticipate payers will approach obesity? I guess the heart of the question is, do you anticipate we're going to really need to see some of the CV morbidity mortality data before we can think about broad coverage for obesity medications? Or are you seeing payers potentially more interested in covering these type of products given some of the profile that kind of emerged from that study? My second question was one for Dave. I guess, on just in healthcare reform. I know you love answering these questions. But I guess, as you guys just been so involved in this process. So just appreciate your thoughts on the latest bill we\u2019re seeing and just kind of the impact you\u2019d expect it to have in the industry and maybe a little more specifically. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Mike first and then on obesity, then Dave for healthcare reform. Mike Mason : Yes, great question. The SURMOUNT 1 data was phenomenal data for patients and physicians who treat obesity. We -- I think there's a combination of effects that will affect employers and the government to increase access for obesity agents. One is the data we produce. And I think, obviously, the first data we're producing is the weight loss as well as the factors like lipids and blood pressure. And the data we produce so far has been stellar. So I think the better data we produce and Surmont 1 through SMA4 is just going to help us in the short term. Long term, we think there's a lot of comorbid conditions associated with obesity like CV and heart failure and sleep Pactia and the better data we support there will open up those indications where are highly have a lot of overlap with obesity. And so we're excited about those trials and seeing those data as those trials complete. And then lastly, the more we can drive consumer interest in this, that puts pressure on employers and the government to be able to gain access for this. And so I think we've got strong plans on all 3 fronts and we're excited about the first data disclosure we've had on obesity. So we're very bullish on the long-term prospects of the obesity market and rolling it. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Dave? Dave Ricks : Yes Chris, thanks for the question. I think everybody probably on the call has a good grasp of what's in this package, Difficult to speculate on probabilities but certainly a lot higher than a month ago that something crosses the line. There may be some adjustments to this as they go through that parliamentary process and whatever changes might occur or still to come in the center in the house. But if what we're looking at passes, maybe that's your question, as you know, we've been for the Part D forms, I think they're good incremental changes, particularly capping annual out-of-pocket and getting rid of the donut hole concept. Unfortunately, they don't improve the concept of facing patient cost sharing on net pricing which we were hoping it would. But by itself, we would support that. The CPI adjustment is not really an issue as probably everyone on this call knows, there's already lots of CPI capping that goes on in the commercial marketplace. And with CPI being where it is now as well. I think list prices in the drug business are not nearly as fast as the rest of the economy. But the negotiation piece is a problem. And I think in the short term, speaking for our company but probably the industry, it doesn't do much. They don't really start until '26 anyway. But in the midterm, there will be, of course, some products that will have attenuated life cycles. And I think that will cause some headwinds for the industry and we'll see if any Lilly products get caught up in that. But probably, to me, the most damaging thing about it is it sends a signal to investors and capital allocators like us that small molecules and particularly small molecules in diseases that require stepwise development like cancer, where we start in stage at later stages and work our way to adjuvant or even in some orphan conditions really aren't wanted and are worth a lot less. So, we'll focus our resources on other areas of innovation. We've got plenty of those. And so will the rest of the sector. And I think that's really a miss for the patients that probably want better oral cancer drugs in the future and orphan disease drugs. So I think that's probably not being talked about enough and I just wanted to emphasize that. Operator : The next call is Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : Great. So just a couple of questions here. Dave, I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on the comment that you made there with regard to orals, how do you see that impacting your efforts to bring forward oral diabetes drugs? And is it more a benefit to complex oral therapies that aren't small molecule per se but perhaps a more peptide oriented. I know you guys are working on some efforts along those lines. So just interested to know if the legislation would imply that as well from a small molecule perspective, we see a number of oral GLP-1s seeking to come to market. at some point in time? And then separately, just on Dan, on the glucagon mechanism, I see BBG listed in 2 Phase II clinical trials but mazetide, your Axos modulin product is listed just in sort of the Phase 1 in diabetes. Wondering if you guys have officially made a decision to move forward with BG or if mazetide is still potentially in the mix as kind of your next-gen asset in the obesity space. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dave and then Dan. Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks, James. I mean, I guess, put a finer point on it. Each project will have to be evaluated one by one. But I think you will probably see 10 years down the line, fewer small molecule oral products developed in the industry than would have been otherwise the case if this bill passes. -- again, that to me is the miss. And I think it -- there's still probably quite a bit of advantage in oral small molecules in sort of large primary care indications, especially if in the case of like GLP, we could accept that weight loss will provide broader benefits for the earlier question about when sort of the belief system tips over and people just accept that chronic weight management could for health like reduced blood pressure is good for cardiovascular risk. And I think those products will be evaluated one by one and big opportunities, I think, will advance and do well. They'll have attenuated life cycle in the government business and that will have to be factored in but we'll look at that. What I was referring to is more, I think, in narrower revenue opportunities, it just gets a lot harder. And when -- by kind of construct, your new indications can't be compressed forward because of the way we develop drugs in some of these diseases, that's a problem. And I don't think that was well thought through and there will be a long-term implication to that. One other thing I probably should say is this bill raises $300 billion for the federal government off the back of the industry, probably cost the industry at least $0.5 trillion and only about $50 billion of that, like 10% is going back to patient benefit support. And I think that's another tenant when we were leading pharma literally was to make sure whatever came out of the industry went back to patients. That's not happening here and that needs to be discussed as well. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. Dan? Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Seamus, for the question on our glucagon containing molecules. We previously said that we have 2 in clinical development, mazdutide which is our oxyntomodulin that's glucagon plus GLP-1 and retitrutide which is our ABG which is glucagon GLP-1 and GIP 1. You're right that the ACG molecule is a head and development that's in Phase II and the oxyntomodulin is still in Phase I. I think they're both viable as next-generation weight loss products. But to be clear here, it's a very high borrower looking for a major step change above the really remarkable results we saw in Surmont One. I think they both have that potential but we're going to need to see more data to know which it either goes forward to Phase II. -- just like when we're doing Phase II interzepatide which was just a few years ago, we noted that it had to have a step change to go forward to Phase III. If you hear us talk about when or growth of these molecules going to Phase III, it means we saw that kind of a big step change. Kevin Hern : Thanks. Operator : The next caller is Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : So my first question for you was on the obesity product. Do you see any potential read-throughs from NOVO SELECT study to tazepatide? And have you given any color on how you want to structure your studies on an outcome basis for BC? And then secondly, it's been quiet on the Alzheimer's front but just curious if you have any updated thoughts on the market opportunity for demenumab, especially in front of some of these Phase III trials will read out at the end of the year. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Louise. We\u2019ll go to Dan for the question on the SELECT trial and then Anne for the question on Alzheimer\u2019s. Dan Skovronsky : Louise, thanks for that question. Of course, we always reach for our competitors' success on clinical trials. We want great data so that we can have great drugs to help patients. I think the novo they pass the interim analysis but didn't stop the trial for efficacy is fine. I think there's really pretty significant differences here between tirzepatide and semaglutide that we just have to remember, a different mechanism, a different degree of efficacy on various outcomes, different trial designs, different populations to some extent. So we don't change our design of our SURMOUNT MMO study. We don't change our thinking about probably success. As Mike said earlier, we're highly confident in this mechanism. -- based on all of the data that we've seen, of course, starting with a quite dramatic weight loss which should be a benefit on morbidity and mortality from obesity. But also all of the cardiovascular indicators that we reported out in that Phase III study, including a very significant drop in blood pressure that should have a benefit -- a drop in LDL, an increase in HDL a drop in triglycerides, all of that should contribute to cardiovascular outcomes. So we remain excited and confident about our own study going forward. Louise Chen : Thanks, Dan. Dan Skovronsky : Louise, thanks for the question on Alzheimer's. So the fact is bottom line is we remain convinced about the mid- and long-term opportunity for donanemab and the Alzheimer's portfolio. Our focus right now is obviously on the rapid availability of donanemab for the appropriate patients through the accelerated approval pathway and then reconsideration with Phase III data. And we remain optimistic that with -- particularly with traditional FDA approval, FDA -- or sorry, CMS would not continue to limit coverage for on-label treatments. Now obviously, you mentioned competitor readout. As we've noted on prior calls, there is a chance that we'll see mixed results in some of these readouts due to the differences in the medicines and their trial designs. And as you know well, we have some unique design features in TV2 and a medicine that demonstrates rapid and deep plaqclearance. So we won't be discouraged if others miss their primary endpoints. And so we'll be following that closely, obviously. But in the near term, of course, we have to acknowledge that patient access will be very limited under the current CMS and CD with accelerated approval. But what that does do with the accelerated approval is really enable us to engage quickly with CMS following that Phase III data and hopefully drive reconsideration at that point. And it also allows us to accelerate the traditional approval through a supplemental BLA. So what we'll do in the near term, following a potential approval and the accelerated pathway is use that time to build out the diagnostic ecosystem to help physicians with the referral process and infusion systems. And so there's quite a bit to do, I think, to get ready for that Phase III data. Operator : The next call is Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Two for me. I guess, Mike, you talked about aiming for long-term success with Manzaro from a reimbursement perspective. So can you just maybe define that for us, put a finer point on it? Should we assume that means you're aiming for a net price above Trulicity ultimately over time? And then as we think about your ability to supply the market here, obviously, launch, you said at the high end of your expectations. No, I think you touched on this a little bit during your comments in terms of confidence in U.S. supply. But how are you thinking about the broader supply dynamics globally and then remind us your flexibility to increase supply, if needed over time. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Terence. We'll go to mic for both questions on Manzaro, with access and price and then just global supply outlook. Mike Mason : Okay. Thanks, Terrence, for those questions. Long term, I think our goals there is obviously to optimize our net price but also secure broad access like we have for Trulicity. So those are our 2 goals. Obviously, we don't give specifics on our net price negotiations publicly. But we're pleased with the progress. We're staying disciplined, trying to accelerate access before any new product launch. You got to be careful that you're not too aggressive, you get access to early but you pay too much for it. So we're staying disciplined. We've got a great product with a great profile. Payers are seeing that but it's a process and we're going through that process right now. From a supply perspective, Mongeral, as Anat said, we were planning for success. And so we had a lot of different launch scenarios. And we have lot scenarios that considered this level of uptake. As Anat shared, we don't anticipate any supply constraints for the U.S. launch of Manzaro. We -- our manufacturing team has been working around the clock for years to build manufacturing capacity throughout the supply chain. We have a number of sites who make this and they're optimizing our initial capacity on a daily basis. Also, we have made investments to expand our capacity over the next several years. We have a new parental plant at Research Dragon Park in North Carolina that's coming online in 2023 and another one behind that in Concord, North Carolina. Also, we're building 2 manufacturing facilities to make taconigredient for Mongeral and those will come on at a later time. So obviously, we're planning for success. And -- our manufacturing team is working around the clock to get as much of past supply as possible. Terence Flynn : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Next call is Tim Anderson with Research [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : On the outcomes trial for obesity, presumably, that's a cardiovascular outcomes trial with MACE was a primary endpoint? And if so, what level of benefit will it be powered to show? Novo is designed to show 17%. And then on the head-to-head versus Novo's product in obesity, anything you can see on trial design, specifically primary endpoint and perhaps, most importantly, the timing of having results... Kevin Hern : Thanks, Tim. We\u2019ll go to Dan for the first question on Surmount MMO and then Mike for the second question on the head-to-head trial with Novo for Costa. Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks for that question, Tim. You're raising an interesting point. I think implicit in your question is the observation that there's a lot of health benefits that come from losing weight Obesity is a risk factor for a number of things, not just the things that are traditionally measured in cardiovascular outcome studies or MACE studies. So probably also noting, we've called this morbidity mortality outcomes, MMO in obesity rather than CVOT. But beyond that, I think we've intentionally not gotten into details on the primary endpoint or the powering assumption. So that is yet to be disclosed. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Mike? Mike Mason : Yes. On the head-to-head versus sema 2.4 milligram, there's been no head-to-head trials comparing receppatide to sema 2.4. So we believe there was a good opportunity to do that to demonstrate tirzepatide significant weight loss benefits and totality, the benefits it has for patients. Head-to-head studies are the gold standards. Every time we talk to healthcare professionals, they really value and get a lot out of head-to-head studies. It just really informs their treatment. So we think it's the right thing to do and we're pleased to do that. It's going to be a head-to-head study, where we're comparing tuxepatide versus 72.4 in people that have obesity and overweight with the weight-related core mobility. Other than that, we'll provide more on the design and the time line at the later date as we get closer to posting it on clinicaltrials.gov. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Tim, thanks. Operator : The next call is Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : A couple of questions. First, Lilly mentioned in the prepared remarks, a limited availability of competitor GLP-1s in select geographies. Can you be more specific on which geographies and the magnitude of the issue? And then a question for Dan. You must have been on the receiving end of many calls from DSMBs with interim updates on trials. For example, the trial of Trulicity in cardiovascular outcomes REWIND. The question is, what is the depth of the information exchange between DSMBs and sponsors at that time? For instance, if a study is continuing past an interim look, is the conversation only 3 words, study is continuing? Or is it more expensive? Or does it depend? And if it depends, what does it depend on? It would seem to me at least, counterproductive for DSMB not to provide some guidance just from the vantage point of further development of the molecule. So that's my question. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Steve. We're going to go to Ilya for the question on the supply and demand that we're seeing for Trulicity outside the U.S. and then we'll go to Dan for the second question. Ilya? Ilya Yuffa : Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. First, what we've seen is an accelerated demand for Trulicity in many of our international markets and there's probably 3 sources of that one, great commercial success. We've been really successful in our diabetes portfolio in driving the growth and utilization of Trulicity. At the same time, we've seen accelerated market growth. And we have seen in some select markets, the amplified demand for Trulicity because semaglutide is not available in full extent in a number of markets. In terms of where we've seen volatility in where that is occurring. And so we're evaluating the local situation is quite dynamic and we're ramping up as much as we can to need this amplified demand. At the same time, in some of these markets, we're going to have to look at managing some of the growth and making sure we limit any kind of patient impact. Steve Scala : Thanks, Ilya. Kevin Hern : Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks,. I understand where your question is going and we probably don't weigh in specifically on what others might do or see but I'll tell you how we run DSMBs and how we think about them generally across the industry. There's a couple of principles at play here. First, of course, is independence. This is not something run by the sponsor. And I think that's an important consideration for patient safety. We don't see the data they see and we're not privy to the discussions as a rule. The second is that we do set for DSMB's rules in advance by which they should make decisions. Those could be very simple rules in some cases, like hit statistical significance with a certain alpha on the primary endpoint or they could be more complex rules looking for consistency across secondaries or subpopulations or a higher bar of efficacy on the primary so that you're sure that you have a compelling effect that varies from study study and sponsor to sponsor. I'm sure. The third thing is that the recommendations that DSMBs get back to sponsors are often prespecified. So we'll tell the DSMB if it meets these criteria. This is what you tell us. And if it doesn't, this is what you tell us. And they usually are a matter of fact, without color that could compromise the integrity or cause one unblinding of an ongoing study. So I hope that's helpful in understanding how DSMBs work. I think at many companies, if there is a surprising recommendation for the DSMB such as to stop a study, there will often be a process where the sponsor or 1 or 2 representatives of the sponsor are unblinded so they can confirm the DSMB conclusion before taking action. But that wouldn't be typical for a simple study continuous kind of decision. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Kevin Hern : Steve, thanks for your questions. Operator : Next caller is Umar Raffat from Evercore -- to Andrew Baum from Citigroup. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions. First on Wingo. -- you uniquely have labeling requiring second form of contraception during titration which Gobi had. The recent Supreme Court overturning of row versus weight put increased emphasis on the confidence in terms of risk of pregnancy given the consequences. How are you thinking about this, whether it's potentially an acute for the product, whether through additional pharmacology studies that could be overturned as the obesity indication rolled through. It does seem from the FDA review that there's a real pharmacologic concern rather than the forcedata here? And then second, on the positive side in relation to the pursuit filing, assuming you get approval on commence cells. I\u2019m assuming that you would, therefore, get inclusion in the MCN NCCN guidelines for Brewing for CLL. So could you talk to how you think the expedited approval through mantle cell may accelerate your penetration of the CLL market when you\u2019re waiting for the Phase I trial program mature\u2026 Kevin Hern : Thanks andrew. We'll go to Mike for the first question on Mondoro labeling and the social climate and then we'll go to Jake for the question on prtibrutinib. Mike Mason : Thanks andrew. I appreciate the question. Let me just even said everyone, our label on Mongeral advisers women using contract oral contraception to switch to or add to a non-oral contraceptive methods for 4 weeks during initiation of the product and then during the dose titration for each dose. Given the -- so healthcare professionals are aware of this, given the profound benefits of Mongeral, this hasn't impacted at all HCP and consumer interest in Montara. If you look at the data in the marketplace, we have data with ONKVIA through July 22 which is just 5 weeks of full promotion. And we've -- and Mounjaro already reached 20% new brand share market. So we haven't seen this as an issue at all. As to the future works for and evaluating the issue, we have nothing new to report to investors at this time. But this has not been an issue that has impacted Montara's uptake at all. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Jay? Jake Van Naarden : So just as a matter of policy, we submit company sponsored guideline requests on consistent with labeling indications that we actually intend to receive or expect to receive. So we'll do that in this setting as well in the context of BTK pretreated relapsed/refractory metal cell lymphoma. What that -- from there, the NCCN and other guideline process is completely independent and has no involvement from us whatsoever to the extent that they choose to do something beyond our labeled indication is really completely out of our hands and hard for me to speculate on -- and of course, we'll be promoting the product only on the labeled indication that we received. Andrew Baum : Thanks, Jake. Kevin Hern : Andrew, thanks for your questions. Operator : The next caller is David Risinger [ph] from SVB Securities. Unidentified Analyst : So my questions relate to Manzaro, please. First, could you clarify the share gain percentages. So I believe the comment was that Lilly\u2019s combined Trulicity and Manzaro share gained by 12 percentage points. So I wanted to just understand what was the starting point and where is the figure today? And then there was also a comment about new to treatment starts gaining by 10%. So if you could provide the X to Y on that. And then based upon your current view of the very strong U.S. uptake of the product, to what degree is Lilly planning to gate its ex U.S. Munzara launches due to the manufacturing supply constraints that you\u2019re currently up against? Kevin Hern : Thanks, David. We'll go to Mike for the questions around share gain and then Ilya for the questions around OUS launch. Mike Mason : Okay Dave, thanks. I'll give you more context of the percentages that we had earlier on in the call. So what we're looking at is IQVIA data, the beginning of that by our analysis is June 3. We had our launch meeting the week after ADA, so the week of June 14 and -- so we have been promoting kind of full on since then. And so when you compare where we're at today, this is -- we have IQVA data through July 22, so 5 weeks of promotion. So we're comparing the -- our NBRx volume, our new-to-brand volume and share at July 22 versus June 13 in the injectable anchor gen market. And so what we've seen since then is that Montero's NBRx share has reached 20.5%. We saw Trulicity's NBRx has declined by only 8.4 share points. And so that produces a net gain in the Lilly injected NBRx share of 12.2%. And -- and then with NTS same time period, same market, we have a 10% overall Lilly injectable NBR share gain. Kevin Hern : Yes. David, thanks for your question on the launch of Manzaro outside of the U.S. and our thoughts around that. One of the key aspects of how we take a look at launching outside the U.S. It's typical for most product launches across pretty much all therapeutic areas to have some lag to U.S. launches, either through -- because of regulatory approval and process but also pricing and reimbursement -- and it can take up to a year to get reimbursement in a number of markets. So the volumes in that first year of launch are somewhat limited. We are encouraged by what we're seeing in the U.S. launch of Manzaro and looking forward to launching Anjar outside of the U.S. and leveraging our commercial expertise and strength in diabetes across our markets outside the U.S. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Sylia. David, thanks for your calls. Dave Ricks : Maybe just -- David, just to clarify that, because the way you framed your question, you said we're up against supply constraints. In the case of Major, as we said today in the prepared text, we don't anticipate supply constraints in the U.S. Of course, before introducing a product in a new market, we want to make sure we could fully initiate new patients and supply. And based on our competitors' actions, it's hard to predict a year from now what we'll need in a given market. So it's not that we don't have supply. It's more -- the demand picture is unstable. We want to -- we're just cautioning that we want to know that before we initiated a launch sequence. But we've launched in the U.S. and we're committed to that supply. It's not that we have an issue, just to be clear. Operator : The next call is Chris [ph] from Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Two questions. The first one, thank you for that information about the relative trend as far as where the source of patients were narrowing in on the question of what portion were actually switches from Trulicity that was helpful back of the envelope that sounded like about 10%. Is that about what you expected? And where do you think that this will go? I'm asking, obviously, since we're relatively early stages of this launch. Second question would be about Verzenio, actually to bring up something that seems a little bit less focused upon but performance has been strong and logically would seem to be in the adjuvant setting. But could you speak to what you believe is driving this and what the outlook is for those trends that have thus far been delivering the strong performance there? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Chris. We\u2019ll go to Mike for the question of Maguro and then Jake for the question on Verzenio. Mike Mason : Yes, it's a good question. I think we're getting what we expected we thought we would see more new patients into the class. That's who we talk about with healthcare professionals and that's what we're getting. So we're not surprised by that, pretty typical what we'd expect with the new GLP launch. Now what you would expect when you have a new product like Monger especially with endocrinologists that they don't always see naive patients. They have a good bolus of patients who are already on GLPs. And so when they -- when we talked to them about Montero, they're excited about the opportunity to actually switch some of the patients who are not performing or not at goal at the current GLP. And so I think early on, you'll see like a higher percent coming from switches versus naive. And so today, we have 72% that is naive. If you look at at Trulicity, that's in like 88%. So what I would expect is that, that percentage coming from AE will grow over time. But I think this is what we would expect at launch and we're very pleased by both Trulicity and Darryl's performance since Mangerahas launched. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Jay. Yes, thanks for the question on Verzenio. We too are pleased with how this has gone so far this year. I think to your question on why and where it goes from here. On the why, I think it largely comes down to the clinical data from the MONARCHY study itself. I think the data are demonstrable and when physicians and patients see them, they quickly want to integrate the drug into their practice. Now in addition to that and this is something we hoped would see happen, we think we're seeing some share gains in the metastatic setting as well, particularly among physicians who historically used other CDK4/6 inhibitors are gaining experience with Verzenio by utilizing it in the adjuvant setting and then starting to use it in the metastatic setting where perhaps they hadn't been before. So that was part of what we hoped might happen. I think we're seeing that happen a little bit so far this year. That having been said, in terms of where we go from here, I'll just say 2 things. One, we continue to interact with physicians who are still not yet aware of the MONARCHY data. And so that's, of course, good and bad. It's bad because there are patients who are appropriate for the medicine that should be on it. It's -- but it is opportunity to continue growing in the labeled indication that we have currently -- and on that note, as we've talked about in the past, we're hopeful that we have the opportunity to expand the indication to the enrolled trial population for MONARCH and we're awaiting that analysis of overall survival, as we talked about in the past. So yes, we're pleased with how it's going. We see plenty of opportunity ahead to continue the momentum. Kevin Hern : Chris, thanks for your questions. Operator : Next call is Carna Gold from Barclays. Dave Ricks : I guess, first off, can you talk about how pronounced the cash pay component was of the early kind of Majoro number? And then how you expect maybe that to evolve? And then separately, maybe coming back to the drug pricing question but from a different angle, it would appear that Lilly could be one of the main beneficiaries from lower out-of-pocket costs on that side and you think about sort of improvement in compliance. So can you maybe help frame that impact or maybe think about how compliance today differs in the U.S. versus maybe other markets where those out-of-pocket costs or not it can don\u2019t exist? Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Carter. Mike, for the first question. I'm on Dave [ph] for the follow-up on the drug pricing reform and the impact. Mike Mason : Carter, thanks for the question. On the cash pay side, we expect the percent of cash paid to follow our percent access in the marketplace. What we've seen so far, again, I reiterate what I said earlier, that we have both Part D and commercial access for Humana, Express Scripts on the National Preferred Formulary and Cigna. If you add that up, that's a little over 20% of the national lives. And so I think that's probably the best estimation of what you probably see with the cash pay. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Mike. Dave \u2026 Dave Ricks : Yes. Carter, I think you're pointing out something as I mentioned, we would be supportive as a freestanding measure of the Part D reforms that are in this reconciliation package for a bunch of reasons. One, it does, I think, more fairly distribute the burden of the industry pay for into Part D. Today, the way the donut hole math works, if you go back a couple of years, we had a lot of earnings calls, we had to describe that. There's this really disproportionate contribution from the industry inside the donut hole. So commonly used medications like in diabetes and cardiovascular, have a pretty big hit on that. That gets smoothed out. So now that drugs that hit the catastrophic pay more and it's more of a balanced contribution independent of drug type, that's a good thing for companies like Lilly, that have more commonly used drugs. The other thing though you're pointing out and I think this really would affect a product like Verzenio for us primarily is patients who get thrown into the catastrophic have this uncapped 5% contribution today. And we know that not only do patients discontinue and you mentioned about compliance rates which are better in oral oncology in Europe than the U.S., for instance. But I think also you'll see more initiation because physicians and their families screen themselves out of even qualifying for an appropriate medication for themselves because of financial burden and maybe go to chemotherapy instead of a more targeted therapy. So that presents another way in which we can both improve healthcare in America but also prospects for medicines at Lilly max. So those are good things. As I said, on balance, we still don't like it for the negotiation side but those are positive elements. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Dave. Operator : The next call is Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry Holford : To please. Firstly, on price, you\u2019ve clearly cited low realized prices for a number of drugs this quarter, particularly in the U.S. And I\u2019m wondering if you can speak specifically to how that\u2019s evolving in the GLP-1 market. Any particular step-up on Trulicity rebates since the Manzaro launch. What are your expectations here going forward? Is it a trend is higher rebates and negative channel mix noted by your competitor on the eosyesterday. So interested to get in the meal perspective here? And then a quick question for Anat. When do you anticipate having greater clarity on the possible repeal in the 2017 tax\u2026 Kevin Hern : Great. Thanks, Gary. We'll go to Mike for the question on anchored and market price trends and then not for the question on tax reform... Kerry Holford : Mike? Mike Mason : Yes. That's a good question. I think naturally, payers will ask for additional rebates when a new product joins a formulary. So as part of our discussion of being disciplined and why you don't want to accelerate those discussions too rapidly and that's a factor into it. So I think net-net, I don't expect any step changes in GLP pricing as a result of Montero launching but it is part of the national pressure intention and contract negotiations. Kerry Holford : Thanks, Mike. Anat? Anat Ashkenazi : So on taxes, what we are seeing is we're seeing broad bipartisan support for appealing that change of capitalizing R&D expenses. -- was evident in the recent Senate letter. This could come. We believe it will come through by the end of this year, most likely if I had to guess, I would say, towards the end of the year, potentially as part of a tech tender. Kerry Holford : Thanks, Anat. Operator : The next call is Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Dave Ricks : Maybe one question on the SELECT-EARLY study, the diabetic study. So maybe one for you, Dan. What you really need to show how long the trial and what you need to show in terms of delta versus control to be -- to prove that it is beneficial in prediabetic patients. And wouldn't oral JLP a better drug for those patients Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mo. So Dan, the question on SURPASS early, the prediabetes study and then whether oral GLP would be better there. Dave Ricks : Yes. That's an early diabetes study. But I think you're -- I don't believe we've disclosed the design of the endpoints yet. But I think with respect to diabetes prevention, that's certainly a very interesting area. And there are currently FDA guidance on what's required to show diabetes prevention of diabetes to get that kind of claim. It's a very high bar. And I suspect the field will come to an understanding about which drugs can actually decrease the risk of getting diabetes you can prevent diabetes before any drug is able to get that indication. I think this class of medications, particularly tirzepatide has great promise in that area. We highlighted the data from Sumant that showed the vast majority, more than 95% of people were prediabetic at the beginning of the study had normal glucose levels at the end of the study. That's really promising. -- longer-term data, including drug washout data required to get to that kind of claim. Mike Mason : Yes, I can add a few comments on that. This study is for people with diabetes have been diagnosed with diabetes. And we want to test what the impact could be on the progression of diabetes if you put a product like tirzepatide on very early in the course of treatment. And so this will study putting \u2013 starting patients who are na\u00efve or very early in their treatment versus standard of care. We think weight loss with the benefits of a GLP and GIP and the improvement in beta cell function and insulin sensitivity could have a profound impact of disrupting type 2 diabetes. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re testing in the study. It\u2019s one that we\u2019re very excited about. And we\u2019ve already started to see weekly injectables being used earlier than just the injection space as more people understand that a weekly injection through an auto injector is a good experience and actually some some consumers prefer orals but some actually consume prefer a weekly injection with an auto injector like Monaro and Trulicity has. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next caller is Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Dave Ricks : So as part of the FDA acceptance of your accelerated approval filing for donanemab, have you gotten clarity from the agency if the iADRS scale is acceptable as an acceptable endpoint for full approval? And can you also talk about what you saw with the N3 PG4 to move it into Phase III? Kevin Hern : Thanks, Evan. We\u2019ll go to Dan for those. Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks for the 2 Alzheimer's questions. So first one is on the accelerated approval application for genenimab and whether that's an opportunity to gain more insight about acceptability of iADRS which is our primary endpoint in the Phase III study. It may not be an opportunity actually because the accelerated approval is not contingent on an understanding of the cognitive or functional benefits of denetumab which we saw in the Phase II trial. Instead, the accelerated approval is just simply contingent on a demonstration of lowering amyloid levels. So I'm not sure we'll get into a deep discussion of that, although clearly, it's relevant in terms of the confirmatory study, Trailblazer 2. The second question that you raised was with respect to remternatug, the NTBG4molecule. This is a next-generation antiplaqueor plaque-removing antibody designed to attack the same power glutamate residue that donanemab goes after. We\u2019ve seen robust ability of this molecule to clear plaques in patients. Remember that a liability or potential liability of genitimab is antidrug antibodies. And so we\u2019ve also noted that this molecule doesn\u2019t have that issue. So given the potent robust clearance of plaques combined with lack of ADAs, we think this is amenable to alternative dosage forms that could be more convenient to patients. So we\u2019ll be looking at that. Kevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Operator : The next caller is Robin Kinesis with Tuas Securities. Operator : The next caller is Colin Bristow with UBS. Dave Ricks : And Kevin, thanks for all the great work. On business development, we had 2 deals announced today. Can you just give us your updated thoughts on BD areas of interest, deal size? And then just what your -- what's the view that you're getting from potential targets on their willingness to transact given the market backdrop? And then secondly, just on donanemab, what's your latest thinking? Or have you had any interactions with CMS with regards to how a single successful Phase III trial would be viewed in the context of reimbursement? Kevin Hern : Thank you. I'll invite not to weigh in on the BD question and then Anne for the donanemab question. Colin Bristow : So on the business development side and in terms of areas of interest and what we're seeing in the marketplace, given some recent changes in valuation, our areas of interest remain really unchanged from what we've had the last several quarters which is our core therapeutic areas. So looking at potential breakthrough innovations in those areas in different stages of preclinical and clinical development as well as in areas of new modalities where we talked about expansions that we have in those areas. We do look at and what you've seen us do in the last 12, 18 months is more earlier stage opportunities where we can bring things into our pipeline to supplement our existing portfolio and add value as well as innovation in our core areas. Valuations will have changed in the last 6 months or so has not historically been the rate-limiting factor in terms of pursuing business develop opportunities. It's really finding those breakthrough opportunities where we make those investments. And you asked about kind of target engagement and whether or not those views have changed, we're looking at whether we look at a partnership or acquisition, everyone wants to get to value if the opportunity is there, then we tend to be able to get to a good spot. Kevin Hern : Thanks for the question on donanemab. So it's our belief that the data package for donanemab which includes, obviously, both Trailblazzer all and all I should be sufficient to meet with CMS as described as that high level of evidence in CD. So the Trailblazer all study obviously was the first disease-modifying Alzheimer's trial to successfully meet its primary endpoint. And if Charles all 2 also delivers that direct evidence of clinical benefit as we expect it would, then we'll engage with CMS to discuss that path quickly and broadly expand access to the treatment. And we have been engaging with CMS throughout the process and we'll continue to do so moving forward. And they've shown openness to continue to meet. Obviously, they noted in the NCD, the promise of donanemab and they've shown a great deal of interest in understanding the Trailblazer 2 Phase III program. And so I think we'll have more clarity on the timing of reconsideration. We're able to share that data with them in mid- they've stated publicly they're committed to rapid reconsideration that I think we'll have to update you on timing once they have that data in hand, mine next year and we discuss next steps with them. Colin, thanks for your questions. We've exhausted the queue. Dave, for the close. Dave Ricks : Okay, great. Thanks for joining us today. And I just want to apologize for all the technical challenges on the call, we'll get that cleaned up. We do appreciate you participating today and your interest in our company. And please follow up with our IR team, including Joe Fletcher, our new leader. And if you have questions we have not addressed today on the call. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service.",

And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Lois, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo@Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.  During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Ricks : Well, thanks, Joe. Over the last three months, we continued to successfully execute our strategy. On the commercial front, we drove strong volume-based growth of our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro, which has seen an impressive initial uptick. At the same time, we advanced our late-phase pipeline progressing towards potential launches of 4 new medicines by the end of next year while also investing in our early-stage pipeline and new modalities like gene therapy. To meet the growing demand for our products and prepare for future launches, we have also continued to invest in expansion of our manufacturing footprint.  I'd highlight 2 areas of high unmet need where Lilly is progressing new medicines to improve patient outcomes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. In obesity, we are pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, enabling us to potentially bring this promising medicine to patients even sooner. We're also initiating SURMOUNT MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity.  In Alzheimer's disease, our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2study for dunenumab continues to progress towards a top line readout in mid-2023. And we continue to work with the FDA to pursue an accelerated approval based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data. We also announced completion of our submission for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis in both the U.S. and the EU. With already completed submissions for donanemab, pertibrutinib, mirikizumab. We are excited by the potential to launch 4 new medicines between now and the end of 2023. We are experiencing an unprecedented rate of new product launches for Lilly and undoubtedly 1 of the most impressive rates in our industry.  Turning to our strategic deliverables on Slide 4. Q3 revenue grew 7% in constant currency. Worldwide volume grew a robust 14%. Key product growth grew 19% and now account for 70% of our core business revenue, a reflection of the youth and durability of our marketed product portfolio. We're encouraged to see the continued global adoption of products like Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and our anchor [indiscernible] medicines, including Mounjaro and Trulicity.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3, which is in line with the same period last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributed to acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges. For pipeline milestones, we shared several important updates since our Q2 earnings call, including FDA Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, with completion of a rolling submission expected by mid-2023; EU and Japan approval for Mounjaro for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; U.S. and EU submission of lebrikizumab for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis; and FDA accelerated approval for Retevmo in RET fusion-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors regardless of tumor type and traditional approval in adults with locally advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer.  Dan will discuss this in more detail later but we are excited to have announced the acquisition of Akros, which aims to accelerate efforts in gene therapies that promise to restore, improve and preserve hearing for patients living with disabling hearing loss. This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to advancing genetic medicine at Lilly. And finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including several important personnel, COVID-19 antibody and ESG updates. We announced the upcoming retirement of Steve Fry, our Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Diversity, following more than 35 years at our company. I'd like to thank Steve for playing a key role in advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion agenda and leading our efforts to be the premier employer in our region and our sector.  We also welcome Eric Dozier, who will succeed Steve. Eric has nearly 25 years of experience at Lilly and a strong track record of developing people and teams that deliver impressive business results. I'm confident he is the right leader to progress our people strategy, which is vital for Lilly to achieve our ambitious growth objectives ahead.  In August, we began to make our COVID-19 antibody beptilizumab available for purchase to states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor. In Q3, we shipped an additional 600,000 -- or 60,000, I should say, doses of beptilizumab to the U.S. government for approximately $110 million. These are to be used for the financially vulnerable patients through a product replacement program. At this time, we are not anticipating any further U.S. government orders for beptilizumab.  With regards to our ESG efforts, we published our inaugural sustainability bond allocation and impact report, highlighting the allocation of approximately EUR 128 million across a range of sustainability projects since the issuance of the sustainability bond in September of '21. For more information about this and the many other aspects of our ESG program, you can visit our Lilly ESG website.  Now I'll turn the call over to Anat for a more detailed review of our Q3 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q3, let me highlight a change in how we expect to communicate our acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. In mid-October, we filed an 8-K with the SEC to provide investors earlier clarity on the impact from acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges for Q3. In future quarters, we generally expect to provide this information for quarterly updates on our Investor Relations website.  Now moving to our results. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2022 and I'll focus my overall comments on non-GAAP performance. A few notable items affected year-over-year comparisons in Q3. Foreign exchange rates had a roughly 430 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as Q3 revenue grew by 2% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We recognized $86 million of revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan; we experienced the first full quarter impact of Alimta's U.S. Fed expiry; and the increase in sales of COVID-19 antibodies and the decrease in sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 impacted our results. When excluding revenue from Alimta, which is now off patent across the EU, Japan and the U.S., COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew 9% for the quarter or 14% in constant currency, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year, the impact of lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs were offset by favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.  Total operating expenses increased 1% this quarter. Growth in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses were largely offset by lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges that reduced operating expense growth by nearly 350 basis points. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by the increased cost associated with the launch of Mounjaro, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 6%, driven by higher development expense for late-stage assets, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies.  Operating income increased 6% in Q3, primarily due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributable to the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges.  Our Q3 effective tax rate was 10.7%, a decrease of 360 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by the favorable tax impact related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased approximately 12% this quarter to $1.98 per share. Acquired IPR&D and development milestone charge and a negative impact of $0.06 in Q3 2022 compared to $0.17 in the same period last year.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange movements primarily related to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, decreased revenue by 4%. Moving to our performance by key geography. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% driven by volume growth of 15%. Excluding revenue from Alimta, COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue in the U.S. increased 20% driven primarily by key growth products. U.S. volume growth was partially offset by a net price decline of 4%, driven primarily by lower realized prices for Humalog due to segment mix and the list price reduction for insulin Lispro injection.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, Verzenio and Taltz. We are encouraged by the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth as the impact from the patent expiry for Alimta, which lost exclusively in June 2021, received from base period comparison. For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased by 2% in constant currency. The growth of our newer medicine and revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan was more than offset by the continued impact of declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta, which both face generic entry in June 2021. We expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023 as we continue to scale our key growth products and the impact of patent expiration subsides.  In China, revenue declined 10% in constant currency as we continue to be impacted by the Zero COVID policy measures. We're also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures for Tyvyt from local competitors with NR DLXs. In addition, we experienced the first full quarter of the pricing impact of volume-based procurement for Humalog. As we expect to maintain a high level of access for our innovative portfolio, we believe our volume should accelerate to drive net growth in the future.  Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 6% in constant currency in Q3, primarily driven by customer buying patterns. The year-to-date growth of 8% in constant currency in this region is more representative underlying trends.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust waterwide volume growth. These products drove approximately 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our current performance and future outlook.  Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of a key growth product. This quarter, these brands grew 19% or 25% in constant currency, generated $4.6 billion in sales and made up 70% of our core business revenue. Products like Verzenio, Taltz in dermatology and Jardiance have outpaced competitors growth and are leaders in new-to-brand share of market within their respective classes.  In the injectable incretin market, we continue to see significant opportunity for further class growth. In addition to Mounjaro successful launch in the U.S., Trulicity has continued to experience strong growth globally. To date, our incretin manufacturing production is ahead of our internal plan, and we remain focused on sustaining this performance.  Strong demand for Trulicity, partially due to ongoing limited availability of competitive GLP-1, continues to challenge our ability to meet expanding demand in most international markets. In those situations, we're working hard to supply market demand will minimize an impact to existing patients, including communication in these markets not to initiate new patients on Trulicity. In the U.S., script volume remains robust. And while we build more capacity, wholesalers may experience intermittent restocking delays of Trulicity orders.  Moving to Slide 11. We're pleased with the rapid uptake of Mounjaro in the first 4 months since launch. Approximately 70% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts are patients naive to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class and less than 10% for switches from Trulicity. We are progressing peer negotiations and have more than doubled the level of access to approximately 45% of total commercial and Part D lives. And as we expand access, the proportion of paid script should start to increase.  Our focus is to make Mounjaro available for type 2 diabetes patients, and we intend to take actions designed to ensure access and supply for these patients. These actions may negatively impact prescription volume, but are not expected to impact net revenue. We have seen unprecedented demand for Mounjaro's type 2 diabetes launch in the U.S., bolstered by strong efficacy and a positive customer experience. Availability of competitor's incretin also is a key factor as we assess Mounjaro's demand and supply. To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretin business, we have plans to add substantial additional manufacturing capacity. In 2023, we expect the RTP site in North Carolina to become fully operational and that capacity, coupled with additional actions and extensions in other sites, will result in doubling Lilly's incretin manufacturing capacity at the end of 2023.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $6.8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in dividend and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities are to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, bolster manufacturing capacity, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.  Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook now includes an additional $300 million of headwinds from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $1 billion of foreign exchange headwinds of revenue for the full year compared to our original guidance. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged.  Our guidance now includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $670 million, reflecting total charges in the first 9 months of the year. We have not recognized material acquired IPR&D or development milestone charges to date in Q4. And this guidance does not include any impact from the potential acquisition -- for business development or acquisition in the remainder of the year, including pending acquisition of [indiscernible]. Our non-GAAP operating margins remain unchanged at approximately 29%.  On a reported basis, operating margin is now expected to be approximately 26%, driven by the intangible asset impairment for our GBA1 Gene Therapy due to change in estimated launch timing. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expensed in the range of $600 million to $700 million, reflecting the net impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during Q3 2022.  Our tax rate and EPS in the first 9 months of the year includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year continues to assume this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for the full year 2022.  Assuming this deferral repeal occurs before the end of the year, we expect our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which includes the cumulative tax impact of immediately expensing research and development costs for the full year 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repeal effective this year, then we would expect our reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.46 to now be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65 per share and lowered our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.85. The $0.20 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates as well as the $0.06 impact from the incremental acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges in Q3.  Now before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as you begin to think about next year. Starting with revenue, we're confident in the growth outlook of our core business. We expect to build on the positive momentum across our pre-growth products, including the continued strong launch of Mounjaro and launches of new products. While we anticipate that initial revenue from our next wave of potential launches will be modest in 2023 with only partial year revenue, we do expect the donanemab, pitubrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab will serve as additional catalysts for continued growth.  In 2023, we will see the full year impact of the Alimta's patent expiry in the U.S., where new generics have eroded Alimta sales starting mid-Q2 and we anticipate a low single-digit headwind from foreign exchange rates. As for revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, we will continue to make bebtelovimab available for purchase. However, the demand for these therapies will depend not only on COVID-19 case counts but also on evolving variants and available therapies. We continue to believe that COVID-19 antibodies will not be a major driver for long-term growth for Lilly. We will invest in our future as we advance promising R&D opportunities, expand our manufacturing capacity and support the potential launch of multiple new products. Assuming inflation persist, we expect to see that impact in 2023 as well. Also, we will be making a significant investment in one of our most important assets, our talented workforce, through increases in compensation that are partially due to inflation pressures, but also to ensure we have the right capabilities to deliver on the promise of our future growth.  While these investments will slow our operating margin expansion in 2023, they are critical to maximizing pipeline and new launch opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid- to long term. We look forward to sharing more details on our 2023 guidance call on December 13. Now I'll turn over the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. 2022 has been another outstanding year for R&D at Lilly. In addition to Mounjaro approval, we have now completed regulatory submissions for 4 new medicines that could all launch by the end of 2023 : portibrutinib, mirikizumab, lebrikizumab, and denetimab. In addition, we advanced our early-stage pipeline with promising next-generation assets in all of our key areas. Plus we've continued to improve our capabilities and advance our projects in our growing nucleic acid medicine portfolio.  Before I share an R&D update for our core business, let me briefly add to Anat's update on COVID-19 antibodies. While we've made bebtelovimab commercially available, we're also closely watching the emergence of new highly mutated strains. Based on pseudovirus data, we do not believe that bebtelovimab will neutralize against the new BQ variants. However, we do have potentially broadly neutralizing antibodies in our labs that we can consider bringing forward if there is a need and an aligned path forward with health authorities. Moving to our core R&D portfolio. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28, and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover important developments since our last earnings call by therapeutic area.  Starting with diabetes and obesity. We have several updates for tirzepatide. For type 2 diabetes, in addition to the U.S. approval of Mounjaro in Q2, we're pleased to announce recent approvals in the EU and Japan. For chronic weight management, we're pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions that have the potential to fill an unmet medical need.  We plan to initiate a rolling submission this year that will be primarily based on the results from the SURMOUNT-1 trial, which is complete; and SURMOUNT-2, which is expected to be complete by the end of April 2023. Assuming positive SURMOUNT-2 results, we expect to complete the rolling submission with these data in mid-2023 for potential regulatory action as early as late next year. We're working hard to bring tirzepatide to adults living with obesity as soon as we can.  We also presented the trial design of tirzepatide SURMOUNT-MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality in obesity study. SURMOUNT-MMO evaluates treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo in adults living with obesity without diabetes and measures the effects of tirzepatide on a broad set of outcomes beyond traditional cardiovascular events. As our primary endpoint, we are measuring the occurrence of a cardiovascular event from a 5-point CV composite that includes all-cause mortality. We've also incorporated key secondary endpoints, including traditional MACE 3 events, reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and adverse renal outcomes.  In SURMOUNT-MMO, we are studying both primary and secondary prevention of events in a broader at-risk population more representative of that seen in clinical practice. The SURMOUNT-MMO study has now initiated, and we look forward to sharing the results in the future. SURMOUNT-MMO is just the latest addition to tirzepatide's development plan. where our goal is to not only demonstrate chronic weight management but also to demonstrate improvement across multiple outcomes as a result of weight loss. We're extremely confident in tirzepatide's potential to impact health outcomes of patients living with type 2 diabetes, obesity and other obesity-related metabolic outcomes.  Transitioning to the rest of our diabetes portfolio, we started 2 more Phase III studies for our weekly basal insulin FC and expect to start the fifth and final registration study in the Quint program in the coming months. We also received FDA approval for the Tempo Smart Button and medical device and key component of Lilly's forthcoming Tempo personalized diabetes management platform. We're excited to begin to introduce this platform to the marketplace this year.  Moving to oncology. In line with expectations previously communicated, we've now performed another interim analysis for MONARCH-E, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. The results of this analysis will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium next month.  We're excited by what we've seen and we look forward to sharing the data publicly. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved in the adjuvant setting, and we are enthusiastic about Verzenio's ability to substantially reduce the risk of developing incurable life-threatening metastatic disease.  We also announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Retevmo for pretreated adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion regardless of tumor type. And also granted traditional approval for Retevmo in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a RET gene fusion as detected by an FDA-approved test. We're grateful to have the opportunity to deliver meaningful clinical benefits to more patients across more tumor types with Retevmo.  We also began dosing patients in our fifth Phase III study for pirtobrutinib. This latest trial is a head-to-head study evaluating pirtobrutinib against ibrutinib in BTK inhibitor-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As a reminder, pirtobrutinib is currently under priority review at the FDA and for mantle cell lymphoma previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with regulatory action expected in early 2023. We also continue to have discussions with the FDA about potentially accelerating the approval pathway for CLL in patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor.  Switching to immunology. We presented detailed week 52 results from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy studies in patients with moderate to spare atopic dermatitis at 2 recent dermatology conferences. The maintenance data showed that lebrikizumab provided robust and durable skin clearance with improvements in itch, sleep and quality of life amongst patients who achieved a clinical response in the 16-week induction period.  Notably, the results also suggested that less frequent dosing of lebrikizumab can provide similar improvements to once every 2-week dosing. Based upon the data we've collected across our trials in over 2,000 patients, we believe lebrikizumab could become a first-line biologic for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a disease where there's significant need to provide new options for a large and diverse patient population.  As part of our efforts to reach a diverse patient population, we've recently initiated an innovative clinical trial to evaluate lebrikizumab for people with skin of color who have a disproportionately higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis and often struggle with more severe forms of the disease. We have now submitted a BLA to the FDA. And Almirall, who holds rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for dermatologic indications in Europe, has submitted to the EMA for authorization. We expect regulatory decisions in both the U.S. and the EU by the end of next year. Together with Almirall, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease.  Shifting to our efforts in genetic medicines. You'll see that we have now advanced our ANGPTL3 siRNA to Phase II development in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is our first siRNA asset to advance to Phase II. And with this molecule, alongside our Lp(a) siRNA, where we shared proof-of-concept data last year, we're optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes using our portfolio of genetic medicines.  Within gene therapy, we're excited about the opportunity to help patients with fatal neurodegenerative diseases, where we're advancing our Prevail Therapeutics programs. We particularly look forward to sharing biomarker results from our progranulin gene therapy program at an upcoming scientific meeting for frontal temporal dementia.  Building on our gene therapy experience with Prevail, we're thrilled to welcome Akouos and their talented team who will bring a transformational gene therapy approach to treating genetically defined hearing loss. Hearing loss is an area of severe unmet need that historically has not been a focus of pharmacologic development. And we believe treatment of sensory neuronal hearing loss through gene therapy delivered to the inner ear is an area ripe for technologic advances for the benefit of patients.  Finally, let me turn to Alzheimer's disease, where there have been a number of important developments since our last call. As a company dedicated to the fight against Alzheimer's, we were pleased to see the positive top line Phase III results for lecanemab. Following dunetimab's TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, this lecanumab study may further support the benefit of removing amyloid plaques for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  These data certainly reinforce our confidence in donanemab and the forthcoming readout from our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, which is expected by the middle of 2023, and which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. In the meantime, we continue working with the FDA to seek accelerated approval in early '23 and based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data.  The availability of and access to safe and effective therapies is important to slow the devastating impact on the estimated 6.5 million Americans and 35 million people worldwide living with this disease and their loved ones. While we acknowledge the hard work ahead to bring these therapies to patients in need, we are excited and we are confident in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio and the potential impact our drugs can have on patients.  Accordingly, we initiated TRAILRUNNER-ALZ, the first trial in our Phase III program for Remternetug, our next-generation anti-amyloid antibody. Remternetug has demonstrated deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance and provides the opportunity to explore flexible dosing regimens for patients. Finally, in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head trial comparing donanemab to aducanumab on amyloid plaque lowering in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have now achieved positive results on the co-primary endpoints of amyloid lowering as expected with a consistent safety profile to previous donanemab studies. For this study, the incidence of ARIA-E in the donanemab group was 21.1%, with 2.8% of donanemab-treated patients showing symptomatic ARIA-E, suggesting the potential that rates of plaque clearance are not directly linked to rates of ARIA development. We'll share the detailed results at the upcoming CTAD meeting in late November, including the relationship between the degree of amyloid plaque removal and plasma phospo tau, as well as radiographic area.  While we focus most of our markets today on late-stage assets, you also notice we have a number of developments across our early-stage portfolio as shown on the slides. Across the pipeline, Q3 was another productive quarter at Lilly. Now I turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. David Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the third quarter. We continue to grow our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro's strong U.S. launch. At the same time, we continue to advance our pipeline, progressing towards potential launches for 4 new medicines by the end of next year, while also internally and externally investing in our early-stage pipeline and discovery capabilities. With the progress we've made, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects.  Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask you please limit your questions to 2 per caller. Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : I just had two here on Mounjaro. I guess the first is just on gross to net trends we should be thinking about from here. I think you're talking at this point about 45% access. Can you talk about just where that will be trending as we look out into maybe early 2023 and when do you think you'll be at a point where the drug will have similar access to what we see with Trulicity currently?  And then my second question in Mounjaro was on manufacturing capacity given what's been really an exceptional launch so far. It sounds like you're in a position to double capacity by end of '23. I guess the kind of bigger picture question I'm asking is, do you see any capacity issues that could limit uptake at all of Mounjaro as we look between now and when that additional facility comes online? David Ricks : Thanks, Chris. I think maybe I'll go to Mike for both the first question on gross to net trends and access and for some commentary on manufacturing capacity. Mike? Michael Mason : Okay. Thanks, Chris, for the questions. I appreciate that. As we guided before launch, we recommended that you look at more revenue. It was a better indicator of our performance than net revenue. We took 2 decisions that were really focused on looking at generating long-term value for Mounjaro. First, we decided to put in place a bridging program that would bridge people who have type 2 diabetes with a low out-of-pocket cost of $25 until they achieved formulary access on their insurance. We were confident that we were going to build, and we still are confident that we're going to build good broad access for Mounjaro.  But we wanted to make sure that we had a bridging program in that then allowed us to be disciplined and patient as we gained access. We wanted to make sure that we look for the long term, not the short term. If you're too short term-focused, then you're going to be driven to gain access quickly and not make the right pricing decisions. So we thought the bridging program tied with the disciplined negotiation approach was the best approach. And that's the one we've taken and that's the 1 we've held true to during our launch.  So what we'll see is net price will increase as we gain payer access. In the third quarter, we had 22% of people with commercial and Part D insurance had formerly access Mounjaro. As of October 1, that jumped to 45%. And what we anticipate is we'll still take a disciplined moderated approach to make sure we get the best access for the right price point. And we're still very confident that we will grow and we'll achieve broad access in the upcoming future.  We are also adjusting our bridging program to further ensure that it's utilized for people with type 2 diabetes, which will impact new start volume but should impact net revenue. So we expect over the upcoming quarters that net price will grow for Mounjaro. As it comes to supply, our supply chain has performed exceptionally well since launch. We're taking actions to maximize production supply for our current facilities while we ramp up our new manufacturing facilities that you referenced.  The U.S. Mounjaro launch is really unprecedented with a viral nature given just tremendous patient satisfaction and the visible results that people experience that really spark many conversations with them, the type 2 diabetes community, which then brings greater interest in the type 2 diabetes committee, our community for Mounjaro. But it is a dynamic situation, given the uncertainty of competitor GLP supply and that Mounjaro patient prescription abandonment long-term adherence and dose titration rates have it yet with steady-state, which are all important forecasting assumptions. So given the dynamic nature of this, it's reasonable to assume that weekly production forecast won't perfectly aligned with weekly demand each week. So this will produce some intermittent delays in meeting wholesale orders for some dosing strengths as we ramp up our supply chain. If this happens, our teams will work hard to avoid or minimize any short-term impact for people that with type 2 diabetes. But stepping back and taking a look at the longer-term picture, we're in a great position.  Mounjaro's launch is going extremely well because patient experiences have been tremendous, and they have a high interest in the product profile. We expect Mounjaro's launch has fueled significant increment market growth which I think just gives us more confidence in the future. And we had the foresight to initiate significant manufacturing capacity expansion before Mounjaro launch because we saw the potential of the product. So we're in a very good long-term position with Mounjaro. Operator : The next question is from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Maybe two follow-ups for me. So just on the manufacturing side. I mean, is that kind of supply challenges you're going to run into kind of expected through the first half of the year? I'm just wondering if there's any way you can bring North Carolina on board any sooner. I know you've got it to year-end, but just maybe help us think about anything you can do to kind of bring that online sooner. And then the bridging program, Mike, you mentioned you made some changes there. So the percentage of patients not with type 2 diabetes will may be different on the forward. Can you tell us what that represents currently and how we should think about that change to volume on the forward? David Ricks : Thanks, Terence. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes, all manufacturing supply, I'll reinforce that our main manufacturing supply and teammates have delivered exceptional results, and they continue to look for every way to maximize our production supply. They have all hands on deck to get the Research Triangle Park facility online as soon as possible. And as soon as that facility is available, we'll make good use of that supply.  So we're confident in our ability for our manufacturing personnel and our leadership there. And as I said before, we're very confident in the long-term potential of tirzepatide. With the bridging program, I think your question was more around kind of off-label use of Mounjaro and how much it was.  As you know, Mounjaro was approved in the U.S. for patients with type 2 diabetes, and we have just excellent processes in place to ensure that all promotional activities are in line with our approved label. We're pleased with our disciplined on-label promotional execution. The launch of Mounjaro has been very disciplined and in line with everything that we wanted. So we've been encouraged by both patients and physicians prescribing experiences, and this has driven a very high interest in Mounjaro.  We haven't -- we don't have perfect data to suggest what diagnosis a patient has. The best data that we have is to look at the -- whether those individuals who are starting Mounjaro, whether they have previously been on a diabetes medication or not. Given that our promotion is focused solely on type 2 diabetes, we would expect to see the majority of people use Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, and that's what we've seen. While we see fluctuation from week to week in the third quarter, we saw about 2/3 of new patients starting Mounjaro with a history of type 2 diabetes medications. For the remaining 1/3 of patients who are classified as naive to treatment -- diabetes treatments, these individuals could either be newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients or individuals who haven't yet been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Operator : The next question is from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : Maybe a quick one -- a quick couple of questions on Mounjaro. A, if you could speak to the inventory contribution to the third quarter U.S. sales. And B, I was just trying to compare Mounjaro gross to net and the dollars per Rx early into the launch and compared versus how TRULICITY did early into the launch. And I think what stands out is the revenues per Rx were several higher for Trulicity. Perhaps if you could speak to any specific differences in the type and extent of patient support. You did early Trulicity launch versus what you're doing in Mounjaro.Clearly, the volumes have majorly, majorly surpass what Trulicity did early on. David Ricks : Thanks, Umer. So Mike, go back to you on both questions. First one on inventory contribution to Q2 sales, and then the second on the gross to net and how that would compare versus what we saw with Trulicity. Michael Mason : Okay. Good question. Inventory contributions to Q3 sales was 40%. But I also note that as soon as a product shifts our product, we accrue for rebates and discounts whether that product is used to supply patient demand in the pharmacy or whether that's used in the channel for inventory. As it comes to gross to net, the big change is, if you look at the Trulicity launch versus the Mounjaro launch is we did not have a bridging program at the launch of Trulicity like we do for Mounjaro. Operator : The next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Stephen Scala : Why does Lilly think FDA is requiring it to submit results from SURMOUNT-2 for the tirzepatide obesity filing when that study would not seem particularly relevant given that it is in diabetics does not select for obesity and is smaller than SURMOUNT-1? And given that the FDA request seems of tenuous value, could it be relaxed perhaps on an interim look at SURMOUNT-2? So that's the first question. Second, why did Lilly sell co-promotion rights to Mounjaro in Japan when it is, I believe, Lilly's second largest market. Lilly has a large footprint there, presumably Mounjaro is a critical long-term driver to Lilly and do so for only $86 million. Granted Lilly has done this before, such as selling rights to Cialis in China, but that was at one -- at a point when Cialis was in steep decline, whereas Mounjaro is your future? David Ricks : Thanks, Steve. So first for the question about the FDA and submission for tirzepatide for obesity, we'll go to Dan. And then your second question around the collaboration agreement in Japan, we'll go to Ilya. So Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question on SURMOUNT-2 here in FDA requirements. Maybe I'll just start off by relieving any worries that there's any specific concerns with the data or safety or anything like that. We don't see anything such as that driving FDA concerns. I think the FDA discussion around having 2 trials is just to be consistent with FDA guidance for adequate and well-controlled studies in chronic weight management that for that indication, having multiple studies in a population with obesity with primary endpoints defined as per the guidance on thresholds of weight loss is the requirement. And that's the requirement of being held to have 2 studies. David Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Ilya, do you want to take the question around the Japan tirzepatide? Ilya Yuffa : Yes, Steve, thank you for the question. You're right, japan is a critical market. Just to clarify, the $86 million that we recognized for revenue and payment from Mitsubishi Tanabe was for an upfront payment for collaboration which is consistent with partnerships we've had in Japan for a number of our growth brands. Like Trulicity, like Emgality, we've had success in having strategic partnerships with local Japanese companies to successfully commercialize our innovative treatments. We believe that this partnership will allow us to maximize the value of tirzepatide in Japan and Mitsubishi Tanabe does have significant scale and experience in diabetes. And together, we will collaborate. And just to clarify, we will preserve the economics on ongoing economics for the launch and sales of Mounjaro in Japan for [indiscernible]. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Thanks for the question. Mike, you mentioned a low switch rate to Mounjaro from Trulicity, but what was the driver of sequential trends for Trulicity? And maybe how do you see cannibalization playing out in the next few years? And then the second question for Dan, on tirzepatide and obesity, you guys added the MMO study, but there are a lot of other additional indications beyond what you guys have talked about where obesity plays a role like a few coronary syndromes or other broad cardio indications come to mind. So how do you guys plan on prioritizing the clinical investments from here for tirzepatide, like what's the math that goes into that? David Ricks : Thanks, Geoff. So Mike, we'll go to you for the question around sequential trends and what we expect -- might expect in terms of ongoing switch rates, and then Dan, we'll go to you for prioritization of tirzepatide development plans. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes. What you typically see is actually the switching for a new product into our incretin class is typically the switch rates people switching from another incretin to the launch incretin, those rates will actually go down over time. And so that's what I would anticipate. The real opportunity here is to grow the market and make sure that before being proactive to treat type 2 diabetes. David Ricks : Thanks, Mike. Okay, Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Geoff, thanks for the question on future indications for tirzepatide. There are many that we can consider. As you point out, weight loss and restoration of sort of normal metabolism, which we think may be possible with tirzepatide is going to have benefits in a lot of metabolic- and obesity-related diseases. So how do we pick which ones to pursue and when.  I think initially, our thinking has been around generating a body of data that shows that a drug such as tirzepatide when driving weight loss lead to downstream health benefits. So that's what drives the MMO study. We have a heart failure study, a sleep apnea study that are all ongoing. When we think about adding more, sort of where can we see improvements in that medical understanding of the dangers of obesity and the benefits of weight loss and restoration of normal metabolism.  That's how we think about it rather than how big is this patient segment or how big is the next patient segment, noting that almost all of those patient segments will already have obesity as an underlying disease, which we expect to have indicated next year, as I commented earlier. Finally, I think one more consideration here, Geoff, for us is we see fighting obesity as a long-term goal for loan company. And so there'll be multiple generations of drugs here, we hope. And we'll have lots of opportunities to contribute to our medical understanding of weight loss. Operator : The next question is from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : So maybe one question on Mounjaro growth in obesity. So when you talk about 100 million patient population, which are obese, not diabetic. I see you're talking about primary prevention. But if you look at the current trials, they are more of secondary prevention type of setting. So how -- the question is how important is getting a primary prevention trial done to get to the broadest patient population in obesity market are possible at this point? David Ricks : Thanks, Mohit, for the question. You were a little bit echoey there. I think we got the gist around the patient population for obesity and how to maximize that opportunity. Mike, do you want to take that? Michael Mason : Yes, I'm happy to answer that question. Actually, with obesity, it's actually kind of counter to what typically happens to the product. Typically, you get it out, it has a finite patient segmentation, you try to explain that with additional indications. Actually, with obesity, you're going to have the broadest indication for people who either have a BMI of 27 with a risk factor or a BMI over 30, which is a massive population in the U.S. and globally.  And so the additions of our trials aren't necessarily to expand the patient population, but is to demonstrate that proactively treating obesity will improve health outcomes in order to drive physicians to write and payers to give access for the product. Operator : Next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : So a couple of quick ones. So with regard to the North Carolina facility, expanding manufacturing capacity, in terms of API versus the actual pens and fill-finish manufacturing, can you just update us on what really is the potential expansion of manufacturing there? It's my understanding that the potential bottleneck is going to be more related to the pen manufacturing.  And it's my understanding also that this is largely the Trulicity pen and the Trulicity pen is going to be the main manufacturing point for pretty much all of your biologic capacity as well as for Trulicity. So just trying to get a better understanding of that. And then second, just on the insulin. There are a number of questions around the change to the penny rule and how Lilly and competitor, Novo, are going to manage through that as many of the insulins could actually be sort of paying the Medicaid fees for the benefit of actually providing insulins. So just trying to get a better understanding of how Lilly hopes to manage that outcome, in particular, it seems wildly unfair to the industry. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Seamus. So I think for the first question on the kind of North Carolina manufacture facility dynamics, I'll hand over to Dave. I mean, David, if you want to comment also on the insulin, I think he's referring to the MCAP dynamics. David Ricks : I can. And Mike, jump in if I get that wrong. So just to step back on capacity, we did make some comments today related to this. And we've taken actions in the quarter to slow demand internationally on Trulicity, primarily because of the constraints by a competitor, which have shifted demand to Trulicity internationally. Should that happen domestically, of course, that will -- I think we're just trying to give a fair balance to say that, that would be an increase in demand we'd have to manage too as well.  But we are producing above our plans right now. We see that continuing. And the next step-up, Seamus, that we expect in capacity will be North Carolina, which will happen towards the end of next year. Just for clarity, there's actually 2 sites in North Carolina. One we announced in 2020 and one more recently down the road in Concur near Charlotte. That second facility will also come online beginning in '24 with some capacity and really '25 more fully. So the company has taken some pretty aggressive investment steps, and those steps in North Carolina are focused on what we'll call the parental filling and the drug finishing process which is the device that is used for Trulicity, but also Mounjaro.  We take a platform approach. So that device is also used for other Lilly biologics. And gives us flexibility to match supply and demand more agilely. Although Mike's comments were well placed earlier that it's not perfect, like inside of 90 days, we can't perfectly match every skew of demand to every SKU produced. But it does give us a lot of agility. Those 2 sites in North Carolina, I'll point out, I think as Anat said, are huge.  So the first one will literally double our global capacity when it's online, and the second side is a similar size. So we've taken some big CapEx decisions, and it looks well placed given the early uptick in Mounjaro, which looks quite substantial. Those do not speak to the API side. API is a different supply chain. We've also taken actions to expand that capacity. It's currently not the bottleneck and is not expected to be the bottleneck, which is the peptide synthesis process we use. Of course, big caveat around all this is, of course, things can go wrong. Regulatory approvals are required to bring the new sites online in an on-time fashion, but that's our current outlook. And as Mike said, long term, we're extremely confident we can supply a massive volume of Trulicity and Mounjaro. But these step-ups do take a little bit of time. And should we have a lapse in competitor supply, that will challenge our ability to meet demand. I think that's the main message from today.  As it relates to MCAP, you're right, that beginning in January of '24, for the cap on payments or rebates to Medicaid programs for medications that have a CPI penalty that pushes them above 100% rebate will be lifted, and we will be required to pay states to use our product in that situation. We have not announced our plans to deal with that, although we're formulating plans to deal with that.  And of course, the best thing to do is keep inventing new things, which reset that calculation. And as you know, we've got a Phase III program for weekly insulin and we're progressing efforts on glucose-sensing insulin. We've got, I think, an exciting new approval on Connected Care as well. So all those efforts, I think, are the long-term approach tactically we'll manage through that event at the end of '23, early '24. Operator : Next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Two questions. One on the obesity opportunity for tirzepatide and the regulatory requirements there. SURMOUNT-3 and 4, I believe, are expected to complete also in the first half of next year. Should we be clear in terms of not anticipating that data from those studies are required or that you'll be planning to submit those to the FDA? And if you were to, would that have any potential implications on the time line for potential approval and processing?  Second, you highlighted some data on Verzenio that we're going to see at SABCS. Can you just maybe contextualize for us what you believe might be the potential impact in terms of the adjuvant metastatic split? And anything in terms of how that might influence the trajectory of Verzenio from a revenue standpoint once we see that data? David Ricks : Thanks, Chris. Okay. For the first question on tirzepatide obesity and the regulatory requirements around 3 and 4, we'll go to Dan, and then we'll go to Jake for the Verzenio San Antonio Breast Conference, maybe preview. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Chris, our understanding is that we'll submit based on SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2, as we said, and we don't anticipate needing SURMOUNT-3 and 4 for that submission. So no implications to time line from those study readouts. David Ricks : Jake, do you want to jump in on Verzenio? Jake Van Naarden : Yes, sure. So as Dan mentioned in the prepared remarks, we conducted a preplanned interim analysis of Monarch as we had talked about earlier in the year that we were going to do that. So of course, we looked at all of the endpoints, IDFS, DRFS and overall survival. We'll be presenting those at San Antonio. Really pleased with what we've seen across the study in both the ITT population cohort 1 as well as the currently labeled indication.  I think there's two components to think about here. One is, how do the data continue to evolve with increased follow-up? And the second is, how does the new analysis look as it relates to potentially expanding our labeled indication over time. And obviously, I want to be careful about reviewing the data themselves, but I think those are the 2 questions that you ought to think about as you see the data in December. Operator : Next question is from Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin Bristow : Congrats on the quarter. Two from my side, first on obesity. There's been quite a bit of discussion around Amgen's upcoming Phase III data. And so could you give us your thoughts on GIP agonism versus antagonism? And just on your development side, could you just remind us when we get updates on GGG and mascutide? And then on the Alzheimer's side, I'm just wondering on donanemab, was any part of your decision to pursue a discrete dosing strategy with regards to stopping when you achieve amyloid negativity? Was any part of that related to antidrug antibodies? I'm just thinking about this, given there's some data suggesting redosing or maintenance dosing may actually be beneficial. Joe Fletcher : We'll go to Dan on both questions. First one around obesity, Amgen's data and then the second one around Alzheimer's and discrete dosing related to antidrug antibodies. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Starting with how we think about obesity and in general as much as possible here, our strategy has been to mimic the body's own response to food. So incretins are hormone submitted by -- secreted rather by your gastrointestinal tract in response to eating then lead to satiety and increased calorie expenditure and decreased food intake. That's how they work and GID is one of the major incretins.  So it made sense to pursue a strategy of agonism of that hormone and probably we'll wait and see Amgen's data to understand if antagonism could also have a surprising effect different than the biological effect of acreages normally in humans. With respect to GGG and, I think BCG is our next-generation incretin that's further ahead in development. We've previously communicated that we expect to have internal Phase II data yet this year and use that data to make a decision whether this proceeds to Phase III or not. In which case, we might wait for mastatide data. That thinking is still consistent and on track for yet this year. The second line of question here was around donanemab discrete dosing strategy, and you're referring here to the notion that we pioneered that once plaques are clear, you can stop taking a plaque-clearing antibody. That was based on our understanding of the biology, nothing to do with antidrug antibodies.  But certainly, we see it as a benefit for patients to not have to continue to take a drug in the absence of having the target or the disease in their brain that's still ongoing. It's pretty specific idea to donanemab, Remternetug and antibodies that are specific to plaques because once the plaques are gone, they're something for the antibodies to do. Our own data that we've shared show that there is no reversion really of adverse biomarkers in patients who've come off therapy. So so far, the data that we have in hand, though it's still early, supports cessation of dosing as appropriate. We'll look to TRAILBLAZER-2 to confirm that hypothesis. Operator : The next question is from David Risinger from SVB Securities. David Risinger : I guess first, although there was 22% coverage in the U.S. in the third quarter, that didn't fully translate into net revenue. So could you provide some more color on why that was the case? Was it because formulary access at the national level may not immediately translate to paid Rx for certain downstream customers of payers because additional negotiations may be required, I thought that might be a factor and this will help us better understand how to think about the 45% coverage that you have as of October 1.  And then second, with respect to ex U.S. sales prospects, I'm not sure if you provided this yet, but could you talk about how we should think about sales to Mitsubishi in the fourth quarter sequentially? And how we should think about ex U.S. rollout plans in the context of the risk of demand outstripping manufacturing capacity. And one other, just a quick one, just to tie to the first question about the U.S. sales. There was a comment about 40% of the sales being from stocking, but it wasn't clear if that was a U.S. comment. So if you could just clarify that when you address the first question. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave, for the question. So for the first one, we'll go to Mike to discuss a bit about coverage. And I think maybe what you're getting at is around the co-pay card. And then for the second one, we'll go to Ilya to talk about OUS sales prospects and dynamics and timing. So Mike? Michael Mason : Okay. Thanks, David, for the question. Yes, the percent that was comp from channel was in a U.S. figure. On the -- when you look at our data and you look at percent covered scripts that were paid versus paid through the savings card, that rate in -- since launch has closely matched our access rates. So I would say that's the best indicator for kind of the percent that are paid versus going through the bridging program. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. Ilya, on OUS? Ilya Yuffa : Yes. Maybe first on Mitsubishi Tanabe and the dynamics of the upfront payment. Basically, the economics are the upfront payment and the future economics would be when we actually start commercializing and selling Mounjaro in Japan market. So that is a onetime upfront payment. And so that's how I would look at the economics for the future. In terms of overall commercialization of Mounjaro outside of the U.S., I think one of the aspects that's important for us to determine is ensuring that whenever we enter a market that we can ensure that we can appropriately supply Mounjaro to type 2 patients in any given market.  And we will evaluate that as well as build up our access. As you may know, for most markets outside the U.S., it takes time and there's typically a lag between approval and also gaining access to patients for reimbursement. And so we don't anticipate that being a significant delay in the full commercialization of Mounjaro outside the U.S., but of course, we will look and monitor and ensure that we have adequate supply when we enter a market. Operator : The next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : So first question I had for you is, how you see the market for all GLP-1s and injectables playing out over time? And then the second question I had for you is, do you think a positive outcome in Novo SELECT study will be enough to convince payers of the opportunity here? Or do you think they'll have to look for a broader study like your MMO? And I don't know if you said this before or not, but will you have an interim look in your SURMOUNT-MMO data? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Louise. Mike, let you kind of handle both. First one is around what we see for the market for oral glips and then around prospects for positive SELECT study. Michael Mason : Okay. On the oral GLP market, I mean, in our market research, consumers are very interested in oral products, both in type 2 diabetes and obesity. And so the prospects of an oral anti-obesity product is very attractive. So we're very encouraged by that opportunity and are excited by our NPA program. As it comes to the positive CV study, if Novo is able to get that with semaglutide, to me, it's -- it's more of an opportunity to show the benefits of the products in the class.  I think any additional benefits that are represented by whether it be our trials or Novo trials are going to help the class and help more payers and more health care professionals take action on the product. And so I think their trial will provide good information and good data for health care professionals and payers. And while our trial is a little bit different, and we think is a little bit broader in nature, we think that will also expand it.  So to me, it's not a comparing our study, the SURMOUNT-MMO study versus SELECT, it's more new information is going to be good for the class, good for health care professionals. We really should be treating obesity a lot more proactive than what we do today. And I think those trials will show the need for that. David Ricks : Maybe if I could jump on this one because I'm speaking to a lot of analysts, there's a desire to anchor on one event that will then trigger broad commercial access for obesity or not. And I don't really think we think it's going to play out that way that already, there are commercial payers who reimburse medicines for chronic weight management and obesity. It's a small number.  We think as the data accumulates over the course of the balance of the decade that, that will become the norm just like we expect in hypertensive to be paid for. Of course, the big action might relate to Troa and the government coverage in the U.S. or similar efforts ex U.S. And those will be more binary. But I wouldn't encourage investors to think about this sort of waiting for one definitive data set, but rather a more accumulating effect over time where commercial access will slowly open up over the next many years due to both Lilly's efforts and other's efforts to prove the health benefits of chronic weight management. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions, please. First, on Remternetug, on the time lines on clinic trials, potentially this drug could be launched as early as '25 under accelerated approval 1 year or so post the introduction of Roche subcutaneous. Do you expect the evolving Abeta data to result in removing of the existing NCD in order to allow it to compete effectively? That's the first question. Obviously, at that point, you will only have the Abeta-lowering data, but it will be subcutaneous potentially?  And then second question, just going back to your oral GLP-1 agents, you're about to unblind both diabetes and obesity Phase II trials. Could you talk to how you look at the commercial potential for this market? It strikes me that the DPP4 market is worth about $13 billion, and that's on top of whatever [indiscernible] is doing. So once you solve or if you managed to solve the drug interaction, is there no possibility that this could be a very major contributor to your revenue growth independent to Mounjaro going forward? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Andrew, for the question. So for the first one on Remternetug and the time lines, maybe hand to Anne to chime in as well as the NCD removal dynamics. And then for the second one on the commercial potential for oral Glips, we'll go back to Mike. Anne White : Thanks so much for the question on Remternetug. Obviously, we're excited that we've initiated the Phase III program. And as you noted, we've started the first study, which is to assess amyloid lowering. We have a broader Phase III program that we're initiating as well, looking at the clinical endpoints as we've done for donanemab, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far with Remternetug, which was the next generation.  And so you're going to see us continue to invest in the AD platform going forward based on donanemab's compelling data and then where we're seeing early, it was on Remternetug. And as you said, it offers the convenience of an additional dosing form that we think will offer a lot of convenience to patients. On your question around the NCD, obviously, we hope now that CMS, we now have the Phase II data from donanemab, which clearly showed clinical benefit as well as clearance of plaque. Now we have the lucanumab data, a large Phase III study also showing clinical benefit. Certainly, it's our position that this is time for CMS to reconsider this decision.  So certainly, we would hope that this is resolved before Remternetug reads out. Obviously, the time line though, is not clear. So what you'll see us do, and I'm sure is doing the same as soon as we have that Phase III data requesting reconsideration and moving forward with the evidence that's demonstrated today, we cannot see a reason that CMS will continue to prevent Alzheimer's patients from getting these medicines.  And as we've said in the past, we believe CD really is very restrictive method to provide to the patients who have this disease and also leads to disparity we've seen in care for Alzheimer's disease. So certainly, I hope that this will be resolved by the time we have Remternetug available to patients. Joe Fletcher : Thanks. Mike, anything to add in terms of the oral GLP commercial opportunity? Michael Mason : Andrew, I think you're thinking about it correctly. When Rybelsus launched, we expected it to grow the class, not impact the injectable market, and that's exactly what happened. It was more additive to the class. And then as Mounjaro is launched, we only see 1% of Mounjaro's demand coming from Rybelsus or oral GLP. So I think you're right. I think it is additive versus attractive, and we're very pleased with the opportunity.  I think in the oral market, what's going to be key is Rybelsus has some interactions with water and food, which have some dosing limitations, which can impact the efficacy of the product, if it's not followed closely as well as there's a gap between the efficacy of oral Rybelsus and injectables. So I think as you get alternatives in place that doesn't have that food and water interaction as the efficacy of the orals increase, you'll see the market potential even being higher, and that's exactly what we plan to deliver, hopefully, with NPA. Operator : The next question is from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : One on Mounjaro Manzaro, it seems like it's Mounjaro call. Looking at the OUTCOME trial, can you comment on kind of the relative risk reduction you'd like to see in the primary endpoint? If you can't comment on any of the [indiscernible] plan, talk more about the need for outcomes to gain payer access over time? And my second question is on Clarity ID, and I appreciate your positive comments around the trial. But do you believe the bar for efficacy has been raised with these data? And can you just remind us why you believe that your endpoint will be sufficient for full FDA approval and any potential coverage by CMS and other payers? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Evan. So for the first question on Mounjaro, the kind of outcomes trial and what we need for payer access, I'll hand that over to Mike. And then for the Clarity AD, I'll hand over to Anne. Michael Mason : Okay. Maybe I'll take another shot at obesity access and how we see it develop over time. I think Dave talked about back if it's going to take a steady drumbeat of evidence and every payer, every employer will make the decision independently and that will grow over time. The other approach that we're taking is we're studying our tirzepatide for other indications for people who live with obesity like heart failure and sleep apnea. These are indications that are already supported by commercial and Medicare Part D. And so we believe that as we get access and demonstrate efficacy there and get indications that, that in itself will unlock subsets of payer access for people who live with obesity who have sleep apnea or heart failure as we continue to build toward our -- the results of the MMO study. So I think it will grow over time, but I think those 2 events are important events in the life cycle of tirzepatide. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. Anne? Anne White : Well, thanks for the question on the Clarity AD and maybe getting to your question, we absolutely see the data that we saw there is clinically meaningful. And clearly, patients, families, care partners highly value a delay in loss of independent stabilities. And so a 20% to 30% slowing of the disease initiated in the earliest stage of the disease should mean additional time in the more functional less impaired stages. So we're excited about those results, and we do think that they're clinically meaningful in this space.  And so we look forward, as we've said, to what we'll see with donanemab. There are many reasons that we're extremely confident about donanemab and those haven't changed. So obviously, it's a positive Phase II study that we were able to produce the choice of the endpoint that we have in our study, as you commented, patient selection strategy and then importantly, the speed and the depth of plaque clearance. So we remain very confident in what we'll see out of our upcoming readout on TD 2.  And then your question on, I think that just as we've said in the past, we believe that is the most robust endpoint in this space. And we've always believed that can be a bit of a noisy endpoint, and so indexing on exact numbers is probably not the best move there. But on TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we powered it for Idris. We showed a 32% slowing, which we definitely see as clinically meaningful. And we believe that Idris will always perform closest to the truth. But in a large enough study, we expect all the endpoints will move similarly. So we continue to be confident about the choice of the Idris. We continue to be confident about the TP2 readout that we'll see in mid-2023. Operator : The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : If I could just stand Alzheimer's for a minute. Just your latest views on the next big readout here coming up, which is the Roche data. To put it bluntly, do you expect that this readout is going to fail even downstream of lucanumab? It seems to me like you guys are still cautious on that data, what's your latest thinking? Second question, not mentioned pushes and pulls in 2023 and something about donanemab. My question is, are you expecting donanemab approval in 2023? And then third question, just your views of the ARIA-E data can and whether you think that's important and clinically differentiating because that does seem to be a real issue that KOLs talk about a lot, and they have the best data so far. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim. And you got an extra question in there out of the 2. But we'll go to Anne maybe to comment high level on Roche and then also on the pushes pulls for donanemab expectations for timing and then finally, lacanumab differentiation. Maybe on the Roche, maybe Dan give your thoughts first. Daniel Skovronsky : Okay. Yes. And then I'll -- I think your last question there, Tim, was on ARIA rates, which I'll maybe take as well. So again, I think I've said before, there's a number of factors here that can help us in predicting results of amyloid lowering drugs. Probably the most important one in our view is the degree of amyloid lowering and there, we're really pleased with what we've seen with donanemab. But lecanumab is probably also a pretty powerful amyloid-lowering drug. Certainly a positive readout from a Phase III of one of these 3 drugs has got to increase your odds of success of 1 of -- or both of the other 2. But I just sort of remind us all that Alzheimer's has been a risky area with studies that are sometimes hard to predict. So we take some caution. Of course, we'd love to see more positive studies and more news for patients -- good news for patients.  I think before I turn it over to Anne for the other question, I just sort of take ARIA-E and lecanemab data. I think it's a little bit hard to do cross-trial comparisons of rates for a couple of reasons that I think are important, maybe we can talk more about at our scientific presentation at CTAD. Just sort of noting that TRAILBLAZER is probably the first time anyone's ever done within trial comparison of 2 different drugs to be able to compare ARIA.  Why is that important? When you're looking at 2 different trials, first of all, you have different patient populations. I think we'll probably learn over time that ARIA rates depend on the stage of disease and are more common in patients with more severe brain pathology. I think that's likely to be true. Second, even in the same population, how you measure ARIA can be very different in different trials, for example. Lecanemab has different timings of MRI than donanemab has used if you have more MRIs or earlier MRIs as we do, I think.  You're more likely to pick up more radiographic ARIA. So that's another caution on cross-trial comparisons. However, I do see ARIA rates as important, particularly the symptomatic ARIA that results in serious consequences in some patients. And that's probably what we need to focus on is the serious events rather than radiographic ARIA. Anne? Anne White : And then the timing, so as I think Dan mentioned during his words that we expect the data readout for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 in mid-'23. So our intention is to submit the data rapidly and we expect a timely review from the FDA for a supplemental submission. So that could lead to a traditional approval in the first half of 2024. And we certainly, as I mentioned, we expect that we would drive for reconsideration. We certainly hope that CMS would take that Phase III data and not wait for the additional approval to assess the situation. but then maybe also to your comment, we expect really limited uptake in the time of accelerated approval, use said, is an early '23 based on how the CED is currently written. So that's the time line that we're on. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim, for your question. I think we have two more questions. Operator : The next question is from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry Holford : Two for me. Just for SURMOUNT-MMO, following up on that I just want to understand why you're firing away to a more traditional 3-point base has been used in diabetes in the SELECT study. What evidence you have adding those 2 additional endpoints? And so why are you drawing a mortality rather than debt. Do you do include those endpoints and your broader eligibility criteria will expedite events? And then secondly, a question on therapeutic focus. You've taken the decision to move your PTL3 into Phase II cardiovascular disease. CME can be, I guess, an expensive risky therapeutic category to participate in. So assuming Phase II is positive, do you anticipate taking these pipelines, the assets on the way through to market alone? Or might you need to consider a partnership just your thought processes around this event decision would be interested? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Kerry. Okay. So first question on Surmount MMO design and second one around Angptl3 and ASCVD maybe more in general, Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks two thoughtful questions there, Kerry. So starting with the SURMOUNT-MMO, you sort of asked why did we -- why are we doing more typical CV outcome studies in -- of course, you'll know that for drugs and diabetes, there was sort of an FDA requirement around this in the past that sort of focus people's attention on discharging risk. And then ultimately, we discovered that certain classes of drugs can actually provide a benefit.  Here, we're trying to go even beyond that observation and demonstrate what we believe to be true, which is that correcting obesity and correcting metabolism in these patients can have a wide range of benefits. And so that's why we've done 2 things there. We've gone beyond the traditional cardiovascular endpoints. This is primarily a cardiovascular drug. It's a drug that corrects metabolism. And we think that will have broader benefits, including, hopefully, and importantly, all cause mortality.  And then second, we've got to a broader population so that we can show the benefit in that group. So that's our thinking here. And I think it's a natural evolution of this class of drugs as we go forward. With respect to ANGPTL3, you ask about our Phase II and what do we do if we get a positive result. Of course, the reason we do these Phase II trials is to look for promising drugs for patients.  I think in cardiovascular, you rightly point out that it's a high-risk area with big Phase III studies that sometimes carry risk into them. In this case, there's a reasonable understanding of this mechanism and how to translate from 2 to 3 -- Phase II to Phase III. But still, what we're focused on is finding a large effect size drug here. And if we can see a big effect in Phase II that would predict a positive strong signal in a Phase III cardiovascular outcome study then that's exactly what we'll do. In terms of whether that's a thing Lilly does alone or partners, it's probably premature to talk about anything like that. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Kerry. Lois, you want to take the last question? Operator : And that's from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : I guess my first question is on Mounjaro. So we talked -- you talked about the whole call, I think, about supply and trends. But can you talk a little bit about the individual dosing like what doses are being used the most? And if you do incur like higher than what you predict demand, what dosage levels might be greatest impacted. I think you had 30% switching and 70% new. So it's the low doses that would go first or the mid doses? And second, on Alzheimer's, we're hearing a lot of doctors say that you have the mind share of the for Abeta class drugs. Can you talk a little bit about what you think is the most important thing that resonates with doctors? Is it subcu? Is it frequent dosing, is it the magnitude of benefit as we think about the speed of uptake once full drug's reimbursed? David Ricks : Thanks, Robyn. So Mike, do you want to handle the question on the dosing dynamics? And then with regard to AD and that mind share question, Anne will fill that. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes, I'm happy to answer that question. I think dosing titration in the real world is different than our clinical studies and the clinical studies we needed to test, what the dose response was going to be 5, 10 and 15. So in our clinical studies, we titrated every 4 weeks up to additional doses in order to be able to have expedited trials and show the benefit. In real world, what you see is that people will start on a dose, they start at 2.5, they go to 5.  And then what we're seeing is that physicians will hold there and see how they respond and 5 milligrams provides really good efficacy for people living with type 2 diabetes. If they need more, then they'll escalate the dose. It may not be at the 4-week mark, it maybe at a 3-month mark. So those trends are still established in the marketplace, but the vast majority of our volume is in the 2.5 and 5 milligrams.  I want to make sure you're not reading too much into my earlier comments around shortages at any particular dose. My comments earlier were just saying, hey, there's a lot of factors that's going on. There's a lot of dynamics. You've got to plan your manufacturing down at the SKU dosing levels a month or 2 ahead of actually when it's for us. And so will every dose line up perfectly with what the demand is needed for that week in the marketplace. It may not. And if it does, then a dose or 2 may not be able to get the order that week, and then we'll adjust quickly. And our team work very closely and very hard to make sure it doesn't impact patients. Anne White : Great. Thanks for the comment on having the mind share. We appreciate that. And I think -- as I reflect on that question, which is a good one, I think it's built over the decades that we've been investing in the Alzheimer's space. So we've been at this for more than 30 years, invested quite a bit of time and resources in this. And I think it led to, first of all, diagnostics being significantly evolved in this space with the launch of and that we have Tauvid, and then we also intend to launch a PTAL blood diagnostic next year, which could really improve access and diagnosis of these patients. And so I think it starts out there with showing our commitment to making sure that the right patients on these therapies. And I do believe that, that was one of the pivot points for how we now have successful trials in this space by the ability to really confirm that people have this diagnosis. All of that learning over the years, all of the insights from the trials that we've had, some of the setbacks that we experienced led to the first positive trial that has happened in this space with the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and showing both significant and rapid clearance of amyloid plaque, but then most importantly, to everyone showing that, that truly slows the progression of the disease.  And so it's really, I think, some of that mind share is built on the commitment that we've shown to the space, the commitment we've had to making sure that patients truly get diagnosed in that. And that's what we're spending a lot of time in the first few months certainly of next year, as we work towards access for these patients is to make sure that we can drive early and accurate diagnosis. We're so pleased with how donanemab has continued to perform. As I said, we believe, and I think lecanemab results reinforce what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ is that clearance of plaque is the key to this disease. And we know that donanemab does that. We look forward to sharing the TV4 data at CTAD. I think you'll see how that reinforces what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and then the design and what we believe will be the performance in TV2. So I think that we deserve that mind share, but I think it's been earned over many years of supporting and investing in this space that has led to positive trials for us and for others. So it's rewarding, I think, for many of the scientists here to see the culmination of this. So -- but again, exciting times, cusp of real meaningful movement for people with Alzheimer's disease. And we really look forward to that readout next year and our accelerated approval early next year as well. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Robin, for the question. Lois? Operator : And there's no further questions in queue. David Ricks : All right. Thanks, Joe, and thanks to the rest of the Lilly team. I appreciate everyone hanging with us on today's call and for your interest in our company. Please follow up with the IR team. If you have any questions that we did not address.

Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Lois. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke from the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Joe. 2022 as a year of strong pipeline and commercial performance for Lilly. We delivered top and bottom line growth in 2022 despite the impact of the Alimta LOE in the US and significant FX headwinds and delivered another remarkable year of pipeline progress. We began 2023 with multiple updates to our late-stage pipeline. In our Q2 2022 earnings call last August, we announced the filing of submissions for two assets with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway, pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Last month, we received response from the FDA on both these assets. On January 19, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for accelerated approval of donanemab due to the limited number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. There were no other deficiencies cited. We will continue to work with the FDA to evaluate the best pathway to make this potential treatment option available to patients and look forward to results next quarter for the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III confirmatory trial, which will form the basis of donanemab's application for traditional approval. We have consistently stated that, we would expect very limited uptake before CMS supports coverage. At the time we submitted for accelerated approval, we had hoped that there would be more movement from CMS to provide access to these medicines for people with Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, this has not yet materialized. We maintain conviction that given the impact of this devastating disease and significant unmet need, positive confirmatory data and FDA traditional approval should be sufficient to support global reimbursement and patient access necessary for broad use of donanemab over time. Also in the month of January, we received FDA approval for Jaypirca, the first and only non-covalent BTK inhibitor, for adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. Jaypirca is a highly selective kinase inhibitor, is novel reversible binding mechanism and pharmacology may allow for extended targeting of the BTK pathway, following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor. We are pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity for donanemab. We also look forward to the potential launch of two of our immunology assets later this year with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab and of tirzepatide for obesity. This current wave of new launches along with the ongoing focus and progress in our next wave of R&D innovation underpins our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth and expand our margins over time. On slide 4 you can see the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue on a constant currency basis grew 10% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Volume in our core business, again, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, grew 13% in Q4 and 12% for the year. This volume-driven performance was attributed to our key growth products, which grew 21% last quarter. For pipeline milestones, in addition to the recent FDA approval of Jaypirca, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call. Positive Phase 3 readout and FDA and EMA acceptance of the regulatory submission for Jardiance for adults with chronic kidney disease, the initiation of a rolling submission in the US for tirzepatide in obesity, and FDA granting a Fast Track designation for tirzepatide in obstructive sleep apnea. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value. In late January, we announced plans to invest an additional $450 million for expansion of our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in North Carolina, to further augment our manufacturing capacity for the years ahead. On the business development front, we closed the acquisition of Akouos to expand our gene therapy capability and we entered into a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities and technologies. Finally, we continue to return capital to investors. In Q4 we distributed nearly $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fifth consecutive year. Moving to slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and ESG updates we are discussing today or that were discussed during our guidance call on December 13. One item I'd like to highlight is the collaboration we announced in December with EVA Pharma to deliver a sustainable supply of affordable high-quality insulin to at least one million people living with diabetes in low to middle-income countries, most of which are in Africa. This is an important collaboration with a local company to produce low quality -- or low-cost high-quality medicines. Strengthening capacity and building self-reliance for insulin manufacturing within the African region will provide a more sustainable supply in the long term. With this agreement, Lilly will sell insulin API to EVA Pharma at a significantly reduced price and provide pro-bono technology transfer to enable EVA to formulate fill and finish insulin vials and cartridges. We're proud to be a part of this novel arrangement, which aligns with our 30x30 goal of improving access to quality healthcare for 30 million people, living in limited resource settings annually by 2030. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full year 2022 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks Dave. Slide 6 and 7 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. As Dave mentioned, we're pleased to report 10% growth for our core business in Q4 on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume growth. A couple of notable items affected year-over-year comparisons. The first is COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q4 2022, which compared to the prior year declined 96% from approximately $1.1 billion in Q4 2021 to $38 million in Q4 2022. Biptimozumab is currently not authorized for emergency use in any US region and we continue to expect no COVID-19 antibody revenue for 2023. Second is the continued foreign exchange headwinds compared to 2021, which resulted in a 45-basis point dampening of revenue growth in Q4. Key growth products grew by 21% and accounted for 70% of our revenue this quarter. For the full year 2022, revenue excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies grew 2% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 80.5% in Q4, an increase of approximately 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized price and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs. Total operating expenses declined 1% in Q4, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were largely offset by higher marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and higher R&D expenses. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 3% in Q4, primarily driven by costs supporting the launch of new products and indications, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expense for the quarter increased 5%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income declined 7% compared to Q4 2021, driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin for Q4 was 27.4%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 330 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Full year operating margin was 27.8% an increase from 26.8% in 2021. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 7.3%, bringing our full year 2022 effective tax rate to 10.3%. As we shared during our guidance call in December, we had assumed that the 2017 Tax Act provision for requiring capitalization, amortization of research, and development expenses for tax purposes would be deferred or repealed by Congress in late 2022. However, no legislative action was taken related to this provision, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for 2022 versus the guidance range previously shared. In addition this provision did increase our tax payments in 2022 by approximately $1.2 billion. At the bottom-line earnings per share declined 4% in Q4 and increased 7% for the full year. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth across key geographies. This quarter US revenue declined 10%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the US. The swap volume-driven growth was led by Verzenio, Mounjaro, and Jardiance. Net price was flat in the US this quarter. For the full year, the net price decrease of 3% in the US was in line with our expectation. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4, increased 8% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Jardiance Trulicity and Verzenio. We remain encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 6% in constant currency. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted, albeit less so than in prior quarters by decreased demand for several products that have lost patent exclusivity including, the Alimta and Cymbalta. We expect to return to growth this year, as we scale key products and launch Mounjaro. In China, revenue grew 2% in constant currency, as continued volume growth was mostly offset by lower realized prices for Humalog, as a result of the volume-based procurement process and for products listed on the NRDL as well as by COVID-19 disruption. Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 11% in constant currency this quarter, driven by approximately $130 million of onetime revenue associated with the sales of the company's right to Alimta in Korea and Taiwan. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth, contributing 15% points of volume growth this quarter. As mentioned previously, the decline in COVID-19 antibody volume, was substantial in Q4 2022 and was largely offset -- and largely offset volume growth from key products. While we will face similar prior period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue through the first three quarters of 2023, our long-term growth prospects are underpinned by our innovative pipeline and key growth products including Mounjaro. Slide 10, further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands grew 21% or 27% in constant currency generated $5.1 billion in sales and made up 70% of our total revenue. While Lilly's incretins portfolio understandably generates high interest, we continue to see tremendous growth both in percentage and absolute terms, for other key products including Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio sales in the quarter grew 100%, driven mainly by the edge of an indication. Jardiance sales grew 42% and the product retains the leadership position, in a competitive market globally. Demand for our incretins portfolio remains strong both for Trulicity globally and Mounjaro in the US, and we remain focused on bringing additional capacity online to meet this robust demand in upcoming launches. In terms of supply, as mentioned in our guidance call in December, given strong demand for incretins products. There have been intermittent delays at wholesalers and pharmacies and receiving certain doses levels of Mounjaro and Trulicity in the US. We continue to update the FDA on the situation, and the FDA has been posting to his website details regarding affected doses and expected timing. To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretins business, we have announced plans to add additional, substantial capacity in the years ahead. The most proximal of these efforts, is our RTP side North Carolina where progress continues as planned and we look forward to the start of production later this year. Moving to Slide 11. Mounjaro's strong launch uptake continues, underpinned by differentiated efficacy profile, and positive customer experiences. For Q4, approximately 75% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts, are patients new to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretins class and further 10% of switches from Trulicity. As we mentioned in our Q3 earnings call in early November, we took actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of the Mounjaro savings program, by type 2 diabetes patients. We indicated at that time that these actions could negatively impact new prescription volumes, but were not expected to impact net revenue. As anticipated, we believe the new prescription volumes beginning in late November were impacted by these actions with some week-by-week volatility driven by end of year seasonality. We continue to build payer access for Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of January 1st AXIS [ph] stands just over 50% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. Regarding the percentage of paid scripts. For Q4 we estimate the percentage of paid script from Mounjaro to be approximately 40% with paid script defined as those prescription outside the 25 non-covered co-pay cards, but inclusive of the 25 covered co-pay card. As we expand payer access, the proportion of paid scripts should continue to increase. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2022, we invested $9.6 billion to drive future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investment. In addition, we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and are oriented towards achieving our strategic deliverables of top-tier revenue growth and speeding life changing medicines to patients. We do this through investments in our current portfolio to drive new launches, investment in our manufacturing capacity in our future innovation through R&D and business development. And we returned capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Slide 13 provides an updated 2023 financial guidance. The only change we've made from the guidance we provided in December is to update our effective tax rate, which result in an updated EPS range. During December guidance call, we shared that the effective tax rate for 2023 would be approximately 16% based on the assumed deferral or repeal of the tax provision requiring capitalization of R&D. Since this provision was not deferred or repealed in 2022 and given the uncertainty around if and when such action will take place in 2023, we have updated our tax rate from 16% to approximately 13%. This update to our effective tax rate results in new EPS range of $7.90 to $8.10 on a GAAP basis and $8.35 to $8.55 on a non-GAAP basis. Regarding FX rates there has been a general weakening of the dollar since we set our initial 2023 financial guidance last year. However, we're not adjusting guidance for FX changes at this time as we're only one month into the year and FX markets can be quite volatile. As I shared in December, the most significant headwind in revenue growth in 2023 versus 2022 will be the impact of COVID-19 antibody sales. This year-over-year comparisons will be most pronounced in Q1 2023 given that we had $1.5 billion of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q1 2022. To a lesser extent the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in the US in Q2 2022 will also impact year-over-year growth in the first half of 2023. Still the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance range represents roughly 7% of growth or 50% growth for our core business excluding COVID-19 antibodies. This year holds tremendous promise for us to help patients as we execute on the current wave of potential launches while maintaining our commitment to invest in and progress future innovation. We expect this ongoing focus on disciplined execution and investment will help drive top two revenue growth through 2030. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan, to provide an update on our pipeline. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks Anat. 2022 was a really productive year for Lilly R&Ds. We advanced our late-stage assets of tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab to key regulatory submissions and we obtained the approval for Mounjaro. We launched Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in mid-2022. As Dave shared, we received an approval last week for pirtobrutinib now known as Jaypirca. By the end of this year, we also have the potential to launch two new immunology assets with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. And for ganitumab, we're looking forward to our Phase III readout mid-year, which if positive will form the basis of our submission for traditional approval. In 2022, we also gained clarity on the next wave of assets that have entered or will soon enter Phase III registrational trials. Those are our SERD in breast cancer, our weekly insulin for diabetes, remternetug in Alzheimer's disease and as shared in our December guidance call, we now have Orforglipron and Retatrutide in diabetes and obesity. Given the updates we provided in mid-December, today I'll just briefly highlight progress since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 30th and slides 15 and 16, show a recap of 2022 key events and potential key events for 2023. Starting with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease, in November, we shared results from the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase III trial, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as the largest and broadest SGLT2 inhibitor trial in CKD to-date. The results showed a significant benefit of Jardiance, in reducing the relative risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% compared with placebo in people with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety data were consistent with previous findings confirming the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. CKD is a leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 850 million people globally and 37 million in the U.S. We've submitted to the FDA and EMA for approval and expect to make submissions to other regulatory agencies in the coming months. In January we started QWINT-1, a Phase III study comparing fixed dose escalation of Lilly's weekly insulin to Insulin Glargine, in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. With this initiation all five studies in the QWINT Phase III program are now underway. Moving to earlier stage assets in our Diabetes and CV pipeline, in Q4 we advanced two assets into Phase II, that aim to lower Lp(a), a well-known risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The first is an oral inhibitor, a small molecule that disrupts the interaction between the apoA protein and the lipoprotein particle and the second uses siRNA to disrupt the production of apoA in the liver. We shared proof-of-concept data on the siRNA asset during our December 2021 R&D Investor Meeting. This is our second siRNA asset to advance to Phase II, following our ANGPTL3 siRNA, which entered Phase II earlier in 2022. We also recently moved an siRNA asset targeting ApoC-III in cardiovascular disease into Phase I. Our genetic medicines portfolio is advancing and we remain optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes with these molecules. Lastly, we discontinued our Phase I KHK inhibitor. In oncology, we're of course pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we look forward to continuing the substantial ongoing development program for the molecule in the years ahead. Jaypirca is the second product approved from our 2019 Loxo Oncology acquisition, which reshaped our oncology efforts at Lilly. Loxo at Lilly's growing NME portfolio now includes a number of emerging assets shown in our pipeline, including our FGFR3 program which recently dosed its first patient. Also, in Q4, we dosed the first patient in EMBER-4, our second Phase III trial for imlunestrant, our oral SERD. EMBER-4 will study imlunestrant in the adjuvant setting. As a sequential monotherapy in patients who previously received two to five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for ER-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer with increased risk of recurrence. Lastly turning to Verzenio. As noted in our guidance call at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December, we shared the latest interim analysis for monarchE, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. We've now submitted an sNDA to the US FDA to potentially expand our adjuvant indication beyond the currently indicated Cohort 1 KI-67 greater than 20% population. In immunology, we're looking forward to potential FDA approvals later this year for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis, which we expect in the first half of the year and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, which we expect in the second half of the year. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, as mentioned in our guidance call, we presented exciting proof-of-concept results for our PD-1 agonist antibody peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis at the ACR conference in November and we have now initiated a global dose-ranging Phase IIb study. Moving to neuroscience. We've advanced into Phase II our P2X7 inhibitor for chronic pain. Lilly acquired rights to this asset from Asahi Kasei Pharma in early 2021. With regards to donanemab. As Dave mentioned, the sole efficiency cited by the FDA to our submission for accelerated approval was a number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. The Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial on which the accelerated approval application was based, allowed patients to complete their course of treatment with donanemab when they reached a predefined level of amyloid plaque clearance. Due to the speed of plaque reduction that we saw, many patients were able to stop dosing as early as six months into treatment, resulting in fewer patients receiving 12 months or more of donanemab dosing. We remain confident in the potential donanemab as a new treatment for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and look forward to sharing results from the Phase III TRABLASER-ALZ-2 study in Q2 of this year. In summary, while 2022 was an outstanding year of pipeline progress, we're fully focused on the work we need to do in 2023 to make our next set of potential medicines a reality for patients. We look forward to providing additional updates throughout the year. Now I turn the call back to Dave. Dave Ricks : Thanks Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2022. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We launched Mounjaro for patients with type two diabetes, while advancing and expanding our development program for tirzepatide, including the start of the SURMOUNT-MMO outcome study and the initiation of a rolling submission for chronic weight management. In 2022, we submitted regulatory applications for important pipeline products like mirikizumab, pirtobrutinib and lebrikizumab. And in 2023, we've already received approval for Jaypirca and are poised to advance donanemab in the regulatory process assuming positive data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ-2 Phase III study. In addition, we continue to invest in our pipeline, our capacity, our capabilities and our people. Finally, we returned $5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fifth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase for 2023. With continued growth in Mounjaro and our key products, including Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz, we expect our core business revenue to grow by mid-teens in 2023. We are energized by the launch opportunities before us this year and no strong launch execution is key to our long-term success. Taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030 and to deliver on Lilly's mission to make life better for people around the world. So now, I'll turn it over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] Lois, please go ahead and provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Bristow : Hey good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just first on Mounjaro. So, it looks like the net price dropped to gain in 3Q to 4Q. Can you just walk us through what specifically drove this, and just update us on how you expect this to trend over the course of the year? And then just maybe looking sort of out to the future of your obesity portfolio, beyond 4G [ph], do you have any interest in mechanisms that target the sort of the mitochondrion coupling side of the equation, that would be helpful. Thank you Dave Ricks : Thanks, Colin. We'll go to Mike for the first question on gross to net and price for Mounjaro and then hand over to Dan for kind of broader obesity mechanistic commentary. Mike? Mike Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to answer that is to take a look at what we saw as kind of our Mounjaro paid scripts in Q4 and then how we think that will progress over '23. In the fourth quarter, we classify about 40% of Mounjaro scripts as paid, which we defined as patients that aren't supported by our $25 non-coverage savings program. In our savings program, as we discussed at launch was designed to bridge people living with type 2 diabetes to access. As we discussed in the Q3 earnings call, we have adjusted a program to better ensure, it's being used for people living only with type 2 diabetes. These adjustments included removing our $25 non-covered benefit from our savings card for new patients. We didn't make any adjustments for existing patients who are seeing these cards are set to expire on June of this year, June 30. As expected, these changes have reduced new patient start volume, while increasing the percent of new patients with a history of diabetes treatments and the percent with formulary coverage. I think the way I would look at our savings program right now for new patients is that, we have graduated from the bridging program and now are kind of the type of savings program, really focused on covered patients that you would do in kind of a normalized cycle of a product. So thus we expect that Mounjaro's percent of paid scripts and a net revenue per script to increase through 2023, as we continue to increase access and grow new starts. We remain disciplined in our access discussions so we can maximize long-term value. From the start, our value our approach was to make sure that we capture value in the long-term versus the short term and we've remained very disciplined on that. We have just over 50% access for lives in Part D and commercial segments for people living with type 2 diabetes We're very pleased where we're at on the access front and where the way our contracting has turned out at this point. So hopefully that helps provide some color to our gross to net in Q4. Thanks. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Colin for your question on future mechanisms for treating obesity. I can assure you we're not done innovating on behalf of people with obesity. There's a lot we can still do. I think keep your eyes open for more to come from Lilly labs on incretins and related types of mechanisms, but also broadly interested in a variety of new non-incretins-based mechanisms. You specifically asked about one mitochondrial uncoupling but there are several others, I think that also have promise for patients. I just sort of put a note of caution though treating obesity we need to have a very high bar for the types of medicines we develop, remembering that this is a chronic often lifetime disease and highly prevalent population. We need medicines that first and foremost are extremely safe and really highly well tolerated for patients. So that's what we're looking for in future mechanisms. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Colin. Lois, next question? Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. One follow-up on the last set of questions. Is it still reasonable to think about a net Mounjaro price that could be above that of Trulicity as we look out to 2024 or whenever you achieve kind of comparable payer access. And then my question was on donanemab. I know there wasn't a huge revenue opportunity tied to the accelerated approval. But I think you had talked about using that gap between accelerated approval and full approval to really ramp physician education and infrastructure, et cetera. How do you kind of manage through that now I guess where we're going to have maybe a full approval that could be occurring closer into a CMS decisions? So just maybe elaborate a bit on what that means for donanemab over time. Thank you. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Chris. All right. We'll go to Mike for the question about Mounjaro price kind of over time and how it might compare to Trulicity. And then to Anne on your donanemab question about activity that would occur to ramp up HCP education. Mike? Mike Mason : Yes, thanks for the question. I can't get into roles about our net price for obvious reasons but maybe I'll address the question this way. I mean if you look at \u2013 when we have - when we reach \u2013 we think we'll reach broad access for Mounjaro and reach ultimately similar access levels that we have for Trulicity. There's nothing differently about how we'll promote or how to support patients on Mounjaro versus Trulicity. So at the end of the day it will come down to our net price negotiations with payers. We believe that Mounjaro has a better profile. We invest a lot of innovation in there. And we do believe that it should have a better net price than Trulicity. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Mike. Anne? Anne White : Yes. Thanks, Chris for the question on physician education and readiness. So as you said, the accelerate approval is not going to provide access for the vast majority of patients. So it doesn't impact us in that way. And obviously, accelerate approval would have made it maybe a little bit easier to do some of the things that we wanted to do, but there's still a great deal that we can do actually have been doing to make sure that the healthcare system is ready for these medicines. So we begin working on that, things such as developing the diagnostic ecosystem are incredibly important, making sure that there's better integrated Alzheimer's disease pathways to make sure that physicians can properly identify refer infuse these patients. So that's the area of focus right now. Certainly diagnostics are a key area of focus for Lilly. We've continued to expand our PET network to make sure that we're ready for patient diagnosis. And then as well we continue to be committed to PTAL blood tests and intend to launch that this year. So many things going on that I think can make us very ready for traditional approval and making sure that people can access these medicines. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris for the questions. Lois, next question? Operator : The next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks for the question. So Dan, I wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit about where you see the oral GLP-1 space developing and how your product is likely to be positioned. A little bit of this I think is also what you think the unmet need is outside of where the, sort of, very robust weight loss that we see from Mounjaro is. And then just an add-on to that how do you see the oral market developing in terms of other potential agonists? Is that something that Lilly is pursuing and hoping to further develop combinations there as well? Thanks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dan on this question. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Seamus. I'll get started. Maybe Mike wants to add on some of the marketplace questions. But clearly obesity is a huge problem in the US and around the world. I think 100 million Americans potentially with obesity and reaching one billion people around the world pretty soon. That's probably not a market that even all of the interested companies could address solely with injectables. So just given the scope of the problem around the world we're going to need orals. Ultimately it's our goal to have orals that can match the safety tolerability and efficacy of injectables. I think our oral GLP-1 is our first attempt in this space and has really good prospects for meeting that initial goal. But then noting of course that the injectables are going to get better over time and the orals will catch up as well. The second part of your question was how do the orals catch up. And I think you're sort of alluding to an obvious issue, which is right now our oral GLP-1 and other orals in the space are single mechanism, single incretin agonists. I think, we've seen with great drugs like Trulicity and competitive products what single agonist against GLP-1 can achieve. It's not as good, I think, as what can be achieved with dual agonism for tirzepatide or hopefully even triple agonism with GGG. And so you can bet, we're working on oral solutions that can bring additional incretin activity to patients in a pill. Nothing ready to disclose today but we're working hard. Joe Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Dan. All right. Lois, next question. Operator : Next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I have two related ones on tirzepatide. Dan I know you have SURMOUNT-4 coming up which is the maintenance study but how has your thinking evolved if at all on the potential duration of tirzepatide use either based on longer exposure from clinical studies or in the real world? And do you think that could inform payer discussions. And then Mike on Mounjaro a moving target, but how does the prescriber base as of today compare with Trulicity. I'm trying to get a sense for maybe the endocrinology versus primary care mix and utilization in obesity? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Great. Thank you, Geoff. So we'll go to Dan for the question on SURMOUNT-4 and duration of tirzepatide and then to Mike on the question of how the prescriber base from Mounjaro compares to Trulicity. Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Sure. As I was just saying I mean obesity is clearly a chronic often lifetime disease. And for such diseases patients often need to take therapy for chronically -- potentially life of the disease here. A lot of times in medicine that doesn't happen of course, people come off of therapies, because either the therapy is working, and they think they don't need anymore or there's a benefit they can't see. I'm not sure either of those are the case for a drug like tirzepatide. People clearly can observe the benefits that the drug is having on their health. And perhaps unfortunately, but not different really than any other drug that we have for any other disease. When you stop taking the drug, it's likely that it can no longer work, and patients may see that as well. So I think those factors will combine to have a pretty long duration of therapy. We have to wait and see in the marketplace maybe Mike has some early signals from patients, but still pretty early on. Anything there, Mike? Mike Mason : Yes, no hard data yet on that. But qualitatively what we hear is what patients who've used Mounjaro, what they like and what they realize once they start using it is that it really does reduce the appetite, and they enjoy the benefits of reducing appetite. It helps them lose their -- lose weight and stop being as consumed as much during today about 80%. And we do know that when -- what we heard from our investigators and our studies is that when people stop taking Mounjaro that their appetite goes back to the level, it was before. So that's something very noticeable something that a patient values from taking the therapy and then when they stop the therapy, they then see this reversed. And so we do believe that people are going to stop, and see if they can lose weight if they can great. But I do think that they're going to see a very powerful signal very quickly to reinforce going back on the product. So I do think that will help reinforce the chronic use of tirzepatide for type two diabetes, and eventually for obesity if we get approved. The question on Trulicity. Mounjaro if you look at Mounjaro's use right now and compare it to how many customers are using that versus Trulicity at this time, it's a lot broader population than we saw with Trulicity is because the market is a lot bigger a lot more people are riding the treatment. If you compare Mounjaro to the number of Trulicity riders today there are more people riding Trulicity just, because it's been on the market longer. They've gone through the adoption curve and Trulicity has better access, access and especially in Medicaid that drives additional prescribers to use that. So overall I'd say the Mounjaro is within the universe of the doctors who write Trulicity at this point. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Geoff for the question. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I have a question on donanemab. I'm wondering if Lilly would agree that there is highly likely going to be higher area E and area H rates with your drug versus lecanemab when TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 reports out. The prior data would certainly suggest that. If so, relative to lecanemab, doesn't that create a potential risk benefit conundrum for FDA assuming efficacy comes in around the same levels. I guess the bottom line here is there a regulatory concern to contemplate maybe this is why FDA issued the CRL they want to see the full results from your second study. You don't just want to capture a few more patients to bring that total to 100, or am I being too bearish here? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim, for the question. We'll go to Dan for this. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Maybe I'll answer the second part of the question first, which is around, why did the FDA issue the CRL. I think that the FDA regulations actually suggest that FDA should list all deficiencies in the CRL. We were pretty explicit copying some of the FDA's own words here to investors about what was in the CRL. It didn't discuss issues like ARIA it was focused on the 12-month exposure. So nothing further to speculate there. I think your question on rates of ARIA-E and ARIA-H comparing across drugs is a complicated one. We did this head-to-head study against aducanumab. I think it's important to use studies like that to compare rates of ARIA, because we've learned that grades of ARIA are highly dependent on the type of patients who enroll the stage of disease and underlying pathology, baseline characteristics of their brain scans, which are different across lecanemab trials and genetimib trials, as well as exactly how you do the MRIs and read them. So I'm personally not going to get worked up about rates of asymptomatic radiographic-only ARIA in any drug. I don't think anyone really understands what that means. What we should be focused on though is rates of symptomatic ARIA. So patients who have ARIA that turns into something they experience, not just a radiographic binding and particularly rates of serious adverse events resulting ARIA. We know that in some patients ARIA can be dangerous even fatal as we've seen from lecanemab experiences. So that's what we'll be looking out for. I think we still have all the caveats about cross-trial comparisons here, but it's a bit easier to compare those symptomatic or serious events. I think in TRAILBLAZER-1 our numbers were very similar to other members of the class. In TRAILBLAZER-4, the numbers look very, very good for that. And we'll wait and see what we have in TRAILBLAZER-2. The level of concern over that is not high. Joe Fletcher : Thank you. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a two part one for me. I guess first on Mounjaro manufacturing. I was just wondering if you can tell us if the FDA has completed the inspection of your new North Carolina facility yet. And then the other question relates to tirzepatide for obesity. I was wondering if you've had any initial payer conversations yet, and if you're planning to use a priority review voucher for that filing? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Terence. I think I'll hand over to Anat for commentary on your manufacturing question and then to Mike on the question about whether there's been any payer conversations on obesity. Anat Ashkenazi : Terence, to your question on the RTP side North Carolina, it's progressing on schedule as we had planned. We can't comment on specifics on the FDA interactions, but we're expecting that site to start producing this year and it's progressing towards that goal. I will mention important to think about -- when we talk about RTP, I think because of the proximal nature of when this site is going to come online. Obviously, this is the next large node that's going to come online in terms of capacity for incretins portfolio. But we are making substantial investments beyond RTP. So, we've announced a second site in North Carolina, very large site in Concord, when we've announced the expansion of the RTP site additional sites in India \u2013 or north of Indianapolis and a site in Ireland. And as we look at our capital investments in manufacturing sites this year alone, it's probably the largest we've ever had doubling what we had in 2022. We're looking at about $3.3 billion of investment just this year. So we're looking at substantial expansion of capacity really across the globe to support not just Mounjaro obviously, but the rest of the portfolio and we have visibility into what's coming as well as the fact that, as we've talked about before we have several products that are part of the same manufacturing network, and the same auto-injector platform. So that helps us kind of build that capacity across the Lilly portfolio. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Anat. Mike on the second question? Mike Mason : Yeah. I think a good thing to focus on is access and obesity. I mean you look at the massive size of the obesity market 110 million people in the US, 650 million people globally but you really see that the historically that the obesity market has really been slow to develop. And it's really because the treatments haven't been adequate. So, the kind of \u2013 the question we had going into this market, was if a safe and efficacious treatment was developed would consumers and health care professionals and payers be interested in using it? Well, based on what we've seen in the marketplace over the past year and on a market research it's clear that consumers and health care professionals will adopt an efficacious safe anti-obesity medication if patients can have access to it. So it does come down to payer access, and we're highly focused on doing that. Noble recently stated in their call that 40 million Americans have access to obesity and the way, they talked about it what's payer access and employers opting into that. So if that's where we're at today that would be a great starting point for access. We're deep into conversations with payers to understand the market and all that. Access discussions haven't started yet, but will shortly. But our focus long term is to improve access for diabetes medications. We are investing significantly to demonstrate the potential health outcome benefits, where people using tirzepatide, who live with obesity. We're also investing in Phase III programs for people, who live with obesity and sleep apnea, or heart failure and they should unlock large segments access for people who live with obesity in commercial and we hope Part D. In addition, in my career, I've seen the power of consumer interest in helping to improve access for medication. And what we've seen over the last year is that, people who live with obesity are highly engaged and willing to do much access effective treatments. They will have an important walls with employers and the congressional representative advocate for access. So, while I think it will take time to establish our ultimate actions goal, I'm more encouraged than ever are potential unlock the obesity market and help a lot of people. So I'm encouraged, but obviously a lot of work still to be done. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, both, and thanks Terence for the question. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. A question for Anat. I'm not going to get the legislative particulars correct. But just to be clear, doesn't Lilly typically guide on tax rate assuming an adverse US situation and doesn't typically adjust that until late in the year. And this year it is assuming no adverse situation but much earlier in the year? If so, can you clarify why you were doing something different this year since it is a profound impact on earnings? And if I could just add on LPA, Dave, Lilly is way behind, how can you catch up? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Steve. I'll go to Anat for the question on the tax rate assumptions, and then I'll go to Dan for your LP little a question. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks Steve. So here is how we look at this and I wouldn't read too much into it. Last year we had assumed based on very broad support for change in this 2017 tax provision, that this will in fact be enacted by Congress. We assumed late in the year, but it hasn't happened. So at this point, the only thing we're doing is reflecting reality of the situation we're in. If it does get repealed or deferred, obviously, we'll update accordingly. I don't think the likelihood of that is zero. So it still could happen this year, but it does take Congress -- Congress will need to add to get this going. So we're simply reflecting the current situation. Dan Skovronsky : Okay. I'll start with the LP little a question. We have two LP little a programs, so maybe the easiest one to comment on first is the oral program. This is a first-in-class I think, probably the only one in clinic here. An oral medication against this target is really a huge feat of molecular engineering. I'm super excited to see the data from this molecule developed and obviously, the market opportunity for an oral drug for such a widespread condition is very important. In terms of the siRNA, you're right to note that a competitor is ahead of us and really just starting the CVOT study. It's a long road to get these drugs to market with outcome studies are needed here to show the benefit. I probably don't get into our differentiation strategy. But, of course, we have some ideas here and we'll move as quickly as possible. I don't see this as a winner take all space. Dave Ricks : Maybe just to add -- Steve add on the LP little a comment. I think we feel good about where we are with that. But just on the tax thing, there is a difference here where you described it as adverse or beneficial, right? From a GAAP and non-GAAP accounting, of course, it's a benefit on EPS growth. But actually from a cash perspective, it goes the other way. So we just wanted to be clear upfront, because it's not a one-way benefit we're taking early in the year. There's an adverse cash impact throughout the year and a positive effect on the P&L. It's a little bit different from maybe past assumptions we've made. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you, what do you think is the minimum amount of relative risk reduction you'd have to see in an outcome study for obesity for payers to be convinced that there's something here? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Louise. Mike, do you want to chime in on that around the minimum amount of relative risk reduction we'd expect in an outcome study for obesity? Mike Mason : Yes. That's a good question. I mean first of all, I don't think it's a binary point where all payers are looking for that outcome in order to provide access. I think you're going to see a lot of payers you already see a lot of payers who can provide access for that. And we have an extensive Phase 3 program only in CV outcomes but also the sleep apnea and heart failure to begin to really talk about heart outcomes for many patients who live with obesity. With the CV outcomes that we have today, I mean we're quite confident in our program and based on what we see with surrogate risk reduction and blood pressure and lipids, we're fairly confident in our CV profile as well as what we saw with the SURPASS data and our meta-analysis in the SURPASS program. So I won't give you the exact number, but I think we're pleased with where we're at. And I think we'll be able to demonstrate outcomes that payers will be excited about. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Louis for the question. Lois, next question. Operator : And that comes from David Risinger from SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Dave are you there? Okay. Looks like we don't have Dave or he's on mute. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. If I can ask a question on Mounjaro and the interplay with Trulicity. You've commented in the past that in terms of patients on Mounjaro, it has been about less than 10%. That seems to be a little bit higher now. Can you share any thoughts and observations about how you see this progressing on the forward through this year? Joe Fletcher : Thanks Chris for the question. Mike, we'll go to you for that question on the, I guess cannibalization from Trulicity figure and how that will progress. Mike Mason : Okay. Yeah, I mean on that nothing has changed over what we had talked about earlier that less than 10% of our scripts we get four Mounjaro comfort Trulicity. That hasn't changed over time. It's still a little bit less than 10%. Chris Shibutani : Okay. Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Lois, next question. Operator : And that comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. There's been a heightened investor focus I feel along the Phase III primary endpoint for donanemab now. And I wonder if there's been any incremental interactions and/or agreement with FDA on the primary endpoint for Phase III. The question I get a lot from investors. And also how are you thinking about this upcoming Phase III? If there were to be a scenario where the MMRM on CDR doesn't agree with ADAS on a patient analysis? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Umer. We'll go to Dan for the question on endpoints. Dan Skovronsky : Yeah. Thanks. Clearly I think there's a lot we can learn from competitor readouts here. And so looking at lecanemab data in our eyes, I think it actually further validates an endpoint like ADAS. If you just look at the forest bot for example there's a lot more homogeneity in effect on an endpoint like ADAS versus CDR Sum of Boxes. So we feel more confident I would say than ever before that endpoint like that is the right way to go. On the other hand I think the -- you could take the position that since lecanemab hit CDR Sum of Boxes people might say, well then it's achievable and you guys should do it too. So there's some pushes and some takes there. But on the whole still feeling good about ADAS as a primary outcome. When you ask though what happens if you hit one outcome and not the other. That's surely a difficult situation to be in. We want to understand why that happened. If that were to happen where the irregularities in CDR Sum of Boxes that could explain it what did the rest of the secondaries look like. Always best to hit all of your outcomes in a clinical trial. Feeling that you want to hit your primary in as many secondaries as possible. So let's wait and see. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Umer. Lois, next question. Operator : That question is from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe a question regarding your next-generation Alzheimer's drug. I cannot pronounce the name remternetug I'll learn it. But how does it differ or similar versus donanemab? Asking -- because I mean you're running a Phase III trial with subcu here. So what would be the read through for this particular asset based on the outcome of donanemab Phase III trial? Joe Fletcher : Dan, do you want to talk a little bit about remternetug? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. I think ,you've got it basically, right. Remternetug is a new medicine, a new molecule, but it's an antibody against the same type of epitope that donanemab has which is this N3pG form of a beta. So a very equivalent mechanism of action. Maybe a little better potency and certainly better drug properties including, no ADAs and formulation things. So the rationale here is to give improved dosing options to patients. Could we get even faster plaque clearance, could it be with fewer doses, could it be subcutaneous. Those are the types of things, that we're currently exploring. The Phase III is designed with a bit of a run-in, were in that portion right now to finalize our dosing strategy and then expand it. Obviously, if donanemab is disappointing there would be read-through remternetug. On the other hand, if donanemab exceeds expectations, I would expect that to read through as well. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Mohit, Next question. Operator : The next question is Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. While much of the discussion on Medicare coverage in Alzheimer's, we know that Medicare really doesn't pay for obesity drugs. Can you just talk about your efforts to help Medicare patients get coverage for obesity drugs including, potentially Mounjaro if approved. Maybe add some parameters around, what that additional population could look like from a revenue opportunity perspective. Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Evan for the question. I'll hand over to Mike. Mike, do you want to talk about the potential for Medicare to cover obesity? Mike Mason : Okay. Sure. Yes, good question. I mean, it's going to take less late action in order to allow diabetes medications to be covered on Medicare Part D. So there is the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act. The acronym for that is TROA. And there's a large growing bipartisan support for TROA, a little over 100 congressmen, senators, people senators are behind the program. And it's growing more and more support across Washington. We're eager to see an advanced list process. It would be great for the company country. America needs to take action and drastic reduce the number of people in the DC and this oscillation would be an important step for this goal. We'll support the translation and continue to work, to advocate for it. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Trung Huynh : Thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019m Trung Huynh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Last month the American Academy of Pediatrics released their guidelines to treat childhood obesity. In those guidelines, they recommended a lifestyle intervention obviously, is the core component. But also they said, they would consider treatment with anti-obesity medications. So I thought, what's your thoughts on anti-obesity medications in children? Is this a scenario that you are moving into or considering moving into? Do you have any trials with children or adolescents? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Trung for the question. Mike over to you again comment on these recent guidelines that were put out. Mike Mason : Yes. Thanks. I mean this is a significant unmet need. Back to the question that we asked earlier about the Treat Reduce Obesity Act. We need to prove the health of America. We have too many people who live with obesity in the US and that includes unfortunately adolescents and feeds. So, I think they took the right action in order to really identify this as an issue that healthcare professionals do need to pay close attention to. We obviously always advocate for diet and exercise is the first approach of this. But if that's not successful then you really only option at that point is medication treatment. We do think it's important and responsible for us to test the appetite in feed and adolescents and we have activity ongoing to do that. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Mike and thanks Trung for the question. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I guess one for Anat. Back in December, you highlighted austerity measures in Europe as a potential risk. At that time that was a bit of a unique position. We hadn't heard that from many companies since that time. We've heard kind of similar messaging from some but not all. And apologies if I missed it I don't think I heard anything today on this front. So, I know it's only been sort of 45 days or so since you made those comments, but any advances in sort of how you're thinking about this? And any specific products or countries we should think about that impact? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Carter for the question. I'm actually going to hand this over to Ilya Yuffa, who's our President of Lilly International to comment on the European austerity measures. Ilya Yuffa : Yes, I appreciate the question. There have been a number of markets in Europe that have taken some austerity measures, partially due to Ukraine crisis and energy crisis and inflation in Europe. We have seen Germany, France, obviously, the UK, voluntary system we think is broken and so we exited that. And so we -- there are some austerity measures in there. We've contemplated that into our guidance for 2023. And the overall impact is modest relative to historical declines in price in prior years. We expect that to continue to be in that mid-single-digit decline in price in Europe. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Ilya. Thanks Carter for the question. Lois, next question. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A question on US commercial access for GLP-1 agonist. First, could you share with us how you're thinking about modeling the impact of the IRA in terms of GLP-1 uptake increasing as a result of the co-pay cap? And additionally benefiting from the reduction in free drug program. How significant is it given the patients still got to find $2,000 per annum? And then second, in relation to the oral DPP-4 market which is still a very, very substantial $14 billion market. You have a category of drugs extensively which may offer considerable advantages in efficacy for glycemia and white. But I'm reminded of the stickiness of the [indiscernible] in the prior period. To what extent do you think managed market is going to preclude your ability to penetrate that segment with oral GLP-1s just on the basis of generic DPP-4s? thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Andrew for the wide-ranging question on diabetes. I'll hand over to Mike first to talk about your question regarding potential impact of the IRA on access for GLP-1. And then the second question around how oral GLP might fit in given the stickiness of some of the older diabetes medications. Mike? Mike Mason : Yes. Good questions. On the IRA side of it, it will benefit patients who live with diabetes who use GLPs and are Medicare Part D the outpace cost will go down. We have I would say a small or moderate impact on GLP sales or just probably lower rates of abandonment than what we'd see at higher out-of-pocket costs. As it comes to the oral DPP4 the perceptions of oral DPP-4 have really declined over the last five years and really being replaced by ST2s and GLP lose. So I don't see much of an impact of DPP-4s going off path in the US or other markets. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. And Lois, I think we have one final question in the queue. So let's go to the last question. Operator : Thank you. And that's from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Robyn Karnauskas : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was just thinking more about some of the launches that are coming up but I know the maybe a little bit out. But for Mirikizumab and I always get this wrong, sorry. But for UC, can you just talk a little bit about given how much promotion there's been for [indiscernible] as you move into also Crohn's with data reading out soon. Like how do you see like competing in that market? Can you start launching? Do you have to be DTC heavy because it seems like they're very prominent. Like what about the launch dynamics. And then second for lebrikizumab the same question here. Atopic dermatitis is getting pretty crowded. What kind of pushes and pulls might you need to use to get quicker uptake in atopic derm? Thanks. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Robyn for the questions. I will go to Patrick Johnson for both of these first on mirikizumab and competition in the UC market and then on lebrikizumab. Patrick? Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much. Well, overall we feel very good with the data we have seen on mirikizumab. If we look at the 52 weeks, we have more than 50% clinical remission and we see statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both clinical, symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic endpoints. What I think is important that if you look at the patient populations with ulcerative colitis, we saw the same results across the bionaive and the bio failure patients. So I think we're extremely well positioned for the launch here. We also demonstrated on a factor but it's extremely important for patients or agency. More than 40% of patients were either completely or almost our urgency at week 52. So therefore, we believe we have a first-in-class asset here that probably initially will be used mainly second line for those that haven't responded appropriately to TNFs and similar. But we believe that long-term, we are positioned for a first-line placement in treatment of ulcerative colitis. And yes, so the outlook for mirikizumab. It's exciting from a competitive landscape perspective, we don't have bad to have data. But if we compare the data we have seen so far, we believe that mirikizumab compares very favorable both versus what's currently in the marketplace as well as what's in the pipeline with other companies across JAK inhibitors S1Ps and other IL-23s as well. So exciting to launch mirikizumab the first half of this year. When it comes to lebri, I think actually, we are uniquely positioned to really upgrade the expected outcomes of patients with atopic dermatitis. We have here an asset that is actually targeting the most relevant cytokine when it comes to treating atopic dermatitis, IL-13 and it does that with a high binding affinity, high potency and a slow off rate. And I think that probably explains the data that we have seen so far. We're extremely pleased with the Phase III data, and we sold more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at Week 16, maintaining that at Week 52, but also very importantly, statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both each, which is probably the most disturbing factor for patients with atopic dermatitis, sleep and quality of life. And we saw similar results across both the Q2W and Q4W formulation. We actually believe that lebrikizumab has the potential to become a first-line biologic. It's important to have in mind that we announced the submission at the Q3 earnings call, and we expect that traditional regulatory pathway. Yes, we will not launch until most likely Q4 of 2023. But a lot of excitement from both health care providers and tier community as well on the payers to get leverage to the market. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Patrick. Dave, to wrap up? Dave Ricks : Great. I think that's the last question. I appreciate the questions across the portfolio. And we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. 2022 was another productive year for the company, and we generated strong financial results and delivered important pipeline progress in each of our core therapeutic areas on behalf of the patients we serve. We aim to continue our momentum in 2023 and execute on the meaningful launch and pipeline opportunities that we have ahead of us. So thanks for dialing in, and please follow up with IR, if you have questions that we didn't get to you today. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lilly Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrick Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Springnether, Kendo Waha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide three. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Ricks : Thanks, Joe. We're off to a strong start in 2023 with volume-driven revenue growth led by our incretin portfolio, Verzenio and Jardiance. At our Q1 earnings last year, we shared exciting data from SURMOUNT-1, the first of our tirzepatide obesity Phase III trials. Today, we're excited to share the positive top line results for the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III trial for tirzepatide, which examine the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in chronic weight management in a type 2 diabetes population. SURMOUNT-1 set a new bar for weight loss possible from a pharmacologic agent in non-type 2 diabetes population with obesity or overweight in a Phase III trial. And SURMOUNT-2 does the same in the type 2 diabetes population. Before discussing our financial results and pipeline updates, I'd like to also note the actions Lilly announced on March 1 to improve insulin affordability in the United States. We are proud to have led these efforts to make it easier for people to access Lilly insulin, including through the broad implementation of our $35 out-of-pocket cap and a significant reduction in list price for most of our most commonly used insulins. That said, there remains substantial opportunity and need to reduce existing systemic barriers to insulin access and affordability. Bringing affordable insulin to those who need it will require action and engagement by all stakeholders in our health system. But together, we can create real change to improve access and affordability for people who use insulin. Moving to our results. You can see this on Slide 4 that the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue, which includes sales of COVID-19 antibodies -- sorry, excluding sales from COVID-19 antibodies grew 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth of 18%. Volume growth in Q1 was underpinned by Mounjaro, which is leading the new product category, which also includes Jaypirca, and we expect it will include additional products in the months and years to come. The new product and growth product classifications represent an evolution from our prior designation of key growth products. We believe that these classifications will help investors see the performance of both our newest products in addition to those with ongoing growth potential. In the first quarter of this year, the new product category contributed $574 million of revenue, and the new product and growth product categories combined to contribute 20 percentage points of volume growth in Q1. These products as well as expecting -- expected upcoming product launches reinforce our belief in the strength of Lilly's growth outlook throughout this decade. Last Monday, we broke ground at the site of our two new manufacturing facilities in Boone County, Indiana. We also announced a further $1.6 billion investment in addition to the previously announced $2.1 billion investment in this project to expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities. And our progress continues as planned towards production starting later this year at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. On the business development front, this past week, we entered into agreements to sell the rights of our olanzapine portfolio, including Zyprexa and the rights to These two transactions will enable us to further focus our time and effort on our next-generation medicines. In our pipeline, we've had several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including label expansion for Verzenio in advanced breast cancer in the U.S.; for mirikizumab approval in Japan and a positive CHMP opinion in the EU as well as the FDA's issuance of a Complete Response Letter in the United States; regulatory submissions in the EU for tirzepatide for chronic weight management and in Japan for lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis; and a positive Phase III top line readout for SURMOUNT-2, the second global study evaluating tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight, which will enable completion of our rolling submission with the FDA under Fast Track designation. Dan will discuss this further, but we are excited with the top line results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-2 trial. As shared late last year, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA and initiated a rolling submission for tirzepatide in chronic weight management based on the results of the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And we aligned with the FDA that completion of the submission would come following the SURMOUNT-2 readout. We anticipate completing our submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. We believe addressing obesity could make an enormous difference in millions of people's lives, significantly impact public health and reduce health care costs. We are encouraged by this important next step in the journey to redefine obesity care. Finally, this quarter, we distributed $1 billion in dividends and completed $750 million in share repurchases. On Slide five, you'll see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we are discussing today. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue declined 11% versus Q1 2022. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenues increased 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, highlighting solid momentum for our business despite a substantial headwind from a loss of exclusivity in the United States, which did not yet face meaningful generic competition in the base period. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 230 basis points to 78.4% in Q1 2023. The increase in gross margin percent was driven primarily by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized prices. Total operating expenses increased 15% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming product launches and indications. R&D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $105 million or $0.10 of EPS. In Q1 2022, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges totaled $166 million or $0.15 of EPS. Operating income decreased 38% in Q1, driven by lower revenue, primarily due to 0 sales of COVID-19 antibodies this quarter, paired with higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 23% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 150 basis points attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 12.8%. This represents an increase of 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022, driven primarily by the tax impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $1.62. On Slide seven, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue declined 14%. As a reminder, COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q1 of 2022 totaled approximately $1.5 billion compared to zero in Q1 of this year. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 19%, driven by robust volume growth for Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. We experienced a net price decline of 5% in the U.S. for the quarter, driven primarily by Humalog and Trulicity. As we move into the second half of 2023, we expect U.S. pricing headwind versus prior year will ease considerably driven by Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics. Europe continued its steady growth trajectory with revenue in Q1 growing 8% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 13% in Q1. For Japan, Q1 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as the base period impact of generic competition to Cymbalta and Alimta waned, and we continue to see strong robust growth in our newer medicines led by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, Jardiance. Moving to China. Revenue declined 1% in constant currency with volume growth of 19% offset by net price declines. Volume growth was driven by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, increase in shipments of Olumiant. Price declines were largely driven by Humalog, which was added to the volume-based procurement scheme in Q2 of last year. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 9% in constant currency, driven by the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia for $95 million in Q1 of 2022, partially offset by growth in Verzenio, Mounjaro and Jardiance. Slide eight shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As Dave mentioned earlier, we have evolved a prior product categorization from key growth products, which included 10 key products launched since 2014 to now focus on 2 categories, the first called new product and the second called growth product. The new product categories led by Mounjaro and also includes Jaypirca, and we expect to expand to include new products in the coming months and years. The growth product category is made up of select products that have been in the market for several years with continued exclusivity. As you can see, the new and growth product categories contributed over 20 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter, which was largely offset by the previously mentioned decline in COVID-19 antibody revenue. While the lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibody will be a headwind to growth throughout the year, the most substantial impact was in Q1. As I mentioned earlier, in Q1 2022, we realized approximately $1.5 billion of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, representing 75% of the $2 billion sold in the full year 2022. Slide 9 provides additional perspective on the trends and specific highlights across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly, but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 60% in Q1 as the long-term monarchE follow-up data shared at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last December and the recently expanded label support continued uptake in adjuvant breast cancer. Verzenio is now the standard of care in its Category 1 NCCN listed for high-risk adjuvant breast cancer. Jardiance also continued its outstanding performance with worldwide sales growth of 38% for the quarter. In Q1, we were pleased to announce that based on the results of the Phase III DYNAMO trial, the FDA accepted the supplemental New Drug Application for Jardiance for children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. And lastly, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of Trulicity's performance in a growing and dynamic incretin market. Worldwide sales of Trulicity grew 14% in Q1, anchored by the product's robust efficacy and safety profile, coupled with the convenient and easy-to-use device. Looking more holistically at Trulicity and Mounjaro together, U.S. revenue for these two products grew 59% in Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022. Moving to Slide 10. Let me share some commentary and context on Mounjaro's performance for the quarter. We are pleased with the positive momentum over the course of Q1 as it means more patients with type 2 diabetes are realizing the substantial benefits of treatment with Mounjaro. While the trajectory of prescription growth shifted following our actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of Mounjaro savings program by type 2 diabetes patients, we have continued to see a positive overall trend. Our focus is on driving new-to-brand growth while continuing to expand access. In Q1, we initiated our first Mounjaro direct-to-consumer TV campaign, and we continue to steadily build access from Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of April 1, access stood at just under 60% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts for Mounjaro in Q1 was just over 55%, up from approximately 40% in Q4 2022. As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescription outside the $25 non-covered co-pay cards but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of the year, we expect continued improvement in access in the proportion of paid scripts and in new-to-brand prescription. On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2023, we invested $2.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned just over $1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $700 million in stock. Slide 12 represents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the revenue guidance range by $900 million to now be in the range of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Since announcing our 2023 financial guidance in December, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most major currencies. We have updated our full year revenue outlook based on recent spot rates. This FX update is driving approximately $650 million of the $900 million increase in our revenue guidance. The remainder of the increase is attributable to underlying business performance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue remains unchanged. In terms of operating expenses, we are increasing the range of marketing, selling and administrative costs by $100 million to reflect our updated exchange rate assumptions. This results in an updated range of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. We are also increasing the range for research and development expenses by $100 million, driven by updated exchange rate assumptions and investments in our late-stage portfolio. This results in an updated R&D range of $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. We have incorporated IP R&D charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of earnings, which totaled $105 million. Consistent with prior quarters, we have not included any IP R&D charges associated with potential or pending business development transactions. Additionally, the recently announced agreements to sell the right of our linsepene portfolio and have not been included in guidance. Each transactions will be factored into our financial guidance after it closes. Other income and expenses and tax rate guidance remain unchanged. Based on these changes, we are raising our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $8.18 to $8.38 per share and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.85. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. Let me start with today's exciting announcement, the positive results for tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III study. Tirzepatide met the co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all prespecified key secondary endpoints. Participants with obesity or overweight and with type 2 diabetes achieved up to 16% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 34 pounds. Additionally, 86% of people taking 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved at least 5% body rate reduction. This was in line with our expectations based on our SURPASS-3 data in a similar population. With this SURMOUNT-2 data, we now have two positive Phase III trials for tirzepatide in obesity, 1 in patients without type 2 diabetes and 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes. We now look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. I'll cover the SURMOUNT-2 results in more detail, but first, let me spend a few minutes providing an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across 8 studies. On Slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for the core SURMOUNT-1 through four studies as well as the more recently announced SURMOUNT-MMO and SURMOUNT-5 studies. Five of the six studies compare efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity, while the most recently posted trial, SURMOUNT-5 compares tirzepatide to 2.4-milligram semaglutide. As a reminder, SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people without type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least 1 comorbidity. And it delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2, which we're reporting today, evaluated treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program and SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. SURMOUNT-5 is an open-label trial that will enroll 700 adults who have obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities without type 2 diabetes and will compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to semaglutide 2.4-milligrams. Finally, SURMOUNT-MMO is our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity. We expect the next two studies, SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 to read out later this year, while SURMOUNT-5 is anticipated to complete in the first half of 2025. SURMOUNT-MMO, as an outcome study, will take several more years to complete. On Slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-2 study where tirzepatide 15-milligram delivered 15.7% mean body weight reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight. With a baseline weight across the study of 222 pounds, tirzepatide treatment led to a mean body weight reduction of 34 pounds on the 15-milligram arm of the study. We're also very pleased to see how well the 10-milligram tirzepatide performed with a 13.4% mean body weight reduction, also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimand. Results for the treatment regimen estimand were similar to the efficacy estimand and are detailed in this morning's SURMOUNT-2 press release. Moving to Slide 15. Tirzepatide achieved the second co-primary endpoint of achieving at least 5% body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2 showed up to 86.4% of patients achieved this level of weight reduction at 72 weeks, again, using the efficacy estimand. This is compared to 30.6% of patients on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Furthermore, over half of all participants in the 15-milligram treatment arm achieved at least 15% weight loss. It has been previously observed in incretin obesity trials that weight loss in a type 2 diabetes population is less than weight loss seen in a non-type 2 diabetes population, a finding consistent with the results we've now reported from the SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2 trials. The average weight reductions reported in the SURMOUNT-2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes range from 7% to 8% less than those seen in SURMOUNT-1, which was an exclusively non-type 2 diabetes population. There are a number of potential mechanisms that may explain this effect, including the weight gain-promoting effects of some classes of anti-hyperglycemic medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving insulin sensitivity with tirzepatide treatment, gender differences between 2 populations and diminished caloric loss effects of glucosuria. These differences manifested as we expected, and the SURMOUNT-2 top line results represent the most robust weight loss seen in a Phase III pharmacological clinical trial consisting entirely of type 2 diabetes patients with obesity or overweight, and we are highly pleased with these results. Moving to Slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-2 study. Tirzepatide was well tolerated in the study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for treatment of obesity. As in SURMOUNT-1 and the SURPASS program, the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related, were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred through dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 3.8% and 7.4% for the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms, respectively, compared to 3.8% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.3% and 13.8% in the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms compared to 14.9% for placebo. We look forward to sharing more data from SURMOUNT-2 at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and to submitting the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Obesity is a widespread and chronic disease in need of more effective treatment options. The FDA Fast Track designation that tirzepatide received for obesity reflects the seriousness of the condition and the substantial unmet medical need. With impressive trial results now in hand for SURMOUNT-2 and SURMOUNT-1 studies, we look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA for tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in the coming weeks. With respect to regulatory action in Europe, as Dave mentioned, we have already completed our submission to the EMA for chronic weight management indication. The EMA submission was initiated based on the results from the SURPASS trial program in type 2 diabetes and the SURMOUNT-1 Phase III trial in obesity. We expect to have a European Commission decision in the first half of 2024. In addition to all the work on tirzepatide for obesity, we also disclosed earlier this month on clinicaltrials.gov the initiation of a bioequivalent study to compare the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide administered using the existing auto-injector device and a new test device. We expect to work on tirzepatide and other injectable incretins for a long time. And we intend to explore different presentations for these medicines to meet our goal of bringing the benefits to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. Moving on from tirzepatide to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 24, and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. Continuing within diabetes and metabolic disease. Earlier this month, we began recruiting for the first Phase III clinical trial for orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 non-peptide agonist. This ACHIEVE-4 trial is an open-label study of orforglipron compared with insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight at increased risk for cardiovascular events. This is the first in what will be a broader series of studies for orforglipron. It is the largest and longest trial in the program, which is why we chose to initiate this trial first. Enrollment is now underway and we expect patient dosing to recur shortly, after which orforglipron will be placed with our Phase III assets on the summary slide. You'll also see we have advanced our Relaxin long-acting molecule to Phase II development for treatment of heart failure. Shifting to immunology. It was a quarter of mixed progress for mirikizumab, our IL-23 P19 inhibitor. We were pleased with the approval in late March in Japan for mirikizumab under the brand name for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. A few days later, we were similarly pleased with the positive CHMP opinion from the EMA. However, regarding mirikizumab's regulatory path in the United States, we announced earlier this month that we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. The letter did not cite any concerns regarding the safety or efficacy profile of mirikizumab but focused exclusively on certain aspects related to the proposed commercial manufacturing of mirikizumab. We remain confident mirikizumab's Phase III data and its potential to help people with ulcerative colitis. We look forward to working with the FDA to address the manufacturing questions in order to achieve our goal of bringing mirikizumab to patients in the U.S. Also in our late phase immunology portfolio, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for lebrikizumab for patients with atopic dermatitis. Moving earlier in our immunology pipeline, during last month's American Academy of Dermatology meeting, we shared data from the single-dose Phase II trial for eltrecabart, our CXCR1/2 antibody in patients with hydroadonitis The data showed good tolerability and clear separation between eltrecabart and placebo, along with a reduction in abscesses and nodules, reflecting reduced disease activity. Lastly, in immunology, we've removed REsPEG-Aldis leukin from our pipeline. In February, following the top line data announcement from the Phase II study in systemic lupus , we informed our partner, Nektar Therapeutics that we do not intend to advance the asset into Phase III development. Moving on to neuroscience. Last month, we announced that our last active solanezumab trial, the antiamyloid in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease study or A4 study did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. The A4 study was conducted through an innovative public-private partnership, and we were thankful for the time and effort of the clinical study staff, participants and study partners. This study formally concludes our clinical development of solanezumab. The A4 results, while disappointing, were not a surprise, given the advancements in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease since the study initiated almost 10 years ago. Solanezumab only targets soluble amyloid beta and does not clear plaque. Denenimab and rimternatug, on the other hand, have been specifically designed to bind to and clear amyloid plaque, and we now understand that substantial plaque clearance is required in order for anti-amyloid drugs to show clinical efficacy. Accordingly, we were pleased to share new data for duninimab and during the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in late March. For denetimab, we shared data from our Trailblazer EXT, a Phase II long-term follow-on study of Trailblazer ALS. While study limitations include a relatively small number of patients, the data showed encouraging trends and the longer-term effects on amyloid and tau levels and clinical progression. We also disclosed the trial design and objective for Trailblazer Phase IIIb study to expand the science and understanding of ARIA in relationship to amyloid lowering through imaging and blood-based biomarkers in different dosing paradigms. This study will leverage enhanced MRI sequences as well as blood-based biomarkers and other patient characteristics that may predict ARIA. And we'll investigate the effect of different dosing regimens on the frequency and severity of ARIA. Of course, we expect the next key milestone for genenumab will be later this quarter when we obtain the results for our confirmatory Phase III TRAILBLAZER ALS 2 trial. We look forward to sharing these results and to advancing the regulatory process for assuming positive data from this trial. This quarter, we also shared the first clinical data from [indiscernible] from a Phase I multiple ascending dose study, which highlighted the potential speed and depth of amyloid plaque lowering in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data on amyloid clearance, safety and tolerability supported our decision to move this asset into Phase III, and we look forward to sharing further updates as the program progresses. You'll also notice we have a number of developments in our early-stage neuroscience portfolio with a Phase II entry for our GBA1 gene therapy asset in the Gaucher disease type 1 indication along with 2 Phase I pain asset entries and 1 Phase II pain asset discontinuation. Shifting now to oncology. Just yesterday, Jaypirca received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. In early March, the FDA approved an expanded indication for Verzenio for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. High-risk patients can now be more easily identified with the removal of the Ki-67 score requirement for patient selection. Moving earlier in our oncology pipeline, we presented data from our Phase I study of our KRASG12C inhibitor as part of the AACR meeting last week. These data show promising efficacy and the potential for a differentiated safety profile in combination with pembrolizumab. We're working on finalizing dose selection for our drug in combination with pembrolizumab. And at AACR, we also showed data from CYCLONE 1, a single-arm unblinded study, which was the first to investigate Verzenio in prostate cancer. This early study informed the design of our CYCLONE 2 adaptive Phase II/III trial, which last year cleared our preset threshold to advance to Phase III and for which we expect to read out as soon as late this year. Q1 was another busy and productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. David Ricks : Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress to start the year. Our core business, which excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, grew 10%, driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. This growth was achieved despite headwinds related to pricing, to generic erosion of Alimta in the U.S. and a moderated but still negative foreign exchange impacts. In the coming quarters, we expect the impact of COVID-19 antibody revenue in the prior periods will ebb, while our new product and growth product categories of medicines will drive continued revenue growth and meaningful operating margin expansion. While the quarter was not without some challenges, which I am confident we'll overcome, we made meaningful advances in our pipeline, including the approval of an expanded label of Verzenio, the first approval of mirikizumab in Japan, submission of tirzepatide for obesity in the EU and positive results from our second Phase III trial for tirzepatide in obesity. We also demonstrated leadership to improve insulin access and affordability for millions of Americans. Lastly, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to both executing on the significant opportunities before us and to continuing the important and often difficult work to discover, develop and bring to market innovative medicines to address some of the greatest areas of unmet medical need. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] We're going to end the call at 11 :15 a.m. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : So question is for Dan. Dan, can you just give us your thoughts on, I guess, what many investors are sort of viewing as the potential Goldilocks scenario that would be necessary to really successfully compete with lucanumab. I'm sure you have your own thoughts on this that are quite detailed. So just wondering how you believe the sort of commercial opportunity and/or really the clinical opportunity is likely to play out once we see the data, assuming the study is positive. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Seamus. I'll start sort of on the data expectations and how it might fit in and maybe Anne will add some things on commercial opportunity. So I think we had very compelling data in Phase II, 32% slowing of disease progression. If in Phase III, we can replicate those kinds of results, this will be a very important and meaningful drug. I know it's interesting for investors to sort of speculate on competition between 2 different pharma companies. It's not exactly how I think about it. I think there's a huge opportunity here for patients. The challenge is not really about competition. It's about how do we help the medical system better identify patients, diagnose them and move them into treatment regimens, of course, requiring reimbursement. I think the two drugs, however, have some important differences. Dunanumab targets specifically amyloid plaques. We think that's the relevant species to hit in Alzheimer's disease. I think we were pretty confident about that in the past, probably the solanezumab data, which targeted just soluble adds even more confidence to that statement. As a result of hitting just amyloid plaques, that allows us to have fixed duration dosing regimens as an option for patients. Let's see how the data turn out. But I expect that many patients will be able to stop dosing even as soon as 12 months. That's a big difference than being prescribed a drug that you might have to take the rest of your life. And I think that could be exciting and important for patients. So lots of ways for donanemab to win. I think the most important thing, though, is showing consistent strong efficacy like we did in Phase II and then getting this drug approved and bringing it to patients. Anne, what do you have? Anne White : Thanks, Dan. Yes, we do remain confident in the mid- and long-term opportunity for donanemab. And I think it's important to remember, it will take time to build this market. And so as Dan said, we're investing in these efforts now, building awareness of diagnostics, the awareness of treatments are coming, making sure that the health care systems are ready for these medicines and that the care pathway is set up, and then most importantly, as you said, that patients have access and reimbursement. And just to echo his comments, I don't think we really think of this as a cost of drugs we need to fight over market share. It's an opportunity to build a new class on behalf of disease, driving awareness, driving diagnosis and then getting access. So that's important to us in the near term. Operator : The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Maybe two part for me. Just I know you're not going to give us a decision on whether you're going to split the tirzepatide brand in two here. But maybe you could just talk through some of the key considerations as you think about kind of access side, pricing, IRA, all those things as you just think about the puts and takes. And then on North Carolina manufacturing, just any update on time lines as to when we can expect that to come on board. David Ricks : Thanks, Terence. I'll go to Mike for those questions on branding strategy considerations and then any update on RTP. Michael Mason : All right. Thanks, Terence, for that question. On the branding question, obviously, yes, we're not going to provide any clarity on that. I think if you look at the kind of pros and cons on 1 versus 2 brands, the pros are, it is a more efficient supply chain and manufacturing for 1 brand, for 2 brands or some access benefits. Also, you have an empty vessel for the commercial promotion of our obesity indication with the 2-brand scenarios. So that's kind of the puts and takes on that part. On the supply, I think maybe I'll answer the overall supply question because I'm sure there may be other questions on there. We talked last year that our focus was to double capacity by the end of this year, and we're progressing toward that goal. Our manufacturing team is working hard every day and directly delivering over our manufacturing plan this year. We believe that our channel inventory for Q2 will be a bit better for what we saw in Q1. And obviously, as you bring up, the important milestone is us bringing our first [indiscernible] brand fully online this year. The manufacturing team is progressing toward that goal. And then long term, we're investing where we need to in order to create a long-term significant supply across our entire incretin portfolio to meet what we think is going to just be a tremendous demand globally for the product and for all our incretin portfolio. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just a 2-parter as well. Can you just maybe talk about bigger picture what you've been seeing in the incretin market? It seems like we first had this nice very strong ramp of Mounjaro, and then we saw a further step-up in category growth with NOVOS capacity issues being resolved. So I guess when you're seeing kind of the underlying demand that's out there, is that changing at all how you think about either investing in the space or just your go-to-market strategy for both Mounjaro and then tirzepatide obesity when that's approved? I'm just trying to get a sense of just are you -- I think we're all surprised by the volume trends, just how you're kind of adapting within Lilly to kind of think about that beyond just the capacity side, more of the investment side. And then the second question for me on Mounjaro is just can you give a quick update of where we stand right now in terms of use in diabetics versus nondiabetics, given the change in the Bridge program. David Ricks : Thanks, Chris, for the 2-parter there. Mike, we'll go to you for the first part around bigger picture in the incretin market and category growth and how we're thinking about that and then the second round, use in patients with diabetes versus none. Michael Mason : Okay. I'll answer the second question first. With our savings card changes as well as our continued focus of our promotion on only for people with type 2 diabetes, for someone to -- for a new patient to come on to Mounjaro, to have a low out-of-pocket cost, they have to have formulary access. We are only contracting for diabetes access for Mounjaro. So at this point, our assumption is that the vast majority of new people who are new to Mounjaro have type 2 diabetes. On the incretin market, yes, it's really growing both across type 2 diabetes. It's really surge as well as on the obesity front. We plan to aggressively promote and offer this product in both disease classes and invest appropriately to the opportunity. We're not surprised by the market growth in type 2 diabetes. We think there's a big opportunity to really help people who have type 2 diabetes early in the course of treatment to improve their long-term health outcomes. And then as the SURMOUNT-2 data demonstrated, there's just a tremendous unmet need in the obesity market. And we're not surprised by Wegovy's uptake after the resupply and relaunch. And I just really think it really points to the tremendous opportunity that we have to really help patients and meet the needs of the marketplace. So really no changes for us. We felt that both markets would have good growth opportunities. We're prepared to be successful and both grow the market and grow our share in type 2 diabetes and then establish ourself in the chronic weight management market. Operator : The next question is coming from Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin Bristow : Congrats on the quarter and the SURMOUNT-2 data. So on Mounjaro, I think it's comforting to see handsome step-up from 4Q. I was wondering, can you help us think about the sort of continued cadence of improvement over the balance of the year? And then more importantly, how should we think about gross to net post approval in obesity? Is it reasonable to expect another kind of step down temporarily? Or would that not be the case? And then just on the Mounjaro and obesity, can you just walk us through the anticipated time lines here and the potential use of a priority review voucher? David Ricks : Okay. Mike, you can go ahead and cover these points kind of general gross to net thoughts and trends and then Colin's question about potential use of a priority review voucher. Michael Mason : Okay, appreciate that. On the gross to net progression for Mounjaro, I think it's best to look at our paid TRxs, which we define as those patients who's not supported by our $25 noncoverage savings program. That was our original program at launch. You see from the slide that Anat presented early on that we have seen just really good growth of the paid TRxs over time. If you take a look at the growth from Q1 versus Q4, it was a 55% growth in paid TRxs. If you look at the point in time of the week before we started the saving card changes to last week, we've increased paid TRx growth by almost 2.5x. So we're very happy with that. That's the trend we need to see to improve gross to net. Now at the same time, we look at kind of what we've defined as unpaid scripts, which is those that are supported by the original $25 noncoverage savings programs, those are decreasing. So really, that's the 2 trends you need to see to lead to improved growth to net of paid scripts increasing and unpaid scripts decreasing. Also, we expect those trends to continue. We also have a milestone coming up at the end of June when the original $25 noncovered savings card are set to expire. With chronic weight management approval, we'll talk about that -- and pricing at the appropriate time after approval. With regards to our submission, chronic weight management, our plan, as Dave said, the team is taking this data right now and working feverishly to submit that in the coming weeks. We do have Fast Track designation from the FDA to expect that -- to expedite it. We have a rolling submission. We already submitted the SURMOUNT-1 data. And we are excited to also talk about that. While we think the FDA will act quickly with the Fast Track designation, we want to remove any uncertainty. And so we will be using a PRV and expect that we'll get approval as early as the end of this year. Operator : The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : First off, congrats on the great data today. Very exciting for patients. Just taking a step back, I'd love to get some color as to how Lilly plans to balance the commercial potential of Mounjaro in both diabetes and obesity with estimates that really could best the top-selling pharmaceutical products now without overstressing the U.S. health care system, especially essentially balancing volume and cost to the system. David Ricks : Thanks, Evan, for the question. Mike, we'll go back to you balancing commercial potential with potential stress to the system. Thoughts? Michael Mason : Yes, it's a good question. And when we look at the opportunity within, let's say the chronic weight management marketplace, it's easy to look at the number of people who live with obesity both in the U.S. and globally, and look at, boy, this could have a big impact on health care costs. But I think if you look more at the real true potential that we focus so much on weight loss, but when you look at not only the -- what does weight loss really provide, there's over 200 complications associated with living with obesity. And as we get more and closer to the marketplace and look at our modeling, we do think that this is going to relieve and reduce the risk of complications associated with obesity, and there will be medical cost savings associated with using these agents, which will, I think, be of great societal value. Also, when you look at the quality of life results that we saw from SURMOUNT-1, they were remarkable. And at times, it's hard to quantify those in a cost-effectiveness model. But in real life, those impact patients significantly. And I think it really does highlight how important these treatments are to people who live with obesity. And so I think as you look at the impact not at like a population level but on a patient level, these agents on tirzepatide will provide great value to society. David Ricks : Yes. Maybe just to add, I think the latest data from the Medicare Trust is that we're spending about $1 trillion a year as a country on obesity-related complications and comorbidities. I don't think we always do a very good job of thinking about buying pharmaceuticals as an investment and future savings in our health. Maybe we do better when it's acute like COVID. I think we spent tens of billions on COVID therapies and didn't question it as much. But here's -- I think even in the most rosy forecast, we're not going to sell $1 trillion of obesity drugs. So the question is more like, over time, can we demonstrate that treatment today reduces cost downstream? We're highly confident that, that will be a multiple of 5x, 10x savings for whatever people invest in the medicines. We have to prove that. That's our job as an innovative company is to do the outcome studies that demonstrate that. I think our competitors are doing the same thing, and that will be good for the field. And as I've said before, it's hard to imagine by the end of this decade that everyone doesn't just accept that pharmacologic treatment for overweight and obesity should be the standard of care, and it will save this health care system trillions of dollars over time. So that's our position and we need to fight for that position. We also need to do the work. And right now, we are talking about weight loss numbers, not outcomes. But that data is coming soon, as early as next year for tirzepatide. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : With and thinking about its safety tolerability profile, I think we have a base level of precedent data that sort of frames expectations for what the ARIA rates are, including last fall when you have the head-to-head for -- where I think there was some relative improvement, recognizing that there's difference in patient populations. Now that you're doing this study, there's aspects of this where you have dosing intervals that include placebo. You also talked about using blood-based biomarkers. Can you help us frame expectations for what would be a meaningful differential? Should we have baseline expectations that reflect more of the prior data? Or is there really room to improve? And when you think about all of these MRI and blood-based biomarkers, how much is this going to be sort of logically natural relative to how patients are cared for? Or is this also going to require some threading in of new ways that patients are managed, which I know that you're investing tremendously in? But just help us with the logic of results from these studies like TB6. David Ricks : Thanks, Chris. That's a lot to unpack in the question, but I'll hand over to Dan for some commentary on TB6. Daniel Skovronsky : No. Thanks, Chris. I'm glad you raised this. It's a topic that we think a lot about. Probably just starting with maybe correcting a misperception in the field around ARIA rates, I think we don't really know what asymptomatic ARIA means is sort of an incidental finding on an advanced brain scan. We don't want to over-index on that. We want to focus on symptomatic ARIA. And symptomatic ARIA rates, that's what the patient experiences is adverse is a range from sort of 5% to 10% or less across the class. We don't understand all the factors that could cause 1 patient of symptomatic ARIA and another patient to have a symptomatic ARIA, which we see is not a problem. That's what we want to understand better in this study. Are there things that we can see on baseline MRIs or on blood biomarkers that might predict who's going to have those symptomatic ARIAs? And then are there adjustments to dosing that you could have in those patients so they can still get the benefit of the drug without getting the symptomatic ARIA? I don't see this as a study where there's a positive outcome or a negative outcome. It's not a binary thing here. What it's going to do is add to our understanding of how best to identify patients and how best to change dosing in patients who have the highest risk that overall, that should lead the field to have more comfort using these drugs, the entire class of drugs probably in more responsible ways. Operator : The next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Geoffrey Meacham : Congrats on the data. Just have a couple of related ones for Dan. On SURMOUNT-4, I know we don't have data yet but are there lessons to be learned commercially about the rebound effect once you discontinue tirzepatide? And just wasn't sure what your thoughts of on continuity of therapy in the real world. And the second one is that when you think about tirzepatide development in other settings like sleep apnea, et cetera, there are a lot of indications that you could still go after but haven't officially announced When you look outside of diabetes or obesity, what is the criteria for selecting tirzepatide development versus, say, the oral versus GGG, et cetera? Geoffrey Meacham : Thanks, Geoff. Okay, I'll start and I'll let Mike follow up on commercial questions here. Starting with your question on SURMOUNT-4, sort of asking what are our expectations and implications of what happens when people come off this drug, I think unfortunately, tirzepatide is probably like every other drug we have, which is requires you to take it to continue to get the benefits. That's the expectation we have for blood pressure drugs and lipid-lowering drugs and probably we should have that for some time for drugs to manage obesity. What does that mean in the real world for patients? My expectation is many patients may try coming off the drug completely to see what happens. Maybe some will be successful in maintaining their weight, but many of them will probably experience some regression of their weight back towards baseline. And this could prompt them to come back on the drug. That's probably natural and we can expect that, although Mike will comment in a second on commercial dynamics. In terms of other indications, we really look at things that could have a big impact via weight loss. There's never been a drug like tirzepatide that can cause this amount of weight loss. So mostly, we're looking through literature on things like bariatric surgery and seeing what kind of benefits that can lead to or diet and exercise. And that's how we've gotten to a few indications that you mentioned, sleep apnea and heart failure, among others. In terms of which drug could be best right now, of course, we have the most confidence around tirzepatide, but there might be some indications where a drug like redatrutide, which adds glucagon and call it GGG, could be better. For example, glucagon has profound effects on fat in the liver, so maybe that plays better for complications of obesity related to liver disease like NASH. Orforglipron, on the other hand, our oral, unlikely to have as much weight loss as profound metabolic improvements as tirzepatide does because it doesn't have any GIP, which is an important constituent of tirzepatide. But on the other hand, the ease of use may make it more applicable to some broader, more primary care indications. So that's a little bit of thinking on how we sort those out. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes. On the commercial side, as we launch into the chronic weight management market for tirzepatide, we'll be very upfront with payers and health care professionals and consumers that this is a chronic disease and a chronic medication that needs to be adhered to long term. When you look at how this product works, one of the most important aspects of it is that it controls and reduces appetite. When someone tries to gain -- to lose weight via diet and exercise, as someone is successful in losing weight, the body actually works against that and tugs it the opposite way by increasing the appetite. That's why these agents, tirzepatide does work because it does reduce the appetite. So while on therapy, we anticipate that the appetite will be lowered and maintained. And then if stopped, then the appetite will increase. Now this is something that unlike most drugs, you don't know if you stop taking like a statin or something else, you don't really feel any effects. We do think that, that will be a noticeable effect that will begin soon after stopping therapy even before you start seeing weight gain. So I think we think that will be an important kind of signal for a patient to understand that this is a chronic disease and needs to be treated long term. As it goes into the -- maybe 1 other aspect on the additional indications, we talk a lot about access and the need for in order to get access into Part D. And obviously, that will be an important thing overarching. But these additional indications are important for the senior population. Complications run with living with obesity, and they emerge into complications when you reach Medicare like type 2 diabetes, like sleep apnea and like heart failure. And so we believe these are important indications to study because we think these are important health conditions. But also commercially, we think this is important because this will help us get access for these really important complications that are really important to the senior population. So commercially, we think these are really important. Thanks for the question. Operator : The next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I have a question on drug pricing, especially as it relates to Mounjaro. A, what's your expectation on net price per patient beyond the first year on Mounjaro? And I realize the compliance as well as maintenance pricing would be considerations. And secondly, in a scenario where Ozempic and Trulicity are in the IRA basket in 2027, should it be our base case that there would not be an impact to the non-Medicare book of business? And would it not impact other members in the class like Mounjaro? I feel like it's not super clear. I'd be curious about your thoughts. David Ricks : Thanks, Mike. I'm sorry. Thanks, Umer. I'll maybe go to Mike for the kind of question about net pricing on Mounjaro and how that might evolve and then also on general commentary around if Ozempic is in the IRA basket, what might the impact be to others. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes. No, good question. I mean, on net pricing, we have 1 price point for Mounjaro. We have flat pricing across the dosing form so people can feel free to find the right dose that works for them at the same price. That will be the same price for new starts, it is for people on maintenance to treatment. David Ricks : Yes. And if I got your question right and just to clarify, it's not clear to us that semaglutide and dulaglutide will be eligible in the same year for IRA, if they're eligible, depending on sales two years prior in the various ways the government is proposing to do this. But let's just play it out if sema is selected because it's a small molecule 9 years from launch, et cetera. What will happen in the commercial market? Nobody knows because in the draft guidance, there really isn't a lot of clarity about how the government proposes to effectuate the so-called maximum fair price to the consumer level. They're entertaining a few ideas, it appears, from their initial guidance. I think we're expecting more regulatory, either definitive regulatory statements or proposals for comment in the coming 90 days, Umer. But I can tell you what we'd prefer is that since we're not a party to that transaction as manufacturers in this example, not us, but someone else, we would probably need a third party to determine, is that a valid Part D prescription? Is it eligible for the maximum fair price? And then to step in and match that transaction up post hoc. We did something like that when the donut hole was created, and it worked pretty well with third-party administrators. This is what we've suggested that the administration will be the best thing. And in that scenario, you would not have a wholesale price reduction to reach the maximum fair price. You would do it after the fact, and I think in that way, be able to keep the two segments, commercial and government a little bit more separate. That has obvious advantage for the industry and probably for payers as well and maybe for patients, creating certainty and lack of arbitrage across physical distribution channels. So to be determined there, but as that detail comes out, we'll have more commentary on it, but ball's in the government's court now. Operator : The next question is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : I wanted to ask some questions about the obesity opportunity in ex U.S. markets because I know it seems like all the discussion is about the U.S. markets. But in your opinion, how will it play out ex U.S. relative to the U.S. when you think about obesity over the longer term? To me, it seems like payers are likely to be much more restrictive ex U.S. with a product like this. Is that a fair characterization? Or do you think low enough pricing will fully offset any sort of hesitation and basically open up the markets equally like it will happen in the U.S.? David Ricks : Thanks, Tim, for the really good question. I'll hand over to Ilya Yuffa, our President of Lilly International to weigh in on that. Ilya Yuffa : Tim, thanks for the question. As we take a look at the chronic weight management market internationally outside the U.S., it's a significant opportunity. We already see significant utilization of current therapies that don't provide as much weight loss and benefit and still providing significant commercial opportunity and also access to patients. A lot of that is happening in many markets out of pocket. At the same time, there are markets that are already moving towards reimbursement, U.K. and other markets in Europe, already looking at ways to reimburse, especially in the higher BMI categories of obesity. And so this will play out over time on both as we look at data and outcomes to drive further an expansion of access. And also, we do foresee a significant out-of-pocket market in many countries, including Asia, South America and Europe as well. And so I think you'll see that grow over time, but significant opportunity to take a look at the total population globally that is obese, overweight, there's a significant opportunity outside of the U.S. for chronic weight management, and we'll look to invest in expanding that both the introduction of Mounjaro tirzepatide in chronic weight management but also improving access over time. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Ilya, and thanks, Tim, for the question. Running low on time, so we'll try to get through as many questions as possible. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : I appreciate that data presentation is key to fully answering the question, but what opportunities are still available to Verzenio in the adjuvant setting now that we have seen the top line of NATALEE? It would be easy to conclude NATALEE is a significant risk to Verzenio adjuvant use and that Verzenio adjuvant use will decline. What other scenarios would you like us to consider? And what aspects of NATALEE would you like to highlight? David Ricks : Thanks, Steve, for the question. I'll hand over to Jake Van Naarden to weigh in on the opportunity. Jacob Van Naarden : I'm not sure I agree with your framing, I'm not sure we agree. The NATALEE success is not really a surprise to us. We said publicly, we expected it to be positive. We frankly thought it would be positive actually at the last interim analysis at the end of last year. Just by way of reminder, we studied Verzenio in the adjuvant setting, given for two years, specifically in a high-risk population, which is a population that we and I think physicians agree is the 1 that really requires intensification of therapy. And now Verzenio is the standard of care in that setting. We don't really expect that to change actually. We have mature follow-up on our data as last presented at San Antonio in December. We have a Category 1 NCCN listing for Verzenio in the setting. I think Verzenio's role in high-risk adjuvant endocrine positive breast cancer is pretty clear. We seem to hear a lot of noise about ribociclib in intermediate risk population, a population that we didn't study, a population for whom I think the risk benefit is a little bit more questionable. And to the extent that the data we see at ASCO provides a role for that drug in that setting, sure. That's fine. That really doesn't pose any threat to the forecasted opportunity for Verzenio in the high-risk setting where we still remain very confident in its prospects. Operator : The next question is coming from David Risinger from SVB Securities. David Risinger : So congrats on all the updates. I just wanted to get your take on NOVOS, Wegovy-SELEcT cardiovascular outcomes trial and potential implications. So I think expectations are that the efficacy could be modest. Could you comment on that scenario and then also comment on the scenario that the trial surprisingly fails? David Ricks : Thanks, Steve. I'll hand over to Dan for a quick update. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Dave. Maybe some of those questions are better addressed to Novo. I think based on passing an interim without stopping early, you can sort of put an upper limit on how good the efficacy could be. But we don't know exactly what that will be. I expect I think most people reasonably expect the trial will be positive. We know that weight loss has so many benefits, including cardiovascular benefits, and that's likely to be demonstrated in a large clinical trial. No idea what the number will be here, the stats or anything like that. But I'll be surprised if weight loss doesn't translate into benefits. We, of course, have our own studies going both in the type 2 and diabetes population and in the obesity population. We'll look forward to those outcomes. Operator : The next question is coming from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry Holford : Two questions, please. First from mirikizumab. Can you provide any more detail on the specific issue the FDA has in manufacturing that when you expect to refile whether you would anticipate a Class 1 or 2 responders and indeed whether you take to launch in the U.S. this year. Secondly, a question for Anat on [indiscernible]. So you've announced two divestments here in quick succession. Just interested to see, is there anything specifically driving this? Are there any additional noncore assets that you're seeking to monetize? And then as you divest your priorities for the use of cash? Clearly expecting to say internal R&D investments. But I'm wondering, too, if we can expect any more external R&D investment. David Ricks : Maybe in the interest of time, since we have just a couple of minutes, let's focus on the first question, and we can connect with IR on the second questions afterwards. So mirikizumab update, I hand over to Patrick for that. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Kerry. As Dan stated earlier, the CRL did not cite their concerns in regards to the clinical profile of miri, but only certain aspects of the proposed commercial manufacturing process. And generally, we don't disclose the details about timing of our interactions with the FDA. But I can say that we are working very closely together with the FDA today to address the questions and also discussing the details of the next steps to understand the time line. But we remain very confident to launch miri as first-in-class in ulcerative colitis also in the U.S. In the meantime, I'm extremely happy with the launch of the approval in and a positive opinion by the European regulatory body. And we are looking forward to launches outside the U.S. as early as late Q2. Joe Fletcher : Paul, maybe time for 1 last question, so maybe send through the last -- 1 last question from the queue. Operator : The last question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Congrats, again. Just a question on long-term capacity for Mounjaro. I know you are trying to thinking about doubling this year, but longer term, you have talked about double of Trulicity. If you look at consensus numbers or what Street is projecting, even that may not be enough. So how are you thinking about increasing the capacity in the longer term for Mounjaro? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mohit. I'll hand it to Dave for that question, and then we'll round out. Dave Ricks : Okay. I'll go right to wrap-up after that. Thanks for the question. Obviously, key. Right now, we have the unique situation of having a product so useful, we can't make enough of it really. And I think when we expand the label, it will continue to put pressure on that. I suspect this whole category will have supply pressure for some time. We're basically in an all-of-the-above moment here in terms of investing in capacity and thinking of alternative ways to expand use and make this -- fulfill the need that's out there. So we've made certain announcements we've talked about the RTP site this year. Our sister site in North Carolina, really the following year beginning to produce, that's of equivalent size. We've also made additional capacity investments in the original RTP site, which will expand the numbers further. And then today, we're talking about other delivery systems that could be providing even more capacity available for global demand fulfillment. So we're on a road map here that we're excited about in the endpoint. I think we'll probably all be a little more frustrated and impatient in the short term with the rate of expansion. But rest assured, the line is going up into the right at a pretty steep angle in terms of our volume and output, and we expect that to continue for several years to come. So working hard on this problem, happy with the progress, need to make more progress, and we've got plans to do that from here. I'll also just close that comment by just punctuating a little bit the importance of the orforglipron program in terms of meeting -- fully meeting the demand that could be something like hundreds of millions of patients per year, oral solid. We know the globe has massive capacity. It's cheaper and easier to make, and that product has a lot of promise clinically but also significant profits in terms of addressing needs, particularly middle-income markets in China and other very large opportunities. And with that, let me close the call today, and thank you all for participating in this earnings call once again and your interest in Lilly and what we're doing. It's been an eventful and productive start to 2023, and we -- as we execute on our innovation rate strategy and bring all these new medicines to patients. I want to thank you again for dialing in. And please follow up with the IR team. I know we didn't get all the questions today. And if you have additional questions, please give them a call today. Have a great one, and we'll talk again soon. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn over the call to Dave. David Ricks : Thanks, Joe. In the second quarter, Lilly's momentum continued. We advanced our R&D pipeline, progressed our ambitious manufacturing agenda and delivered strong financial results. Our business saw an acceleration of revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. As base period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue and Alimta's loss of exclusivity recede, we do expect strong growth to continue in the quarters ahead. Lilly has made substantial progress in advancing our pipeline of innovative medicines in recent years, but the past few months have been particularly noteworthy. In early May, we shared the top line results of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, which showed donanemab treatment slowed clinical decline in Alzheimer's by 35%. While differences in enrollment criteria and study design make cross-trial comparisons difficult, this represents the greatest percentage cognitive slowing in a primary end point of any disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatment reported to date, and the only Phase II to Phase III replication to date. Three weeks ago at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we shared the detailed results, including new analysis, which demonstrates the potential of even greater cognitive slowing in patients in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease. At the ADA scientific sessions in June, we shared positive Phase II data on 2 next-generation diabetes and obesity product candidates : orforglipron and retatrutide. And less than 2 weeks ago, we shared top line results from the SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 Phase III trials, which showed participants on tirzepatide following intensive lifestyle intervention or with continued tirzepatide treatment, achieved up to 26.6% mean weight loss. Dan will share more perspectives in his R&D update on these and other exciting areas of pipeline progress. Moving to our results. You can see on Slide 4 the continued progress made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from the sales of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, Q2 revenue grew 22% on 23% volume growth. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, which leads our new products category. That category also includes Jaypirca and now Omvoh, which saw its first sales in Japan in Q2 and launched in Germany in July. In the second quarter of this year, new products and growth products categories combined contributed approximately 26 percentage points of volume growth. These products, coupled with potential upcoming launches, solidify Lilly's strong growth profile through this decade. We've had several important pipeline updates since our Q1 earnings call. For mirikizumab, approval in the EU and resubmission of our U.S. application with regulatory action expected by the end of this year. Regulatory submissions in the U.S. for tirzepatide for chronic weight management; regulatory submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA following the positive Phase III results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial; and positive Phase III top line readouts for SURMOUNT-3 and 4 in the third and fourth global studies evaluating tirzepatide in chronic weight management. The second quarter also was productive for business development. We've commented in the past on our active exploration and pursuit of external innovation and are pleased to have announced agreements to acquire 2 clinical-stage companies in the second quarter : DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio. These companies operate in different therapeutic areas, and each is a fit with Lilly's strategy. We also closed the sale of global rights to Baqsimi, and the financial impact of this transaction is reflected in our Q2 results. After quarter end, we closed the sale of rights to our olanzapine portfolio, which will be reflected in our Q3 financial results. Both these transactions are now incorporated into our updated 2023 financial guidance. We continued to progress the most ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda in the 147 history of our company. We're happy to share that commercial production to support our incretin portfolio has begun at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. Beyond the capacity expansion that will come as we ramp production at this site, we're also pursuing other near-term paths to expand access to our incretins to patients around the world. Anat will provide more detail on these efforts. And finally, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends this quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we're sharing today. So without further ado, I'll turn this over to Anat to share our Q2 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments today on non-GAAP performance. In Q2, revenue increased 28% versus Q2 of 2022. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from COVID-19 antibodies in the base period, revenue increased 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This acceleration on revenue growth was achieved despite lingering headwinds from Alimta's loss of exclusivity in the United States, which occurred in the first half of last year, and the effects of which should normalize going forward. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was flat in Q2 at 79.8%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from product mix, including onetime revenue from the sales of rights to Baqsimi, which was offset by increases in manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and our investments in capacity expansion. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 18%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming new product launches and additional indications. R&D expenses increased 32%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research. This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $97 million or $0.09 of EPS. In Q2 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $440 million or $0.46 of EPS. Operating income increased 69% in Q2 driven by higher revenue, including revenue associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi and lower IPR&D charges, partially offset by higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 27% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 115 basis points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges.  Our Q2 effective tax rate was 16.1%. This represents an increase of 190 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 driven by the impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime in the sales of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.11 in Q2, a 69% increase versus Q2 of 2022, inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue increased 41%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi, U.S. revenue grew 30% driven by robust growth from Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 2% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamics. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by low single digits, consistent with prior trends.  As I mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we expect Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics to have an even greater effect on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of this year.  Europe continued its growth trajectory with revenue in Q2 up 6% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 12% in the second quarter. For Japan, Q2 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as we continue to see robust growth in our newer medicine, led by Verzenio, and to a lesser extent, Jardiance, Olumiant and Mounjaro, the last of which launched in Japan in April.  Moving to China. Revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth only minimally offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We are pleased to see our China business return to growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 19% in constant currency as volume growth of 20% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.  Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you may recall on our Q1 earnings call, we simplified the categorization of our products with a focus on 2 categories : new products and growth products. As you can see, the new and growth categories combined contributed 26 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. The volume growth for all others category was driven by the sale of rights to Baqsimi. The lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a milder headwind to growth in Q2 compared to Q1 and will continue to be a modest impact to prior year comparisons.  Slide 10 provides additional perspectives across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 57% in Q2 as OUS volume grew 82%, while U.S. volume grew 47%. Jardiance also continued its strong performance with worldwide sales growth of 45% for the quarter. There have been 2 notable regulatory approval for Jardiance in the last 2 months. In June, the FDA approved Jardiance for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in children 10 years and older, making Jardiance the first and only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for this patient population. And in late July, Jardiance was approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease. After almost a decade on the market, Jardiance continues to demonstrate its importance to patients across a number of cardiorenal metabolic conditions.  Trulicity performance has held up well in a growing and dynamic incretin market. In Q2, we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline by 5% as modest volume growth was more than offset by price erosion. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to initiate patients on Trulicity. We remain confident that Trulicity will continue to be an important option for HCPs and patients in years to come.  Moving to Slide 11. I will share some perspective on Mounjaro's performance. We continue to be pleased with the strong momentum of Mounjaro as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro's revenue in the U.S. grew to $960 million for the quarter. In Q2, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro, and access reached 73% on July 1 for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts from Mounjaro in Q2 was approximately 67%, up from approximately 55% in Q1. As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 noncovered co-pay card but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay card program expired in June 30, we would expect the proportion of paid script next quarter to be 100% under this definition.  Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect continued growth in new-to-brand prescription as well as ongoing improvement in access.  Lastly, regarding the demand and supply outlook for incretin. We're pleased that commercial production has started at our RTP site in North Carolina. Even as we ramp up capacity at RTP, we believe supply will likely remain tight in the coming months and quarters due to significant demand.  Given the expected global demand for tirzepatide, as we mentioned on previous earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentations to bring tirzepatide to more patients faster. To this end, we initiated a bioequivalent study in early April for a multi-dose quick pen device. In many OUS markets, we expect to launch tirzepatide first in valve form later this year and transition to a multi-dose quick pen as approved and available in these markets starting in 2024. The launch of the valve and quick pen presentations for tirzepatide will leverage existing manufacturing assets and capacity. We're excited about the opportunity to expand the number of people we can help in the short term and long term with these additional options.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first 6 months of 2023, we invested $5.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we returned nearly $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 3 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Given the strong performance in our underlying business as well as revenue from the sales of rights for Baqsimi and olanzapine, we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance by $2.2 billion to a range of $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of this increase is driven by business development activities, including the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi, while the remainder reflects strong underlying business performance.  Our updated FX assumptions based on recent spot rates are listed and represents a de minimis impact to the updated guidance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue has increased to approximately 80% driven by the sales of rights for Baqsimi and our olanzapine portfolio.  We're also increasing the range of operating expense guidance for the year. Marketing, selling and administrative costs are now expected to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with the increase driven by additional investments in recent launches in preparation for launches of new medicine and line extensions expected later this year.  The range for research and development expenses has been increased to $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion, reflecting positive dynamics across our portfolio, including success in events in our early-stage assets, positive enrollment trends in our late-stage studies, broadening of the clinical program for next-generation incretin, and expected incremental expenses from business development activities.  We have incorporated IPR&D charges that have been incurred through Q2 2023, which totaled $202 million. Other income and expense and tax rate guidance have also been updated. OID is now expected to be between $0 million and $100 million in income, up from prior guidance of $100 million to $200 million in expense. We've also increased our estimated effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%, up from approximately 13%, reflecting the impact of the sales of rights for our olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi.  Based on these changes, we have raised our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share and raised our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. It's been a productive and busy few months for Lilly R&D. Since our last earnings call, we've had a few major readouts across our therapeutic areas, and we've announced several business development transactions. Let me start with the data that we shared in June at the American Diabetes Association. We presented over 40 abstracts across our portfolio and shared data during 2 ADA-sponsored symposia. The first was for the Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-2 study of tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight in type 2 diabetes, which was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And the second symposium was for the results from 2 Phase II trials of retatrutide, our GIP/GLP glucagon tri-agonist in adults with obesity and overweight as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. The retatrutide results in obesity and type 2 diabetes were simultaneously published in New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet, respectively. We also shared an oral presentation on our Phase II trial results for orforglipron, our once-daily, non-peptide oral GLP-1 in adults with obesity or overweight. These results were simultaneously published in New England Journal. We also presented results from a Phase II trial of orforglipron in patients with type 2 diabetes, and these were published in the Lancet. Clearly, we're proud of all of this data in diabetes and obesity portfolio. Since we discussed the top line data for SURMOUNT-2 tirzepatide trial during our last earnings call, I'll focus my updates today on the Phase II data shared for orforglipron and retatrutide, starting with orforglipron on Slide 14. The orforglipron presentation highlighted safety and efficacy data across 6 dose arms in our Phase II study in obesity. With an overall mean body weight at baseline of 109 kilograms, orforglipron demonstrated an average of up to 14.7% body weight reduction at 36 weeks. At the second highest dose tested in the study, 75% of participants reached a weight reduction goal of 10% or more. We also shared data showing a dose-dependent decrease in systolic blood pressure and an overall improvement in lipid levels. The most common adverse events were GI-related and generally occurred earlier in the trial during the titration phase and were mostly mild to moderate. While we've not yet shared the dosing details for our Phase III studies, these Phase II results have informed our approach on dose escalation. We also presented data at ADA from a similar Phase II study of orforglipron in people with type 2 diabetes, the results of which are highlighted on Slide 15. Orforglipron demonstrated a mean reduction in hemoglobin A1c at 26 weeks of up to 2.1%, and over 90% of participants on the highest 3 doses achieved A1c levels less than 7%. We initiated Phase III trials for orforglipron in both obesity and type 2 diabetes in the second quarter, and we look forward to those results in 2025. For retatrutide, the full results of 2 Phase II trials were presented during an ADA-sponsored symposium, which discussed efficacy and safety in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. There's also a segment of the symposium focused on liver fat and NASH-related biomarker data in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which showed relative liver fat reduction of over 80% at 24 weeks for the is doses. Slide 16 highlights key results from the obesity Phase II trial in which retatrutide met the primary end point at 24 weeks, demonstrating mean weight reduction up to 17.5%. The safety profile of retatrutide was similar to other incretin-based therapies. In a secondary end point of weight reduction at 48 weeks, participants treated with the highest dose of retatrutide demonstrated a mean rate -- weight reduction up to 24.2% or almost 58 pounds on average. If confirmed in registrational trials, we believe that magnitude of mean weight reduction would represent a new high watermark for weight loss from a pharmacologic agent at this time point. It's also worth noting that the Phase II retatrutide trial in obesity was well balanced between genders with females representing just under half of all participants in the trial. This was intentional and is atypical for incretin clinical trials in obesity, which often have a higher proportion of female participants, a subgroup that typically experiences greater weight loss than males. Indeed, in the retatrutide Phase II obesity trial, the mean change in body weight for female participants at the highest dose was 28.5%. Given these encouraging results, we moved rapidly to initiate the Triumph Phase III program, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of retatrutide for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea and knee osteoarthritis in people with overweight and obesity. These 4 Phase III trials will each run between 68 and 80 weeks. The trajectory of weight loss seen in the Phase II study reinforces our belief that retatrutide can potentially represent a further improvement and additional option for patients seeking pharmacological treatment for obesity and its complications. While retatrutide's Phase II results in obesity garnered much attention at ADA, the Phase II results in patients with type 2 diabetes are also very encouraging with participants receiving retatrutide achieving a hemoglobin A1c reduction of up to 2% on average in addition to meaningful levels of weight loss. I'm pleased to share that we plan to advance retatrutide into Phase III for type 2 diabetes. Moving to tirzepatide on Slide 17. We were delighted to announce in late July that SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 trials of tirzepatide in obesity met all primary and key secondary objectives. In key secondary objectives for both these studies, participants achieved similar mean weight reduction, 26.6% in SURMOUNT-3 and 26.0% in SURMOUNT-4. While these 2 trials were not required for our chronic weight management submission to the FDA, they provide important additional information regarding the role tirzepatide plays in maintaining or adding to the weight loss achieved with either intensive lifestyle intervention or pharmacotherapy in adults living with obesity or overweight. SURMOUNT-3 evaluated tirzepatide following an intensive lifestyle modification program and demonstrated that even in people who have a weight loss response to lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide provides significant additional weight loss. SURMOUNT-4 was a randomized withdrawal study in which all participants received tirzepatide for a 36-week lead-in period, at which point, half the participants were switched to placebo and the other half continued treatment with tirzepatide. This study demonstrated that those participants who continued on tirzepatide experienced continued weight loss, while those who switched to placebo started to regain weight. These data reinforce our understanding that obesity is a complex chronic disease for which multiple treatment approaches, including lifestyle modification and effective medications, are needed. We believe tirzepatide is well positioned to be one such treatment option. Accordingly, we submitted an application for tirzepatide for chronic weight management to the FDA during Q2. The FDA granted this application priority review designation, and we anticipate FDA action by year-end. Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 4, and Slide 19 shows potential key events for the year. I've covered the major updates in diabetes, including the advancement of orforglipron and retatrutide into Phase III since our learning -- last earnings call. Turning then to our neuroscience portfolio. 3 weeks ago with the AIC meeting in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we were excited to share the detailed results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, highlighting donanemab's robust efficacy profile across a number of new analyses that reinforce our belief in the medicine's ability to meaningfully slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, especially in patients earlier in disease progression. We cover the results in some detail during our AIC investor call so I won't cover that again, except to note that we submitted donanemab to the FDA and to the EMA for approval, and we look forward to FDA action before the end of this year. Shifting to oncology. Launch progress continues with Jaypirca and mantle cell lymphoma, and we are pleased to have the detailed chronic lymphocytic leukemia results from the BRUIN Phase I/II trial published in New England Journal in early July. Following the discussion with the FDA, we've now submitted an application for accelerated approval for Jaypirca in CLL patients previously treated with both a covalent BTK inhibitor and venetoclax based on the results from the BRUIN Phase I/II study. We expect FDA action by year-end. Also during the quarter, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for pirtobrutinib for patients with MCL. We continue to study pirtobrutinib in multiple Phase III trials and look forward to the results from the BRUIN 321 trial in CLL, which we now expect to see before the end of this year, and it has been added to our key events slide. In other oncology developments, at ASCO in June, we presented new data from the Verzenio monarchE trial in high-risk early breast cancer. For the first time, we showed data demonstrating the efficacy of the medicine in this setting is not compromised when patients undergo dose reductions. We believe that the ability to manage Verzenio's side effects while preserving efficacy could be very important to ensuring that patients complete their 2 years of therapy. This is an emerging part of Verzenio's differentiation in this class. We're also very excited about last week's announcement regarding the randomized trial of Retevmo in treatment-naive RET fusion-positive lung cancer. As we communicated in the press release, this randomized trial was declared successful on its primary end point of progression-free survival, the first time any targeted therapy in lung cancer has ever shown superiority to a PD-1 plus chemotherapy regimen. While we remain disappointed by the low levels of genomic profiling done at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, we're hopeful that these data will continue to advance the practice of genomic-driven medicine. We look forward to sharing the full results of the study at an upcoming medical meeting. In our earlier-stage oncology portfolio, the combination experiment of our KRAS G12C inhibitor with pembrolizumab continues to mature nicely. And we're now working to initiate Phase III trials in first-line G12C-mutated lung cancer in the next 6 to 9 months. More broadly, we're excited to see the overall progress of our oncology portfolio. In addition to last week's Retevmo announcement, we expect another 7 randomized trial readouts in 4 to 6 new first-in-human trials across small molecules and biologics in oncology over the next 12 months. With the acquisition of Loxo Oncology 4 years ago, we catalyzed a change in the strategy and direction of oncology at Lilly, and we're seeing the fruits of these efforts. Finally, in immunology, we have several updates related to mirikizumab. A Digestive Disease Week in May, we presented new analyses from the Phase III LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 studies, demonstrating that remission of key symptoms of ulcerative colitis, including bowel urgency, was associated with significant improvement in the quality-of-life assessment in adults with UC. In Q2, we launched mirikizumab marketed as Omvoh in Japan as a treatment for adults with moderately to severe active UC. In late May, we received approval for Onvio in the EU and have subsequently launched Omvoh in Germany and planned additional launches in the EU later this year. In the U.S., we've resubmitted our application to the FDA. We now expect regulatory action by the end of this year. For lebrikizumab, our IL-13 monoclonal antibody under regulatory review for atopic dermatitis, we presented a new secondary analysis at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference in May. This post-hoc analysis demonstrated improvement or clearance of face or hand dermatitis in adult and adolescent patients treated with lebrikizumab. These are parts of the body that are highly visible and for which dermatitis can be particularly burdensome and stigmatizing. We expect regulatory action for lebrikizumab in both the U.S. and EU later this year. Together with Almirall, our development and commercialization partner in Europe, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, we're pleased in May to have the detailed results from our Phase IIa study of peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis published in the New England Journal. These data were first presented as a late-breaking abstract at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in late 2022 and represent the first clinical evidence that's stimulating the endogenous PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be an effective approach to treat rheumatologic disease. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for Lilly R&D with important progress in each of our therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. David Ricks : Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the second quarter. This quarter saw an acceleration of revenue growth as our recently launched product portfolio gathers momentum. Excluding COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi revenue, we grew 22% driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The quarter also saw a continuation of investment in our future growth in our manufacturing expansion, in late-stage medicines, in early phase capabilities and in business development. Notwithstanding these long-term investments, we continue to expect our revenue will grow more rapidly than our expense base in the coming years and see significant opportunity for margin expansion. We also achieved meaningful advances in our near-term pipeline with positive phase -- positive top line results, detailed data disclosures and submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA, and completion of the tirzepatide submission in chronic weight management, alongside positive top line results from 2 more Phase III trials for the SURMOUNT program. We also shared data from 4 mid-stage clinical trials for orforglipron and retatrutide and initiated Phase III trials for both assets. Lastly, we announced several targeted business development moves intended to bolster our early- and mid-stage portfolio and our R&D capabilities, and we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions]. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : Just wanted to ask you about the Novo SELECT study that came out this morning. What kind of read-throughs do you see for the industry? And do you think it will help improve reimbursement for obesity/overweight drugs? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Louis. We'll go to Mike for that question on the recent SELECT news. Michael Mason : Thanks, Louise. I assume we probably would get a question on the SELECT trial, and thanks for starting out the call with that. The SELECT trial read out as we expected. I think the results are great for the anti-obesity medication class. It should really support access for any payers who are on the fence of whether they should add anti-obesity medications or not. I think importantly, it should turn the conversation of the benefits of weight loss away from aesthetics and more toward the health benefit of people living with obesity. When you look overall, there are 236 obesity-related health complications. To name a few, obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by 243%, coronary heart disease by 69%, hypertension by 113%, dyslipidemia by 74%. The overall cost of obesity-rated complications and comorbidities are massive, accounting for $370 billion in direct medical cost, over $1 trillion in indirect annual costs in the U.S. People living with obesity or overweight drive 2.7 greater health care costs than normal-weight individuals. The global health stakeholders really need to be moved beyond the debate and really move to action on the AOM class. With tirzepatide's potential to provide over 20% weight loss, it should provide great value for payers. We have a comprehensive real-world evidence plan and clinical plan to demonstrate tirzepatide's value, including our MMO OUTCOMES trial. Based on the SELECT trial results, we can't wait to see the results of tirzepatide/MMO study. We do believe that additional weight loss will matter. This is a fantastic day for people living with obesity. Now do I think most payers will adopt AOMs overnight because of SELECT trial? I don't think so. I think, as I said earlier, those who are on the fence, this will push them over. But I think it is an important milestone in a long-term goal to get broad access for anti-obesity medications. Operator : The next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : I know that we're a year into the , but I wanted to get a view of persistent rates. The question is, are you seeing drug holidays after weight loss troughs? And I wasn't sure if there were differences between diabetes and obesity indications at this point just with regard to duration of use. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Geoff. I'll go back to Mike for that question on persistence rates of Mounjaro. Michael Mason : Okay. Geoff, thanks for your question. Right now, we only market Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. So the only end-market real-world persistency rates that we have are for Mounjaro in type 2 diabetes patients. What we do know is that people living with type 2 diabetes have had good experiences with Mounjaro. In the first launch, like at the first phase of launch before we've made savings card and experienced supply spot outages, type 2 diabetes patients to Mounjaro did have better persistency than Trulicity, which is important because Trulicity historically has had the best compliance in the diabetes market. So we're confident in the experiences that people who use Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes have. And we're excited to see what that will be for people living with product weight management when and if we get approved by the FDA. Operator : The next question is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : So just going back to SELECT, a commonly held view is that positive results benefits every company in the category. And that's our view as well. But of course, Novo will be able to make the claim for quite some time that they're the only drug to have a proven cardiovascular benefit. So could that actually give them a big commercial advantage in the marketplace on things like payer coverage that would actually be to Lilly's detriment? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim. I'll go back to Mike for that question, a follow-up on SELECT. Michael Mason : No, it's a good question. I don't think that will be the case. What we've seen is payers opt into the class, not a particular drug. So I don't think that will give them a differential impact within payer access. I think commercially, typically, health care professionals when they see results like this, it really helps the class more than any one individual product. Operator : The next question is coming from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry Holford : On the guidance, please, on OpEx. So clearly, operating costs higher than at least, the market anticipated in Q2. And you are now guiding to spend more on SG&A R&D through this year. So I'm just interested to learn more about what has changed through this quarter to continue to raise that OpEx outlook versus your previous record. Can you elaborate on the key drivers of that, please? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Kerry, for the question. And yes, we'll go to Anat with that commentary on the OpEx guide and additional context. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Kerry, for the questions. So we have raised, you're right, both SG&A guidance as well as R&D. The SG&A increases are primarily as a result of continued investment in the upcoming launches we have yet this year. As we're seeing the opportunities, we're excited to divest efficiently behind these opportunities and make them a reality for patients and for Lilly. On the R&D side, Dan provided a robust outline of the progress we've seen in our pipeline. And there are really, I would say, 3 to 4 key drivers of that increase. One is additional new studies that we've announced primarily in Phase III. And you mean the broadening of the investments we're making in our incretin portfolio, initiating multiple Phase III studies for both orforglipron and retatrutide and announcing new studies, coupled with continued advancement. We're seeing great success in our early-stage pipeline and we're investing behind that. We're also seeing continued success in our enrollment rates for currently for our Phase III program. So that's continued to enroll well. And then the 3 business development transactions, the inbound that we've announced, are now going to be incorporated in our second half R&D run rate. So all these combined are the drivers of the increase this year. So they represent really a tremendous opportunity for continued investments in a very successful pipeline. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Can you just walk through expectations for Mounjaro volumes and ASP as you move through 3Q and 4Q just given the change in the patient assistance program on June 30 as well as the North Carolina facility coming online? I guess, specifically, I was just wondering, do the IQVIA scripts we're now seeing largely reflect the change to the patient assistant program? And then should we expect volumes from North Carolina to be a meaningful contributor to capacity this year? Or is that more 2024? Joe Fletcher : Was close to multiple questions there, Chris. But let me hand over to Mike to provide expectations on Mounjaro volume and gross-to-net dynamics as we move in the second half, given the RTP news, and then also given the changes to the co-pay program at the end of June. Mike? Michael Mason : Chris, thanks for those questions. Yes, we did make the change in the $25 savings, program did expire at the end of June 30. So anything that you see in IQVIA is post that change. And you'll see that volume of those individuals who were using an uncovered plan no longer in our trends. We were very happy with what we saw with Mounjaro-pay TRxes in the quarter as they grew nearly 60% in the quarter. As we go forward, we'll -- our manufacturing team is working on bringing on new capacity at North Carolina and then a few more areas. And as that production comes on and ramps up, we will see some benefit from that supply. I mean, ultimately, that will help build inventories up and help eliminate any spot outage that we see. In the short term, because we're seeing really unprecedented demand, we do still expect to see tight supply and some spot outages on Mounjaro through the end of the year. But I think ultimately as that manufacturing capacity ramps up, we will be out of the spot outages that we see. But in the next couple of months and quarters, I think we'll still see tightened [indiscernible]. Operator : The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : I was just wondering if you could provide any perspective on how you're thinking about the potential for a single brand, for Mounjaro, or a split brand ahead of the potential FDA action on the obesity indication? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Terence. Mike, I'll hand that over to you for commentary on single brand versus multiple brands for tirzepatide. Michael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. We're evaluating all alternatives, and we'll announce our decision at approval. Operator : The next question is coming from Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin Bristow : Congrats on the quarter. I heard the sort of positive commentary regarding the commercial supply coming online RTP. And just as we think about '24, how likely is it or what do you foresee in terms of supply potentially capping the sales potential in '24? And is the decision to move forward with the vials and multi-dose pen in any way related to delays at the RTP side? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Colin. I'm going to hand to Anat to talk a little bit about the RTP commercial supply and supply dynamics in the near term. Anat Ashkenazi : Colin, so let me first start with the end of your question on -- just to clarify RTP. So RTP is now live and producing for commercial purposes, and it's on line, in line with our expectations. So there are no delays. It's progressing as we had expected. I'm incredibly proud of the work that the manufacturing team have done to get us to this point. As Mike alluded, there will be a gradual increase in available capacity coming out of that site. We've mentioned in the past, it's a large site with multiple lines. They'll come online gradually and provide more products into the marketplace. As we think about 2024, I suggest we step back and look comprehensively at our manufacturing agenda and capacity plans. So RTP is one side. It's obviously of high interest just because of the proximal nature, and that's the first one that's launched out of the number of sites we have under construction. In parallel, we have been working and continue to work to expand capacity in existing sites. We're working with partners and CMOs to supplement capacity. And our strategy is, first and foremost, to have an internal build but then we supplement externally as needed. But we're also progressing with -- rapidly with our site in North -- the second site, North Carolina in Concord, which you recall we've announced last year. And that could potentially go live in terms of production in the second half of 2024, again, gradually. So we will see some relief of supply at the end of -- or towards the end of next year and then continue to grow from there. And as you know, this is -- these are not the only 2 nodes of capacity. We're also adding outside of incretin and for incretin, API capacity in Ireland as well as 2 large sites in Indiana. So we're expanding capacity broadly to support both the incretin portfolio but then the broader Lilly portfolio, and managing a broad set of networks outside of Lilly. So a complex manufacturing set of nodes that we're working towards. We'll comment on -- specifically on 2024 when we provide guidance in terms of what you should expect in revenue. But this is how you should think about the gradual increase in supply with both RTP, internal capacity elsewhere as well as CMOs. The additional presentation is meant to provide options for patients. And as we've said, we'll start launching outside the U.S. with these presentations will -- which should provide additional capacity as well. And as I stated earlier, the manufacturing facilities in line already exists within Lilly for, for example, the vial production. We have those facilities. We don't need to construct new ones. So that provides us with the option to start with these as early as the end of this year and then going into next year. Operator : The next question is coming from Steve Scala from Cowen. Stephen Scala : How should we think about the MACE reduction powering in SURMOUNT MMO now that we have the SELECT results? SURMOUNT MMO likely won't be as robust given the population studied, but would Lilly consider a win something half of SELECT's 20% MACE reduction? Or would that be viewed as disappointing? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Steve. I'll hand over to Dan for that. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Steve, for your provocative question here. Actually, of course, we expect tirzepatide to show a very important benefit, I think, on the MMO study. There are several important differences as you're alluding to. I think for the most part, though, they run in the opposite direction as you're suggesting, which would indicate a potential for an even larger effect size for SURMOUNT MMO. The most important difference is the drug itself. Remember that tirzepatide is a GLP/GIP coagonist, and GIP has some very significant benefits on weight loss and metabolic health overall. We've seen that in a number of different trials and confirm that with some interesting experiments on GIP monotherapy as well. So given the properties of this drug, given the level of weight loss we've seen in previous trials, given the important effects on blood pressure, on lipid profiles and on other biomarkers that indicate lower cardiovascular risk, we should be very confident in the large effect size coming out of the MMO study. There are some differences in the population. Our study includes both primary and secondary cardiovascular risk population. We also have a different primary end point, although, of course, we have the MACE as a secondary end point. Our primary includes 2 other events related to cardiovascular risk. Other than that, I would say that many of the patient characteristics are going to be quite similar. Our study is obviously much earlier. And as an event-driven study, it's going to take some time to read out. I think you were also asking about what would be considered a victory here, and I think we'll just sort of wait and see the data and understand it as it comes but no reason to expect anything less than what we're seeing today. Operator : Next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : I wanted to zoom in on orforglipron and specifically on the case of liver enzymes, above 5x and a case above 10x as well as the treatment-emergent hepatobiliary disorders. I know the slides mentioned safety was similar to other incretins. And my question is, is your opinion on liver safety driven by the fact that these liver enzymes self-resolved? Or is it some preclinical data like the GSS ad hoc formation, et cetera? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Umer, for the question. I'll hand over to Dan for that question on orforglipron liver dynamics. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, thanks for the question. Of course, there's been more attention on liver safety for orforglipron following the competitor announcement from Pfizer on 1 of their 2 oral GLP-1s. So we don't see any read-through from that. But of course, we've looked very carefully at liver safety. Maybe just starting at a high level, if you look at the supplementary data from the journal publication or you can see in the obese population that in terms of group averages, there's actually an improvement on liver enzymes with treatment of orforglipron. That's not surprising. We know that disease obesity is characterized in many patients by excess liver fat, which can cause inflammation and liver abnormalities. And when you reverse that, you see an improvement in liver function. Of course, when people come off the drug, they could get fat in their liver again and liver enzymes could go up. What we saw in this trial were a couple of patients scattered across arms, including placebo with excursions and liver enzymes, as you point out to -- I think there was one patient, with a bit of a higher excursion in liver enzymes on orforglipron that returned to normal levels while maintaining on therapy. That's generally not a pattern that we see in drugs that cause liver injury. But surely in Phase III, we'll keep an eye open for all possible safety consequences. I think I frequently caution investors on all of our molecules that Phase III is really the place where you can get surprised by any new safety findings. So we'll be watching liver safety closely, but not with any particularly heightened concern versus other adverse events that we'll also be watching carefully. This is a new molecule. This is the first time that we're exposing large, large numbers of patients to it for many years -- or many, many months, I should say, and we'll be monitoring safety carefully. Operator : The next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. David Risinger : So my question is for Dan, please. How are you thinking about whether future orthogonal mechanism weight-loss drugs can deliver the cardiovascular outcomes of incretins even if they match weight loss on a pound-for-pound basis? Joe Fletcher : Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, David. It's a very good question, of course, particularly today. We think we understand how the biomarkers from incretin therapy translate into cardiovascular benefits. Some of those biomarkers should be translatable to other mechanisms. But depending on how orthogonal those other mechanisms are, there could still be some uncertainty. One, I think, important understanding, though, is that obesity itself, including, I think, particularly where the fat is deposited in the body, so for example, virtual fat, particularly, is -- contributes to adverse health outcomes, including adverse cardiovascular outcomes. And therefore, reversing that should provide cardiovascular benefits across mechanisms. But obviously, when we get to orthogonal mechanisms, each one will need its own data to demonstrate that. Recently, our focus has been on mechanisms that could stack on top of incretin therapy to give additional benefits in which case there could be a good read-through from the incretin trough. Thanks, David. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Trulicity and Mounjaro, can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? In particular, are you seeing switching? Just trying to get a sense for how you're seeing the supply and then the revenue dynamic. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Mike to talk about Trulicity and Mounjaro, and any switching dynamics or observations we have. Mike? Michael Mason : Yes. No, good question. Obviously, it's something we've taken a look at since the launch. Really haven't seen any trend breaks in what we've seen and how much of Trulicity is being converted over to Mounjaro. We've seen about 13% to 14% of patients coming on to Mounjaro come on from Trulicity. So really no changes from what we've seen at launch. Overall, our goal is to grow the entire Lilly incretin franchise, and we did that well in Q2 by growing revenue by over 58%. So we're pleased where we're at with the -- with our Lilly incretin pipeline, our portfolio, and are excited to grow it further in quarters to come. Operator : The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Congrats. I have a comment and a question, a comment from an associate that Lilly needs to have two calls, one for Mounjaro and one for everything else. So my question is -- the question is basically, how should we think about long-term supply now that the success of CV trial would likely spur more demand here? I know in the past, you talked about double of Trulicity eventually, but how should we think about the eventual supply of Mounjaro and Trulicity combined? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mohit. We'll take your comment under advisement. It's a fair point. To your question on long-term supply, I'll maybe hand back to Anat to talk a little bit more about manufacturing dynamics and plans. Anat Ashkenazi : Yes. So Mohit, I would echo a few of the things I said earlier. I outlined the expansion we are going to be seeing in our manufacturing footprint across our portfolio. So it's not just to support the incretin portfolio. But certainly with the RTP site in North Carolina and Concord, they're both for -- to support our incretin portfolio. They're both large sites. We did not provide the specific quantities, but we said that once RTP comes online by the end of the year, we expect to double capacity from where we were last year. So just use that kind of as a reference point. Trulicity and Mounjaro as you know are -- both utilize the same auto-injector. So they run on the same platform. And these lines are interchangeable, which allows us to manage production plans across our sites based on where we want or need to produce a product or market demand, et cetera. So we're going to be expanding our internal footprint to support the incretin portfolio as well as continue to leverage external partners to supplement that capacity. Operator : The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO. Evan Seigerman : I'm going to ask one on donanemab to shake it up a little bit. So in submitting for donanemab full approval, are there any nuances that you needed to discuss with the agency following the CRL earlier this year? Or does FDA have everything that they need based on the data that we saw last month? Anne White : So much for the question on donanemab. And just to refresh Evan's memory, we have submitted accelerated approval submission, which was designated as a priority review. We did receive a CRL just based really on wanting more exposure. So it's a pretty simple request. Our resubmission with TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, the Phase III study, which certainly fulfilled any expectations on the CRL. And those good news, I think going through the accelerated approval, the FDA had the chance to review all of the aspects of the submission, preclinical manufacturing and others. So I would say we feel pretty confident at this point about the quality of our submission. And they've accepted that. They're reviewing it for traditional approval. So as we've said, we expect action by the end of the year. Operator : The next question is coming from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : I guess I have a big-picture question. So you're in payer discussions right now ahead of approval for weight loss from Mounjaro. For those payers that are not willing to cover, not on the fence, what do they need to see as you expect the cadence of supply versus access to shift in 5 years? Can you give us a sense of what that looks like and what they really need to see? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Robyn. I'll hand over to Mike. It sounds like the question is more around kind of payer discussions longer term and for those that are more maybe reticent, what might eventually move some of these payers. Mike, do you want to comment? Michael Mason : Yes. I think there's a couple of dynamics that will play out. I mean, first of all, we need to build a long-term clinical and real-world evidence to support payers' decisions, and we're doing that. We're spending literally billions of dollars in clinical evidence to show what tirzepatide and our pipeline can offer patients who have obesity and payers with regards to medical cost savings. We're confident in our modeling that payers will see medical cost offset with tirzepatide. And so I think that will be an important piece of it. I think the other dynamic is a lot of times, we focus on the clinical story. But there is things beyond the economic analysis that I think will play a role. If you go and really discuss with people who live with obesity, improving their health is a top personal goal. Sadly, when we look at the data, 82% people live with obesity experience physical functioning reductions, while 77% experience reduced mental, emotional well-being. Patients using tirzepatide showed significant improvements in physical, mental and emotional well-being in the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And it's clear from the patient testimonies that we had in our SURMOUNT clinical trials that tirzepatide can meaningfully improve the lives of people with obesity. The massive interest that we see in obesity medications is really driven by the fundamental desire for people living with obesity to improve their health. People live with obesity should have a loud and powerful voice in this debate. And I think that's going to be a big component of payer decisions, whether that be an employer or be state or federal government. And so I think what you're going to see is over time, you're going to see data like the SELECT data, data like MMO or other clinical trials, continuing to build the case on economic side for these. While you're going to see the voice of people living with obesity who really want a better life, more hope for the future, who will be demanding access for these agents. And I think both over time, we'll continue to build access across the U.S. as well as globally. Operator : The next question is coming from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : A non-Mounjaro and non-donanemab question coming up. We estimate there's about $2 billion of Dupixent in the U.S. from adults with atopic dermatitis. When you are thinking about the launch of lebrikizumab, given the relatively little clinical differentiation, and therefore, the need to displace the Dupixent, could you just comment on how you're thinking about the launch? I'm assuming similar to Wegovy or [indiscernible] to some similar to Mounjaro or [indiscernible], the obvious thing would be to launch a very, very large bridge program in order to secure formulary access, tapping into that high-deductible patient population. Just interested in your thoughts here, please. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Andrew, for diversifying the question set. I'll hand over to Patrik, President of Lilly Immunology, to weigh in on lebrikizumab and how we're thinking about positioning. Patrik? Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much for the question on lebrikizumab. Now based upon the data we have seen, we realized it's not a head-to-head, but we're extremely encouraged by the maintenance data, having more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at week 16 and maintaining it at week 52. We really believe that we are positioned to launch a first-line biologic that actually has less frequent dosing than Dupixent. So that's a big differentiator and targeting the most relevant cytokine for atopic dermatitis, being IL-13 with a slow rate and high potency. From an access perspective, we see we have atopic dermatitis market growing significantly. And we know that payers are looking forward to options here. So we are believing but PBMs are willing to enter into discussions to enable a rapid access of lebrikizumab. And of course, here, we can capitalize on the strong footprint we have in dermatology and the portfolio we currently have in immunology. And our strategy will entirely focus on value and the differentiation with our medicine and what it brings to the marketplace for atopic dermatitis. Operator : The next question is coming from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : I appreciate all the color on the manufacturing side. At the same time, Anat, a lot of those sites you talked about, those were sort of in your plans to start the year. So I guess my question is, as we think about sort of the derisking of orforglipron, the move to Phase III, has that in any way changed your sort of expected build-out for your longer-term manufacturing needs and really on the peptide side of the incretin side? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Carter. Great question. I think Dave wants to maybe jump in on this one. David Ricks : Yes. Sure. I'll jump in. I mean, just as we think about this over the long term, first of all, versus where we started the year, there is one change we're talking about today, which are these new presentations that we'll be launching beginning even this year into next year. It's important for people to know that the constraint we experience now is in the parenteral auto-injector space. So to the degree we move outside of that, using our multi-dose pen that's currently developed for insulin and we're redeveloping for tirzepatide or certainly the vial, which is quite accessible and high-volume systems available, we'll be able to make more than we had planned previously, just to be clear. That's on top of sort of an on-schedule expansion at RTP in the other North Carolina site as well as other internal nodes of capacity. So I think that's good news for Mounjaro. That all said, for the prior questions here, will that be enough to meet demand? I'm not so sure. So while the volume is moving up into the right, we need more. And does like today's news, will only expand the opportunity. So you're right to point out that other molecules, in orforglipron in particular, could play a big role in meeting global demand for obesity treatment and all the related complications because it's a completely different technology in that it's using oral solid, and there's quite a bit of capacity around the globe for that. Orforglipron is a complicated molecule to make. It's got many steps. But it puts us in using a different set of assets and processes than the current ones we're using. So that's an important program, particularly for global access and availability over the long term. Just to remember as well, 2 years ago, we were probably treating 10 million people globally with incretins. And the WHO is estimating there'll be 1 billion people with obesity and related conditions by 2050, I believe. So a long way away from getting all the way to that. We need things like orforglipron to work for us to meet the needs of all the patients in the world. Operator : The next question is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Trung Huynh : Just one on IRA. So one of the components that's been implemented in the part -- is the Part D redesign that starts impacting in '24, and then there's going to be some more meaningful changes in '25. On our calculations, we think it should benefit products under $25,000 a year, like your GLP-1 portfolio, but a negative for drugs priced above $25,000 a year. So given the mix of products you have in your portfolio at various different price points, directionally, how do you see that impacting earnings in the next few years? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Trung. I'm going to hand to Anat for that comment -- for that response on the IRA and potential impacts. Anat Ashkenazi : Yes. So if we -- I think you were referring to the Part D redesign associated with removing the coverage gap, but I'll also mention the negotiation. I wouldn't necessarily look at what the dollar amount is. But rather, you're right, there are going to be varying degrees of impact on products based on how quickly they move through the catastrophic phase. So just to give an example from Lilly. If you're thinking about an oncology product where patients get to the catastrophic phase very quickly, there is probably an additional cost associated with that for us moving from the previous 70% coverage gap to the 10% participation in the initial phase and then 20% in the catastrophic phase. For other indications, it might be the opposite. So there is a mix there. But then important to think about the fact that given that patients are now going to have a limit of out-of-pocket when they get to the pharmacy counter, hopefully, that should improve adherence and compliance to medications, which should drive, obviously, better health outcomes for these patients, but also as we're thinking about medication kind of adherence. So there's going to be some pushes and pulls of that part of the IRA. The more significant one that I would refer to is the so-called negotiation that we have as part of that, that's going to come later in 2026 and 2028 with the first cohort of products to be announced this year. I think that could have quite a meaningful impact on the drugs that are going to be negotiated in terms of the price discounts that the government is going to arrive at as part of that process. Operator : The last question is a follow-up from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry Holford : Just a quick one on Verzenio. Just interested to see whether you can tender from a proportion of those drug sales now are represented by use in the early breast cancer setting. And given we've now seen the Kisqali NATALEE data at ASCO, just interested to hear how you're thinking about competition coming into that space? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Kerry. All right, I'm going to hand over to Jake for that last question on Verzenio and the proportion of sales in early breast versus metastatic and maybe some commentary on NATALEE. Jake? Jake Van Naarden : Yes. Thanks for the question. So I'll answer the proportion of sales really on new patients or NBRx. TRx is sort of a lagging indicator, of course, that takes into account iterations of therapy. But what we're seeing on the NBRx side is about, call it, between 30% and 45% of prescriptions are in early breast cancer versus metastatic. And obviously, that number bounces around sort of week-to-week, month-to-month. So that's more or less in line with what we expected. So that's what's happening there. On the competitive dynamics in the adjuvant setting, now that we've seen the NATALEE data from Kisqali at ASCO, which by the way, were not really surprising to us, I think when you take a step back, and this is sort of both our opinion as well as what we've heard from thought leaders, we just really don't see what the Kisqali 3-year regimen is giving to patients to justify the additional year of therapy relative to the 2-year regimen that we've offered patients with Verzenio. Obviously, cross-trial comparisons notwithstanding, if anything, you see a marginally larger effect size with the 2-year Verzenio regimen in high-risk patients, obviously, the NATALEE study studied a larger population. The node-negative patients are at lower risk and frankly, not part of our indication. We didn't study those patients. I think to the extent that folks want to use Kisqali there, that's not really our business. Maybe it could be beneficial for those patients, I can't really say. I think the other thing, and Dan mentioned this in the prepared remarks, is that there's been a lot of talk in the past, of course, about the differences in the tolerability of these two agents. And I think one of the things that perhaps was somewhat surprising in the data we saw at ASCO with the high rate of discontinuations for toxicity of Kisqali, especially with many patients still on therapy. So that number, of course, will go up with more follow-up. So I think these 2 drugs, while they have different tolerability profiles in terms of what the side effects are, they actually have somewhat similar overall tolerance profiles. And importantly, the Verzenio tolerability can actually be managed with dose reductions without sacrificing efficacy. It's not clear that the same is true for Kisqali given the nature of those adverse events. So we continue to feel really good about what Verzenio can offer to patients and its competitive profile in the marketplace, and that's been validated by -- in talks with prescribing physicians. So we continue to feel good, and we just got to make sure that all the patients who can benefit from the medicine know that it's out there for them. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Jake. Dave?

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Good morning. Thanks everybody for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes and obesity; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn over the call to Dave. David Ricks : Thanks, Joe. In Q3 Lily continued the progress we made so far this year. We delivered strong financial results continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invested in our future through several business development transactions. As you can see on slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 24%. Our new products and growth products combined contributed approximately 17 percentage points toward volume growth, with over 12 percentage points coming from our growth products.  Last week, we announced that the FDA approved Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This marks Lilly's first approval in the U.S. for a type of inflammatory bowel disease. And it's important for Lilly's growth in its immunology portfolio. In addition to the FDA approval for Omvoh, we had several other important pipeline updates since our last earnings call.  Specifically Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, at risk of progression. And we reported positive Phase 3 results from the VIVID-1 trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for lebrikizumab based on inspection findings at a third party manufacturer. The letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package, the safety or the label. We will continue to work with the third party manufacturer and the FDA to address the findings to make lebrikizumab available to patients as quickly as possible.  In terms of business development, we once again had a very active quarter. In Q3, we completed the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, which will further enable us to focus on our current and new product launches. The financial impact of this transaction is reflected in the Q3 results. Additionally, within the quarter, we completed the acquisition of two clinical stage companies, adding to our Phase 2 portfolio, DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio as well as the acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics and Sigilon Therapeutics. We also announced that we reached an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma, which, if approved, has the potential to expand our oncology capabilities into next generation radioligand therapies. And lastly, we distributed over a $1 billion in dividends this quarter.  On slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 call, including several important regulatory clinical and other updates we're sharing today. Now let me turn the call over Anat to review our Q3 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance.  We're pleased with the strong financial performance this quarter, highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, representing robust momentum in our core business. Q3 revenue increased 37% versus Q3 2022. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and from the COVID-19 antibodies, revenue increased 24% in Q3. This represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration of revenue growth, driven by Mounjaro and the continued strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 81.7%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, the absence of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q3 2023, and higher realized prices partially offset by increases in manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with new product launches and additional indications, as well as compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 34%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late stage assets and additional investments in early stage research.  This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $2.98 billion, which negatively impacted EPS by $3.29. In Q3, 2022, acquired IP R&D charges totaled $62 million, or $0.06 of EPS. Operating income decreased 71% in Q3, driven by acquired IP R&D charges, partially offset by higher revenue associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio. Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 6% for the quarter, and reflected a negative impact of approximately 31 percentage point attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our q3 effective tax rate was 84.6%. This represents an increase of approximately 74 percentage points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IP R&D charges incurred this quarter.  Other than the impact of acquired IP R&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously providing guidance. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $0.10 in Q3, a 95% decrease versus Q3 2022, inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and a negative impact of $3.29 from the acquired IP R&D charges.  On slide 8, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter U.S. revenue increased 21%. When excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 32% driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 13% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro, access and savings cards dynamics.  Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected Mounjaro access and saving card dynamics to have a meaningful impact on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of 2023, which was evident in Q3. Europe continued to post robust growth against this again this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine divestiture, revenue was up 7% in constant currency driven by volume growth of 11% primarily from Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz.  For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased 16% in constant currency. Excluding Mounjaro, which had a one time upfront payment associated with the sales collaboration agreement in the base period, revenue in Japan decreased 3% in constant currency, driven primarily by customer buying patterns related to [indiscernible]. Moving to China revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth of 25% partially offset by price decline. Volume growth in Q3 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We're encouraged by the growth we have seen this year in China.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 23% in constant currency, as volume growth of 28% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see the new product and growth product categories combined, contributed approximately 17 percentage points of rolling growth for the quarter. The absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a headwind of nearly six percentage points to volume in Q3. This headwind will abate as COVID-19 antibody sales were minimal after the third quarter of 2022.  Lastly, revenue from the sales of rights to the olanzapine portfolio delivered nearly 22 percentage points of growth this quarter. Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 68% in Q3, driven by robust volume growth. The continued positive momentum is driven by the early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 22% for the quarter. As you heard earlier in Q3 Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression. In Q3 we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline 10% as volume growth in the U.S. was more than offset by lower prices driven by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in both periods, as well as unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to healthcare professionals, now [ph] to start new patients on Trulicity.  Moving to slide 11, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of Mounjaro, as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro revenue grew to just over $1.4 billion globally this quarter, up from $980 million the previous quarter. In Q3, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro. As of October 1 access for patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. reached 78% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 85% access for commercial patients. This expanded access gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes.  As communicated last quarter, since the $25 non-covered copay card program expires on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. As a reminder we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 non-covered copay card, but inclusive of the $25 covered copay card. We expect Mounjaro net price will continue to benefit from the higher percentage of paid prescription, but will also continue to face a headwind for more rebated volume as access improves.  Looking forward to the end of the year with increased access we expect to continue to see overall growth in prescription trends. In terms of Mounjaro supply, we're continuing to make progress in our manufacturing expansion agenda. Given strong demand, we continue to experience tight supply throughout most of Q3, which impacted results for the quarter. Most recently U.S. product shipments have increased and inventory levels at U.S. wholesalers have improved with all doses of Mounjaro now listed as available on the FDA shortage website.  While supply constraints have eased in the U.S., outside the U.S. Trulicity and -- outside the U.S. to Trulicity and Mounjaro supply remains tight, which materially impacted performance in these regions. With device assembly online at RTP, we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling capacity by the end of this year from where we were a year ago, and are gradually increasing production each quarter.  We're also continuing to focus on other parts of the supply chain, as demand is expected to remain high and production bottlenecks may shift over time. As we mentioned in last quarter's earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentation of Mounjaro to reach more patients around the world faster. We have launched with a single dose vial in Australia, and plan to launch in other markets outside the U.S. in the coming weeks and months.  The introduction of a single dose vial presentation in these geographies is intended to serve as a bridge to a multi-dose quick pen, which we expect will be available starting in 2024. We're also preparing for potential launch of tirzepatide for obesity in the U.S. this year. Our auto injector capacity and output continues to increase. And we look forward to bring tirzepatide to more patients in the months and years ahead.  On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested nearly $12 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we've returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 13 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Guidance for the first four line items including revenue, gross margin percent, marketing and selling and administrative expenses and R&D expense is unchanged. I would note that we are trending towards the higher end of our estimates for gross margin and the top end of our ranges for operating expense categories. You'll see that we've updated guidance for acquired IP R&D charges, OID, tax rate EPS, to reflect the inclusion of IP R&D charges for completed transactions through Q3, and year-to-date results on equity investments and GAAP guidance. These updates do not include the effect of potential charges associated with pending or future business development transactions after Q3. We will provide our initial 2024 guidance when we report Q4 results. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks Anat. This quarter, we had significant pipeline progress as well as a high volume of activity at the major medical congresses, where we presented new data on multiple products across all of our therapeutic areas.  Starting with oncology, since our last earnings call, we announced top line results from the LIBRETTO-531 study evaluating Retevmo versus physicians' choice of multi kinase inhibitors as an initial treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer. As we presented at ESMO the study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 72% improvement in progression-free survival compared to Cabozantinib or Vandetanib. These data should establish Retevmo as the standard of care for the initial systemic treatment of patients with progressive advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and we have work to do to ensure that all of these patients are identified and properly diagnosed.  We also shared detailed data from the Phase 3 LIBRETTO-431 study at ESMO in October, showing that Retevmo more than doubled progression free survival compared to chemotherapy plus Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer. We hope these data in addition to others recently published, for other driver positive lung cancers will help accelerate genomic profiling at lung cancer diagnosis to guide initial treatment selection.  The results of LIBRETTO-531 and of LIBRETTO-431 were each simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Also at ESMO we should landmark five year results from a pre-planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 monarchE study, evaluating Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy, compared to endocrine therapy alone, in patients with HR positive HER2 negative no positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. The impact of two years of Verzenio treatment is observed well beyond the treatment period, reducing the risk of long term recurrence by 32% at five years.  These data reinforced two years of Verzenio plus endocrine therapy as the standard of care for high risk early breast cancer patients. Lastly, we shared data on imlunestrant, our oral SERD being studied in Phase 3 as a single agent and in combination therapy. The data shared included the first clinical data for imlunestrant in combination with everolimus or alpelisib as well as updated monotherapy from the Phase 1 EMBER study in patients with ER positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer.  We hope that imlunestrant could be an important future endocrine therapy backbone, in certain settings of breast cancer. And these new data show that the medicine can be safely combined with other agents utilized with endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer.  Looking earlier in oncology pipeline, we shared preclinical data on three of our new pipeline agents at the triple meeting on molecular targets in cancer therapeutics in October. We shared preclinical data for first, a highly potent inhibitor of KRAS G12D, that is selective against wild type KRAS. Second, a highly potent and isoform selective pan-KRAS inhibitor, with activity against a broad spectrum of the most common activating KRAS mutations, and high selectivity of a wild type H RES and N RES. And third, a fully human monoclonal anti-Nectin-4 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor. These programs are among the next slate of oncology agents we expect to enter the clinic over the next year. They represent years of focused work to create potentially differentiated molecules against exacting target product profiles.  Turning to our diabetes and obesity portfolio, in Q3, we announced the FDA approval of Jardiance for treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression. In the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase 3 trial Jardiance significantly reduced the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular deaths in adults with CKD. This approval adds to the treatment options for the more than 35 million adults in the U.S. affected by chronic kidney disease.  Since our last earnings call, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-3 Phase 3 clinical trial at the obesity weight conference in October, with the results simultaneously published in Nature Medicine. Also in October, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-4 study at EASD. These results will be subsequently published in a top tier peer reviewed medical journal.  Data from these Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide showed that participants achieved up to 26.6% total mean weight loss. The detailed results from these studies clearly show the importance of continued therapy for sustained weight management, and that if approved, tirzepatide could be an important part of obesity management, for those having difficulty maintaining weight loss with diet and exercise alone.  Our pipeline, as shown on slide 14, now includes a high dose tirzepatide NILEX in Phase 2, since we have initiated a study exploring higher doses of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Earlier in the pipeline, we presented Phase 1 data on Muvalaplin at the European Society of Cardiology Congress with simultaneous publication in JAMA [ph]. Muvalaplin is the first oral agent specifically developed to lower Lp(a) levels. In this Phase 1 study Muvalaplin was well tolerated by participants and resulted in dose dependent lowering of Lp(a) of up to 65%. Muvalaplin is currently in Phase 2.  As shown on slide 14, we've advanced our SCAP siRNA into Phase 1 for NASH. We've also completed our acquisition of Versanis and NASH Bimagrumab [ph] in Phase 2. We are excited about the potential combination of Bimagrumab and tirzepatide.  Lastly, we're happy to share that since our last earnings call the Retatrutide TRIUMPH Phase 3 core registration trials are now all actively enrolling to pursue simultaneous indications for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea, and knee osteoarthritis. Turning to our neuroscience portfolio, the FDA has shared with us that the Donanemab review will extend into Q1 2024 needing additional time to complete their review. We've completed submissions in Europe and Japan, and submissions to other global regulatory authorities are either completed or underway. Recently, at the clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease meeting, we presented new insights from donanemab development program during a symposium session.  As part of this symposium, we shared ARIA data from a pooled analysis that included more than 2000 participants dosed with donanemab, and explored ARIA E association across a number of baseline variables, highlighting a few key factors most strongly associated with ARIA risk, including baseline amyloid levels, evidence of a prior bleed and high blood pressure. Interestingly, this data also suggested use of antihypertensives decreased the risk of ARIA. Additionally, we shared analyses from our open label addendum of over 1,000 patients treated with donanemab. These results included a post hoc analysis of patients with no brain tau, and demonstrated similar or even stronger biomarker results than our main TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. In a separate post hoc analysis from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 study, related to activities of daily living and independence, in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease we showed that compared to placebo, people treated with donanemab preserved more of their ability to perform many of the items measured, including their ability to make meals, to use appliances, keep appointments, perform pastimes, and be safely left unattended.  We also shared an update on our validation data for our Plasma P tau 217 test for identifying amyloid positive patients demonstrating robust performance of this immunoassay. We expect to have this test commercially available in a phased approach first, as a laboratory developed test by the end of this year. As you recall, we use Plasma P tau 207 to identify pre symptomatic individuals for our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial. This is an event driven trial and we have now recruited a sufficient number of qualifying pre-symptomatic participants and expect to have efficacy results within three years. We're excited to announce today that our Otoferlin Gene therapy asset from Akouos has begun dosing patients in a Phase 1/2 trial for hearing loss.  In immunology, as Dave noted, we're happy to have FDA approval for Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This approval offers new hope for patients, who are searching for an effective option that can offer rapid and lasting improvements. Omvoh will be approved --available to patients in the U.S. in the coming weeks. We were also excited to have the Phase 3 readout for this molecule, mirikizumab in Crohn's disease. In the VIVID 1 Phase 3 study mirikizumab met the co-primary in all major secondary endpoints compared to placebo. Mirikizumab demonstrated clinical remission and endoscopic response for patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease through 52 weeks. We were thrilled to see that more than half of participants on mirikizumab achieved clinical remission at one year, and that robust efficacy was seen in both participants who are naive to biologic therapy, as well as participants who previously failed a prior biologic therapy.  Helping patients achieve long term clinical remission is a key goal for us in our pursuit of treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. These new data in Crohn's Disease build on the high levels of long term remission seen with mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis, and help reinforce the differentiation of this important potential medicine. This successful Phase 3 trial will be the basis of global regulatory submissions for Crohn's Disease.  As Dave noted earlier in Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for lebrikizumab, based on findings at a third party manufacturer. In Q3 we completed the acquisition of DICE and now reflect the two oral IL-17 assets, DICE 853 and DICE 806 in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our pipeline respectively. Additionally, two new molecules began Phase 2 studies in immunology this quarter. First, our CD200R monoclonal antibody, known as Ucenprubart for atopic dermatitis, and second, our RIPK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis.  We've removed our BTLA monoclonal antibody agonist from Phase 2 in our pipeline, after the Phase 2a study failed to demonstrate efficacy. Q3 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. David Ricks : Thank you, Dan. Before we get to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the third quarter. This quarter revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum, of course led by Mounjaro. Excluding revenue from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and the sale of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, revenue grew 24%, driven again by Mounjaro, Verzenio as well as Jardiance. By continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late stage medicines and early phase capabilities as well as in business development, we are confident that we have positioned ourselves for growth now and in the coming years, with the opportunity for continued margin expansion. We achieved meaningful advances in our late stage pipeline, with the FDA approval of Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, as well as Jardiance for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, and the positive Phase 3 VIVID 1 results for mirikizumab for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.  Looking forward, we are expecting regulatory responses before the end of the year on our submissions for pirtobrutinib, and accelerated approval in CLL as well as tirzepatide for obesity. In Q3, we completed several targeted acquisitions, intended to bolster our early and mid stage portfolio. Directly following the quarter we also announced an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma which will further expand our R&D capabilities in oncology. Lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. A few weeks ago, we announced several leadership changes. Mike Mason, our Executive Vice President and President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity will retire from the company at the end of 2023 after 34 years with Lilly. In his current role, Mike is overseeing tirzepatide, late stage development and an unprecedented type 2 diabetes launch. Mike leaves behind an enduring legacy that reflects his deep compassion for patients and his commitment to our people. With this being Mike's last earnings call, I would like to thank him for his many years of outstanding service to Lily and wish him all the best in his next chapter of life.  Patrick Johnson will assume leadership of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity. In addition to his current responsibilities as President of Lilly USA Dan Skovronsk, our Chief Scientific Officer and president of Lilly Research Labs will take on the additional role of President of Lilly Immunology from Patrick. And in a related move, David Hyman is assuming the role of Chief Medical Officer for the company from Dan, overseeing the full Lilly portfolio. Leigh Ann Pusey, our Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs and Communications has decided to leave the company at the end of 2023. Leigh Ann has left a lasting impact on Lilly and the patients we serve. And we're grateful for her many contributions over the past six years.  So as we begin this new chapter of growth for our company, we are very confident that our deep experience of our leadership team will allow us to continue to accelerate our efforts to make medicines and be more effective and more innovative in the years ahead.  So now, let me turn the call over to Joe and he'll moderate the Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. So consistent with last quarter we will respond to one question per caller. So ask that you limit to one question per caller. As we'll aim to end the call at 10 am. If you have more than one question you can reenter the queue, and we'll get to your question if time allows. So Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and we're ready for the first caller. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live? Timothy Anderson : Thank you so much. I have a question on obesity and persistence on therapy, which I think has been a big question mark. I know you haven't formally launched yet, but guessing you might have some idea, a best guess if nothing else. So in your view is this going to be like most other drug categories where persistence on therapy is often low? I think the rule of thumb is that at the one year mark 50% of patients drop off chronic medicines.  So really, the question is, if you took 100 patients who start on one of these contemporary obesity drugs, how many of that initial 100 would likely still be on therapy, let's say three or four or five years down the road. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim. Mike, you would you like to weigh in on the persistence of therapy on obesity? Michael Mason : Yeah, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll first answer with the data that we do have, because it's hard to speculate on what it's going to be for obesity. The best data we have for tirzepatide is in Type 2 diabetes patients who started Mounjaro prior to our savings card changes last fall Mounjaro persistency for those patients is tracking higher than those patients that were started on trulicity and Ozempic, over that same period of time.  So while it's too early to project the average length of therapy or how many out of 100 will still be on therapy after a couple of years, I think that this early data is encouraging. As for obesity, time was time was going to tell. I think we've all looked at Wegovy data, but I don't think this is the right benchmark at this point because of novel supply constraints. And there's been just a very dynamic market. I think, as you said, this -- having persistency on a chronic treatment isn't just an issue for anti-obesity medications. It's a goal for all chronic treatments.  I think what's different about obesity is that, on many chronic treatments, consumers don't feel differently or experience any acute impacts from stopping treatments. So what we've seen in this SURMOUNT clinical trials, with tirzepatide is that some consumers will feel their appetite increase and experience weight regain when they stopped tirzepatide. And so this should help reinforce treatment adherence, seeing in our market research how important it is for people who live with obesity to lose weight and maintain it.  I do think you're going to see just a high motivation as people have lost weight that they do want to maintain it. And we do know for our SURMOUNT program that, chronic use of tirzepatide is a good component, an important component of maintaining weight loss. So it's too early to project it. But I do think there's things that's rolling in favor of tirzepatide having a good length of therapy in the obesity patient. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. Next question, Paul. Operator : The next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live. Seamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks so much for the question. So I really wanted to drill into orforglipron, and those Phase 3 programs. Dan, I was just hoping that you could clarify for the market, if there's any monitoring in that study related to liver enzyme elevations. I think there was one case in the Phase 2 diabetes study that you conducted. Just wanted to know if there's any related concerns associated with that. Or if this is kind of as expected, an all hands on deck moving forward opportunity. Thanks. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Seamus. Yeah, I like the way you phrase it all hands on deck moving forward on orforglipron. We're really excited about this molecule. In terms of, liver safety, I think we commented before that, what we saw in Phase 2 is what we thought would be probably be typical for a trial of that nature in this population.  So not a heightened level of concern, but always concerned about safety going into Phase 3 from a variety of factors, including for all small molecules, especially liver function. So it's routine in our Phase 3 studies across the portfolio to monitor liver function. And sure we're doing that in orforglipron, but not aware of any special precautions there. So super excited that that program is going fast. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dan. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terrence, your line is live. Terence Flynn : Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Anat you had mentioned shifting the date of your 2024 guidance call early next year. Just want to know what drove that change? And if you can assure us that there are no issues with tirzepatide OBC review and/or manufacturing? Thank you. Anat Ashkenazi : Sure. So let me first start with reassuring you that there are no issues behind our decision to move the guidance date to -- or have it aligned with our Q4 earnings call. What it does do is it does help us have the yearend full results when we provide guidance for 2024. So previously, if we didn't have that, investors had to look at guidance range for the year and estimates based on midpoint, etc. This does enable us to close the year and then have a full view into 2024. It is aligned with our internal planning processes as well. And obviously is the way most companies and I believe all companies in our industry do that. So nothing unique going into that other than just having the full data set for 2023, going into that other than just having the full data set for 2023. Joe Fletcher : Thank you Anat. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit your line is live. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And my question is regarding the P documents [ph], seven biomarker data you have shown at CTAD. It seems like the predictability is getting to 94% of these tests, even C2N was pretty good. So do you have any thoughts on at this point, how close are we to actually make this -- bring this to prime time? And when the donanemab gets approved do you think this could be the test doctors use? Or it will still take some time to get to that? Joe Fletcher : Thanks Mohit, for the question. You broke up a little bit there. But I think we got the gist. I'll hand off to Anne. Anne White : Yes. So we shared at CTAD, we were pleased with the data that we saw. And we're also pleased to see progress across the field in blood biomarkers. We definitely believe that this is incredibly important to drive access and early diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease. So you've seen us invest in a number of fronts, our own p tau 217, but also partnering with others who are working on good tests to elevate the area. So it's a strategy of raising all boats.  But yes, we did share our data. And we intend to make this available in a phased approach commercially as an LDT starting at the end of this year, in a couple of sites, and then continuing to expand over 2024. But at the same time, you'll see us continue to publish the data. We think that what's incredibly important in the field, is that good correlative data, particularly with amyloid PET, which is the gold standard in diagnosis is published and shared so that we can continue to make sure that we have high quality tests out there.  So that's part of our goal with delivering this test is to really set a standard for what blood tests should look like. So look forward to hearing more over the next coming months as we publish that data and then make that more broadly available. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Anne, and thanks Mohit for the question, Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor, Louise your line is live. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask you, do you think the approval of additional oral potential -- approval of additional oral diabetes drug could impact the pricing for injectables? Why or why not? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Louise, for the question. I'll hand over to Mike about the potential approval for other oral diabetes drugs and potential impact on injectables? Michael Mason : No, I don't think that'll have an impact. I mean, traditionally, we don't see a new class of diabetes agents coming in and affecting a current class. Usually the competition happens within a specific class within a diabetes market. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Jeff, your line is live. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had one on tirzepatide supply. I know you guys have, a plant in North Carolina and another one coming online next year. But if you look beyond that, if you have demand anywhere near what's modeled, and even outside of obesity and diabetes, obviously, supply could remain tight. So the question is, is there a threshold of treated patients like in the near term that will inform your decision on adding manufacturing capacity? And how much does the outlook for or orforglipron have on that? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Geoff for the question. I'll hand over to Dave. David Ricks : Yeah, thanks, Geoff. Obviously a hot topic. We work on this multiple hours every day. You're citing the announcements we've made and as mentioned great progress is showing manufacturing agenda RTP sort of on track to deliver on its goal. But as we exit the year, and then that kind of in market volume following that Concord, which is a few hours away, and kind of a replica site also, well on track for coming online in '24. So that's good news in the ERMA [ph] presentation, which is -- what we call our auto injector, from trulicity, and the current presentation from Mounjaro in the U.S. We've announced previously that we're introducing now single use vial presentation ex-U.S., so that we aren't basically sitting on approvals and connect patients have access to the medication.  That will follow them by a multi use injector that uses different property, plant and equipment than what we're talking about here. So a couple of things to point out. You're noting kind of new greenfield site expansions. We've rightfully made a big deal out of. We're not done with those. I think you might hear more about that in the future. Of course, we are aggressively planning that and not banking on or forced upon to rescue us from this. We think that there is a need to take up parenteral incretin supply pretty dramatically from the current levels. And we plan to do that.  But that will be in a combination of the current syringe-based auto injector, the vial capacity, we've already talked about. The multi use injector, which will come online sometime next year, and is a highly efficient play for us because it uses current systems and different ones from the auto injector. And then there's third party agreements that have been ongoing in the background. And to point out here, we are not relying on one. We have a diverse portfolio of third parties, recognizing that, the probability of full supply from any one is probably less than one. But buying up as much capacity as available in all those systems.  So we've got a, I think the all hands on deck phrase was used earlier. I mean, this is really all hands on deck. And it's a problem we work every day. So we're not at all happy with the capacity. We've announced already, you'll see more. Some we don't announce that we'll just layer in to the volume we ship. And of course, long term new presentations like solid oral opens up even more possibilities, but we need to do everything we can now given the huge potential for global obesity treatment for our medicines to play a key role in that, and then ultimately impact hundreds of millions of people.  So a lot of work to do here yet ahead. Thanks for the question. Joe Fletcher : Paul, next question? Operator : The next question is from Laura Hindley from Berenberg. Laura, your line is live. Laura Hindley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I think it's clear from your results that the next steps in Mounjaro is rapidly in progress. But how should we think about the ex-U.S. trulicity contribution going forward, which did look weak this quarter? But at the moment you're still supply restricted? Can we expect a return to growth into next year as constraints ease or should we now assume Trulicity is ex-growth as you push the shift into Mounjaro? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Laura for the question. I'll hand over to Ilya Ufa, President of Lilly International. Ilya, do you want to address Trulicity ex-U.S. contributions in the quarter and going forward? Ilya Yuffa : Sure, first, thanks for the question. From a trulicity standpoint, we had healthy growth coming into later part of last year. And we've been pretty transparent with both physicians as well as regulators that due to the tight supply, we are encouraged not to start new patients. We continue with that, to be transparent. We think it's the right thing to do. And as we think about the growth in incretin, we're looking as we build up capacity, as David mentioned.  As we increase capacity both in the single use vial and introduce Mounjaro in additional markets as we have in Australia and we will continue over the next number of weeks and months in other markets and then transition towards a multi-use platform in quick time in introducing Mounjaro. And so the overall growth in incretin will be mainly driven by as we are able to launch Mounjaro in new markets that's probably will go get the growth. Thank you for the question. Joe Fletcher : Thanks Ilya, Paul. Next question? Operator : The next question is coming from Umar Rafat from Evercore. Umar, your line is live. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I realize Mounjaro has not approved in obesity yet. But I'm just very curious how you're thinking about the pros and cons heading into that pricing decision, if there is any, because Novo does have that price premium, as you know, on Wegovy or Ozempic. So on the one hand, while Mounjaro price could be the same because the dose is the same, but on the other hand, Novo has this dynamic where it can offer a lot more rebate for the obesity indication than you can, if you leave the price unchanged. I'm just curious what your thought process is heading into that. Joe Fletcher : I'll hand over to Mike. Michael Mason : Yeah, thanks for the question. Obviously, we're not going to talk about price prior to approval. We're evaluating every scenario. We will make the right decision for patients who live with obesity. Thanks, Joe Fletcher : Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink. David, your line is live. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. And thanks for all the updates today. So some major payers seem to under appreciate the broad health savings potential that incretins offer the non-diabetic obese population, and instead focus on criticizing drug pricing. So ahead of the results from Mounjaro's morbidity and mortality outcomes trial in 2027, how does Lilly plan to better inform payers about Mounjaro's health economics benefits in non-diabetic obese patients? Thanks very much. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave for the question. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit about that, about the longer term appreciation for the broader health benefits of medicines, like tirzepatide? Michael Mason : Yeah, no, David, it's a good question. One that we've obviously spent a ton of time on and done a lot of internal analysis and a lot of planning on. We will have a whole suite of real world evidence and pragmatic trials so that we can answer this question clearly, for payers and other stakeholders. In our conversations with payers, while they're concerned about the short term budget impact, they do understand that losing weight will have benefits. It's not that hard of a sale, because they do understand the benefits are intuitive.  If you look at the total number of like obesity rate of complications, there's over 200. And you look at some of these are just really devastating and very costly, like type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia. And then when you look at the cost of these, on the U.S. alone, there's $370 billion in direct medical costs associated with obesity-related comorbidities, and over a trillion in indirect annual cost. When payers see that, people living with obesity and overweight, drive 2.7 times greater healthcare costs, than normal individuals, that data does get their attention.  And so I think over time will continue to provide health economics data, but also I think the voice of those living with obesity will be very important in this. This is a disease that, that really materially impacts someone's both health and mental functioning. And is really important for people who live with obesity. Their goal is to is to lose weight and maintain that so they can help their long term health benefits. And they're going to have a loud voice in this. I think both in commercial insurance as well as in states and the federal government. And so I do -- I am confident over time that we will see increase in access.  I think the most recent report shows that there's 50 million people in the U.S. that has access to obesity medication. So it will take time, but I think -- do think more and more payers are appreciating the value that anti-obesity medications especially when we get approval for tirzepatide will offer them. Thanks. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Mike. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live. Evan Seigerman : Hi, thank you so much for giving me the question and congrats on the progress. So given the executive changes announced in October, how should we think about the direction of the immunology business now with Dan at the helm? Thank you guys. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Evan. Dave, do you want to take that? David Ricks : Sure, I can start and let Dan comment. Look, we've been really pleased with this business, which I think is important to take the long view here. I mean, I was involved in creating this like 10 years ago, and both [indiscernible] and now mirikizumab, and hopefully soon Lebrikizumab will form a really core portfolio for us, really exploiting ideas that we had some time ago. What's next, and you see here today advancing another checkpoint agonist into Phase 2 is a lot of decisions about, okay, what's next to take immunology to the next level. And that's largely going to be about key decisions, both internal portfolio and potentially externally, like with our DICE acquisition, to find a new set of either single agent or combinations that can raise the standard of care in tough immunology diseases, noting, in particular in IBD and RA, the standard of care is hardly satisfied today.  We measure real pretty low performance status of success. So that's the mission that Dan and we've hired Mark Genovese to the company and others to really build a portfolio the future. So I don't Dan, if you want to Daniel Skovronsky : No, excited about the opportunity. There's lots of work to do in immunology, given the depth of unmet medical needs and the science is great here. So I hope we can continue to bring great drugs to market as we're doing with mirikizumab. And we hope to do with Lebrikizumab soon and more to come. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Evan, for the question. Next question, Paul. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your life is live. Christopher Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just as we're thinking about the upcoming tirzepatide obesity approval, just interested in your perspective of how we should anticipate commercial coverage ramping, as we think of maybe the first couple of quarters post launch versus where it could be in a year or two from now, a business how quickly can we think about coverage coming on board? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Mike to comment on anticipation of commercial coverage over time, Mike? Michael Mason : Yeah, no, it's a good question. It will ramp up. We're trying to be disciplined. And we're trying to make sure that we bring on access as quickly, as is prudent. And so just like we did with Mounjaro we will take and make sure that we sometimes access has to materialize at an organic pace where it makes sense. And we'll make sure and use our judgment. So just like with Mounjaro, while we'd love to get out of the gate quickly, most importantly, as a setup for long term success. So you'll see a kind of a natural ramp up that you would with any new product. And I think it's important, as you look in the first quarter of our launch last January, when you saw Wegovy resupply. They were resupplying into a market where they already had capacity.  So I think when you look at our access, and you look at our volume as we head into next year, you'll see a ramp up in volume as you see a ramp up in our access. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve your line is live. Stephen Scala : Oh, thank you very much. A question on why Lilly is evaluating higher doses of tirzepatide. There is risk and adverse event is uncovered and taints the franchise, and of course there are IRA considerations. Does this suggest some reservation about the pipeline either Triple G or orforglipron, the former, which has safety signals, the latter of which took five years to get to Phase 3. It would also be interesting to know whether it's the exact same molecule or it's been enhanced in some way. Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Steve for the question, Dan. Daniel Skovronsky : orforglipron: So there's no hesitation or trepidation there at all. I think though notwithstanding those two molecules, which I expect to be great and important contributors to human health, we have, tirzepatide. I'm not exactly sure if we've maximized the dose response, if we hit the flat part of the dose response curve yet. It looks like we might be close. But we want to explore it. And so we're testing the higher doses in Phase 2. I think we've had enough patients on this drug for long enough that I expect the risk of uncovering a new safety signal with sort of marginally higher doses is extremely low. So not worried about that at all. Joe Fletcher : Let me just jump in here maybe on questions like this. And we have a number of research projects and obesity and related mechanisms. In some people ask, well how does this one affect that or whatever. That's not really the mindset in which we're pursuing this. We're -- we see ourselves a leader in the space and have a unique opportunity. And our goal is to exploit every single idea till we get data that says we shouldn't. And so high dose tirzepatide just another version of that. But it doesn't have a read through to other things. Were just in all the above mode in obesity. Thank you.  Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs, Chris, your line is live. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. Good morning. In about a week or so we'll get detailed results from the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial, the American Heart meeting. Can you share with us what perhaps three key questions that the Lilly team will be looking at when we get detailed results? Joe Fletcher : Dan, do you want to weigh in on--? Daniel Skovronsky : I don't know. I can start maybe. Maybe Mike has some to add here. Look, I'm excited to see that data, of course, as everyone else's. But the top line looks good. For me, I think we're sort of creating now data points on a line that connect the level of weight loss with the degree of cardiovascular benefit. I think this point fits on that line reasonably well. That line which was greater health benefits, including better, a fewer mace outcomes with greater degrees of weight loss bodes very well for Mounjaro data, given the very high degrees of weight loss that we saw in our trials. I'll leave it at that. See if Mike wants to add. Michael Mason : Probably the key question I'm looking at is like how much of the effect was driven by drug effect versus weight loss is probably the key question we're looking at. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dan and Mike. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is live. Carter Gould : Great. Good morning. Congrats on the progress. May be following on, on the prior question, but maybe more on sort of the impact of the flow data, and your thoughts there. Specifically, you guys have taken sort of a different approach with your more recent assets there in terms of targeting that population. Is Lily's view that those benefits will accrue to the class and maybe just talk about how you think about targeting that segment down the road? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Carter for the question. Dan you want to comment on the flow data? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, so you're asking about kidney disease. I mean, I think the profound effect that incretin seem to be having on the kidneys is really a nice and important additive benefit here. This is something that's been observed with multiple class members now and they expect it will extend into our incretins as well. So it's exciting and I think proof that these drugs perhaps in addition to weight loss and A1C control, could have other direct metabolic benefits including the kidney. Joe Fletcher : Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung your line is live. Trung Huynh : Morning, all. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one on Mounjaro U.S. pricing. So by our calculations, we think that 3Q '23 the net price is around 440 per TRX. For the rest of the year do you think that net price can continue to go up and above the saving card price of 450 [ph]. Although payers willing to pay for this, or is this broadly capped now until that saving card ends? And for next year, can you just give us your thoughts on if net price can meaningfully keep increasing? Thanks. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Trung. Mike, do you want to make any comments around Mounjaro pricing? Michael Mason : Yeah, no, I'd be happy to do that. I think maybe at a macro level, I would say that our gross to net for Mounjaro in Q3, that kind of normalized. Before then we had a number of saving card changes that that, made our gross to net rate dynamic. Our last and copay card change occurred late in Q2, so at the end of June. And so Q3 was a kind of a pure quarter, where we didn't have any other copay card changes. And I would say that our Mounjaro rate normalized at that point, you know, going forward, I think what you'll see is what you see normally for a product at this point in the lifecycle that as we pursue gaining access, there'll probably be some pricing pressure related to that. But we don't have any other coping card changes planned in the near future. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mike. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question is coming from Robyn Karnauskas. From Truist Securities. Robyn, your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. This is Nicole [indiscernible] on for Robyn. Going back to obesity, how are you thinking through the impact on Mounjaro if Ira [ph] stays and Wegovy and Ozembic prices decline in the 2026-20 27 time frame? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Nicole for the question. I think it's very -- if I heard you right, you're thinking about IRA impacts to maybe semaglutide and potential impacts to Mounjaro. Mike, do you want to comment on that briefly? Michael Mason : Yeah, and I'll happy to do that, Obviously, it's too early to really impact how IRA will have an impact and the impact will have another product within the class. I think what you know, what's important for tirzepatide is it is the first dual acting incretin. And we do think it has a unique profile. And in head to head results in type 2 diabetes, it did show superior, both I1C and weight to semaglutide. And so at the end of the day, I think the profile of the product will carry the day. And obviously more to come on the IRA. As the first products go through the negotiation, we see the impact, but we're confident in the profile of tirzepatide. Joe Fletcher : Thank you Mike. Paul, I think we have two calls left in the queue. Why don't we go through those two quickly, and then we'll wrap up? Operator : Certainly. The first one is a follow up from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live. Seamus Fernandez : Oh, great. Thanks for the follow up question. So just in terms of how you're thinking about the introduction of oral treatments, and the importance of pushing for what would be hopefully a maintenance type regimen. Is Lily looking at oral therapies as more of a maintenance regimen opportunity, or do you see a broader opportunity here, perhaps bringing in other mechanisms that perhaps could aid in pursuing, I guess, the ever elusive metabolic set point? Thanks. Joe Fletcher : Dan, do you want to comment on that? Daniel Skovronsky : Yeah, thanks, Seamus. Maybe to paraphrase Dave's previous answers, it's sort of in all of the above here, I think there's great opportunities on the oral as a standalone therapy for initiation of therapy. Also, yes, for maintenance therapy globally. And also, yes, for potential combinations. You know, I point out the obvious fact that this is a GLP. One monotherapy. So we benchmark it against the best injectable GLP1 monotherapy. But I don't expect as an oral it will achieve the same levels of efficacy we can see with dual agonism like tirzepatide. So the future certainly will hold combinations like that. Thank you. Joe Fletcher : And the last question, Paul from the queue. Operator : Certainly. The last question will be a follow up from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live. Timothy Anderson : Thank you. What's the latest thinking on the topic of get agonism versus antagonism. Tirzepatide is the former Amgen drug is the latter. I've never seen two drugs in any category that have a similar clinical effect but opposing underlying activity the biologic target. Amgen says get antagonism is the way to go supported by their genetic analyses. What is Lily saying? Have you looked similarly at genetic analyses to inform your view? Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Tim, for the last question, Dan. Daniel Skovronsky : Yeah, I'll take that. I, of course, say we have now I think more data on GLP agonism than anyone in the world and starting with tirzepatide, of course, which is a combo GLP1 GIP agonist and the head to head study against a pure GLP1 agonist and you can see some profoundly different effects here looking at, for example, efficacy relative to tolerability. It looks like the GIP is boosting efficacy while also reducing the side effects that limit tolerability. So that was our initial evidence in human trials that involved well now tens of thousands of patients have been on tirzepatide in trials.  And then we went out to sort of prove this point by creating a pure GIP 1 agonist that just agonizes GIP to see what that could do alone. And again we saw a very highly tolerated drug consistent with what we understand about the mechanism of GIP 1 that probably could suppress actually nausea, vomiting that lead to weight loss. So, I think human data trumps everything here, and we've got a ton of that. So we're pretty excited about gap agonism. I can't really say what will happen with antagonism, but like you said, it's pretty unusual to have opposing mechanisms both work in similar ways. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dan for the last one, Dave. David Ricks : Okay, thanks, Joe. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and of course your ongoing interest in Eli Lilly and Company. As I said, it's been a very productive year for Lilly so far, and we look forward to continuing this momentum through a busy end of year in fourth quarter. So thanks for dialing in today. Please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we did not address on the call. And hope everyone has a great rest of the week and rest of the day today. Take care. Operator : Thank you.

Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Good morning and thank you, Paul. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2023 earnings and 2024 guidance call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Diabetes and obesity and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn over the call to Dave. David Ricks : All right, thanks, Joe. 2023 was a year of advancement across our company. We grew our top-line. We progressed our pipeline. It advanced our external innovation agenda through partnerships and collaborations. We continue to invest in quality, the reliability and the resilience of our company's manufacturing infrastructure, and most importantly, delivered new life-saving and life-changing medicines to more patients. In 2023, revenue grew 20% for the full year and 28% for the most recent quarter, as our newly launched portfolio continued to gain momentum. This past year, we announced positive Phase IIIs for Donanemab, Tirzepatide, Mirikizumab And Pertibrutinib. We also announced a positive Phase II result for Orforglipron as well as Retatrutide and moved these two important molecules into Phase III. In terms of external innovation, in 2023, we continued to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. These transactions included the acquisition of DICE Therapeutics, POINT Biopharma, Versanis Bio, Emergence Therapeutics, Mablink Biosciences, Immunotrac as well as Sigilon Therapeutics. We have several significant investments in manufacturing, including plans to expand capacity at the company's Research Triangle Park facility and the two manufacturing sites within the LEAP Innovation Park in Boone County, Indiana. Most recently, we announced plans to construct a new high-tech manufacturing site in Germany. This facility will further expand the company's global injectable product and device manufacturing network, including for our diabetes and obesity portfolio. Most importantly, this past year, we brought innovative new medicines to patients. In 2023, we received regulatory approvals for Zepbound, Jaypirca, Omvoh, in the U.S. -- in the EU rather, and an expanded label for Verzenio and two new indications for Jardiance. This progress will serve as a foundation to drive top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion over time. As you can see on Slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 28% with our new products growing by over $2 billion. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones in addition to the Zepbound and Jaypirca CLL approvals, today, we announced top line results for the Tirzepatide Phase II SYNERGY-NASH trial as well as the Verzenio Phase III CYCLONE two trial. Dan will talk more about this update -- in his update. In terms of business development, in Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Mablink Bioscience and POINT Biopharma, the latter of which expands our capacity and capability into Radioligand therapies. Lastly, we announced a 15% dividend increase for the sixth consecutive year and distributed over $1 billion in dividends in the fourth quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, and other updates. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our performance was highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, driven by our new products and growth products. Q4 revenue increased 28% compared to Q4 2022. Excluding divestiture, this represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance and the recent launch of Zepbound. For the full year, revenue increased 20% driven by robust volume growth of 16%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 82.3%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 17%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with launches of new products and additional indications as well as higher incentive compensation costs. R&D expenses increased 28%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as higher incentive compensation costs. In Q4, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $623 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.62. In Q4 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $240 million or $0.23 negative impact to EPS. Operating income increased 29% in Q4, driven by higher revenue from new launches, partially offset by operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 28% for the quarter and included a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 13.1% compared to 7.3% in Q4 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q4 2023 was primarily driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2022 and the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.49 in Q4, a 19% increase compared to Q4 2022, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.62 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.23 in Q4 2022. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 39% in Q4, driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Zepbound. Net price in the U.S. increased 27% for the quarter, driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamic as well as the onetime favorable change in estimates for rebates and discounts. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. Europe continued its trend of strong growth in Q4. Excluding $65 million in revenue associated with milestones received for the EU approval and launch of Revenue was up 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. For Japan, we are pleased to see robust growth in Q4 as revenue increased 15% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio and Mounjaro. Moving to China, Q4 revenue increased 7% in constant currency with volume growth of 10% partially offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q4 was primarily driven by Pivot. We are pleased to see China return to growth in 2023. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 10% in constant currency. However, when you exclude the impact of the Q4 2022 sales of rights for Alimta Korea and Taiwan, sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide nine shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see, the new products and growth product categories combined contributed approximately 15 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 42% in Q4 driven by robust demand growth and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The continued positive momentum is driven by early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 30% for the quarter. In the U.S., Jardiance revenue increased 29%, driven by increased demand. In Q4, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 14%. U.S. revenue decreased 18% driven by lower volume and lower realized prices. We experienced intermittent delays for filling orders of Trulicity. Starting in early December and going through January, all dose strengths of Trulicity were indicated as having limited availability on the FDA drug shortage site. We expect to experience intermittent delays orders of certain doses in the coming months. In international markets, Trulicity volume continued to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to start new patients on Trulicity. Moving to Slide 11, Mounjaro continued its robust growth as more Type 2 diabetes patients benefited from the medicine. Q4 revenue grew to over $2.2 billion globally, up from $1.4 billion in Q3 2023. In the U.S., Mounjaro revenue of $2.1 billion in Q4, up from $1.3 billion in Q3 2023, benefited from a onetime change in SMS for rebates and discounts. Adjusted for this onetime change, sequential net sales in the U.S. would have grown approximately 30% in Q4. Since our last call, we further expanded patient access to Mounjaro. As of February 1, access for patients with Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. was 90% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 92% access for commercial patients. This expanded access puts Mounjaro near parity with established injectable Incretins and gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for Type 2 diabetes. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay part program expired on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. Compared to Q4 2022, the Mounjaro net price in Q4 2023 benefited from this change to the co-pay part program in the U.S. Recall that after a change to the noncovered co-pay program in late 2022, patients already started on the $25 co-pay card could remain in the program until June 30. Today, commercially insured patients without coverage utilize the current noncovered co-pay program and pay roughly half the list price for Mounjaro prescription. Turning to Slide 12. In November, we received FDA approval for Zepbound for adults with obesity or those who are overweight and have weight-related comorbidities. We then announced on December five that Zepbound available at U.S. pharmacies, and we started building commercial formulary access before the end of the year. We are pleased with the early access of approximately one-third of commercial lives covered as of February 1. Access in this market will be more gradual as individual employers need to opt in to coverage after the typical formulary contracting takes place. We are focused on building formulary access and employer opt-ins, but we expect that it will take some time before we reach broad open access in this market. Meanwhile, the commercial savings for our program is available at U.S. pharmacies for those who do not yet have coverage. In Medicare Part D, weight loss drugs are still prohibited from reimbursement. In Q4, we recognized $176 million in sales for Zepbound with approximately 3/4 of that coming from initial channel stocking. The initial prescription trends we have seen are encouraging. On Slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation. Looking forward to 2024 and beyond, we have confidence in our existing commercial portfolio, bolstered by the recent launches of Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, and Zepbound and the potential launches of the Donanemab and Lebrikizumab, all of which we expect to serve as drivers for contained growth through the balance of the decade. On Slide 14, you'll see a summary of our outlook; outline our capital deployment decisions in relation to achievement of our strategic deliverables. We will invest in our current portfolio and in the future innovation through R&D, business development and a comprehensive manufacturing expansion agenda designed to drive revenue growth and speed life-changing medicines to patients. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend increases in line with earnings growth over time and share repurchases with excess capital. Moving to Slide 15, we highlight some of the dynamics that may impact our 2024 financial results. We expect continued robust revenue growth with revenue from our core business which excludes revenue from divestiture growing nearly 30% at the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by positive momentum to simply launch products. In Incretins, anticipated growth will be led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. In 2023, we made tremendous strides in expanding access from Mounjaro, and we entered 2024 with 90% of commercial and Part D lives covered. Zepbound coverage is off to a good start in its early December launch, and we expect both Tirzepatide to contribute substantially to Lilly's revenue growth in 2024. While we expect Mounjaro and Zepbound to be drivers of revenue growth, this will be partially offset by an expected continuation of the softer Trulicity sales trends that we saw in the second half of 2023. Recent revenue declines for Trulicity in the U.S. has been driven by supply tightness. Volume has also been impacted by our actions outside the U.S. As for supply outlook for Emberton, our manufacturer organization continues to execute well on the most ambitious expansion agenda in our company's long history. Given strong demand and time required to bring capacity fully online, we continue to expect demand to outpace supply in 2024. In late 2022, we showed our expectation that by year-end 2023, our capacity for Incretin auto-injector pens would double. This goal was achieved through significant efforts from our manufacturing colleagues and partners around the globe. In 2024, our capacity execution efforts will continue with equal urgency and will be accomplished not just through increased auto-injector capacity but also through alternative presentation like our multi-use Quick Pen, which received regulatory approval in the U.K. in late January. We expect our manufacturing site in Concord, North Carolina, will initiate production as early as the end of 2024, with product available to ship in 2025. And we are pursuing a host of the projects, internal and external, large and small, to further expand capacity. Now I'll provide a bit more context on the timing and pace of our Incretin supply plans in 2024. While we're continuing to expand supply every quarter, we expect the most significant production increases to come in the second half of the year. We expect our production of sellable doses in the second half of 2024 will be at least one and a half times the production in the second half of 2023. Note that while last year, our commentary focused on capacity of auto-injectors devices compared to 2022, we're now referring sellable doses produced, which is more relevant to patients and investors. Beyond Incretin, we look forward to progressing our launch project for two other medicine approved and launched in 2023, Jaypirca and Omvoh. Jaypirca was initially approved by the FDA in January 2023 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma under the accelerated approval program, received FDA approval also on the Accelerated Approval Program in December 2023 for adult patients with CLL or SLL that have received at least two prior lines of therapy. We look forward to the ongoing opportunity to help patients with this medicine as our best Phase III program continues. Omvoh was approved in October 2023 in the U.S. and earlier that year in Japan, Europe and other markets and represents a compelling new options for patients struggling with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And in 2024, we look forward to potential U.S. launches of two more medicines, Donanemab and Lebrikizumab. We continue to expect FDA regulatory actions on Donanemab in Q4 2024 and remain confident in the substantial potential for Donanemab to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease. With the current state of diagnostic and treatment readiness, initial uptake will be somewhat limited, and we expect Donanemab to contribute only modestly to growth in 2024 once approved. Lebrikizumab, which last year was approved and launched in Europe under the brand name by our partner, received regulatory approval in Japan in January. As for the U.S., we look forward to the potential proof of Lebrikizumab by the end of the year. We believe the efficacy, safety and dosing of Lebrikizumab can make it a compelling option for patients and prescribers in a large and growing market for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Given the expected timing of FDA regulatory action, we expect Lebrikizumab to contribute only modestly to revenue growth in 2024. Beyond our recently launched portfolio of medicine, we expect continued growth from Verzenio driven by the early breast cancer indication where the magnitude and maturity of our clinical data reinforces it as a standard of care treatment in node-positive high-risk early breast cancer. Jardiance has been another outstanding contributor to growth, and we expect revenue growth to continue in 2024 though at a slower price as strong growth may be dampened by pricing dynamics in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we expect an acceleration of growth in every major geography led not only by the anticipated launches of Tirzepatide but also continued strong growth of Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz. Lastly, we seek to create long-term value beyond this decade. We will continue to invest across our value chain, in our recent and upcoming potential launches, in our pipeline, and in our manufacturing footprint. Slide 16 summarizes our initial 2024 financial guidance. Starting at the top line, revenue is expected to be between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion. Using the midpoint of the 2024 range, this represents roughly 20% growth or 29% growth for our core business, which excludes the impact of divestitures that took place in 2023. In terms of phasing of our revenue growth throughout 2024, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, consistent with the increased availability of Incretin doses. In terms of pricing for our core business, which excludes divestitures, we expect a high single-digit percent price decline in 2024. The lingering base period impact of the Mounjaro non-covered co-pay card dynamics will dampen these price declines in the first half of 2024, with more significant price declines expected in the second half of the year. During this year, we are taking a streamlined approach to our guidance line items related to expenses. Rather than provide three separate guidance line items for gross margin, research and development costs and marketing and sale and administrative costs, we are presenting a single new ratio representing our margin after planned costs, calculated by subtracting R&D costs and marketing and administrative costs from gross margin and dividing that figure by revenue. We express this ratio as a percentage, and for 2024, we expect it to be in the range of 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis. While we are not providing a specific guidance number for gross margin as a percent of sales, our expectations remain consistent, but we will maintain gross margin of approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis as productivity gains and volumes are offset by pricing pressures and the cost of new manufacturing facilities. As for our expense growth across key categories, we expect marketing and administrative expenses to again grow in 2024 though at a slower pace than revenues, with growth driven by marketing investments in our recently launched and upcoming launch products. We also expect R&D expenses in 2024 to increase, driven by growing investments across all phases of our pipeline as we invest for the future, with the majority of dollar growth driven by ongoing and new late-phase opportunities. We expect R&D expense to increase at a higher rate than marketing, sell and administrative expenses. Other income and expense is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million of expense, primarily driven by higher interest expense. Turning to taxes; we expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. Note that this rate does not assume or repeal of the provision of the 2017 Tax Act, requiring capitalization, amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Should such a change take effect, our effective tax rate for 2024 would be moderately higher. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.70 on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our prior practice, we are not including any potential or pending acquired IPR&D and even milestone charges in our 2024 guidance, and we will provide updates each quarter from the impact of IPR&D on earnings per share as acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges are incurred. For guidance modelling purposes, we're currently estimating diluted weighted average share outstanding for 2024 to be approximately 903 million. We entered 2024 with strong momentum and a remarkable opportunity to help millions more patients with our medicines. For our investors, 2024 should be another exciting year, driven by expected revenue growth in our core business, near an approaching 30% and continued investments to drive future growth. Our outlook for top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion remains on track. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our continued progress in R&D. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. I'll start with our progress against diabetes, obesity and complications thereof. Today, we announced positive results from SYNERGY-NASH. The Phase II study of Tirzepatide in adults with biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis, also known as MASH. As shown on Slide 17, the study met its primary endpoint with up to 74% of participants achieving an absence of MASH with no worsening of fibrosis at 52 weeks compared to less than 13% of participants reaching this endpoint on placebo. We are equally encouraged by results seen in the secondary endpoint, evaluating improvement in fibrosis. While the study was not designed to be statistically powered to evaluate improvement in fibrosis, the study results showed a clinically meaningful treatment effect across all doses on the proportion of participants achieving a decrease of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of MASH to placebo. The adverse events were consistent with those observed in other clinical trials studying Tirzepatide in people living with obesity or Type 2 Diabetes. The full SYNERGY-NASH results will be presented at a medical congress later this year. As you know, late last year, we received FDA approval on Zepbound, which marks Lilly's first approved treatment for obesity. This is a landmark occasion for patients and for the field as Zepbound is the first and only approved treatment activating two Incretin hormone receptors, GIP and GLP-1 to tackle on the underlying cause of excess weight. Also, in early-stage development, we have now advanced our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist for the treatment of diabetes into Phase I and our long-acting Atrial natriuretic peptide for treatment of heart failure into Phase I. We've advanced mastatide into Phase II for obesity as we've begun to dose patients in that study. We are pleased that early this year, our partner, Innovent, reported positive results in the Phase III GORE-I study of mastetide in Chinese adults with obesity. In helps the development and commercialization rights for in China and Lilly retains the rights to the rest of the world. Moving to oncology. Today, we shared that in the Phase III CYCLONE two trial, Verzenio added to abiraterone did not meet the primary endpoint of improved radiographic progression-free survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. For the study, we employ an adaptive Phase II/III design. And while the Phase II stage met the prespecified threshold for the independent data monitoring committee to recommend initiation of Phase III, the signal was not confirmed in the Phase III portion in a larger sample size. The overall safety and tolerability profile was consistent with the known profiles of the medicines. We anticipate sharing full results from the CYCLONE two study at a future medical meeting. Since our last earnings call, Jaypirca received approval under the FDA's Accelerated Approval program for the treatment of divergence with CLL or SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL2 inhibitor. We also reported that the Phase III confirmatory trial intended to convert this approval to traditional approval, known as BRUIN CLL 321 met its primary endpoint, and we plan to present these data at an upcoming medical meeting. With the CLL and SLL approvals, Jaypirca is now the first and only FDA-approved non-covalent BTK inhibitor that can extend the benefit of targeting the BTK pathway in CLL and SLL patients previously treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. This was the second approval for Jaypirca in 2023 with the first in patients with MCL. We believe these two indications only represent the beginning of the eventual impact Jaypirca can have for patients, and we look forward to seeing the data from the rest of the Phase III program across CLL, SLL and MCI. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, which begins Lilly's entry into radioligand therapy, a promising technology with potential to deliver meaningful advances against a range of cancers. We welcome our new Point colleagues to Lilly, and we look forward to building on their work to grow this capability at Lilly. 2024 is also poised to be a particularly productive year for new clinical starts in oncology, as we begin to see the results of the new oncology R&D strategy that we implemented about four years ago after the Loxo acquisition. Through a combination of internal discovery efforts and business development, we expect to put at least five new molecules into the clinic this year, a wild-type of selective KRASG12D inhibitor, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, two antibody-drug conjugates with two biasomere's payloads, one against Nectin-4 and one against folate receptor alpha and an actinium PSMA radioligand therapy. I'll speak in a moment about our clinical KRASG12C program, but you can see that we're putting real effort into developing a suite of restorative therapeutics. And we're excited to see those discovery efforts result in three potential medicines so far. Of course, we'll have to see which of these deliver on our target clinical profiles but we're optimistic about this early phase portfolio, and we've certainly diversified the modalities in our pipeline. In addition, we're excited that [ph]alomorasib, our KRASG12C inhibitor, has progressed into Phase II as we're finalizing dose selection under Project Optimus for the Phase III program, which we plan to start later this year. You can now see the full design of that study on clinicaltrials.gov. By way of reminder, we started this program years behind our competitors. And through focused effort behind what looks like a great molecule to us, we've made up the vast majority of that time. We believe we're now neck and neck with our closest competitors with a medicine that we hope to show combines better with PD-1. Lastly, in oncology, we terminated development of our RET inhibitor two as it did not meet our threshold to move forward with internal development. In immunology, we moved two new assets into Phase I, and we advanced our KV1.3 Antagonist for psoriasis into Phase II. Lebrikizumab was approved in the EU for atopic dermatitis under the brand name Akouos, which is marketed by our partner, Amaral there. In January this year, we were pleased to have Akouos approved in Japan. In neuroscience, in January, our wholly-owned subsidiary announced positive clinical results for the Phase I/II AK-OTOF-101 study which demonstrated hearing restoration within 30 days of a single administration in the first participant, an individual with more than a decade of profound hearing loss. The surgical administration and the investigational therapy were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. These results highlight our commitment to help solve some of humanity's most challenging health care problems and make life better for individual patients. We now show OTP gene therapy in Phase II on our pipeline chart as we've begun enrolling younger patients in the Phase II portion of the study. On Slide 18, we highlight our select pipeline assets with updates since the last earnings call, and Slide 19 summarizes our key events for 2023. I note the key updates on each of these slides in my therapeutic area of comments. Turning to Slide 20. We'd like to highlight potential key events for 2024. As you can see, this year will be another important year as we look to progress our late-stage pipeline. In 2023, we initiated Phase III development projects for our next generation of Incretins, which are our oral agent glyprone and our novel weekly Injectable Tri-agonist, Retatrutide. These programs are progressing and enrolling well. We look forward to seeing the first set of Phase III results on next year. This year, we're planning to initiate a Phase III program in Type 2 diabetes for retatrutide, complementing the ongoing trials in obesity and related complications. Also this year, we are planning to initiate a Phase III program for Lepodiserin, our LPA-lowering siRNA therapy in cardiovascular disease. On Tirzepatide, we're looking forward to a number of additional key data readouts this year. Beyond SYNERGY-NASH, we expect to see results from the Phase III obstructive sleep apnea and Phase III heart failure studies this year. We note increased investor interest in the timing of SURPASS-CVOT, and we reiterate that we expect the data in 2025, notwithstanding the clinicaltrials.gov listing which will be updated soon to reflect our current assumptions based on event rate. By the end of 2024, we expect to have results of SURMOUNT 5, which is our head-to-head study of Tirzepatide compared to high-dose semaglutide in participants with obesity. We also expect the full Phase III program readout on our weekly basal insulin, insulin efsitora alfa alpha later this year. Moving to neuroscience. We're looking forward to FDA action and the potential launch of Erenumab in Q1 of this year, and we are progressing with regulatory reviews around the world. We've now launched a PT 217 blood-based diagnostic test, and we will continue to scale this throughout 2024. We'll also continue to partner with others in the field to ensure physicians have multiple tools to aid in timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In immunology, following the Mirikizumab positive Phase III data at Crohn's disease, we plan to submit to the FDA for this indication this year. Additionally, following the U.S. FDA complete response letter on Lebrikizumab, we expect regulatory action by the end of the year in the U.S. Finally, in oncology, as I mentioned before, we look forward to moving our KRASG12C inhibitor Olomorasib, Phase III later this year following Phase II dose selection. Lastly, we're looking forward to seeing the results of our inlinesterat Phase III study, EMBER-3 in participants with metastatic breast cancer in both monotherapy and in combination with Verzenio. This past year was busy and productive, and we expect more of the same in 2024 as we make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline for the benefit of patients. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. David Ricks : Thanks, Dan, and congrats to you and the team for a big year. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum. We achieved meaningful advances in our late-stage pipeline with the FDA approvals of Zepbound and Jaypirca. We continue to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late-stage medicines, early phase capabilities and in business development, all of which will serve as a foundation for future growth. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma and announced plans to build a new manufacturing site in Germany. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders via dividend. Lastly, in January, we announced that Jana Norton, our Executive Vice President of Global Quality, will be retiring at the end of July after 34 years of service. During her tenure, Jana has overseen significant expansion, modernization and improvements in our quality and manufacturing processes. I'd like to thank her for her many years of outstanding service to Lilly. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate our Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. Before diving into Q&A, I wanted to clarify one point. We may have had some muffled sound during announced prepared remarks. regarding the timing of regulatory action on Donanemab. And as Dan mentioned, the timing is expected to be Q1 of 2024 this year. Received some notes that there were some muffled sound, so I just wanted to clarify from that important point. Now for Q&A, we'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. So consistent with prior quarters, we'll respond to one question per caller so ask you limit to one question per caller, and we'll end the call at 11 :15 a.m. [Operator Instructions] Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on the progress. Just wondering for your GLP franchise, ex U.S., you under-index versus your key competitor. Just wondering what are some of the hurdles to closing that gap as we think about the ramp in '24 but also into 2025? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Terence, for the question. I'll hand over to Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International for that question. Ilya Yuffa : Thanks, Terence. As we think about Mounjaro launches outside the U.S., we have already launched in a number of select markets. We have foundation to be competitive in many of our markets, and we anticipate continued launches. We've just launched in vial format in select markets outside of the U.S., mainly in Australia, Canada and Germany, and Poland. And we just received QuickPen approval in the U.K., and so we're anticipating launch there. As we get additional regulatory approvals for a multi-use QuickPen and we monitor our ramp-up in capacity for supply, we'll continue to launch in other markets throughout the year. And so we anticipate further growth, anticipated four launches of Mounjaro outside of the U.S. and continue with that throughout the year as well as into 2025. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live. Christopher Schott : All right, great. Thanks so much. On Zepbound, seems like you're making strong progress on coverage but just interested in expectations for the remainder of this year as we think about just where coverage could go and just how to think about ASP. I guess the core question is, is it reasonable to think that most payers who cover will add Zepbound year? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Patrik to comment on that question about Zepbound coverage. Patrik Jonsson : Yes. Thank you very much, Chris. As we stated, we are pleased we are so early in launch with the 35% commercial access, having contract a and Our efforts moving forward will really be to continue to expand payer access but not only we will do that with a very disciplined approach as we did with Mounjaro but also to make sure that we get to employer opt-in. And as Anat alluded to in her prepared remarks, that's going to take some time. But we are assuming that with the current access we have, that our access will be along the lines of what the competition has referred to, around 50%. Let me just emphasize that when it comes to employer opt-in, there is not one reliable source for employer opt-in. So I think that's something that we need to continue to monitor and we'll come back with more data during coming earnings calls. So overall, a good start and we will continue our efforts to increase payer access. I think we are quite encouraged with what we have heard from the marketplace so far. Employer opt-in will take longer, but we believe that we are well positioned in that regard as well. Operator : The next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live. Seamus Fernandez : Oh, thanks very much and congrats on all the progress and the success here. But I just wanted to add a quick sense from Dan. Do you see a prospect from SYNERGY-NASH for accelerated approval? And can you confirm that while clinically significant, the secondary endpoint of fibrosis age improvement was not statistically significant? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Seamus, for the question. Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Seamus. This is really quite new to us but we're really excited about it. We haven't had a chance yet to talk to the FDA here at all about next steps, but we're looking forward to having that opportunity. Of course, this was a small trial of about 190 participants but it did use liver biopsies, of course, to assess the endpoints here. With respect to the improvement in I think probably previously stated that I was unsure whether it would be possible for Incretin-based therapies to reverse fibrosis in patients based on competitor readouts in the field. But really excited to see this data with clinically meaningful improvement in fibrosis. There's different doses. There's different statistical methods that can be applied here, accounting for dropouts, particularly in placebo group. So have to wait for the scientific presentation to see all the p-values there. But we're pretty positive on this data package as a whole and what this could mean for patients, both in terms of stopping progression of MASH and reversing fibrosis. Operator : The next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umar, your line is live. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, as you think about manufacturing build-out in various sites, which is obviously very important for all the existing GLP demand, I'm curious, how are you balancing that dollar investment with your probabilities on orfoglipron's clinical and commercial, especially with all the blinded data that's coming in? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Umer. Dave? David Ricks : Yes, happy to answer that. Of course, as we enter this phase of really strong growth in the Incretins, we're very focused on allocating capital, but top priority is creating new capacities. The gating factors are not really financial for us right now, so you can expect us to be investing fully. We're not slowing down because of cash flow or whatever. It's really a function of the technical capacities, both in people and in suppliers to be able to bring facilities online. That's particularly true in the parenteral side. Now you're referencing Orforglipron. Here, we do plan to build ahead of Phase III at risk. I think, given the probability we assess internally as well as the opportunity on the other side of a positive Phase III, we see that as a wise investment. And as we've commented on before, it relies, as you would know, on very different assets inside Lilly as well as outside of Lilly. So here you have organic chemistry, API and tablets and capsules, so a pretty different setup. So we can -- we're paralleling that with our robust injectable investments. And if we're wrong, okay, we'll have to eat that in the end for isn't a strong product. But if it is, I think it does begin to change the math on supply in this category, and I think that's about worth taking. Operator : The next question is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live. Timothy Anderson : Oh, thanks. On SURPASS-CVOT, you mentioned it slipped to 2025. I assume that implies the one interim look has come and gone. And then you're evaluating both non-inferiority and superiority. Would you agree that superiority is really what you need to show here and what you're confident in achieving that? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim, for those couple of questions. Maybe we'll field the one on the interim look, Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, sure. Well, thanks for that question, Tim. As you know, Lilly doesn't comment on interims. Probably most trials in our portfolio do have opportunities for interim looks. But that has -- is not, I think, germane at all to the question on the timing on clintrials.gov, which was before and continues to be the time point at which we'll have final data. When we initially put that time point in clinicaltrials.gov was in early 2020, we hadn't started enrolling the trial yet so that was based on our assumption on enrollment rates but probably more importantly on event rates. And as the trial matures, we get a view on event rate. So I know it's frustrating for investors and for us perhaps to wait to longer time to get events, but of course, that's great news for patients when the event rates are slower, remembering that this is a head-to-head trial with a drug Trulicity that we already know is active in preventing Operator : The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and going back in the progress. I have a question regarding your sleep apnea study. How much benefit do you think from baseline is required for this to be clinically meaningful? Is it 50% or more? And do you think the trial is big enoughto seek a label in [indiscernible] Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mohit, for the question. Dan, back to you. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, thanks. There isn't really a well-established threshold for clinical meaningfulness in sleep apnea. Of course, the commonly used measure here is an index of how many apneic or hypoxic events a patient has while sleeping. Certainly, drugs in this category, I think, have great potential to improve that. We're excited to see what Tirzepatide can see, probably in addition to the absolute percent improvement in AHI that we'll be looking for, I'd also like to see patients switching from one category, for example, intermediate to mild disease or things like that. So we'll be looking at a number of things to assess clinical meaningfulness here, but I'm quite optimistic. Operator : The next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is live. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you how you think about sizing the downstream opportunities for GLP-1 such as Tirzepatide, maybe in NASH, some of the other indications that you're going after as well. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Louise, for that question. So about the downstream opportunities in NASH and elsewhere, Patrik, do you want to field that? Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much. I think there are two important aspects. The first one is when we refer to employer opt-in. I think employees are really looking actively into benefits of listing anti-obesity medications. And whatever data we can generate here being in the cardiovascular space, being in of being national average indications will be extremely important for increased employer opt-in. The second piece will be in Medicare Part D. As long as is not passed, I think data in those comorbidities will be critical to enable access for patients in Medicare Part D. So those are truly the key drivers for those indications. Operator : The next question is coming from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live. Kerry Holford : Thank you for taking my question. It's on Tirzepatide obesity. I'm interested to hear why you've taken the decision not to launch under the Zepbound brand outside the U.S. but rather seek a label expansion for weight loss to Mounjaro. Does that relate to simplicity, perhaps faster reimbursement access? And I wonder if you foresee any risk here that ex U.S. governments prefer ultimately to keep diabetes and obesity budgets separate. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Kerry, for the questions. I'll hand over to Ilya to talk about the branding of Tirzepatide OUS. Ilya Yuffa : Sure, yes. So the broader Tirzepatide outside of the U.S., it depends on a number of different factors, whether it's regulatory or competitive market dynamics. There are some payer dynamics as well. We don't anticipate that being a challenge in terms of negotiating reimbursement either for Type 2 diabetes or for management. We continue to have those discussions in a number of markets and are optimistic about our ability to commercialize under different brand scenarios. Operator : The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff, your line is live. Geoffrey Meacham : Morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question.Dave, I know you guys formally announced Lilly Direct last fall. Should we view it as a platform to just streamline access to providers and Lilly meds? Or is there a monetization model or some market differentiation that could also play out over time? David Ricks : For that I can start, Patrik, jump in. Yes, thanks for the question. The idea was really actually borne out of the challenges patients face every day in the U.S. and sometimes seeing doctors. And you'll know we have a Doctor Finder tool as well as telehealth partners on the platform for migraine, diabetes, and obesity. Finding medicines and their pharmacies, that's been a challenge. And I think particularly as supplies are tight, many patients report driving to 5, 6, seven pharmacies to find the medicine they need that simplifies that process. And then I think in addition, there's been a lot of noise about drugs that are illicit or copies or compounded versions of Zepbound or other weight loss drugs and that's concerning to us. And I think it's concerning to patients. So by going to Lilly Direct literally, they have confidence in the supply. And finally, application of our savings programs has also been a challenge at the pharmacy counter and that happens 100% of the time on Lilly Direct. We haven't thought about it as a way to create some new retail distribution business. It's a way to serve the patients that want our medicines better. That's sort of the frame we're in now. Early days. We're trying to develop it to be smoother, better, include more products over time, have better information about physicians and telehealth providers. So look for more developments there, but good start so far. A lot of energy and enthusiasm from the patient community. Operator : The next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink. David, your line is live. David Risinger : Yes, thank you and congrats on today's updates. Congrats on today's updates. So my question is for Dave and Dan on lean muscle loss associated with Incretin use. Could you help me understand Lilly's take on this debate and comment on Tirzepatide data to date relative to semaglutide? What I've observed is that SURMOUNT-1 showed a 3 :1 lean muscle loss ratio, whereas SEMA's STEP one trial showed a 1.5:1 ratio, albeit with a slightly different assessment. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. I'll have Dan field that. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks for your question. Maybe just starting with our take on lean versus fat mass. I think the ratio of lean to fat mass is an important thing to think about. Body composition, not by weight matters to patients, for example, in risk of Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that ratio seems to be important. The good news is that for patients on Tirzepatide, that ratio appears to improve. As you pointed out, they lose far more fat mass than lean mass. And so in every trial we've done, at the end of the trial, if we measure body composition, it's better, a higher ratio of lean to fat than at the beginning of the trial. So we see this changing body composition as a benefit, potential benefit of Tirzepatide to be further explored. Of course, it's also a benefit we want to further extend. You've seen us try to improve the total amount of body weight loss. We're also trying to improve further improve, I should say, the change in body mass composition. And that's why you saw us acquire and experiment with drugs like [indiscernible] the number you quote from the Tirzepatide and semaglutide studies seem right to me. Of course, they're not head-to-head studies. But it does raise a question here about whether there's a potential benefit of GIP-1 -- GIP agonism here in addition to GLP-1 agonism. That's probably the way I would interpret this data. Operator : The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live. Evan Seigerman : I would love to get your take on how you're thinking about the opportunity for the oral GLP-1s. We've seen some mixed data from competitors. And I just would love to get how you see this evolving in context of your investment in orforglipron. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Evan, for the question. Patrik, maybe you talk about how we think about an oral agent. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much. When we look at the opportunity in obesity, we have more than 110 million in the U.S. and 650 million globally. I think taking into account the current supply constraints across markets, it's impossible to reach all of those with injectables. So I think that's the big opportunity we have for orforglipron. And what we have seen so far in Phase II, if we can replicate those data in Phase III, we have an oral medicine here with a weight loss along the lines of the best competitive Incretin, not at the level of Tirzepatide, but that's the level of the best Incretin in the marketplace and with no food or water restrictions. So we really see the opportunity here with orforglipron to reach patients across the globe. And there is another component as well. If we look at the current market, approximately 20% of patients with obesity are actually concerned to take an injectable. So that's another opportunity with orforglipron. So we believe that's a really strong drug in our hands moving forward in the space of chronic weight management. Operator : Next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve, your line is live. Stephen Scala : There could be several reasons why Lilly is not initiating a Phase III trial of Tirzepatide in NASH. First, Lilly believes it has better molecules. Second, there is something in the Phase II data which is less than ideal. Or third, Lilly will do a Phase III. It just hasn't gotten around to finalizing plans, but that really can't be yet. To draw a parallel, you're starting a Phase III with LPA without even telling us the Phase II was positive. So what would be best for us to conclude about Tirzepatide and NASH? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the clever analysis here. So first of all, I should just say, we literally just got this Phase II data so give us a chance to determine our next steps on the plans, probably debug at least one of the hypotheses here. There's nothing bad in the data that would stop us from going to Phase III. In terms of having a better molecule, probably we do in -- of course, we don't have that kind of Phase II data here for retatrutide. And so that's based on liver fat reduction, which was just incredible in the Phase II trial. Still though, I think having a positive Phase II trial here with really a meaningful data and NASH obligates us to think about next steps. As I said, that's going to the FDA to talk to them. I would say in terms of planning a Phase III for any drug in NASH, a really important priority for us is to move away as much as we can from liver biopsies and replace them with non-invasive testing. I think we and others in the field have made a lot of progress there. We see analogies here to other disease areas. And we hope that in the future, it will be possible to conduct Phase III NASH trials without relying on biopsies. That would really have a profound effect on the feasibility of running these trials quickly but also in the clinical application of NASH drugs, where those non-invasive biomarkers could be identified patients for treatment and monitor response to therapy rather than biopsies. Operator : The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is live. Chris Shibutani : Duration of use of the GLP-1s across the diabetes and obesity populations. Previously, you've characterized the duration in the range of 15 months for diabetes and have commented that you don't believe we have enough experience. Any updates there? And when do you think we will have enough experience to be able to get a better gauge of duration of use median in the obesity population, at least initially? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris. Patrik, do you want to comment on duration of therapy? Patrik Jonsson : Yes. Thank you very much, Chris. I think you're right. It's quite challenging. It's still early days with both Mounjaro in particular Zepbound, and we have been facing some specific dynamics in terms of supply and also changes to the co-pay program. However, when we look at the recent data for Mounjaro, it's encouraging and it suggests that patients that start therapy back in Q1 2023 are having a persistency at least along the lines of other injectable Incretins. For Zepbound, definitely too early. But we strongly believe that patients will be motivated when they see the benefits of the drug. And there will, of course, be many factors impacting both supply, macroeconomic and microeconomic, but we are convinced that there will be a final duration of treatment also for obesity since when we look into even [indiscernible] in Type 2 diabetes, more than a 12-month period of adherence is considered long. But encouraging data in Type 2 diabetes so far. And with Zepbound, we will see, that will for sure be an end of duration based upon what we have seen in other chronic diseases, but we believe that the features itself will be motivating for patients. Operator : The next question is coming from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live. Akash Tewari : So David, at JPMorgan, you made an interesting comment on orforglipron, where you mentioned the molecule has lots to prove here. Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by this? And what's your confidence on orfo's CDI profile? It seems to have a bit of CYP3A4 inhibition. So will this drug be able to get dosed with SGLT2s, given they were excluded in some of your earlier studies? David Ricks : I would frame like why I said that, but maybe Specific DDI question in the SGLT2 coadministration. I just said that because we're just starting the Phase III. And we all know small molecule, there's a bit of empiricism in terms of eliminating safety risk. And of course, every day, as we expose more patients to the drug and we have higher doses, that's a good day where we don't announce that the drug has a problem. At some point, we reached a lot of confidence. We just weren't at that point. We're not at it now. I think we're running the Phase III experiment and we need to discharge the off-target safety that is inherent in small molecule discovery, and we've seen in this class from others. But nothing specific on my mind. Maybe Dan can further reassure us. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Dave, of course, that's just the normal Phase III types of risk, new safety signals, which could always arise. I think with respect to DDI and coadministration with SGLT2s, we expect that to be possible, and we have that ongoing in our Phase III trials. There are patients who achieve -- will be just with our base for orforglipron as well as other drugs like SGLT2s. Operator : The next question is from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live. Trung Huynh : Can I just ask your thoughts on GIP agonism versus antagonism, given data yesterday from a competitor suggesting more limited effects on things like blood pressure and lipid modifications. Just how differentiated do you think an agonism approach is versus antagonism and why you think agonism is the way forward? Joe Fletcher : Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Well, first of all, it's an unfair comparison. We have so much data now on the benefits of GIP agonism from tens of thousands of participants in randomized clinical trials for Tirzepatide. So we're extremely confident here about the benefits of GIP agonism. Adding to that data, we have experimented with a pure GIP one agonist that doesn't have any GLP-1 and we reported the benefits there in our Phase I study. We're contrasting that here to a small Phase I study that was recently published with a drug that has both GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism. I noted in that publication, the GIP antagonism is at a much lower affinity. So it probably only starts to antagonize GIP at very high doses. It's probably a question for that company. But I noted at the high doses actually an increase in free fatty acids and complete attenuation of the decrease in triglycerides in the clinical trial. Those are some effects that we attribute to GIP.  And so I'm not surprised that antagonism of GIP is starting to have some negative effects once that kicks in. We also see GIP agonism as having positive benefits on tolerability, reducing potentially nausea and vomiting. Then again, I think maybe at the higher doses, you could probably see some hints of the opposite effect with antagonism. So pretty glad with the decision we took, and let's see how the field continues to evolve. Operator : The next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is live. Carter Gould : I guess over the prior two earnings calls, there have been at least an acknowledgment that CMOs were going to be part of the equation going forward for supply on the Incretin side. I guess, does the development fee yesterday have any sort of direct or indirect impacts as you think about that part of the equation going forward? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Carter. Anat, do you want to field that? Anat Ashkenazi : Sure. So we've, and I've mentioned on this call as well that we have very expensive expansion agenda, which does include third parties. While our strategy is and has always been to develop more internally, we do have third parties as well. So we saw the announcement that came out from NOVO yesterday regarding the intent to acquire Catalent. And we certainly have questions about that transaction and need to learn more. And we don't know, Catalent is an integral part or a manufacturer of both commercial and pipeline products for the industry especially in diabetes and obesity, and we have products with these sites as well. So our focus today is on ensuring that the continuity of supply of medicine for patients is uninterrupted as well as we intend on holding Catalent accountable to their contract with us as we look and we gain more information on this proposed transaction. Operator : The next question is coming from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James, your line is live. James Shin : I just want to circle back to Carter's question. Given Lilly is well-capitalized and manufacturing capacity being the priority, I mean, could you expect more buy versus build to get around some of the technical bottlenecks and the nontrivial FDA process? I just want to get your thoughts there. Joe Fletcher : Dave? David Ricks : Yes, maybe I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the question, James. As I mentioned on the earlier question related to Orforglipron, we are not -- we don't think of ourselves as capital-constrained, buying or building in the space. The reality is there just isn't built capacity that's available. Most of it that's being used is already deployed against the leading products in the GLP-1 space, at least any at scale and new capacity has a lead time of three to four years. So all of the things that are coming online now, like we mentioned today, are very large site in Concord, North Carolina. That's a big node of capacity for the sector and certainly for Lilly. I mean, that was announced two and a half years ago and it will just begin production at the end of this year. So that's the problem. And why is that? Well, of course, greenfield building is difficult, repurposing is difficult, but also these are technically complex facilities. There's not an infinite number of people who know how to set them up. And the supply chain for the machines that make the products is also constrained. So at this point, I don't think there's an easy way forward. And I think even in yesterday's announcements, we have a lot of questions about that. But I think even the purchaser or our competitors said it will take many years for them to be able to increase capacity within that purchase. So it's just not an easy problem to solve. I think that over time, it will ease. There'll be more capacity brought online by us, our competitor and maybe others, including third parties and new technology will emerge like Orforglipron or other oral options, that tap into a different asset base. So I know it's frustrating for investors, it's frustrating for us. It's even more frustrating for patients but it's just sort of the situation we're in is that we steady gains in manufacturing over the coming several years and perhaps bigger gains after that. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Dave. Our next question? Operator : The next question is from Rajesh Kumar from HSBC. Rajesh, your line is live. Rajesh Kumar : Hi there. Can you give us some color on, you know, how the access with employers is playing out? Are you getting exclusive access for your drugs or you're being added to the existing access your competitors' drugs have? And what is the nature of discussion, especially given that, you know, the pound is priced at a more attractive list price? I'm assuming with rebate, the differences might be a bit smaller, but any color there might be super helpful. Joe Fletcher : Yeah. Thanks, Rajesh. I think we covered that in Chris Schott's question earlier. I don't know if Patrick has anything to add or if we could just move on. Patrik Jonsson : I think the only addition would be that we are always aiming for open access. We believe that's important for the providers and the patients we are serving. So that's going to be our aim when it comes to employer opt-in as well. And we believe a move by pricing set down 22% below the competition, despite launching with a best-in-class profile, is also a good signal for increased and enhanced employer opt-in. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Patrick. Paul, next question. We have time for maybe two more. Next question? Operator : Certainly. The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew, your line is live. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Could you talk to your scenario planning for post-2032 when the potential exists for generic somatocytes to be launched? There seems to be significant interest and investment in capacity expansion. Now, obviously, this is complex, as you outlined, given not just API, but fit and finish and IP and the rest of it. But I'm just curious how you think about that in terms of future-proofing your business against step edits and other thinking about your broader Inquity portfolio? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Andrew. It's a very long-term question. I'll pass over to Anat to talk about 2032 and beyond. Anat Ashkenazi : We do look at 2032, and we actually do look beyond. And the way we look at our business, it is a long-term business. It's not a business that changes every year or two. So we do look at the long-term horizon, both in terms of the commercial products as well as what's coming through the pipeline and as we think through the events of that next freeze, whether for our products or those of competitors, our way of managing through that is to bring new breakthrough innovation to the marketplace. So to raise the bar on our own innovation, we don't wait for that to occur or happen by competition, but to bring something into the market that provides a meaningfully improved outcome for patients. So in this specific example, you use the GLTs, Shirley True's appetite brought in a higher bar for weight loss for patients with chronic weight management. And [indiscernible], that Dan referenced in his comments, currently in Phase III has the potential to bring even further improved outcome for patients. So that's how we see that. In terms of capacity and one of the questions is on whether companies should be or shouldn't be building, given that there is a patent expiry at the end, we do look at that and we look at the long-term horizon. But certainly, the investments in a metro facility, for example, the ones we've just mentioned, whether it's in Concord, North Carolina or Research Triangle Park, between the two of them, it's about a $4 billion investment, are certainly a good investment of our capital, given that size of opportunity over the long term. I will say that as you think about potential for either generic or biosimilar entry in this space, in general, it will require quite a massive investment in capital. Just the sites that I've mentioned today in the call and we've talked about for the past year or so total about $11 billion, and that's on top of already substantial network we have around the globe, primarily in the U.S. and Europe for production. So as you think about entering into that space, it will require some significant capital commitments. Joe Fletcher : Maybe a final question, Paul, and then we'll wrap up. Operator : The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live. Timothy Anderson : So one of the competitor data, obviously, everyone is watching as the Amgen data this year. And their messaging is around longer dosing frequency, monthly dosing and then possibly a greater effect of weight loss off-therapy. So can you comment on your views of the value of extended dosing like monthly or longer? And then do you believe in that argument about efficacy being sustained off-therapy? Or is that just a function of the fact that this drug lasts longer? Joe Fletcher : Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : I'll start with the second, and then maybe Patrik will weigh in on potential value here although that could be a good question for Amgen. Look, I think the sustainability data I saw in that publication are a bit underwhelming. It's a very high-dose drug at half-life of an antibody. So just based on plasma concentrations, that would be extended to -- expected to remain there after a month or two. It doesn't surprise me, but what we're seeing is that at doses that are reasonably well tolerated, if there were any doses that are reasonably well tolerated, weight loss is lower than what we would need to see to take a molecule to Phase III for sure. And sustainability doesn't appear to be at all differentiated. Patrik Jonsson : Only addition would be that when we look at the market research, of course, convenience is one factor, but it's not necessarily the most important factor when it comes to provider and consumer selecting treatment. So I'm really excited about the we have in our hands. Of course, Tirzepatide remaining a foundational treatment for obesity, but also with the addition of orforglipron and also the opportunities here to look into options with additional non-weight loss-dependent pharmacology to complement the assets we have in the pipeline. Joe Fletcher : Dave, do you want to wrap this up? A - David Ricks : Yes, absolutely. That's good, Joe. Thanks. We appreciate everyone participating today and, of course, your interest in the company. 2023 was a really productive year for Lilly, and we look forward to continued momentum in 2024 with a strong guide today. Thanks again for dialing in. And please follow up with Joe and the IR team if you have additional questions that weren't answered. Thanks. Operator : Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 2. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note, our commentary will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Joe. We're pleased with our Q1 results and the continued momentum in our business, which positions us well for accelerated growth as this year progresses. Our focus is to bring innovative medicines to people in need. And in 2024, we're investing in our people, our launches, expanding our pipeline of new medicines, including through business development, and of course, accelerating the needed capacity in our manufacturing network. Results this quarter represent a continuation of the strong growth we delivered in 2023. On Slide 4, you can see details of the financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 26% in Q1 with our new products growing nearly $1.8 billion compared with the same period last year. We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, the approval of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery device for Mounjaro in Europe, submission of mirikizumab in the U.S. and in the EU for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, the resubmission of lebrikizumab in the U.S. for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and the initiation of our Phase III study for lepodisiran, evaluating efficacy and reducing cardiovascular risk. Lilly's top priority is to ensure we execute on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. We recently signed an agreement to acquire an injectable medicine facility from Nexus Pharmaceuticals in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. This state-of-the-art facility has been FDA approved, and we are targeting to initiate production at the end of 2025. We broke ground earlier this month on our previously announced parenteral manufacturing site in Germany. And in existing facilities, we are working to maximize output and productivity to meet demand. The recent EMA approval and upcoming launch of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery life for Mounjaro will unlock new supply capacity for Europe and other international markets. While we are also seeing meaningful progress in the ramp of new lines in existing Lilly and CDMO sites for the United States. We continue to make progress against our plans to increase manufacturing capacity, the most ambitious expansion plan in our company's history. Lastly, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends during the first quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q4 earnings call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. So now let me turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 financial results. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenue growth of 26% was driven by new products, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 78.4% in Q1 2023 to 82.5% in Q1 2024. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, variable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improved production costs. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12% primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting current and future launches as well as increased compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 27%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as a onetime charge of approximately $75 million associated with the termination of the Verzenio prostate program. In Q1, we recognized acquired IPR&D charge of $111 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.10. Operating income increased 63% in Q1 driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 11.9% compared to 12.8% in Q1 2023 driven by a larger net discrete tax benefit reflected in Q1 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. We delivered earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1, a 59% increase compared to Q1 2023, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.10 from acquired IPR&D charges in both periods. On Slide 7, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 28% in Q1 driven by growth of Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. Unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler backorders of Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound at quarter end. Realized prices in the U.S. increased 16%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics. Moving to Europe. Revenue growth was once again strong, increasing 29% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume from Verzenio and Mounjaro as well as payments associated with the distribution and divestiture agreements. Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by decreased volume for Trulicity and a partnership milestone in the base period.  Price declined 5% in the quarter. Moving to China. Q1 revenue increased 4% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Tyvyt, partially offset by Olumiant and Cialis. Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 31% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, Verzenio and Jardiance. Slide 8 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales increased 40% in Q1, driven by continued volume growth in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $50 million worldwide, representing an acceleration in sequential quarterly growth following the December 2023 approval for the CLL indication. We're looking forward to potentially making this medicine available to even more patients as future Phase III trials read out. Next in Q1, Mounjaro sales were $1.8 billion globally, and $1.5 billion in the U.S., up from $568 million and $536 million in Q1 2023, respectively. Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue for Mounjaro in the U.S. was impacted by a onetime benefit from changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in Q4 2023 as well as lower inventory in the channel in Q4 2024 and a strong demand. Access level across commercial and Part D were consistent with high levels we communicated on our last earnings call and near parity with established injectable incretin medicines. The demand for tirzepatide is very strong. And each week, hundreds of thousands of people fill scripts from Mounjaro and Zepbound. Yet we understand the frustration from those facing prescription delays or uncertainties yet in their medicine. While we are working tirelessly to ramp supply and expect meaningful increases in shipment volumes in the second half of the year, demand continues to outstrip even increased supply. We remain on track to meet expectations we set earlier this year, the production of saleable doses of incretin medicine in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5x the saleable doses in the second half of 2023.  In the short to midterm, we expect sales growth to primarily be a function of the quantities we can produce and ship. Outside the U.S., we're delighted that the multi-dose KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro was recently approved in the EU, adding to the U.K. approval earlier this year. This approval applies to both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management indication as they are under the single brand in Europe. While timing for launch will vary by country, we expect to start launching in the EU in coming weeks. In Q1, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 26%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 30% driven by lower volume, primarily due to supply constraints and competitive dynamics. In addition, sales in international markets were impacted by measures we have taken to minimize disruption to existing patients, including communicating to health care professionals to not start new patients on Trulicity. Turning to Slide 9. We have seen exceptionally strong U.S. launch progress for Zepbound with over $0.5 billion in sales in Q1. We're rapidly building out access for Zepbound in the U.S. And as of April 1, we have approximately 67% access in the commercial segment. As a reminder, patients' access to this market is a two-step process typically require individual employers to opt in to an anti-obesity medicine rider following PBM coverage. We are continuing to focus on broadening access, both with PBMs and for employer opt-ins and early progress is encouraging. On Slide 10, we provide an update on capital allocation. Slide 11 shows updated 2024 financial guidance. Given the strength we're seeing in our business and projections for continued acceleration expected in the second half of the year, we're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $2 billion on the top and bottom end of the range to be between $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion. This increase is primarily due to the strong performance of Mounjaro and Zepbound and greater visibility and confidence into our production expansion for the remainder of 2024.  With this update, year-over-year revenue growth of the company is now expected to be approximately 26% at the midpoint or approximately 35% for the core business, which excludes the impact from global divestitures.  Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 32% to 34% on a reported basis and 33% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis, representing further margin expansion. We're reaffirming guidance for other income and expense and tax rate, which now takes into consideration Q1 results. Based on these updates, and inclusive of Q1 IPR&D charges of $0.10 per share, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.05 to $13.55 on a reported basis and $13.50 to $14 on a non-GAAP basis. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. Let me start with our exciting announcement from earlier this month. That was the positive Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-OSA studies, which evaluated tirzepatide for treatment of adults with obesities and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea known as OSA. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA can have serious cardiometabolic complications contributing to hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and even type 2 diabetes. The need is significant. OSA impacts 80 million people in the U.S. with more than 20 million people suffering from moderate to severe OSA. We also know that a substantial majority, approximately 70% of people with OSA also live with obesity.  While there are pharmaceutical treatments for the excessive daytime sleepiness associated with OSA, tirzepatide could potentially be the first pharmacological treatment for the underlying disease. As shown on Slide 12, SURMOUNT-OSA was comprised of two separate trials run under one master protocol. Study 1 evaluated tirzepatide in participants not currently on positive airway pressure or PAP therapy, while Study 2 evaluates tirzepatide in patients who had used PAP for at least 3 months prior to the study and plans to continue PAP therapy during the entire course of the trial. A total of 469 participants were enrolled across these studies. Each study randomized participants to either maximum tolerated dose approved for tirzepatide, which can be 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or to placebo. And patients were followed on therapy for 52 weeks. On Slide 13, we show the results of Study 1. For the efficacy estimate on mean Apnea-Hypopnea Index, or AHI, tirzepatide led to a mean reduction of 27.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 4.8 events per hour for placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant. AHI baseline values were 52.9 and AHI was reduced by 55% in the tirzepatide arm. We also saw a mean body rate reduction of 18.1% for tirzepatide treatment consistent with our expectations for the study. This was, of course, also statistically significant versus placebo. On Slide 14, we show the results of Study 2. In this population, for the efficacy [ estimand ], tirzepatide led to a mean AHI reduction of 30.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 6.0 events per hour for placebo. The baseline AHI was 46.1% in the tirzepatide arm and mean AHI reduction was 62.8%. Again, we saw impressive weight loss with a mean body rate reduction of 20.1% from baseline. These results were also all highly statistically significant. In both studies, the overall safety profile was similar to previously reported SURMOUNT and SURPASS trials. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, with the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events for patients treated with tirzepatide being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and constipation. Prior to the study readout, we noted investor questions about what level of weight loss we would see given several factors that were uniquely combined in the study of tirzepatide. First, the primary aim of the study was not treatment of obesity. Second, that the population was approximately 70% males, in whom weight loss can be harder to achieve with incretin medicines. Third, there's a particularly high baseline BMI in this population. And finally, the use of the 10- or 15-milligram maximum tolerated dose approach. We were therefore highly reassured to see weight loss observed across the two studies at 52 weeks was nearly 20% despite this difficult-to-treat population. Consistent with other Phase III studies of tirzepatide at the 52-week time point, we did not see weight loss plateau. We'll present detailed results of SURMOUNT-OSA during a symposium at ADA on June 21. Additionally, we plan to submit to the FDA and other global regulatory agencies beginning midyear. Moving to the other updates across our portfolio. Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 26, and Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. We're pleased to share that results were positive in QWINT-4, the first Phase III study of insulin efsitora alfa, our once-weekly basal insulin. This study evaluated efsitora compared to insulin glargine in adult participants with type 2 diabetes who are on multiple daily insulin injections. In the coming weeks, we expect to report top line results from QWINT-4 as well as QWINT  T-2 which is evaluating efsitora compared to degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who are naive to basal insulin. Together, these are the first 2 of 5 studies in the efsitora Phase III program. Additional updates in our late-stage diabetes and obesity pipeline include results of the EMPACT-MI study, showing Jardiance had a 10% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time-to-first hospitalization due to heart failure or all-cause mortality versus placebo, which did not reach statistical significance. We've completed enrollment for SURMOUNT-MMO with over 15,000 participants, and for both orforglipron studies in chronic weight management, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2, which together enrolled 4,500 participants. Finally, we've now initiated the [ TRANSCEND ] Phase III program studying retatrutide in type 2 diabetes. In the cardiovascular disease area, we're excited to have initiated the Phase III trial for lepodisiran, the subcutaneous injectable siRNA. This study will evaluate the efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes for participants with high lipoprotein A, who have cardiovascular disease or at a risk of heart attack or stroke. We are evaluating the efficacy of lepodisiran in both secondary and high-risk primary prevention. And we hope this will one day offer health care providers a treatment option for a broad group of patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to high LP(a) levels. Earlier in our diabetes and obesity pipeline, we've now initiated a Phase II monotherapy study evaluating eloralintide, our selective amylin receptor agonist in obesity. Turning to oncology. We made the decision to terminate for futility, the Phase III CYCLONE 3 trial evaluating Verzenio in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer following an interim analysis. This concludes development of Verzenio in prostate cancer following last quarter's announcement that the CYCLONE 2 study did not meet its primary endpoint. In early oncology development, we've initiated Phase I trials for two new assets. The first is our Nectin-4 ADC, which came from our acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics. The second is PNT2001, which came from our acquisition of POINT Biopharma. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in our oncology portfolio and expect 2024 to be particularly productive. Along with the Nectin-4 ADC and PNT2001 start, we expect at least three other new molecules to enter the clinic this year. We look forward to sharing more details with the investment community at an oncology-focused investor event hosted by the Lilly Oncology team. This event will take place on the evening of Sunday, June 2 in Chicago in conjunction with the ASCO annual meeting and will also be available via webcast. We plan to provide an update on our oncology strategy and pipeline opportunities. Additional details will be available soon regarding this event. Turning to Neuroscience. Last month, we announced that the FDA plans to convene a meeting of the peripheral and CNS Drugs Advisory Committee to discuss donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We expect the advisory committee meeting will take place in mid-2024, but the exact date will be confirmed when it appears in the Federal Register. We expect the focus to be around the safety and efficacy profile of donanemab, along with unique aspects of the clinical program. We remain confident in donanemab's potential to offer very meaningful benefits to patients and look forward to addressing the FDA's questions in this form. Additionally, we made the decision to discontinue investigation of GBA1, our gene therapy assets in Gaucher disease type 2. Phase II studies in Parkinson's disease and Gaucher disease type 1 are still underway and have not been impacted by this decision. Finally, in immunology, we've submitted mirikizumab to the FDA and EMA for approval for use in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In the U.S., we've resubmitted lebrikizumab's application to the FDA for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This is following a complete response letter based on inspection findings of the third-party manufacturer. As a reminder, the letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package safety or label. We expect regulatory action in the second half of this year. We're also announcing that in the coming months, we'll be initiating Phase III studies evaluating lebrikizumab in two new indications : chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and allergic rhinitis due to perennial allergens. Lebrikizumab will be the first biologic to be evaluated in Phase III for allergic rhinitis. We're optimistic about the potential of lebrikizumab to be an important treatment option in these patient populations as well as in atopic dermatitis. In earlier-stage immunology development, we've advanced our CD19 antibody into Phase II for multiple sclerosis. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. David Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress in our first quarter. Strong revenue growth in Q1 was driven by our recent product launches, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. We expect acceleration in revenue growth through the second half of the year as supply of incretin medicines continues to ramp. Significant advances in our pipeline include top line data from tirzepatide and SURMOUNT-OSA, approval of the KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro in the EU, submission of mirikizumab and lebrikizumab as well as initiation of lepodisiran  Phase III study, as Dan just mentioned. We are continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, internal and external pipeline development and our manufacturing expansion agenda. This is to sustain our long-term growth outlook. So now let me turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and to conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] Paul, please provide instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for our first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Congrats on the progress here. I just had a question, just was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the capacity dynamics that are leading to the guidance raise today. Specifically just looking for little more color, is this more U.S. or international? And should we read this as more capacity in the system than you expected or just a faster ramp of the new plant and maybe the same overall capacity as you exit the year? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Anat to talk about the guidance raise. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks for the question, Chris. And as we've mentioned earlier in the year when we issued guidance, we said that we expect capacity and supply to ramp towards the second half of the year, and that's what we're seeing. Now as a reminder, we do have quite a large number of nodes across our supply chain that have to come online or ramp capacity. We are -- if you look at everything we have under construction, or ramping up, we have six sites right now between the two sites in North Carolina, a site in Ireland, two sites in Indiana, a site in Germany and then a seventh one that we just purchased, they are all either ramping up or under construction. And there are multiple nodes across that supply chain that have to become operational, which requires approval, et cetera, for three products, depending on which product runs on which line, that are planned throughout the year. Now that we're 4 months into the year, we have greater visibility into that -- into these nodes of capacity and feel more confident. Just as one example, the approval of the KwikPen in Europe that just came in slightly ahead of our expectation gives us additional confidence in our ability to launch KwikPen for patients in Europe. So it is across our sites globally as well as ramping up capacity with partners or CDMOs as well as in existing sites where we're making investments to expand where we can or ramp up capacity. So it's across our supply chain. Operator : The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : I have a question regarding the pricing. So if you look at the script trend, it seems like there was a little bit of adverse relationship in the pricing versus fourth quarter. Can you comment on that? And how should we think about the cadence of price volume over the quarters for the year? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mohit. You didn't say it, but I assume you're talking about Mounjaro and Zepbound so I'll hand over to Patrik to make some commentary on net price. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Mohit. When you look at the pricing of Mounjaro, I think it's important to take into account that in the Q4 earnings, we announced a onetime adjustment for Mounjaro in Q4 that was quite significant. So it was a onetime adjustment in the base of Q4. When we look forward for the first half of 2024, it's important to have in mind that we also terminated the $25 saving card 6/30/2023, but patients that were on are grandfathered until 6/30/2024. So there would probably be some benefits during the first half of 2024 for Mounjaro. But from the second half of this year, we should expect to see typical pricing headwinds for Mounjaro as well. Operator : The next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : I wanted to focus a quick second on Part D reimbursement dynamics, if I may. And my question is, will tirzepatide be considered differently than a \"weight loss drug\" to secure Part D reimbursement? And the new indications like sleep apnea, will they considered an applicable drug and not get lumped up as a broad \"weight loss drug\"? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Umer. I'll go to Patrik for that question. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Umer. I think with the announcement made by the CMS early April to reimburse comorbidities for obesity based upon the SELECT trial, we're also confident that with the new data that we presented just weeks ago in terms of obstructive sleep apnea, that's going to be reimbursed in Medicare Part D. And we expect similarly for other comorbidities and the readout of HFpEF, assuming that's positive and approved, and later on with the mobility-mortality outcome study. Still, our true north is really to get the true Treat and Reduce Obesity Act cost, and we strongly believe it's not a matter of if but when. We don't see it likely to pass in 2024, but there is still a small likelihood that that's going to happen. Operator : The next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : Great. So really just wanted to ask, Dan, as you have assessed the Phase II SURMOUNT data in NASH, just interested to know how you are thinking about those data and the opportunity for tirzepatide in that setting or perhaps if retatrutide remains the right target molecule to move forward there? We've had a lot of speculation around some of the comments from the last quarter and just trying to firm that up and also when we're likely to see those data, I believe, they're expected at EASL, but if that is possible to confirm. Joe Fletcher : Dan? Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Seamus. So I'll start with the last part there. Yes, the abstract was accepted and will be presented at EASL early June. So that will be the opportunity to see the full NASH package from that Phase II trial. Like we said in the last call, really exciting data. We shared some of the top line. I think tirzepatide can have a profound effect on this disease. It's a Phase II trial. Next steps here are to discuss with the FDA what the best path forward could be for tirzepatide. You're pointing out, though, that we have another choice in retatrutide which, based on biomarker data from earlier studies, could also have a profound effect of this disease. That molecule has the addition of glucagon, which is likely to have additional benefits in the liver. So important opportunities ahead and good-to-have options as we go into these discussions with regulators. I think for MASH, like other obesity-related or metabolic related diseases, Lilly has a pretty broad portfolio, and we'll just continue to push the science to make the best possible medicines for patients. Operator : The next question will be from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : You showed a slide, Zepbound has NBRx share market of 57% end of Q1. That makes it pretty clear that the strongest drug wins. So on that topic, just your latest thinking on upcoming competitor readouts and how they'll stack up to Zepbound on metrics of weight loss and blood sugar. So specifically, CagriSema from Novo and Amgen's 133. I know it's just the best guess, but it's what we get asked to do. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim. Okay. I'll maybe hand to Dan for some comments. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, sure, Tim. It's probably more of your job than ours to speculate on competitor readouts but I'll take a stab at it since you asked. I think on AMG 133, we've just seen really a small amount of data. So probably anything is possible and like you will be interested to see their results. Of course, there's arguments that can be heard about GIP agonism versus antagonism. We've placed our bets, and we like the data we got with GIP agonism. On CagriSema, of course, adding more agonism on different pathways on top of GLP-1 is a good idea. That's what we have with tirzepatide, is a dual agonist. So CagriSema makes sense. And you'll note that we've advanced our amylin agonist to Phase II. Tirzepatide already is a dual agonist. Retatrutide is already a triple agonist. There's probably more we could do here at Lilly. I think across our portfolio, in Phase I and Phase II, we have nine assets that are marked for diabetes or obesity. Many of them could lead to additive weight loss on top of established mechanisms plus two more in Phase III, of course. So we have a strong portfolio here. I think tirzepatide still has unsurpassed efficacy at weight loss, but we're preparing for our next generation assets as well. Operator : The next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Congrats on all the progress. Just was wondering if you can tell us if the IQVIA prescription data is an accurate representation of tirzepatide volumes or if it's been underrepresented at all given LillyDirect and what you know about how much is flowing through that channel? And if it is underrepresented, can you help quantify any delta for us. Joe Fletcher : Thanks for the question, Terence. I'll hand to Patrik for commentary on IQVIA and LillyDirect. Patrik Jonsson : Thanks very much, Terence. When it comes to LillyDirect, I think we are very pleased with the start. And when we look at the utilization by consumers, it's gaining traction by weeks here. If we look at the TRx data of Q1, particularly for Zepbound, it's relatively low volume that goes through LillyDirect, slightly higher in terms of NBRx. It's our understanding that what goes through LillyDirect is not by default captured by IQVIA. But IQVIA has a methodology in place to estimate what goes through LillyDirect as well. Operator : The next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash Tewari : So your team presented data on a monotherapy GIP agonist at ADA last year, but it looks like you are moving the amylin into Phase II. Can you talk about why amylin might be preferred versus GIP as a maintenance regimen for obesity? And how your product could defer versus others when it comes to half-life and preferential agonism versus calcitonin and amylin? Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Akash. I'll hand to Dan for a commentary on our amylin. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, there are a lot of good questions in there. Thanks for following so closely. So on the GIP, the long-acting molecule, I think primarily in that experiment, we were excited to show the benefits of isolated GIP agonism, just to answer some mechanism of action questions around tirzepatide. But as you point out, there's potential for that molecule for other indications or as a monotherapy or combination with other mechanisms. But of course, since tirzepatide already includes GIP agonism, we're also excited to explore other mechanisms. So that's where [ elora ], which is 1 of 9 different mechanisms, as I said a moment ago that we're exploring the long-acting amylin moved forward to Phase II. That has potential perhaps as a combination therapy, perhaps as a maintenance therapy, perhaps as a monotherapy, there's a lot to explore. It's still very early as it is for all of our mechanisms. So we'll keep investing and as we have data to share, we'll do that. Operator : The next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung Huynh : Just back on CMS recently broadening its coverage for Wegovy for certain heart conditions. I appreciate you mentioned that TROA is the main goal. But do you expect Zepbound to get added to CMS in a similar way as Wegovy? And when could this happen? Could this be after the heart failure data in 3Q? Or do we have to wait for the CVOT data? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Trung. I'll let Patrik respond. Patrik Jonsson : Thanks, Trung. Now based upon what CMS stated early April, we actually expect to get obstructive sleep apnea for Zepbound covered by CMS and Medicare at the time of launch. And the next one then would be HFpEF assuming a positive readout and approval. And the third one would be the MMO indication. That's the sequence of our plans, assuming everything goes according to plan and we get the approval for both. Operator : The next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : You guys have been asked on this before, I'm sure, but can you just review the rationale in utilizing the KwikPen just for outside the U.S. markets like Europe. I wasn't sure why this couldn't apply to the U.S. market and if this also could be a means to relieve capacity looking forward? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Paul -- Dave, you want to weigh in? . David Ricks : Yes. Sure. And Ilya can add to this. As we think we've said on several calls now, our goal is to pursue all of the above, basically as it relates to supply options, recognizing the tremendous demand and unmet need and the constraints that exist in scaling the supply chain. So KwikPen uses existing assets, so there was less time lag. We see this first in the U.K. and now in Europe as a way to meet the needs of those patients. But we haven't ruled it out in other jurisdictions. And so we'll continue to look at every option we can to meet the needs of patients with obesity and overweight as well as with diabetes. Operator : The next question is from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry Holford : I'm going to take a different topic here. Looking LP(a), your new product you've now said that you're taking into Phase III. Can you confirm whether you've published new Phase II data, haven't found any. So if I'm correct, when  might we see that published? And can you confirm what dose and frequency of administration you're looking at from that Phase III study? And I guess that you appear to be positioned third in that race, would be interested to hear how you expect your drug to be differentiated versus the competitor as that's already in Phase III. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Kerry. So a good multipart question, but on Lp(a), happy to talk about lepodisiran. So Dan, do you want to comment on this? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Kerry, for the good questions here. You're right, we haven't yet published a Phase II data. But I think we just recently were able to publish the Phase I data. That was really exciting and well received. I think one of the things that people noted in our Phase I data was a very long durability of action and a very deep reduction in Lp(a) levels following a single dose of lepodisiran. We now have, of course, a Phase II data in hand and use that to design and begin the Phase III trial. I think we haven't quite disclosed dose or frequency yet, but I'm sure that will happen in time. You asked about differentiation. I think there's probably a couple of different potentials for differentiation here versus a shorter-acting ASO and a siRNA that are both in Phase III studies. Maybe first is the depth of clearance of Lp(a), we don't know how much you have to reduce Lp(a) to lead to benefits in cardiovascular outcomes and whether there's a threshold effect or a floor to this. So the depth of clearance is one. The second, as you asked about, could be frequency of administration or durability of action, those two being closely linked. And the third, of course, is the population that's being studied into -- I noted we're studying secondary as well as primary prevention here. So I think we have a good package with multiple opportunities for differentiation and eager to test the Lp(a) hypothesis here this Phase III study. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve Scala : Given that based on all available metrics, the SURPASS-CVOT interim likely already has passed, can you confirm that the only way the trial would have stopped is if there were either a survival benefit or futility and not simply non-inferiority? And anything you can say regarding your confidence in eventually hitting superiority based on what you know so far? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Steve. Dan, do you want to take the question on SURPASS-CVOT? Daniel Skovronsky : Sure. Thanks, Steve. As you know, we do our best not to comment on interim analyses, although many of our different trials can incorporate interim analyses. But when we do talk about the risks, unintentional unblinding of results, for that reason, we prefer not to do that. You're right that the primary analysis of the study and the design is around noninferiority versus what we are ready to know to be a very good drug that reduces cardiovascular risk, and that's Trulicity. So it's designed as a noninferiority trial. Of course, when the final data come, we would be delighted to see even superiority. You asked about our confidence. Confidence continues to increase for this readout. In fact, as disclosed in the prepared remarks today, we got additional data here even from the OSA study that should make us feel more confident, not just the benefit in sleep apnea, which itself could lead to cardiovascular benefits, but actually the weight loss. And I think there are some concerns about weight loss of different populations and different trials and males, females, et cetera. So some of that was discharged here. So we remain excited and look forward to getting that data when the study's complete. Operator : The next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : I wanted to touch on donanemab with the AdCom approaching. Can you discuss how your -- if your confidence has changed in the asset? And maybe any specific points that you hope will be addressed during this discussion with these outside experts. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Evan. Anne, you want to discuss [ donanemab ] and AdCom? Anne White : Yes. Thanks so much for the question. And we are incredibly confident in donanemab's potential and the fact that it offers very meaningful benefits to people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and just the overall approvability of the package. We do look forward to seeing there's questions. We haven't received those yet. I think that what we'll anticipate really is discussions around the safety and efficacy of donanemab. And those -- the safety and efficacy profile remain very consistent with what we published and presented. So nothing new there. We do expect there's a couple of unique aspects to our trial that we anticipate they'll want to discuss. One is around limited duration dosing. We think this is an incredibly important feature of donanemab, the chance to stop dosing when you've cleared the plaques. And donanemab clears them robustly and rapidly so we think that allows for this limited duration dosing approach. So we really do look forward to getting into that data and having the advisers see that and respond to it. Another unique aspect is assessing tau at baseline. This is important for the field that we understand the prognostic factor of tau, and that was able to be earned. But what we saw in the trial was all patients benefited regardless of tau level with those early in the disease doing even better. It's one of the reasons that we remain so enthusiastic about TRAILBLAZER-3. And while Dan didn't mention that in his remarks, I think we remain even more enthusiastic about the opportunity to intervene earlier based on what we saw in that early population, the people with low tau and those that had no tau with such strong biomarker results. I think you probably remember the data that patients in the earliest part of our study had a 60% slowing. And we believe that could be even stronger as you get into the earlier patients that are preclinical. But maybe just one remark. In the meantime, though, this is not time loss. We'll continue to make sure the health care system is ready. We're going to make sure that we launch into an even stronger market with potential approval. So we're making the most of this time and look forward to the outcomes, as Dan said, in mid-'24 and answering any questions that they have. Operator : Next question will be from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. David Risinger : And let me add my congrats on the progress and the guidance raise. So my question is on orforglipron. Novo Nordisk has raised some concerns about the scalability of orforglipron manufacturing given its complexity. I haven't spoken to Novo directly, but someone told me that they mentioned there are 35 steps in the process. I don't know if that's true. But could you please discuss how Lilly is building out its manufacturing capacity and whether the company expects to be able to meet global demand in the Western world after launch in 2026? Or whether we, the investment community, should expect supply constraints and should be guarded about how we try to model orforglipron's ramp after launch? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. I'll hand over to our Dave Ricks here. David Ricks : Okay. Great. Dave, great to hear from you. I mean, first of all, it is true that orforglipron is a complicated large small molecule, a large small molecule, if you were, and there are many steps in the process. You can read about them in our patent filings, I think. But Lilly, maybe unlike other companies, we've made small molecules for a long time. We're capable of doing it. We understand how to put them together, and we've got a defined process to do it for orforglipron. So the API production, while a long process and maybe complicated relative to other small molecules, is something we're super confident in and have our arms around. The finish process is really the big advance over using injectables because here, we're just tablet stamping or tablet -- capsule making, which are dry processes we understand extremely well. I think the big gain here will be the fact that both for synthetic chemistry and capsule making and tablet making, there is already capacity on planet Earth that is significant. And so unlike the parenteral side where we've been talking about injectables, a new capacity needs to be built in which we're doing aggressively, as Anat commented on earlier. Here, there's a lot of partners we can access as well as our own substantial network for dry product finish and API production. So pretty confident here. Now will we stick the landing on exact doses and quantities in every instance? We're not guaranteeing that, but I think the picture will be quite a bit different should orforglipron prove to be safe and effective in the Phase III studies. Again, that's in '25, so we can expect launch maybe a year after that, and that's an important event in the time course of the incretin class. Operator : Next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : I just wanted to ask you about your next wave of obesity drug. It looks like you've got half a dozen of these in development. And where do you think you can most differentiate yourself? Joe Fletcher : Dan, do you want to comment on earlier phase obesity? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Louise. We're excited about that portfolio of earlier-stage obesity molecules. I think there's a number of opportunities for improvement over even an excellent drug like tirzepatide. We think about the quality of weight loss as one aspect. So for example, even on tirzepatide, we see the ratio of lean to fat mass approved as patients lose weight on these drugs. Could we make it improve even faster with the muscle stimulating agents like bimagrumab? But maybe that's under investigation. Tirzepatide is very well tolerated, but some people stop taking it because of GI side effects. Could we have drugs that have fewer side effects? Maybe that could be possible. Tirzepatide is given as a once a weekly injection. Most patients find that to be acceptable. But probably with less frequent injections, that could lower the burden on manufacturing and make it easier to use for patients. So that's another avenue of exploration. There are some patients who don't achieve their desired levels of weight loss even on a powerful drug like tirzepatide. And so that's another avenue. Finally, across different indications, and I spoke earlier of NASH, that are related to metabolic disease, there could be different activities that proved more or less beneficial for these other related diseases. So that's another avenue of differentiation. I think we're just at the beginning of probably what will be seen as a multi-decade investments in treating abnormal metabolism and all diseases that come with that. And I'm really proud and pleased that Lilly has what must be the strongest pipeline in this area in the industry. Operator : The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris. Paul, next question? Chris Shibutani : Can you hear me? Joe Fletcher : Oh,  yes, there you are. Go ahead, Chris. Chris Shibutani : Wanted to ask about the supply and dynamic -- and the demand and when those two might come closer together? Previously, Anat, you've been quite specific in your vocabulary and saying that, that was something that could possibly happen in 2025. Dave, you were in front of a group that we hosted and I think you gave a little bit of a broader range. What's the latest that you would like to communicate based upon all the progress that you're making, the acquisition of Wisconsin facility, et cetera, about a potential timing for that supply-demand dynamic to come closer together? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris. Anat? Anat Ashkenazi : Yes. Let me start on this. So I would say that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that the supply and demand situation will remain quite tight in the near term as well as the midterm. And just to clarify, it's not that we have a production issue. Our manufacturing facilities are progressing incredibly well, and I'm incredibly proud of the work done by our M&Q colleagues around the world. Clearly, we have sites working 24/7. We're doing construction overnight. We're making the right investments and so we're progressing rapidly as you've seen evidenced by the results as well as the raise we did for the year. But the demand is strong, which shouldn't be a surprise given the health benefits that these products provide to patients, highly efficacious and safe medicines. And I expect that this will continue through the year, even with the significant ramp that we have, and we'll add more supply across different presentations, both with the auto-injector as well as the KwikPen. But even with that, I expect that the demand will be -- will outpace supply through this year. Potentially next year, obviously, we'll see. We'll continue to invest and ramp as we go into next year, but it could be quite some time. We talked earlier about orforglipron, should we have positive Phase III readout that provides another relief valve in terms of just offering a different presentation, as Dave mentioned, which utilizes a different set of infrastructure within our manufacturing organization available capacity globally. So it will be in a stepwise fashion. We'll continue to update investors as we progress through the year and coming years. Operator : Next question will be from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter L. Gould: I wanted to dive into bimagrumab ahead of the Phase IIb data forthcoming. Can you talk for a bit around the importance of showing stat sig or clear dose response across the composition of the weight loss drivers and maybe as well as the importance of not blunting the overall weight loss as you contemplate a move to Phase III potentially? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Carter, for the question. Dan, you want to comment on bimagrumab? Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Carter. It's a good question. Bimagrumab is a very different mechanism of weight loss versus incretins but one that we think could be important in combination with incretins. So bimagrumab, we think will likely have important effects on adipose tissue as well as muscle mass. And so our hope is to see increased muscle mass and increased ratio, I should say, of lean to fat mass by combining bimagrumab with incretins. In this present study, it's being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with semaglutide at different doses. So we'll see if weight loss effects on fat tissue stack and we'll see if effects on lean body mass that we're seeing in previous bimagrumab monotherapy studies work in combination with incretin. Looking forward to seeing that data. Operator : The next question is coming from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Srikripa Devarakonda : Congrats on all the progress. I have a question about your radiopharma pipeline. You mentioned PNT2002 in your oncology pipeline. Can you talk about how you see that advancing? And given what you've seen so far, where you see this being placed in the landscape in terms of market share? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Kripa, for the question. Jake, calling you to maybe opine a little bit on our radioligand efforts, PNT2001 in particular? Jacob Van Naarden : Yes, happy to. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about bringing radiopharmaceuticals into the portfolio by way of the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, and we are supplementing that acquisition with additional work through our discovery labs and the ability to make these medicines ourselves. So I expect we'll have more to talk about in terms of additional medicines over the course of the next couple of years in addition to PNT2001. But specific to that question, 2001 is a PSMA-directed therapy for prostate cancer conjugated to actinium, the alpha emitter. And I think while actinium holds a lot of promise over lutetium, particularly in the context of creating double-stranded DNA breaks versus single stranded and the ability to perhaps drive more efficacy for patients of prostate cancer. I think one of the limitations of the existing agents is that they probably cause too much salivary gland toxicity to be real durable products. And so the POINT team designed a novel PSMA-directed ligand with increased tumor uptake relative to the salivary gland in order to drive more therapeutic index using actinium as the payload. So we're just getting started with the Phase I experience right now. So I don't have a lot to say about what we're seeing just yet. But the preclinical package looked really interesting and differentiated from the other PSMA ligands that exist out there. So we're looking forward to putting it through its Phase I paces, and we'll see what we have. Depending on the clinical profile, I think there's the potential to improve outcomes in patients that have already seen a lutetium-based agent maybe go ahead of that and compete with the lutetium-based agents or perhaps even go even earlier in therapy as PSMA expression really exists in the continuum of prostate cancer care. So more to come on that as we define the clinical profile in the Phase I. Joe Fletcher : Paul, I think we've got time for maybe one more question. We're right at 11. So maybe a final question in the queue. Operator : Okay. And the final question today is coming from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James Shin : I just wanted to try and reconcile the guidance lift with the 1.5x saleable doses being maintained. Joe Fletcher : Okay. James, maybe I'll give to Anat to talk about the guidance and how the guidance raise relates to the 1.5x dose comments. Anat Ashkenazi : So let's start with the 1.5 dose -- sellable dose comment that I made on the guidance call in February. So that reference is not a number of devices, but number of sellable doses. And as we ramp up capacity for KwikPen, recall that unlike the single-use vial or the auto-injector, that KwikPen is a multidose device that has multiple doses available for patients. That comment referred to the second half of this year versus the second half of last year. So we're expecting that total saleable doses this year in the second half will be at least 1.5x where we were second half of last year. That remains unchanged. But the level of confidence we have in our ability to progress on each node of our capacity that's coming online or will get approved, et cetera, has just increased. There are multiple of these throughout the year. Multiple of these have occurred. Some will occur as -- I gave the KwikPen as one example. Think about a construction of a site, for example, Concord in North Carolina, which we said will become operational by end of the year, and we'll start seeing products next year. That construction has concluded. Lines are installed, and we need to run qualifications, get approval, et cetera. There are multiple nodes of these across our own manufacturing sites as well as external and that they all need to come online to get to where we need in terms of the full year guidance. But our confidence as the year progresses -- as the year has progressed, our confidence in that has increased, but it remains the -- at least 1.5. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Anat. Great. Well, thanks for your time today, everyone, and we appreciate you participating in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. Please follow up with the IR team if you have any additional questions that we didn't address today, and have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lilly Q2 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2024 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; and Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Gordon Brooks, Interim Financial -- Chief Financial Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA. And we're also joined by Makela Irons, Mike Springate, Lauren Zurke of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 4. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Joe. It's an exciting time here at Lilly as our growth trajectory accelerated in the second quarter. Our investments in advancing innovative medicine are focused on manufacturing expansion are bringing Lilly medicines to more people around the world. On Slide 5, you can see details of the financial performance in the second quarter and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 36% in Q2 with our new products growing nearly $3.5 billion compared to the same period last year. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound is strong and growing as access and supply continue to expand. While weekly prescription volume was volatile in the first half of the year due to challenges fulfilling high demand, our progress on supply gives us confidence in our outlook. Q2 saw impressive performance across other areas of the business as well. Excluding the sale of the rights to Baqsimi last year, non-incretin growth was 17% worldwide with growth spread across geographies, including 25% growth in the United States. And our $3 billion increase in revenue guidance reflects our expectation that momentum will accelerate through the balance of the year. We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the approval of Kisunla, the brand name for donanemab in the U.S. for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the approval of Jaypirca in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors, the submission of tirzepatide in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity and the positive top line results from the SUMMIT Phase 3 trial evaluating tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. Lilly now has a significant opportunity to create new medicines through a broad internal portfolio and active business development to support our long-term growth. In obesity, our strategy is to comprehensively address this global public health crisis, pursuing opportunities against every rational mechanism, indication and dosage form. We are investing broadly in this disease and now have 11 new molecules currently in the clinic across multiple indications. We're also investing in a wide range of late-stage Phase 3 programs. We recently shared the positive data of tirzepatide in OSA and -- Orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 small molecule, has a comprehensive Phase 3 program underway in diabetes and obesity with nine trials currently running and readout starting next year. With tirzepatide, our GIP/GLP-1 glucan try agonist. We have initiated a broad Phase 3 development program studying the molecule in obesity, OSA, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular and renal outcomes as well as type 2 diabetes. These readouts start in 2026. Our top priority remains executing on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. In May, we announced plans to invest an additional $5.3 billion in our Lebanon, Indiana manufacturing sites, bringing our total investment there to $9 billion. We believe this is the largest single investment in synthetic medicine active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing in the history of the United States. Importantly, this expansion will enhance capacity to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for Zepbound and Mounjaro. Since 2020, we have committed more than $18 billion to build, upgrade or acquire facilities in the U.S. and Europe, and we began to see the benefit of these investments. We are making near-term progress to ramp production, including at new sites like Research Trial Park, existing Lilly sites and contract manufacturing organizations. Our Concur North Carolina site is progressing well. We're in the process of running validation and expect this facility will initiate production by the end of 2024 with product available to ship in 2025. We also continue to make progress on different presentations for tirzepatide. We have now launched our multidose quick pen in multiple markets outside the U.S. with positive early indicators of patient adoption. And in Gordon's remarks, he will preview our plans to launch vials here in the U.S. Lastly, in terms of external innovation. In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Morphic, a biopharma company developing oral -- therapies for treatment of serious chronic diseases, including a Phase 2 asset being evaluated in inflammatory bowel disease. On Slide 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. As we announced in June, Anat Ashkenazi resigned as Lilly's Chief Financial Officer to become the CFO of Alphabet. We wish Anat well in her new role and thank her for your partnership and leadership of our financial organization in the last 3 years. We have named Gordon Brooks Interim CFO as an internal and external search for Anat successor is currently underway. Gordon has been with the company for 29 years and also serves as our controller and the leader of the corporate strategy group for the company. In other leadership news, Alonzo Weems, our Executive Vice President of Enterprise Risk Management and our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, will retire at the end of the year after 27 years of service. And Melissa Seymour has joined the company as Executive Vice President of Global Quality and a member of the company's executive committee following John Norton's recent retirement. I want to thank Alonzo for his many years of service and welcome Melissa to the Lilly team. Now let me turn the call over to Gordon to review our Q2 financial results. Gordon Brooks : Thanks, Dave. So, I'm on Slide 7, which summarizes the financial performance in the second quarter of 2024. Second quarter revenue growth of 36% was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as Verzenio. When excluding revenue from the sale of rights to Baqsimi in Q2 of last year, revenue grew 46%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 79.8% in Q2 of '23 to 82% in Q2 of '24. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from favorable product -- and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher production costs. R&D expenses increased 15% driven by continued investment in our portfolio and in our people. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by promotional efforts associated ongoing and future launches as well as investments in our people. Operating income increased 90% in Q2, driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.5% in Q2 of '24 compared with 16.1% in Q2 of '23. The Q2 '24 tax rate reflects a mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, while the Q2 '23 rate reflected the impact of earnings from the sale of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $3.92 in Q2, an 86% increase compared to the prior year. Q2 '24 results include a negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.09 in the prior quarter, Q2 of '23. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 42% in Q2. Volume growth of 27% was driven by Zepbound, Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by sale of rights for Baqsimi in Q2 of '23 and declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 15%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics. As noted in our Q4 -- Q1 2024 earnings call, unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler back orders at the end of Q1. In Q2, we fulfilled the majority of these back orders, improving wholesaler stocking levels. We estimate that U.S. Mounjaro and Zepbound aggregate sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by channel stocking that we estimate totaled high teens to mid-20s as a percent of U.S. sales as we rebuilt inventory from extremely low levels in the spring and to account for the growth of these brands. We are pleased that the group's supply situation is reflected on the FDA shortage website, which currently shows all doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound, listed as available and the two lower doses of Trulicity as available. While wholesaler back orders in the U.S. have been reduced substantially, it's important to note that the pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, more so for medicines that require refrigeration and offer at several different doses. These factors may continue to result in variability in the patient experience at the pharmacy counter. While supply and demand has come into better balance, we expect increase in demand may result in periodic supply tightness for certain presentations and dose levels. We have a continued broad agenda to further increase supply, and we'll continue to look at all options. Today, we are excited to announce plans to further expand access to Zepbound with the launch of the 2.5-milligram and 5-milligram single-dose files in the coming weeks with more details to come at that time. In Europe, revenue grew 20% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro launch uptake in the U.K. and Germany. We also had strong volume growth from Verzenio, Jardiance, which was partially offset by decreased volume from Trulicity. Japan performance was strong in the second quarter with 15% revenue growth in constant currency. Volume growth of 21% was driven by uptake of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Moving to China. Q2 revenue increased 1% in constant currency. Growth was driven by -- Olumiant and Taltz, partially offset by Trulicity and Cialis. Mounjaro was recently approved in China for type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management. We have not yet announced expected launch timing in this market. Revenue in Rest of World increased 61% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro volume growth from demand and channel dynamics. Slide 10 provides additional perspective on performance across our product categories. Verzenio solid growth in the second quarter across major geographies with worldwide sales increasing 44%, driven by the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $92 million worldwide, which included a $19 million partner milestone payment related to Japan. Jaypirca continued impressive quarter-over-quarter growth, building on the brand's uptake from both the MCL and CLL patient populations. OMVOH is launched in the U.S. and 14 international markets with sales of $26 million in Q2. These launches continue to progress well with increasing patient starts. And in the U.S., we expect sales to accelerate as the product-specific code went live on July 1. Mounjaro sales in Q2 were $3.1 billion globally with $2.4 billion in the U.S. Revenue growth in the U.S. reflected continued strong demand as well as the improved channel dynamics discussed earlier. We're seeing solid uptake in Mounjaro outside the U.S., with sales in Q2 totaling $677 million. In the first half of the year, we launched the quick pen presentation in the U.K., Germany and the UAE. So far in Q3, we've also launched Mounjaro Quick Pen in Spain and plan to launch an additional market throughout 2024. In Q2, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 31%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 36% driven by lower volume, primarily due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints, partially offset by improved wholesaler stocking levels on services. Turning to Slide 11. We have an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We've seen exceptional growth trends for Zepbound that have accelerated as production has ramped leading to sales of over $1.2 billion in Q2. We are rapidly building our formulary coverage for Zepbound in the U.S. and as of July 1 had approximately 86% access in the commercial segment. We estimate over 50% of employers have opted into anti-obesity medicine coverage and see that modestly growing as we work to expand coverage. On Slide 12, we provide an update on our capital allocation. Slide 13 shows our updated 2024 financial guidance. We are raising our full year revenue outlook by $3 billion to be between $45.4 million and $46.6 billion. This increase is due to strong performance across our non-incretin medicines as well as Mounjaro and Zepbound. Additionally, we have improved clarity into the timing and pace of our production expansion and Mounjaro launches outside the U.S. We achieved a number of supply-related milestones in Q2 and have increased confidence regarding our expectation that production of salable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5 times the salable doses taken half of 2023. Based on the midpoint of the range, our updated guidance implies revenue growth of 38% in the second half of the year, below 31% in the first half. In the second half of the year, we expect a more significant growth in Q4 compared to Q3. Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 36% to 38% on a reported basis and 37% to 39% on a non-GAAP basis. For other income and expense, we now expect between $525 million and $425 million of expense on a reported basis, and between $400 million and $300 million of expense on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect lower expected net interest expense and the reported range reflects net losses on investments in equity securities through Q2 of '24. We have increased our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 15%, driven by changes in our forecasted mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $15.10 to $15.60 on a reported basis $16.10 to $16.60 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges -- the updates mentioned earlier as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q2 of $0.24. The reported range includes a charge in Q2 of '24 associated with anticipated litigation payments. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Gordon. It's been another busy quarter. I'll start with comments on the Kisunla FDA approval, then the tirzepatide heart failure Phase 3 readout. Then finally, I'll cover the rest of the updates for the quarter. We are, of course, very excited about the FDA approval of Kisunla for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This followed the June Advisory Committee meeting where we had another chance to present and discuss the compelling data package characterizing the safety and efficacy of this medicine. We were pleased by the discussion of the FDA advisers, particularly with regard to our data supporting stopping of Kisunla therapy when amyloid plaques are removed to minimal levels. In our trial, nearly half of study participants completed their course of treatment with Kisunla in 12 months. We believe limited duration therapy, along with a once monthly infusion schedule, could result in lower patient out-of-pocket treatment costs and fewer infusions required. The vote was unanimously positive on all questions presented. Then a few weeks later, the FDA approved Kisunla, including labeling that physicians may consider stopping dosing of Kisunla based on reduction of amyloid plaques. Following the July approval, we launched Kisunla, and we're delighted to see that patients have already begun receiving this new Lilly medicine as part of clinical practice. We note that Kisunla is broadly covered for Medicare patients through approved CED registries. Regulatory reviews continue around the world with potential action yet this year in several countries. We're pleased to have recently received a positive opinion for genenimab from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. And finally, our Phase 3 prevention study, TRAILBLAZER ALS 3, continues to progress as planned. Moving to tirzepatide. On Slide 14, you'll see the recent positive results of our SUMMIT Phase 3 trial, which evaluated tirzepatide for the treatment of heart failure with preserved detection fraction and obesity. This study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both primary endpoints for tirzepatide, maximum tolerated dose compared to placebo. In the first primary endpoint, tirzepatide reduced the risk of worsening heart failure by 38% compared to placebo as measured by a composite outcome of heart failure urgent visit or hospitalization, oral diuretic intensification or cardiovascular death. The median follow-up for this endpoint was 104 weeks. In the second primary endpoint, tirzepatide significantly improved heart failure symptoms and physical limitations compared to placebo as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questioner, KCCQ Clinical Summary score. Main changes from baseline in this measurement is 24.8 points for tirzepatide, while placebo was 15 points based on the efficacy as demand at 52 weeks. All key secondary endpoints were met in the study, including mean body weight reduction of 15.7% compared to 2.2% for placebo. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide in the SUMMIT trial was consistent with previously reported tirzepatide studies, including SURMOUNT and SURPASS. We will present detailed results at an upcoming medical -- and submit to a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to submit results to the FDA and other regulatory agencies starting later this year. In other updates across our portfolio, Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 6. Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. I'll start with updates in cardiometabolic health, which is the new name of our internal business, formerly known as Lilly diabetes and obesity. In June, we published detailed results for our Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we presented results at the American Diabetes Association Meeting. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved in these studies. Notably, in one of our key secondary endpoints, as shown on Slide 17, tirzepatide demonstrated that up to 51.5% of participants met the criteria for disease resolution of sleep apnea. We've now submitted tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity to the FDA as well as the EMA. We are pleased that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation, and we expect U.S. regulatory action as early as the end of 2024, which will be dependent on the FDA granting priority review. Also, in June, we published results in the New England Journal from our Phase 2 trial of tirzepatide for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, with Stage 2 or Stage 3 fibrosis and we presented these results at the European Association for the Study of Donanemab. We are pleased to show that in a secondary endpoint, more than half of the patients taking tirzepatide achieved improvement in fibrosis at 52 weeks as shown on Slide 18. We're engaged with regulatory authorities on a potential Phase 3 registration strategy, and we're also encouraged by the potential read-through of these results to retatrutide, which also showed significant improvements in liver fats in Phase 2. This quarter, we also announced top-line data from two Phase 3 trials for our once weekly insulin called efsitora alfa, the QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes each met their primary endpoints of non-inferior A1c reduction. QWINT-2 compared to efsitora once-daily insulin degludec for 52 weeks in insulin naive adults. QWINT-4 compared efsitora to insulin glargine for 26 weeks in adult previously treated with daily basal insulin and at least two injections per day of meal time line. In both QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 efsitora, was safe and well tolerated. Detailed trial results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting. We look forward to sharing additional data from the QWINT program later this year. We are pleased with our progress to provide breakthrough innovation to patients who require insulin, progressing our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist molecule in Phase 1 and investing in approaches aimed at disease modification for type 1 diabetes, such as -- cell therapy. In other late-phase updates, we've initiated Triumph outcomes, a Phase 3 trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes and renal function for patients taking retatrutide. Earlier in our cardiometabolic pipeline, you'll see additional incretin molecules in Phase 1. Incretins are an important part of our portfolio strategy and having multiple molecules in clinical development offers us potential optionality as we look at opportunities to help patients across mechanisms, indications, dosages, formulations and treatment schedules. To highlight a few. GLP-1 NPA2 is a small molecule non-peptide agonist of the GLP-1 receptor designed for once daily oral administration. We expect this asset to move to Phase 2 later this year, so we now identify it on our pipeline slide whereas it had previously been listed as not disclosed. Given the diversity of indications to potentially pursue with incretins, we are excited about the possibility of having another oral option to help more patients with different diseases. We also highlight today the GLP-1 coagonist III, which is a next-generation dual agonist molecule and we are planning to explore weekly and monthly dosing given its longer halfway. Elsewhere in our cardiometabolic health portfolio, we have stopped development of our NRG4 agonist as the profile was insufficient for further clinical development. Turning to oncology. We are pleased that Jaypirca has now been approved in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors. In early phase oncology, we've initiated the Phase 1 trial for a second Nectin-4 ADC. We view this as an important target and having two compounds in the clinic provides more opportunities to improve outcomes for patients. We've also initiated a Phase 1 trial for our ADC targeting the folate receptor. This asset, which came from our acquisition of Mablink is the next-generation construct design -- efficacy at all fully receptor expression levels and with an improved therapeutic index relative to existing agents. We're also announcing that we've terminated the LOXO-783 program, which targeted PI3 kinase alpha. We evaluated the ongoing clinical data from the program and compared the molecule to next-generation candidates that we have progressed from our discovery efforts. We believe our next molecules have greater potential to benefit patients and we look forward to putting our next candidate into the clinic in 2025 and sharing more about its profile later this year. In immunology, we've now submitted mirikizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in Japan. We've terminated development for our GITR agonist, antagonists due to insufficient efficacy. We also announced our acquisition of Morphic. And pending completion of the deal we plan to reflect the oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor, MORF-057, in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Finally, in neuroscience, our anti-tau small molecule OGA inhibitor, recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. OGA failed to meet the primary endpoint of decreasing the change of baseline as measured by -- in either of the two dose levels tested. We're reviewing the data for presentation of detailed results of the study at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's conference later this year. While this negative outcome is disappointing, we remain committed to TAP as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease and plan to continue studying Taobao. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the second quarter. Exceptional revenue growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. We are pleased with the ramp in production in the first half of the year and expect continued expansion ahead. Significant advances in our pipeline include the approval of Kisunla for Alzheimer's disease, the submission of tirzepatide for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the U.S. and Europe and positive results from the Phase 3 study of tirzepatide for heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. We are investing in product launches, the advancement of our pipeline as well as our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. All of this and the incredible work of our teams around the world give Lilly leadership confidence that we have a very bright future ahead and better opportunity than at any time in our company's history to impact human health on a global scale. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and to conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions]. So, Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus your line is live. Seamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks so much. And just I'll stick with my one question. It really is on your awareness of ASP movements in the market, so the average selling price. By our calculations, when we sort of look at the ASP averages, removing rebates, inventory, et cetera, relative to comments made yesterday on Novo's call, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you're seeing in the market with regard to average selling price. The prices look actually reasonably close to us with the tirzepatide franchise having higher sort of ASP per script, but not dramatically higher given concerns of real pricing deterioration. I guess the only question that I have here is, what are you seeing from an ASP perspective? And do you see this as kind of a natural evolution of this market as competition emergence as we saw with Ozempic historically and Trulicity in 2019? Thanks so much. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Seamus. I think I'll go to Gordon. Do you want to touch on that, or Patrick? Gordon Brooks : Sure. I'll hang -- with that. Seamus, thanks for the question. Yes. So just on price streams, initial favorability in the first half of the year was driven by Mounjaro. That goes away in the second half of the year as the co-pay program moves out of the base period. In terms of pricing, we see stable pricing sequentially across quarters in '24. So, nothing unusual, Q1 to Q2 and our guidance Q3 and Q4 continue stable sequential pricing. For the second half of the year when you don't have the Mounjaro dynamic pricing in the second half will be similar to prior year pricing. So those are kind of the dynamics we see in pricing. Operator : The next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence your line is live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress on the manufacturing. Maybe just a two-part for me on that one. Just wondering if you're unit guidance for the at least 1.5-fold increase in sellable doses include the Zepbound bound star vials that you're rolling out in the U.S. or if that's a potential driver of upside? And then as we think about RTP, I know you continue to make progress there. The scripts suggests you're at about 1/3 of the way through the ramp to peak. But this inventory restock that you talked about today suggests maybe more of a meaningful step-up. So just can you quantify for us where you are in the ramp in RTP? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Yes, sure. I think, Dave, do you want to hop in and... Dave Ricks : Yes, I can just can -- So I think what we're saying today is just reiterating the 1.5 is sort of like a floor on how we think about second half volume. I would say the vials are part of that. But given the -- we have about 20 weeks left in the year. So, there's a limit to how much of that will ship anyway. But they certainly open up a node of the most constrained part of the supply chain, which is still finish in the final container closure and it uses different lines obviously, then syringes or cartridges. So, it just adds to our capacity, probably the most meaningful part of that will show up in the early '25 to be honest, as that new form ramps and details on that rollout will be coming in the coming weeks. As it relates to RTP, I wouldn't read through that the Q2 step-up in volume we shipped was primarily to RTP. That site is on track, and we are steadily escalating production per our goals. I also mentioned Concord is doing well against its time schedule, and we expect product out of that site end of this year, early next year. But rather, maybe performance out of the totality of the network that allowed us to recover wholesaler inventory levels in Q2 and now come off the FDA shortage list. It's more just overall performance across many, many nodes of our supply network. Operator : The next question will be from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris your line is live. Chris Schott : And congrats all the progress. There seems to be a broader debate on the role emerging earlier-stage competition in the obesity market could play where that fits in the market broadly. I'm sure you're not surprised by the breadth of agents being developed in the space. But just interested in your latest views in terms of barriers to entry you see for some of these newer competitors and how you think about defending Lilly's market position over time? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Maybe, Dan, do you want to start on that? And then... Dan Skovronsky : Yes, I'll start some R&D comments on BarCentry. The first, I think, is having a successful drug in Phase 3 clinical trials and getting it approved. You can see that we've invested thoroughly, I would say, in our Phase 3 portfolio is often pursuing multiple indications in multiple populations at once. Just being able to get to that point, I know investors have gotten excited about various releases of Phase 1 data. But it's still a challenging space to develop drugs and we usually wait until we've seen pretty robust Phase 2 data before we get too excited about a particular molecule. So that's the first thing. And I think a lot of the news we've seen from different companies only sort out as we get to see Phase 2 data and which molecules make it and which have the right profile and which don't. But I wouldn't be expecting 100% success here. Patrik Jonsson : A few additional comments. I think when we look at the marketplace, about two are very important barriers. We have been extremely successful in gaining access across both Mounjaro, where we are currently 93% access in commercial and 89% in Part D. And similarly, for Zepbound, 86% after 7 months in the marketplace, that's quite significant. The second piece is the amount of outcome indications. We are investing heavily in both Mounjaro and Zepbound, and similarly for the Phase 3 assets of our Zepbound and retatrutide. So, I think, overall, we think that we are extremely well positioned to compete here. And we are not surprised to see that most of the firms are actually leaning into this very important space. But with the cost we have not had in the market today, the Phase 3 assets and what we referred in the prepared remarks, we are well positioned to compete today and tomorrow. And that -- both different indications, assets Gene [ph] therapy, et cetera, all hands-on deck on our side. Dave Ricks : Maybe one last thing -- follow-on. But here, we're highlighting our [indiscernible] 11 assets, all different targets. And maybe just a reminder, Chris, we had our Phase 1 MAD data for tirzepatide in 2016, that was 8 years ago. And that's a massive lead, I think, over other GIP/GLP agonists that are behind us. On the oral side, you can get more in category differentiation based on target engagement, safety profile, et cetera. But here, again, we have the most advanced program, and as Dan highlighted today, a follow-on program to add to that sort of portfolio we have there. And finally, one other, I don't know if it's barrier, but certainly is work to do is scaling manufacturing. The volume is really high in this category, probably will end up being one of the highest volume categories in the history of the industry. And you're talking about making things on the $1 billion scale, which takes time and it's technically difficult and very capital intensive. So of course, competitors will come. But there's a road ahead for all these that -- the two leading companies have already walked in large part. Operator : The next question will be from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim your line is live. Tim Anderson : I have a question on compounders of GLP-1s, including, but not limited to, your tirzepatide. So, companies like IMS or anyone else. How can this not infringe patent protection? And is this something that is likely to get adjudicated in the courts, meaning the you and presumably Novo, too? So, an article just yesterday in New York Times talked about patients getting upside down with compounded GLP-1s. I think they used the term overdosing on these compounded formulations. So not only do compounders take away sales from you guys, but it could also turn -- reputation of the class. So, what can we expect Lilly to do about it? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim. Dan, you want to start with some comments? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks for raising this important topic, Tim. Of course, we've been watching this carefully, not really out of concern that they're taking away our business. We've been largely supply constraint here, but rather the impact it's having on patient health. We often are able to secure samples from these kinds of compounding labs and analyze them in our own labs. And what we found for the most part, in most instances is this isn't kind of tirzepatide at all. Our drug is not available to compounders, rather they're purchasing either other chemicals entirely, which we often find or make producers of tirzepatide that is often full of impurities sometimes contaminated by bacteria. This is a safety risk to patients that we take seriously and try to think we can to make patients aware of the potential dangers here so that we can help. Dave Ricks : Yes. And just from a policy standpoint, I mean, you can expect us to be active here. We've taken public positions. We're obviously engaged with regulators and considering all kinds of legal actions and filed some. Of course, compounding is a long-standing practice under the 503A provisions of FDA, which is meant to customize doses for individual patient needs that we don't -- it's not clear to me medically what that would be for tirzepatide. But I guess that's legal in a sense. It's the mass production that's concerning. And we don't see a lot of that with our medicine more with the other one. But I think if we just step back and reflect them why the -- there's shortages because of parenteral manufacturing constraints in the industry and the lead companies. A lot of that constraint is investing and proving those processes are compliant with the GMP standards that the FDA and Europe or NX1 have enforced. And we agree, by the way, with that strict enforcement. So, it's a little odd that the answer to that constraint, which is about raising the standards of the industry to a sterile product is to create another industry that is non-sterile product. So, we're just pointing that out. And I think you can see Lilly on the front foot here over the coming months to address this. But ultimately, the real thing to address is the increasing coverage on insurance and increasing supply. We -- drive on supply. We'll step that up another notch with the availability of vials, and we need to work with primarily the government as well as employers to expand coverage. So OBC medicines are affordable. People when we get to those points, this will be an issue. But in the meantime, people can get hurt. And as Dan said, it's pretty concerning what's happening. Operator : Next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer your line is live. Umer Raffat : Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask on operating leverage, if I may. I know in the first quarter, when you guys raised the guidance by $2 billion on top line, it dropped down to EPS by $1.30. This quarter, guidance went up by $3 billion, but it dropped down at a much higher leverage at $2.16 EPS, almost a 90% incremental margin. And my question is not so much what your operating leverage is going to be in 2025 or a forward year guidance. But instead, I'm basically asking if you annualize the momentum of your 4Q numbers per this year's guidance, the EPS upside implied to consensus could be almost as much as half of Lilly's entire full year EPS where it stands right now. So, I'm just trying to think through, how do you plan on spending on various functions and what the incremental margins could look like as the revenue momentum really kicks in with the improving supply? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Umer. There's a lot of financial mechanics. So, I'll hand to Gordon to comment on, I think, effectively capital allocation considerations. Gordon Brooks : Good. Thanks. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, we've been speaking for a long time about operating margins and getting to the mid- to high 30% range. As we've seen this year, Mounjaro and Zepbound are taking an inflection point upwards and so we're seeing ourselves at the top end of that range. For the first half, margins are a little inflated. We haven't yet lend in to all of our promotional channels and incretins. You don't see, for instance, TV commercials in the incretins. We haven't done that looking at the -- given the supply situation. And in R&D, it takes time to scale R&D thoughtfully. So, it doesn't always move exactly in sync quarter-by-quarter with revenue. That said, our guidance for the year does indicate we will stay in the upper 30% range for the full year, with growth first half, if you look at the first half, as the two quarters' growth into the second half. And you should also expect to see within that mix, stronger sales and marketing growth as we get to new launches in the second part of the year and the R&D continue to scale the growth from what we've seen thus far. So those are the dynamics we see on operating margin for 2024. Operator : The next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit your line is live. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you, very much for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. My question is regarding the rest of the world sales for incretins. It seems like Mounjaro is doing quite well there. And if I take out the -- like 15% or so for stocking in the U.S., it seems like ex-U.S. is already about 33% this early in the launch. So, I would love to understand how has been your experience so far? And is there going to be any different uptake for ex-U.S. versus your prior generation incretins for both Mounjaro and Zepbound given that these are really efficacious drugs? Joe Fletcher : Yes. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. Ilya, do you want to comment on OUS rollout for Mounjaro? Ilya Yuffa : Sure. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. We've seen some great progress with the launch of Mounjaro outside of the U.S. I think what you've seen in terms of growth in the earlier launch countries, such as the U.K., UAE and Saudi, UAE and Saudi are both key markets that make up rest of world, have already achieved a leading share and continue to drive momentum and overall market growth. And so, as you take a look at Q2, the main driver of that growth has been in Mounjaro in markets where we've already launched earlier in the cycle and majority of that coming from the Quick Pen presentation with a lot of that in the UAE. Some of that is channel dynamics similar to the U.S. At the same time, if you take a look at Q2 and the trajectory for Q2 relative to historical peak sales of any of our brand, has already surpassed that with a limited number of markets where we've launched. And so, as we look at the coming quarters, obviously, we just recently launched in Germany and now also Spain with Quick Pen presentation. We'll also look and monitor the demand and also supply capacity and expect to launch in new markets. The near-term growth, I would expect predominantly coming from already launched markets of Mounjaro. Operator : The next question will be from Alex Hammond from Bank of America. Alex your line is live. Alex Hammond : Thanks for taking my question. In the prepared remarks, Dan mentioned engagement with regulatory authorities on a potential pivotal trial in NASH. Can you provide any color on these discussions and how Lilly is thinking about tirzepatide versus -- for this indication? When could we receive updates? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Dan? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about the opportunity to help patients suffering from NASH. I think the data that we shared in Phase 2 for tirzepatide appetite is really quite profound in terms of the size of effect we can have. There's a couple of issues in mass drug development that we're trying to tackle, probably the most significant of which is current standard of liver biopsy to identify the patients to enroll in these trials and also then measure the outcome. Liver biopsy is obviously an invasive procedure and difficult to find patients to consent to these trials and of course, there's risk to patients. We're working hard to develop noninvasive biomarkers that can be used to identify the right patients to enroll in mass studies and also potentially could be used as an outcome to know if a drug is working. My hope is that we could develop those kinds of biomarkers that could be used both purposes and could be suitable for accelerated or approval of mass drugs in the future. Of course, long-term traditional approval for Astra still requires demonstration of outcomes. So, in that environment, we have two drugs that I think could both be great mass drugs and we'll have to decide whether to invest in one or both of those drugs, depending on the regulatory path we see. We'll keep investors updated as we make decisions about these molecules in mesh. Operator : The next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan your line is live. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on manufacturing and specifically, on the concern that you raised back in February around the proposed acquisition of Catalent by Novo Holdings and the subsequent sale to Novo Nordisk. Are you still as concerned as you were in February? Or given what you've been able to do with your own footprint? Is this less of an issue? Dave Ricks : Yes, I can take it. We remain concerned about that transaction. I don't think it was ever really about the trajectory of our ramp, although as we've disclosed, we do rely on one of the Catalent sites for GLP-1 and other diabetes production. It's more the oddity of your main competitor being also your contract manufacturer and how to resolve that situation. There's also an industry structure issue. CDMOs are important for managing capacity across the sector. And if we ended up in an outcome where that sector didn't really exist, they all became captive of large pharma would really constrain, I think, availability in the development of medicines, particularly out of biotech. So, we've aired those concerns publicly and privately since the proposed transaction was announced, and we're waiting to see what happens. But in terms of the long-term outlook for our company, as you may have noticed, we're building aggressively ourselves. Our primary strategy is self-run sites. And we've got $18 billion we've announced in the last several years, probably not done there. And we're quite comfortable building operating sites and as the newest large sites of begun to come online, we know we can execute that drill and repeat it, and that's our base plan. Operator : The next question will be from Dave Risinger from Leerink. Dave your line is live. David Risinger : Let me add my congrats on the results as well and the corporate updates. So Zepbound's breadth of health and work or productivity benefits seem to be underappreciated by many. There are articles from time to time, let's say, that patients need an off-ramp from therapy, et cetera. And my question is, what is Lilly doing to encourage patients to stay persistent with therapy? And how does Lilly intend to better communicate not just Zepbound's health benefits, but its worker productivity benefits to employers in order to drive much greater employer inclusion of obesity drugs as part of employee benefits? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. Patrik, do you want to comment on persistency and benefits? Patrik Jonsson : Absolutely. I think first overall, when we look at persistency, it's very early after the launch. But based on the feedback we have from providers, and from patients as well, this is a drug that patients want to stay on because they experience the benefits -- weight loss and also the downstream implications on comorbidities. You're right, the employee opt-in efforts are extremely key, and we believe that our outcome data, OSA, now have -- will help us tremendously and more readout to come over the coming years. We're also having value-based agreement with several other payers where we are looking into the benefits of tirzepatide in the workplace in terms of reduced absentees, increased productivity, et cetera, as well and that has gained a lot of interest. In terms of the consumer, yes, the ease to start and stay on is a key priority for us. And then we're working with consumer, improving our consumer platforms and also digital channels to really enable patients to experience the benefits that Zepbound provides over time. Operator : The next question will be from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry your line is live. Kerry Holford : Just coming back to the margin question earlier, given another expense in the 2024... Operator : Apologies team. We will get Kerry reconnected with a better line momentarily. And we'll move on to the next question, in the meantime, if that's okay from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris your line is live. Chris Shibutani : With all the different oral mechanisms in particular, variations on it from yourselves as well as competitors, can you update us on your thinking on what the basis of competition is going to be? And what kind of opportunities do you really envision? I think there has been for a while now a comparison on the basis of percent weight loss, particularly for the injectables. But as we move into orals, it seems as if tolerability profiles really matter. So how are you thinking about it? And how do you recommend investors think when we compare datasets across these other oral products in development? Even if the mechanisms are different, how do we get smarter about differentiating and interpreting data? Joe Fletcher : Dan, you want to chime in? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks. I'll start, and then we'll see Patrik to anything to add on commercial differentiation. But in the clinical trials, I think first of all, as I'm saying before, just take some caution on the small short Phase I trials. There's more to see. Most of the drugs that we've seen actually aren't different mechanisms that are GLP-1 agonists. In this class, I don't expect there to be differentiation in terms of efficacy, weight loss. You can pretty much dial in the amount of weight loss you want depending on how aggressively you dose it and what population. Tolerability is another issue that usually comes along with the efficacy. The faster you ramp to higher doses, the less tolerability you have. Then the different companies have to work through their own escalation of dosing to match the desired efficacy with some reasonable tolerability. The variable that links those two things together is often the half-life of the molecule. So shorter half-life molecules will give you bigger peak trough -- in the pharmacokinetics of the drug. And we think that's what -- that drives the tolerability issues. So, what you want is a long half-life molecule that can be dose escalated more smoothly. So that probably will be the differentiation rather than anything that companies are currently talking about in terms of efficacy. As I said before, it's a long road from early data to Phase 3 clinical trials like we have with orforglipron and we can expect some attrition. I'm pretty excited also about next-generation molecule. All of these ones that we've been talking about now are GLP-1s and will offer efficacy sort of in the range of injectable semaglutide. I think ultimately, we'd like to see drugs that offer efficacy and tolerability that exceeds that things that could combine multiple incretins like tirzepatide does and we are certainly working on orals that could also agonize GIP-1, for example. So exciting progress there and more to come on that in the future for us. Patrik Jonsson : Just from a commercial point of view, we are regularly conducting both consumer and provider market research. And when we're looking into the preferences, the true drivers today is still the degree of weight loss and safety and tolerability. And when we look at the needs beyond that, it's actually the need of an oral, and an oral with an injectable-like efficacy. So that's probably the new that comes beyond what we're currently serving today and particularly to serve those patients that have a fear of injections. When we look at over aspects, I think what comes beyond that would be the compensation of weight loss, lean mass versus fats and durability. And I think we are looking into all of those aspects as well. Joe Fletcher : I know we're running short on time. So, we'll do our best to kind of compress our answers as we get through as many questions as possible. Operator : And we have Kerry Holford from Bernberg reconnected. Kerry your line is live. Kerry Holford : Hopefully, you can hear me better this time around. Joe Fletcher : Much better. Kerry Holford : Lovely. My question was on margins. So, given you are now landing -- expecting to land in that mid- to high 30s range this year -- after the Zepbound launches, where can we expect your midterm operating margin plan? Is the margin in the mid-40%, perhaps higher achievable? And Dave, I know you previously suggested that an operating margin above 40% is not sustainable from an innovation-focused company. But given your progress so far, I wonder if you've changed your view on that. Joe Fletcher : Gordon, do you want to touch on that briefly? Gordon Brooks : Will do. Thanks, Kerry. I appreciate the question. Yes. I think as we said, like dance, as I said earlier, we do expect to end in that upper 30s range this year. There's still a lot at play here. Yes, on the top line, we see inflection points on revenue. But through the first half, you've had an inflated position. We haven't yet leaned in to any of our promotional channels. That's going to be a dynamic that we lean to more starting in the second half. And R&D, we do intend to scale that, and that's not going quarter-by-quarter exactly in line with revenue. So, all of those things are still going to play through. I think that said, at this point, we're just talking about 2024. And when we do guidance for '25, we'll chat about the longer-term picture there. Operator : The next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash your line is live. Akash Tewari : So, we're starting to see that -- may not be the only way to kind of preserve lean muscle mass. In particular, it looks like Amlin GLP combos are showing the potential for maybe 90% versus 10% fat versus muscle loss. Can you talk about what you think Aloralintide to Zepbound combo could show both in terms of absolute weight loss, but also the quality of that weight loss? And then where would -- fit in a world where next-gen -- triplet could show that level of muscle preservation? Joe Fletcher : Dan can focus on that first question about oral [indiscernible]. Dan Skovronsky : So, we have multiple mechanisms in play here, starting maybe with the amylin. We have a molecule Phase 2 called Aloralintide, which is a pure AML agonist, and we're evaluating that both as monotherapy and in combination with tirzepatide GLP clip. So that will be interesting to see. I don't have a strong preconceived notions about what to expect in terms of lean versus fat mass loss with that particular combination. Probably the people who have the most data about that would be the scientists at Novo since they've investigated cricalutide in combination with semaglutide. I think that brings us probably to another mechanism, which is dual amylin calcitonin agonism, which crugilatide probably is a dual agonist, and we have a molecule like that in Phase 1 called DACRA and we'll also investigate that and composition of biomass will be one of the aspects in which we evaluate it. And then finally, you talk of myostatin, we have a molecule in this family, and that's the bimagrumab that we acquired from Versatis, which is an antibiotic -- and that's proceeding in a Phase 2 trial in combination with semaglutide. And we look forward to having data to share with that in the future. All of these mechanisms, I think, could have variable effects on body mass composition. I point out that so far, we've not seen any disadvantages to the types of weight loss that we get with tirzepatide. In fact, patients show improved functional outcomes on a variety of things, including fruit function and heart failures we just demonstrated. So, could we have further improvements with even more higher ratio of fat to lean mass? That's the question of these trials makes Operator : The next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung your line is live. Trung Huynh : Thank for taking my question. Just following on from the previous question on ex-U.S. GLP-1. You saw Mounjaro ex-U.S. sales this quarter jumped to $677 million from $286 million. Can you give us some color on how ex-U.S. reimbursement is going with the bigger countries? And is this more of an out-of-pocket drug in these countries? And what percentage of the 677 million is obesity sales versus diabetes? Joe Fletcher : Okay. On that second one, I don't think we'll probably give much of a good answer on that. So, I'll maybe ask Ilya to weigh in just on that first question around how ex-U.S. reimbursement is going. Ilya Yuffa : Sure. Well, of course, I think the momentum overall is progressing quite nicely in both the reimbursed as well as the out-of-pocket segments. We have achieved reimbursement in the U.K. We have reimbursement in Germany, and we're continuing to look for reimbursement and expand reimbursement in other markets that we've launched. We have some reimbursement in UAE in Saudi as well in type 2 diabetes. And we continue to expand on that in the markets that we will enter. But a lot of that momentum is covering both the Type 2 and chronically management market and both in the reimbursed and out-of-pocket segment, and we're seeing both the progress in share as well as market expansion in the markets that we've been in. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Ilya. Paul, I know we have a lot in the queue. Maybe we just have two more questions and then wrap things up. Operator : The next question is coming from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve your line is live. Steve Scala : Thank you so much. The FDA definition of shortage seems clear and tirzepatide no longer meeting the definition of shortage seems to imply Lilly is meeting demand. I assume you will say that that's not the case, but the definition at least in black and white is quite clear. I assume this is FDA's determination. So, does Lilly agree with FDA's conclusion? How is demand being met? How is demand being measured? And what does demand look like? Dave Ricks : Yes. Thanks for the important question. As we think about the compounding question is important as well. As we've said earlier, we're available in all dosage forms in the U.S. What that means is, as you know, we can fill orders as they receive versus what we're doing. That does not mean that any pharmacy or certainly every pharmacy has all 12 dosage forms sitting on their shelf. That's infeasible economically probably for a lot of them and even logistically. So, I think we'll continue to see because there's not an abundance of supply. It's more of a real-time fulfillment situation, patients going to pharmacy counters and being told to wait a few days while their orders filled. But product is flowing and it's flowing at a pretty high rate. We're shipping part of it, and you can see that in these results from the quarter. So, files will add to that picture, but demand will increase as well. So, I think we're doing well given the situation. But the end pharmacy experience will continue to be choppy. We point that out to the FDA. So that means people may call and say, I couldn't get what I want on the moment I wanted it at the pharmacy I choose to. That's not the definition that we think applies here. So, we'll continue to with channel partners and the agency to try to clear up the confusion and improve the consumer experience, which is our responsibility along with theirs. Operator : Last question today will be from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise your line is live. Louise Chen : Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you how excited you are about this muscle preserving obesity drugs and if you see that as a true unmet need? Joe Fletcher : Thanks. Dan, anything to add on? Dan Skovronsky : Yes. No, thanks for the question, Lisa. I think it's an interesting area of science for sure. Too soon to know exactly how these kinds of mechanisms will translate into benefits for patients. At a high level, we know that the ratio of lean mass to fat mass is really important in determining metabolic health, probably more important as an indicator of overall metabolic health than, for example, BMI. And so that's what spurs these kinds of efforts to increase lean mass while causing fat mass loss and we'll wait to see data from our own donanemab and wait to see how that translates into health benefits for patients. Joe Fletcher : Great. So, I think we'll wrap up. Dave, closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Great. Thanks, Joe, and thanks to the team here. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Please follow up with the Investor Relations team if you have any questions we didn't address, and it sounds like there's a few that are holding. Happy to answer all of those. Have a great day, everyone. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2024 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Lucas Montarce, Chief Financial Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Susan Hedglin, Michala Irons, Mike Sprengnether and Lauren Zierke of the IR team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 4. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Joe. In Q3, Lilly continued to make progress across the business. We delivered strong revenue growth. We advanced and expanded our pipeline and we invested in new product launches and continued expanding manufacturing network. On Slide 5, you can see details of our financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, which we divested in Q3 2023. New product revenue grew by over $3 billion led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound has been strong and continues to grow as we expand both access and supply. U.S. sequential quarter-over-quarter prescription volume growth was 25% in Q3. All doses are available for order from Lilly in both the wholesale channel and LillyDirect Pharmacy Solutions. The launch of a single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect's self-pay channel further expanded supply and access in the quarter. And finally, we remain on-track to exceed the production target of at least 1.5 times the saleable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last year. We continue to see strong performance across the balance of our portfolio in oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, the non-incretin growth of the company was 17% in Q3. We achieved several key pipeline milestones this quarter, including the approval of Ebglyss in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The approval of Kisunla in Japan and Great Britain for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Disclosure of positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight. And the recent presentation of positive data from the Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 study, evaluating different dosing regimens for donanemab. Our manufacturing expansion agenda remains a top priority. In September, we invested nearly $2 billion to increase our manufacturing footprint in Ireland. This brings the total commitments to build, upgrade and acquire manufacturing facilities announced since 2020 to more than $20 billion. And beyond this $20 billion commitment, we also announced a separate $4.5 billion investment to develop the Lilly Medicine Foundry. This first-of-its-kind facility will be dedicated to research and development for manufacturing process design and to develop high-quality investigational medicines for our clinical trials. It will be located in Lebanon, Indiana, a short drive from the corporate headquarters. This investment underscores our confidence in our pipeline and the urgency we bring to bring our innovative medicines to patients around the world. In August, we closed the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics, adding oral integrin assets to our early phase immunology portfolio. And lastly, we returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. On Slide 6, you'll see key events since our Q2 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other key updates. Last month, we appointed Lucas Montarce as Lilly's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Lucas has 23 years of experience at Lilly and has worked with the executive team and the Board for a long time. So congratulations, Lucas. Now, let me turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q3 financial results and provide an update on our 2024 financial guidance. Lucas Montarce : Thanks, Dave. The Slide 7 summarizes our financial performance in the third quarter, which is highlighted by strong revenue growth across our new products as well as our non-incretin medicines. As Dave mentioned, revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Revenue from our non-incretin portfolio grew 17% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 82.2%. Gross margin primarily benefited from favorable product mix and higher realized prices, partially offset by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio in Q3 2023 and higher manufacturing costs. R&D expenses increased 13%, driven by continued investment in both our early and late-stage portfolio. We recognized $2.8 billion of acquired IPR&D charges, primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16%, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches. Operating income increased to nearly $1.8 billion driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expenses growth. The effective tax rate was 37.6%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. Other than the impact of acquired IPR&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously provided guidance. We delivered earnings per share of $1.18, up from $0.10 in Q3 2023. And this includes a negative impact of $3.08 from acquired IPR&D charges. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 46% with volume growing 35% driven by Zepbound Mounjaro and partially offset by declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 11% in the U.S., primarily driven by Trulicity, Humalog and Verzenio. While Mounjaro and Zepbound demand remains strong and growing, quarter-by-quarter revenue growth in 2024 has been impacted by supply and channel dynamics. As we highlighted in Q2, increase in supply led to higher shipments that allow us to fulfill the majority of wholesalers back orders, serving as a tailwind to sales. In Q3, we saw channel inventory decreased as wholesalers continued to navigate the complexities of high-volume cold-chain products across a dozen different dose and brand combinations. We estimate this inventory decrease impacted Q3 sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound by mid-single digits as a percentage of aggregate used sales of these products. Europe revenue grew 39% in constant currency when excluding the impact of the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio. This growth was primarily driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. We continue to be pleased with the Mounjaro equipment launches in Europe and are now launched in the U.K., Germany, Spain, and most recently Italy. Revenue in the rest of the world grew 45% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance. Moving to China, revenue increased 17% in constant currency. This increase was driven by volume growth of Tyvyt and favorable pricing impacts for Humalog. Finally, Japan grew 17% in revenue in constant currency. Volume growth of 20% was driven by uptick of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The Slide 10 provides additional perspective of performance across our product categories. Mounjaro sales were $3.1 billion globally, with almost $2.4 billion of net sales in the U.S. We continue to see solid uptake of Mounjaro outside the U.S. with sales in Q3 totaling $728 million. Verzenio continued its growth trajectory with worldwide sales increasing 32%, driven by strong execution in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca worldwide revenue was $81 million. When excluding the impact of Japan collaboration milestones recognized in Q2, Jaypirca continued its sequential quarter-over-quarter growth trend, demonstrating sustained uptake in both the MCL and CLL patient population. Worldwide Omvoh revenue increased to $41 million. We are pleased with our progress gaining commercial access for Omvoh in the U.S. As of January 2025, we will have first-line access at two out-of-the three major PBMs. We were also excited to receive U.S. approval for Kisunla and Ebglyss in Q3. The Kisunla launch is underway and progressing, and the Ebglyss launch began early this month. We are pleased to have already secured formulary access for Ebglyss with one of the major PBMs. Worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 22%, driven by lower volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. The Slide 11 provides an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We continue to see strong growth trends leading to sales of over $1.2 billion. We have broad formulary coverage for Zepbound. As of October 1, Zepbound has approximately 87% access in the commercial segment, and we are making ongoing progress expanding our employer opt-ins. We are in the early days of launching single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect. 2.5 milligram and 5-milligram single-dose vials are currently available to self-pay patient at a 50% or greater discount compared to the list price of other incretin medicines for obesity. This offering helps even more adults living with obesity access Zepbound including Medicare beneficiaries and those without them. Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. On Slide 13, you can see our updated guidance for the full year. We are updating our revenue guidance range to $45.4 billion to $46 billion. The new midpoint range represents approximately 50% growth in Q4 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, demonstrating a continuation of revenue growth acceleration. We are investing heavily in increasing supply of tirzepatide and have been carefully balancing our demand creation activities and launches into new markets with our production to support continuity of care for patients. In Q3, we continued to be prudent scaling up and demand-generation activities. This is the driver for lowering the top end of the range. We continue to expect that we will exceed our goals to increase production of incretin saleable doses by at least 50% in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. Now with all the doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound available, we will accelerate demand activities and while there is a lag to flow-through revenue, we expect to see the impact of these efforts in Q2 and into 2025. Lastly, we also expect new Mounjaro launches internationally to contribute to growing in Q4. Our expected ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue remains unchanged on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Other income and expense is now expected to be in the range of $425 million to $325 million of expense on a reported basis and is unchanged on a non-GAAP basis. We have updated our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, driven by the impact of non-deductible IPR&D in Q3. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $12.05 to $12.55 on a reported basis and $13.02 to $13.52 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect the updated mentioned earlier, as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q3 of approximately $3.1 billion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Dan Skovronsky : Thanks, Lucas. Lilly R&D had another productive quarter. So let me begin by sharing some late-phase updates, including some exciting Phase 3 data that we shared at recent medical congresses. Starting with neuroscience. Yesterday, at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's Disease Conference, we are pleased to share positive results from our Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 trial, which evaluated different dosing regimens for initiation of donanemab treatments to understand their effect on ARIA-E. In this trial, we tested a modified titration, which shifted one vial of donanemab from the first infusion to the third, as shown on Slide 14. We designed this modified titration to achieve identical total dose of donanemab administered in the first three months as does our standard dosing regimen, but we hypothesized that the smoother increase in dose could result in less ARIA. We are pleased to see in this trial that indeed by pharmacokinetic analysis, we achieved equivalent cumulative exposure between the modified titration and the standard dosing regimen. And as a result, we achieved similar levels of amyloid plaque removal and phospho-tau217 reduction. Importantly, we also confirmed our hypothesis on ARIA and showed that the modified titration reduced the incidence of ARIA-E to 14% compared with 24% for those receiving the standard dosing regimen. As well, lower frequency of symptomatic ARIA-E, lower radiographic severity of all categories of ARIA-E, and lower ARIA-E and ApoE 4 genotype carriers was observed using the modified titration as compared to the standard dosing regimen. We plan to submit a supplemental DLA to the FDA in the coming weeks for this modified titration. Our efforts on Remternetug continue to progress and we are starting a Phase 3 efficacy study of Remternetug focused on preclinical phase of the disease. Similar to our ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial for donanemab where we are trying to reduce the risk of progressions symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. In this upcoming Phase 3 registrational trial called TRAILRUNNER 3, we are evaluating a fixed duration of monthly subcutaneous administration of Remternetug, offering what we see as a potentially convenient option for this earlier patient population. We'll share more details about the study design of TRAILRUNNER 3 tomorrow at CTAD. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. Last month we shared data from our remaining Phase 3 studies for our weekly basal insulin called Insulin efsitora alfa. As a reminder, the efsitora Phase 3 consists of five global registration studies, four of which are in adults with Type-2 diabetes, and one is in adults with Type-1 diabetes. We are pleased that each study met its primary endpoint of non-inferior A1c reduction versus insulin glargine or insulin degludec, which are the most frequently used daily basal insulins. In the studies evaluating efsitora in people with Type-2 diabetes, the results demonstrated that efsitora achieved meaningful A1c reduction with relatively low hypoglycemia rates. We were particularly excited with the results for QWINT-1 in which efsitora was administered via six doses using a single-use autoinjector. In this 52-week study in people with Type-2 diabetes, efsitora lowered participants A1c by 1.31% compared to 1.27% for insulin glargine. This impressive A1c reduction was achieved in low hypoglycemia rates. Actually, efsitora had approximately 40% lower rates of severe or clinically significant hypoglycemia than the daily insulin glargine. These data highlight the power of an easier-to-use dose form of a weekly insulin for people who are just initiating basal insulin therapy for the first time. We look forward to discussing the results from the QWINT Phase 3 program with global regulatory agencies. It has also been a productive quarter for our late-phase incretin programs. First, as shown on Slide 15, we shared positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight, which demonstrated a remarkable 94% reduction in the risk of developing Type-2 diabetes. This is the longest duration tirzepatide data to-date, and we are highly encouraged to see that patients on the 15-milligram dose achieved sustained weight loss of nearly 23% during the more than three-year treatment period and that this weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction in risk of developing diabetes. We look forward to sharing the detailed results next week at ObesityWeek. These results add to compelling data showing the benefit of the combined pharmacology of dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonism in several obesity-related complications, including Type-2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or MASH, moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and heart failure. We are working quickly to bring tirzepatide to more adults living with obesity and its complications, and we are pleased to share that we expect U.S. regulatory action for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and obstructive sleep apnea yet this year. And that we will submit for U.S. approval for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and heart failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction before the end of this year. Another avenue to advance patient care is the maintenance of body weight reductions. We are conducting two Phase 3b weight loss maintenance trials. The first is SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN, which compares either tirzepatide 5 milligrams or tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose to placebo. The second is ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, which evaluates our oral GLP-1 orforglipron versus placebo after tirzepatide or semaglutide in participants who completed SURMOUNT-5, the 3b head-to-head study of tirzepatide versus semaglutide. We look forward to sharing the topline data readout for SURMOUNT-5 later this year. Next, in oncology. The Phase 3 EMBER-3 study evaluating our oral SERD, imlunestrant, in patients with second-line ER positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer was positive. The study evaluated three-arms, imlunestrant as a monotherapy, investigator's choice of endocrine therapy monotherapy, and imlunestrant in combination with abemaciclib. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit an NDA to the FDA by year-end, and we look forward to sharing detailed results at an upcoming medical meeting. The Phase 3 portion of the olomorasib first-line KRAS G12C lung cancer study is now underway. The first Phase 3 trial for this class of medicines in newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 expression. This comes after recently defining the dose of the medicine in combination with standard-of-care regimens in consultation with the FDA under Project Optimus. We continue to believe we could have a leading agent in this class and look forward to execution of the late-stage program. Finally, in immunology, we're excited by the recent U.S. FDA approval of lebrikizumab as Ebglyss for adults and children 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Ebglyss provides a new first-line biologic treatment that targets a main cause of eczema inflammation that offers significant early skin clearance and itch relief with convenient once-monthly maintenance dosing following the initial phase of treatment. We recently shared compelling long-term data showing that lebrikizumab provides sustained disease control for up to three years in more than 80% of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who responded to Ebglyss treatment at 15 weeks. We have also initiated two Phase 3 studies of lebrikizumab in adults with perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. As we continue to expand our immunology portfolio to help more patients, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies evaluating Ixekizumab and tirzepatide together in patients with obesity or overweight in either psoriatic arthritis or moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases and can negatively impact disease outcomes. Taltz has already demonstrated strong efficacy in treating psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis and we are excited to see the potential for additional benefits for patients when combined with the significant and sustained weight loss offered by Zepbound. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28 and Slide 17 shows potential key events for the year. I've already covered our late-phase progress, so now I'll quickly cover updates for the early-phase pipeline. Starting again with neuroscience. We recently initiated a Phase 2 study of an epiregulin antibody in chronic neuropathic pain associated with distal sensory polyneuropathy. We had previously shown this molecule in Phase 1 of the pipeline as an undisclosed mechanism in pain. We also have begun Phase 1 studies on two new neurodegeneration assets, an alpha-synuclein directed siRNA and a tau-directed siRNA. Earlier this morning at CTAD, we disclosed detailed results from our Phase 2 study of Ceperognastat, our oral GlcNAcase anti-tau agent. While neither dose slowed clinical decline in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, biomarker data suggests potential impacts on tau pathology, brain volume and neuroinflammation. Safety follow-ups for the study are ongoing. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. In the coming days, we will initiate a Phase 2 study of Eloralintide, our long-acting amylin receptor agonist for chronic weight management in combination with tirzepatide in patients with Type-2 diabetes. And a Phase 2 study of Bimagrumab, alone or in combination with tirzepatide for chronic weight management in participants without Type-2 diabetes. We will also be advancing Volenrelaxin, our long-acting relaxin molecule into Phase 2 in adults with chronic kidney disease. We removed the Phase 1 APOC3 siRNA asset in cardiovascular disease as it did not meet our bar for continuing clinical development. In oncology, 2024 continues to be a very productive year for new clinical starts. Since the last call, we advanced three new molecules into Phase 1 studies. Our oral SMARCA2 or BRM inhibitor, our KRAS G12D inhibitor, and our Pan KRAS inhibitor. These three initiations bring the total new clinical starts in oncology in 2024 to seven, exceeding the goal we shared earlier this year to put at least five new potential medicines in the clinic. And we've done that across three different modalities, emblematic of our strategy to utilize therapeutic modality diversification to combat treatment resistance and improve patient outcomes. We expect this new slate of clinical programs will set us up for an exciting 2025 as we look to see which programs deliver differentiated and important early clinical datasets for patients. Finally, in early-stage immunology, we're also excited to initiate several new Phase 2 studies. First, we moved DC-853, an oral IL-17 inhibitor from the DICE Therapeutics acquisition into Phase 2 in adults with moderate-to-severe black psoriasis. And we removed DC-806 from the pipeline in favor of 853, which is a more potent molecule. Second, we are initiating a Phase 2 study combining Eltrekibart and Mirikizumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. In addition, we are terminating the Phase 2b study of Peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis due to the overall benefit-risk profile of the molecule in this study. Finally, after welcoming our Morphic colleagues to Lilly in August, our pipeline now reflects the oral alpha 4-beta 7 integrin inhibitor MORF-057 in Phase 2 for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Q3 was an exceptionally productive quarter for Lilly R&D, and we're pleased with our important progress we're making for patients across all of our therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Dave Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before taking questions, let me briefly summarize our progress in the quarter. We had strong revenue growth across both Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as our oncology, immunology and neurosciences medicines. Significant advancements in our pipeline included approval of Ebglyss for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the U.S., Kisunla for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in Japan and Great Britain, and positive data disclosures for Phase 3 studies of tirzepatide and donanemab. We are confident in Lilly's bright future. We have now launched in major geographies the cohort of medicines that we expect will serve as the driver of our growth through the balance of this decade. That is Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, Zepbound, Kisunla and Ebglyss. We expect these products, together with our already launched products will contribute to strong growth of the company in 2025. In addition, we plan to continue to scale R&D and step-up our investment across manufacturing and commercial to support the successful launches of these medicines to help even more patients next year. So now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate a Q&A session. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner. So consistent with prior quarters, we'll respond to one question per caller, so ask that you limit to one question per caller as we will end the call at 11 a.m. If you have more than one question, you can re-enter the queue and we'll get to your question if time allows. So Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live. Chris Schott : All right. Great. Thanks so much. Just to kick off the questions, can you just help bridge a bit from the 3Q sales we just saw reported to the 4Q implied results. It's obviously a substantial step up in sales. It sounds like part of this is you're now accelerating demand generation efforts given the improved capacity. But I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on exactly what those efforts are and how quickly you expect those programs can translate to an acceleration in prescriptions? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Chris, for the question. I'll maybe hand over to Patrik since I'm guessing a lot of the question is around tirzepatide related, but let Lucas jump in as needed. Patrik? Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Chris. I think it's first important to emphasize that the overall performance and health of both Mounjaro and Zepbound are very strong. And then we saw a slightly accelerated growth in Q3 of more than 25% and also the market, the underlying market for both Type-2 and obesity continues to grow. And we took a more prudent approach than we anticipated in Q3, pretty much driven by the need to deliver a good consumer experience. That has been one of our triggers for any investments based upon the experience we faced in the first half of the year when a lot of the calls of our customer service center was about supply, actually more than 20%. We are now down to less than 1% of those being supply-related. So what we are doing right now is that we are investing heavily in our DTC effort, which we haven't done in the past, whilst supply allows us to invest strongly there, but it's not a demand issue. And similarly, we are fully leaning in on all the HCP promotional efforts, also providing samples in the marketplace to providers. So we remain very confident based upon the underlying trend in the marketplace today and also the growth of both Zepbound and Mounjaro in terms of TRx, NBRx, and TRx that we are after a good Q4. Lucas Montarce : Maybe just to add to that, thank you, Chris, for the question. When you look at the midpoint that I mentioned, 50% growth that we expect for the fourth quarter compared with the 42% is a step-up of 8%. When you remove the channel dynamics that we alluded in Q2, the step-up of growth is very consistent throughout the quarters. So the acceleration and the drivers are the ones that Patrik mentioned. Maybe just to add to that, OUS as well, we continue to advance or engage new countries that we are going to be launching Mounjaro as well that will drive that part of that growth acceleration in the fourth quarter. Joe Fletcher : Thanks. Paul, next question? Operator : The next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citigroup. Geoff, your line is live. Geoff Meacham : Hi guys, thanks for the question. I guess related to that, I just want to dig into the 3Q volatility. I mean, Dave, you mentioned the scrip demand sequentially. I guess -- so given that, why would you see such a big drawdown this quarter, I guess investors are trying to figure out if the sequential trends are perhaps a leading indicator of a moderation in demand or if it's just the lumpiness of the roll-out in excess? Thanks. Joe Fletcher : Dave, you want to fill that? Dave Ricks : Yes, maybe because it's kind of a macro thing you're asking there. But I think first of all, there is a lot of lumpiness in channel stocking. I think all the sell-side analysts on this call have probably struggled with that as we have, exiting Q1, we can recall that we had a number of our dosage forms on back-order, and we pretty much reached a NATR of supply in the wholesalers. That was kind of restocked in Q2 and then we saw a drawdown in Q3. I think what we really don't control and don't attempt to, but as a reality is that downstream customers from Lilly, wholesalers and retailers, are making their own decisions about which of the 12 different dosage forms they want to stock and at what level. There are some physical constraints to that, cold-chain, capacity is constrained and their financial constraints, working capital that they're managing to. Those are their decisions to maintain their customer service levels. I think what we've done is sort of move our set point of how much stock we want to have on hand before we go initiate demand-stimulating activities, which we had more or less paused for Mounjaro in the first half and never started for Zepbound remembering we launched in December of last year. So I think the in-market data, you guys can all read, and you see Geoff yourself, and we do see acceleration of both brands in Q3 over Q2 in actual consumption. And our estimate is that will continue or accelerate as we add U.S. stimulation to that demand, which, as Patrik said, we're going to begin doing here really mid-November in earnest. And ex-U.S. demand is another factor that affects sales and that too we moved out launches by about a quarter just to make sure we had enough buffer. So when customers want a prescription, they could get it filled reliably. And I think that's an important thing for us to keep that trust going forward. So at a macro-level, is there a demand problem here? No, actually. Is there a supply problem? No, although if we had unlimited demand, there would be. So we're carefully gating those two things together. As we escalate supply in Q4, which, as I mentioned, we're going to beat the 50% growth number, you'll see us grow our demand stimulation as well. And I think that's really about Q4, but even more about Q1 of 2025 and continuing acceleration there. So business is super-healthy. We feel good about where we are. Obviously, there was some choppiness this quarter, but I think underlying growth here is as strong as we would have hoped. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. Paul, next question? Operator : The next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital. Evan, your line is live. Evan Seigerman : Hi guys. Thank you so much for the question and Joe, congrats on your new job. I want to touch on compounding. Given the headlines, do you believe that compounded drugs are impacting demand? And secondarily, how do you frame kind of the FDA's waffling on the shortage list as it relates to compounding? It seems that this has been a hot button issue, I'd love your perspective. Thank you so much. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Evan. Yes, a hot topic indeed. Maybe in terms of talking about whether there's a financial impact we see that, I'll have Patrik feel that and then maybe the broader question around the FDA, I'll let Dave chime in. So Patrik? Patrik Jonsson : Well, thank you very much, Evan. I think as we all know, that is not one reliable source when it comes to quantifying the compounding market. We also know that it's opaque and mainly cash and there are probably reasons to believe that some of those patients are off label. So from our perspective, we actually don't estimate there to be a huge financial impact of compounding on our business. But our major concern here has been driven by safety, but thousands of people in the U.S. are getting medicine that is not approved by the FDA for quality, safety or efficacy purposes. So that has been our concern, and we are mainly leaning in now, as we said earlier, to drive demand in the U.S. marketplace for patients with obesity and Type-2 diabetes. Dave Ricks : Yes, I mean, I can't really speculate too much what's going through the FDA's mind, but I think other commentators have mentioned that the longer this goes on, the more risk they have to their own regulatory framework. And so, my guess is the FDA is concerned about that and they want to win this case and they're putting their ducks in a row to do so. There is an alternate, I guess, perspective that they don't care, but I think they do care. The other thing I'll say is we work closely with the FDA to approve new capacities. And it's important to note here we could do more with them, and we communicate this to them directly. They're not hearing anything here. They haven't heard from you already, but we have invested massively in parenteral filling capacity and API capacity. And a big part of the delivery schedule for that, which can take 2.5 years to 4 years is actually the regulatory process itself. So it's difficult to think about a world where the workaround to that is to unleash unregulated product. The workaround should be to collaborate with the companies to speed up legitimate product delivery and we would embrace that discussion fully. We have a lot of things in queue now with the FDA or about to be that could speed up what already is an impressive production ramp, we would welcome that opportunity. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, both. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks. My question is actually on how you feel the compounding situation could be resolved by the availability of an oral small molecule that can be provided at substantial scale? It seems like this is the easiest and most straightforward answer to the compounding crisis. Once that occurs, does it make sense with that availability regardless of product that the agency would move to resolve the crisis? Or is this a product-by-product situation such that if Novo can't get their house in order in that context that we'll end-up with having this compounding issue just draw out over time? Thanks. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Seamus. Yes, I'll hand back to Dave, although I mean, if you're referring to our, of course, our oral GLP-1 non-peptide agonist orforglipron, I mean that's still a ways away from the Phase 3 turning over and then ultimately coming to-market. But Dave, maybe what would you add to your prior comments? Dave Ricks : Yes. Well, I mean in the long run, of course, there's a potential 1 billion customers on the planet. And I think we've said, I've said that probably the only way that a big chunk of those are served well is with oral products because of the production system efficiencies there versus parenteral filling of proteins. So it's important. Of course, we're in the lead there and we want to see our orforglipron be successful, but we need the data and then submission and launch would put that sometime something like less than 2 years from now. But I wouldn't characterize compounding as a crisis. It certainly isn't one for us. I think the problem is people are being harmed and duped, right? And so that's kind of what we'd like to see stop. But as Patrik said, we don't really see a financial impact on Lilly of compounding. I think that as an industry, we should probably be worried that if this grows and is allowed to continue, then it sort of creates this back to our generic world. But as I said, I think the FDA wants to stop that for good reasons, for public safety reasons and they'll do that. At the end of the day, FDAs use this as a product-by-product analysis. And right now, tirzepatide is not in shortage and therefore for mass compounding should not be permitted. There's a stay, etc. in the court, but we think that should be the state there. As it relates to semaglutide, you'll have to ask Novo that, although we're working hard to help Novo with their supply problem by reducing demand for semaglutide and increasing it for tirzepatide. So maybe it will resolve that way. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe if I can ask the demand question and supply question differently. So now you will be starting some demand generation activities in the later half of the year - later part of the year. How are you thinking about the access side of it, do you think that there is some convergence between access demand generation and supply into 2025 because we are hearing that some of the payers are restricting it even more now. So would love to understand your thoughts on access side given that you are probably have done the negotiations at this point? Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Mohit. I'll hand over to Patrik to talk about maybe access updates and go forward. Patrik Jonsson : Yes. Maybe just a few comments on Mounjaro. Prior to moving into Zepbound, I think with Mounjaro, we have really good access and it's 93% and I think pretty much where we need to be across commercial and Medicare. In terms of Zepbound, I think we've made progress in record time here, close to 90% commercial access and we continue to see improvement in terms of employers opting. You're correct, we heard stories about some employers opting out, but the major trend is actually in favor of opting-in to the anti-obesity medications. So we are definitely north of the 50% and I think we will have some new data in the first part of 2026 since both the employers are making those decisions effective one-one in the new year to come. So I think we are very, very optimistic in that part of our business, but we're also continuing to make progress in terms of access for Medicaid. And just since we connected last time, we have gained six incremental states for Medicaid and most recently effective 10-1, we have California and Massachusetts. So big states are now covering more than 30 million lives, and we expect to continue to make progress in that space. And lastly, I would just emphasize the potential approval here of obstructive sleep apnea. The approval of obstructive sleep apnea will help us with employer opt-in because we know that outcome studies are critical to convince employers. But on top of that, it also opens up the door for access in Medicare, and with the decision that CMS announced back in April this year, we are confident that we will gain access also for OSA in Medicare. So I think we have many reasons to be excited about the outlook for 2025, driven by improved access across the commercial America space as well as the investments we have done, we believe to be direct. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Patrik. And Mohit, even though you didn't ask about OUS access, and I don't allow multipart questions, maybe I'll see if Ilya wants to chime in and talk a little bit about OUS access progress to-date and what we see going forward. Ilya, do you want to -- would you like to chime in on that? Ilya Yuffa : Sure. Overall, we have seen significant progress on our launches OUS. We have both access for Type-2 diabetes where in some of the markets like U.K., Germany and Japan, and we're seeing some good progression of our share in those markets where we're already seeing leading share of market in new patient starts in those places. Of course, we need to continue to develop access in other markets. And then on the chronically management side, we feel good about the prospects of adding countries to drive access. At the same time, there's also developed self-pay markets like the U.K., UAE and Saudi, where we're already seeing significant progression of our share and penetration where we actually have leading share of market in TRx in these markets. And we continue to focus on both developing the self-pay, but also increasing access for both Type-2 diabetes and chronic weight management over time. And that will be gradual as we enter new markets. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Ilya. Paul, next question. Operator : Next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering I know you've already framed out kind of where supply would be for the second half of this year. Again, as we look out to 2025, can you give us an early read on how your supply capacity efforts have been progressing and how we should think about the amount of new capacity, especially on the auto-injector side that you can bring on for 2025? Thank you. Dave Ricks : I can start, let me just jump in. I mean, we will have a chance to lay out that as we did this year in our guidance call in early February. But qualitatively, you can see the flow of our investment and CapEx into this space and you could kind of go backwards three years or so and expect the capacities we announced then to be coming on full line in that timeframe and then rolling that forward. So of course, we made an announcement this year and those are a couple of years away from having full impact. But if you go back to '21, '22, '23, we are working hard to bring those online and expect good growth next year. So I think Lucas mentioned, we're seeing acceleration in demand, but that means acceleration in supply during this year and we expect strong growth on the total for next year and we'll lay out the details if we get into the guide call. If you have anything else to add to that, Lucas? Lucas Montarce : Maybe just say one comment from my side. When we talk about more so from the demand perspective, I think in the U.S. in particular, the proxy that we alluded to on the growth that we see across both and Mounjaro and Zepbound in TRx of that 25% sequential quarter-on-quarter is a good proxy to start basically trending out into next year, more so to provide more perspective from the market side and the demand side than the manufacturer. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, both. Paul, next question? Operator : Next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is live. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to spend one more minute on the inventory dynamic in the quarter. I'm trying to think out loud, could the launch of cash-pay single vial option via LillyDirect have impacted channels' interest in filling out their inventory given how those launch is going? And/or were there any changes in your incentives or fees to the distributors that could have impacted it? Thank you very much. Joe Fletcher : Thanks. I'll let Patrik quickly handle that. Patrik Jonsson : Well, overall, we launched LillyDirect self-pay by just a month ago. Not we are pleased with the uptake, but we also realized that it takes some time for healthcare system to adopt the self-pay in their EMR systems. But so far, I would say that the impact of TRx has been quite limited and would be defined as being at the low-single to single-digit level. We expect Lilly Direct self-pay though to be a very important channel to grow new therapy starts moving forward, but not significant in Q3. Dave Ricks : I think the short answer to both the question is no and no. We didn't change our terms, and I don't think we've seen any change in retail stocking of the auto-injector because the vials are filled. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Umer. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is live. Steve Scala : Thank you so much. For a product with a seemingly unlimited market opportunity, what appears to be great market awareness and persistent supply shortages, DTC for Zepbound really shouldn't be necessary, particularly now. DTC, in my experience usually signals concern about patient volumes, awareness or competition. So the question is, if DTC were not instituted, what would be the trajectory of Zepbound over the next, say, 12 months would consensus be achieved? And if competition is the concern, are you getting ahead of CagriSema data due out soon? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : That's a lot to unpack, Steve. I don't think we're going to speculate around a hypothetical demand curve, but maybe -- I think Patrik kind of touched on this in his first answer on DTC. With regard to why we're doing DTC now, maybe just reiterate that point very briefly, Patrik, around. Patrik Jonsson : Yes, you know, I think we are comparing a very different market, the first half of '25 versus the second half of 2025. We faced some significant supply constraints, and it wouldn't be responsible for us at that point in time to drive any major DTC investments and just provide consumers with a bad experience at the pharmacy level. We have much more confidence now in terms of the supply moving forward. And this is not a demand issue problem. It's actually just a supply opportunity and we want to drive up that consumer awareness. So while we're doing extremely well, we just need to have in mind that the penetration in terms of obesity is just at the low single-digit level, 4% to 5% and there is still a huge stigma. So what we can do here to drive patient activation is going to serve us very well moving forward. Dave Ricks : I would just add that actually unaided awareness for Zepbound, although we're -- everyone on this call is highly aware of the brand-name is actually not very hot, and then we launched this drug almost a year ago and have done no advertising. So I think it is time to introduce the brand and so people are aware of that when they speak to their doctor. Joe Fletcher : Great. Thank you. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question will be from David Risinger from Leerink. Dave, your line is live. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. A number of my questions have been asked. So with respect to peresolimab, I'm hoping that you could just provide a little bit more color. You mentioned that it was dropped due to the benefit-risk ratio, but do you see any specific safety problems? And what is your view of the opportunity to develop another PD-1 agonist for INI disease in the future? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. And I was getting worried that Dan wouldn't get a chance to speak in the Q&A. So maybe I'll hand this over to Dan for his thoughts. Dan Skovronsky : Good. Thanks for your concern, Joe. Thanks for your good question, Dave. Yes, I mean peresolimab is a really interesting mechanism for us and we were excited when we saw the Phase 2a data. It was a small number of patients, but had a relatively profound effect on RA symptoms, particularly in patients who had failed the previous biologics. So we sought out to replicate that in a larger Phase 2b study. Unfortunately, when we came to the end of that study, the benefit-risk that we've seen in the Phase 2a study was not fully borne out in Phase 2b. So just based on the overall profile, which includes both the efficacy and the safety of the drug, we decided not to pursue that. As to your question on a follow-on PD-1 agonist, we don't have one that we're pursuing right now. So that's I'll say about that. And I think, of course, we'll look forward to presenting the full data package at a future meeting. Thanks Joe. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Dan. Paul, next question. Operator : The next question will be from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live. Kerry Holford : Thank you very much. Kerry Holford, Berenberg. My question actually on Verzenio, please. So your competitor in this space, Novartis, Kisqali recently received a broad approval in early breast cancer, which obviously includes the high-risk patient group. So I would just be interested to hear you speak about your expectations for market-share evolution in that space, how you protect your position with Verzenio in the high-risk setting? And then also if you can talk to the impact of IRA that you expect on that brand as we move through Part D reform next year and whether or not you expect the drug to be on the negotiation list for 2027? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Kerry. Sort of a two-part question, but I'm excited to ask Jake to chime in and maybe talk about on Verzenio, potential Kisqali impact as well as IRA. Jake? Jacob Van Naarden : Yes, happy to take it. Thanks for the question. Our position and expectation here around market share with respect to the adjuvant setting for Verzenio versus Kisqali hasn't really changed sort of pre-approval versus now. I think we have a very robust clinical data package with a lot of follow-up on our dataset, which is critically important for prescribers and a 2-year regimen where patients can finish their adjuvant therapy and move on with their life, hopefully remaining recurrence-free. That's a pretty compelling proposition. It has been, and I think is recognized as such in a variety of treatment guidelines that for the high-risk population, the monarchE patient population prefer Verzenio over Kisqali as standard-of-care. Those expert guidelines have weighed in over the past couple of months. I don't expect that to change materially. Of course, with a new market entrant, the percentage of patients in the setting who get any CDK4/6 inhibitor as adjuvant therapy could go up and that would benefit us and I expect that there will be some patients for whom Kisqali is a more appropriate choice, but I don't expect it to be a significant shift in our overall market dynamics. And of course, the node-negative population is not where we're indicated and not where we're used and that's a story for them to tell. On the second part of your question around Part D reform, it will have an impact. Of course, there's a push and pull here on the amount we have to contribute for catastrophic coverage being a downside, and of course, the co-pay cap, out-of-pocket cap on patients, and particularly in Medicare where that could be a tailwind on the brand. I think it's hard to know exactly where that will net out. It probably nets out sort of in the neutral range. I don't think it will end up being a headwind or a tailwind sort of in totality, but we have to see how that shakes out. On the last part of your question around negotiation list, I don't want to speculate on that. I don't think we have enough information yet given the evolving nature of all of the different medicines that could be up for negotiation to actually say one way or another, which ones will be there just yet. Joe Fletcher : Thank you, Jake. I know we're running short on time. So, Paul, maybe just two or three more questions. Next question. Operator : The next question will be from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is live. Chris Shibutani : Great. Thank you very much. Lucas, welcome to these calls. Just curious, there's a little bit of a tension point between the thought of what the operating margins and I know Lilly uses a very unique and specific precise calculus for that. With most people longer-term forecasting at least amongst the sell-side approaching high 40s percent. And I believe some of your commentary suggested that perhaps that would not be where you would aim for. Can you just maybe clarify for us your view, your take on where you think the operating margin trajectory would go under your purview? Joe Fletcher : Well, Lucas, go ahead. Lucas Montarce : Yes. Sorry. Thank you, Chris, for your question and thank you for quoting me about this new ratio, the gross margin minus OpEx divided by revenue is quite a lengthy ratio. But just going to your question in the short run you see that we have grown our ratio in the last few quarters as we have been having this cycle of significant growth trajectory and we are starting to ramp up our investment both in SG&A and R&D. That effect will continue for sure for getting into the fourth quarter of the year that is including as part of our guidance. And what we expect to see moving into 2025, going into your question is we do expect to ramp up our demand generation activities in SG&A that will pay down into 2025, as well as we will scale our R&D. We talk about some of the assets on our portfolio that moves into Phase 2 and Phase 3 that will continue to play-out as we ramp-up those investments to drive long-term sustainable growth. So, I would expect that in the short term, we continue to see some operating margin expansion on this ratio. In long term, again, we will continue to expand and drive sustainable growth that will basically justify the investments that we do in SG&A and R&D. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, Lucas. Next question. Operator : The next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live. Trung Huynh : Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So in your PR, you note favorable changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Mounjaro. If you axe on our numbers, if you axe-out mid-single-digit destock, it does look like price has gone up for the year for that product. Also, Zepbound pricing looks pretty stable. So perhaps can you just talk about what you see in pricing evolution for the rest of the year, but also next year as you'll have potentially sleep apnea and have that on the label, which may mean that you go into more government settings? Thank you. Joe Fletcher : Lucas, would you like to talk kind of high-level and any net pricing dynamics worth sharing? Lucas Montarce : Yes, sure. And thank you for the questions. Going back to the Mounjaro so far in the year, we kind of signaled throughout the year that once we were sunsetting last year, the co-pay program that we had that we will see that basically tailwind on the price year-on-year comparison that played out as what we expected. And the sunset, of course, takes again a little bit of time to see that playing out. So you see a little bit of that spillover effect getting into Q3. Getting into Q4, we don't expect to see major dynamics on that. And what you're starting to see basically in Q3 is what we project into the fourth quarter of the year. Maybe getting into the obstructive sleep apnea indication, any comments that you would like to add, Patrik, on that front? Patrik Jonsson : I would just say in terms of Zepbound, we are still very early on in launch. And I think you clarified the stability in pricing Q3 over Q2, look out. And what we need to have in mind is that we will continue to increase access. We will see launches outside of U.S. as well now with Zepbound being approved and also can impact the global net pricing dynamics moving forward. Joe Fletcher : Thanks, both. Maybe last question, Paul, and then we'll wrap up. Operator : Yes. The final question today will be from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney, your line is live. Courtney Breen : Hi, there. Thank you so much for the question and for squeezing me in. Coming back to obesity and perhaps looking a little longer-term, you spoke to the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial off the back of SURMOUNT-5. I note that for orforglipron, this is placebo-controlled. And so, I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on kind of that being the comparator. For us kind of that being the comparator suggests that this is about kind of duration of treatment, expansion to patients, which would really be an expansion of the total market rather than kind of displacement of necessarily another obesity product. Can you just talk a little bit about orforglipron kind of the future of how this could expand the market? Joe Fletcher : Yes. Thanks, Courtney, for the question on orfo. Maybe I'll hand to Patrik to talk about that and some of the commercial -- potential commercial strategy in ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial. Thank you for noticing that. Patrik, would you? Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Courtney. But we are looking forward to the readouts of the orfo Phase 3 trials next year 2025. But I think overall, we see a significant opportunity here. It's going to be the first oral if we deliver along the lines as we saw in Phase 2 with an efficacy along the lines of an injectable along the lines of semaglutide. So I think that will really position us to scale globally. We are avoiding the cold-chain requirements, etc. But also in the U.S., we see an opportunity to further penetrate because we know that even if the experience with the auto-injector, once you have tried it is really good. We know that there is a need there in the marketplace that probably impacts 20% to 25% of the population. So I think there is a huge opportunity to expand. And when you refer particularly to be ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, I think there is an obligation on our side to really better understand how can you best keep patients on treatment for a longer period of time knowing that obesity is a chronic disease. That's why we're leaning in on some of MAINTAIN to see what is the lowest efficacious dose that you can keep patients on during a longer time. And similarly, with ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, we don't expect a major shift led by clinicians from injectables to orals. But I think this is one alternative to continue to treat patients for the periods they need to be on medication, which is a chronic disease, and we are doing whatever we can to improve adherence and improve patients outcomes. Joe Fletcher : Great. All right. Thank you, Patrik, and I think we're wrapping up, Dave. A - Dave Ricks : Okay. Great. Well, thanks for joining us today, everyone. I want to end the call by just thanking Joe Fletcher, who is moving on from his role as Head of IR to a new role, a critical role of CFO Manufacturing. I think you'll all agree, Joe did a great job in representing Lilly to the Street over the last many years. And we welcome Mike Czapar into the role, returning to IR actually after various rotations in the business and it will be an exciting time ahead with Mike as your main point of contact. So thank you all for joining us today. And as usual, if you have follow-up questions, please give us a call at the IR team and look forward to seeing everyone on the road over the coming months. Take care. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike, please go ahead. Mike Czapar : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2024 Earnings Call. I'm Mike Czapar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Lucas Montarce, Chief Financial Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mark Keman, Wes Tall and Wai Wong of the Investor Relations team. During the call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 4. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Ricks : Okay.  Thanks, Mike. 2024 was a productive year for Lilly. We grew our top line, advanced our pipeline and invested in our supply chain to meet the increasing demand for our medicines. Most importantly, we delivered for patients by bringing life-changing medicines to more people around the world. In 2024, full year revenue grew 32% compared to 2023, exceeding our first-time guidance by $4 billion. Revenue grew 45% in the most recent quarter as our recently launched products gained momentum. Last year, we announced positive Phase III results for imlunestrant, insulin efsitora alfa and 3 additional tirzepatide trials. We also started Phase III programs for lepodisiran,  remternetug and olomorasib based on positive earlier phase data. We continue to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. We acquired Morphic Therapeutics and announced a collaboration with OpenAI to invent novel antimicrobials. We opened the Lilly Seaport Innovation Center in Boston as a hub for Lilly's genetic medicines efforts and announced a new Lilly Gateway lab in the U.K. to collaborate with European research. We advanced our manufacturing agenda, announcing investments to expand our footprint in Indiana, in Wisconsin and in Ireland. Since 2020, our commitments to build, expand and acquire manufacturing facilities now total more than $23 billion. Importantly, we brought innovative new medicines to patients. In 2024, we received regulatory approvals for Kisunla, Ebglyss, and a new indication for Zepbound in OSA. This progress strengthens our portfolio of new products and enhances our capacity to drive top-tier growth and margin expansion. As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 45% and our new products growing by more than $3.1 billion, led by a strong uptake of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Q4 also saw a solid performance across oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Our business, excluding incretins, grew by 20% in the quarter compared to Q4 2023, excluding the onetime benefits of business development. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones. We received approval for a new indication of Zepbound and Omvoh. We submitted imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer and tirzepatide for heart failure. We also announced positive Phase III results in the SURMOUNT-5 study, where Zepbound demonstrated a 47% greater relative weight loss compared to Wegovy. We strengthened our overall supply position and delivered on our production target to make 1.5x the salable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of '24 compared to the second half of '23. With more patients using Lilly Direct, the uptake of single-use Zepbound vials increased. We had no wholesaler back orders as we closed 2024, and wholesalers have been fulfilling orders from pharmacies at very high levels. We continue to augment our internal pipeline with external innovation, announcing plans to acquire Scorpion Therapeutics' mutant-selective PI3Ka inhibitor program. This transaction will add a clinical stage breast cancer asset to our oncology pipeline. And lastly, we returned $3 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition to that, we announced at the end of the year a $15 billion share repurchase program and the seventh consecutive 15% increase in our quarterly dividend. On Slide 6, you'll see a full list of key events since our Q3 call, including the milestones I mentioned here and several other updates. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q4 and 2024 full year results and provide details on the '25 guidance. Lucas Montarce : Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 summarizes our financial performance in the fourth quarter and Slide 8 for the full year. As Dave mentioned, our revenue grew 45% in Q4, primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Performance of our non-incretin portfolio was also strong as revenue grew 20%, excluding onetime payments related to business development. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 83.2% in Q4, primarily impacted by favorable product mix. R&D expenses increased 18% from continued investment in our early and late-stage portfolio. In total, we started 8 new Phase III programs in 2024 and advanced several new assets into the clinic. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 26%, mainly driven by promotional efforts to support ongoing and future launches. This includes U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising on Zepbound and Mounjaro and U.S. launch activities for Kisunla and Ebglyss. We also increased our commercial investment outside the U.S. to support international launches of Mounjaro. Operating income more than doubled, increasing to $5.6 billion, driven by higher revenue from new products. The effective tax rate was 13.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $5.32, inclusive of $0.19 of acquired IPR&D charges. This compares to $2.49 in Q4 2023 that includes $0.62 of acquired IPR&D. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 40% in Q4, driven by robust volume growth of 45%. Zepbound and Mounjaro were again the largest growth contributors, partially offset by declines in Trulicity. Realized prices decreased 5% in the U.S. due to favorable changes to estimate for rebates and discounts related to Mounjaro in Q4 2023. Europe revenue grew 82% in constant currency. We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Mounjaro and have now launched in all major European markets. In addition to growth from Mounjaro, European revenue benefited from onetime payment associated with the amendment of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. This was recorded in Jardiance's revenue in Q4. Excluding this onetime payment, Europe revenue grew 61%. Japan revenue grew 27% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Mounjaro, Omvoh,  Jardiance and Verzenio. In China, revenue increased 13% in constant currency.  Tyvyt and Verzenio drove volume growth. Mounjaro was recently made available in China and will proceed with a limited launch as supply becomes available. We expect modest initial Mounjaro sales in China due to supply limitations, a more meaningful contribution in the second half of 2025. Revenue in the rest of the world grew 46% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide 10 provides an update on our performance of new and growth products. New products more than doubled in Q4 to $5.6 billion, led by global Mounjaro sales of $3.5 billion and U.S. Zepbound sales of $1.9 billion. U.S. Zepbound performance is going very well. We began promotional activities this quarter, and we continue to see strong uptake. In Q4, Zepbound became the market leader in the anti-obesity market as measured by new prescriptions. As shown on slide 11, we combined U.S. incretin analog market, grew 45% compared to Q4 2023. We increased 3 percentage points in share of market in Q4 2024. Jaypirca worldwide revenue was $114 million, adding another solid quarter of sequential revenue growth. Worldwide Omvoh revenue increased to $57 million. With the recent FDA approval in Crohn's disease, we look to drive broader use in an additional patient population. The Kisunla launch is progressing well and prescriptions in the U.S. have been steadily increasing. While it is early, we saw positive momentum across key indications -- key indicators, including volume of diagnostic ordered, access in priority integrated health systems, coverage by Medicare and commercial plans and number of infusion sites placing orders. We are encouraged by the launch of Ebglyss in the U.S. We saw early positive receptivity and high levels of physician engagement. In addition, we expect commercial access with 2 of the largest pharma benefit managers beginning in March. We now plan on accelerating investment in commercial activities to drive new patient start. Growth products also performed well as revenue increased by 13% compared to Q4 2023. Verzenio's growth trajectory continued as U.S. total prescription grew by 15%. In addition to strong execution in the early breast cancer indication, Verzenio revenue benefited from increased U.S. wholesaler stocking at year-end. Worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 25%, driven by Mounjaro switches and to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to Slide 13 and 14, I will discuss our 2025 financial guidance. As previously shared, we expect 2025 revenue to be between $58 million and $61 billion. The midpoint represents approximately 32% growth compared to 2024. We anticipate continued U.S. incretin class growth, consistent with the trajectory of total prescriptions seen in 2024. We expect to launch Mounjaro in new markets outside the U.S. and Europe throughout the year. Mounjaro international revenue will contribute to overall performance more significantly in the second part of 2025. Given the uptake of newer incretins, we expect Trulicity volume to continue declining as fewer new patients are starting on Trulicity. We expect oncology, neuroscience and immunology to also grow revenue in 2025 as Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Omvoh and Kisunla launch upticks continue. At the portfolio level, we anticipate foreign exchange to be a headwind as the dollar has strengthened relative to other currencies. In addition, we forecast overall net prices to decline by mid- to high single digits in percentage terms, including U.S. Part D changes. We continue expanding our manufacturing capacity and estimate to produce 1.6x the amount of incretin salable doses during the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Our facility in Concord is anticipated to begin shipping medicines this year, and we plan to make continued progress on expanding our manufacturing network. Our expected ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue is expected to be between 41.5% and 43.5%. At the midpoint, this reflects approximately 340 basis points of margin expansion compared to 2024. In SG&A, we will continue to invest behind our new launches, including direct-to-consumer efforts in the U.S. to drive new patient activation. In addition, we plan to increase investment outside the U.S. to support the launches of Mounjaro in new and existing markets. In R&D, we plan to accelerate our investment in early and late-stage activities. As Dan will share later, we started 8 new Phase III programs in 2024 and anticipate that investment in those programs will ramp as the studies enroll patients. We also plan to initiate new Phase III programs in 2025. While we keep a high bar for what we advance into clinical trial development, we expect to scale our investment in R&D this year. Other expenses is expected to be $600 million to $700 million, driven by interest expense. We estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. Earnings per share or EPS is expected to be $22.50 and $24 on a non-GAAP basis. This doesn't include a forecast for charges related to IPR&D. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D and to provide an overview of potential key events we expect in 2025. Daniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Lucas. Lilly R&D had another productive quarter. I'll cover pipeline progress in Q4, then the 2024 key events and finally, provide potential key events for 2025. Since our last earnings call, 2 new indications were approved in the U.S., Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity and Omvoh for moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Both approvals are important milestones and mark an expansion in the number of patients who can benefit from each of these medicines. Moving to regulatory submissions. We completed submissions in the U.S. and EU for tirzepatide for heart failure and global submissions for imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer and for Jaypirca with the BRUIN CLL-321 data. I'm also pleased to share that we've submitted an update to the Kisunla U.S. label to include the dosing modification data from TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6, and the FDA has granted the submission a priority review. In our Phase III portfolio, we initiated a new program for Orforglipron in obstructive sleep apnea. This program includes 2 studies under the same master protocol to evaluate if people with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity can benefit from Orforglipron. After Zepbound was approved in the U.S. as the first and only prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea, we're excited to explore if an oral GLP-1 can also deliver a benefit in this disease. Earlier in the pipeline, we advanced the second oral GLP-1 into Phase II in obesity and advanced Eltrekibart into Phase II for ulcerative colitis. Three Phase II assets and 1 Phase I asset have been discontinued based on clinical readouts. In Q4, we also began Phase I studies for 4 new molecules, 1 in each of our therapeutic areas. Q4 capped off a productive year of advancing new medicines at Lilly. In total, over the year, we started 8 new Phase III programs. We disclosed Phase III data from 21 trials, including 17 major publications in top-tier medical journals. We received regulatory approvals for 2 new medicines, Ebglyss and Kisunla as well as many new indications around the world. And we added 14 new programs to the early phase pipeline. On Slide 16, we detail these outcomes for our 2024 milestones. I'm pleased that nearly all of our anticipated milestones came to fruition positively in 2024. Turning our focus to 2025. Slide 17 shows key R&D milestones we expect this year. Starting with our late-stage portfolio, we expect to initiate 2 new Phase III programs this year. First, in oncology, we'll begin an adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer Phase III program for our KRAS G12C inhibitor, olomorasib, building on its ability to be administered with immunotherapy. Our current metastatic program is progressing well, and we've aligned with the FDA on our Phase III dose through the Project Optimus pathway. We shared a clinical update at the World Conference on Lung Cancer last fall, and we are encouraged by the ability to safely combine olomorasib with other agents. Our new Phase III program will focus on moving to an earlier setting and combining with existing approved agents in both resectable and unresectable KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer to prevent cancer from recurring. The second program is in cardiometabolic health, where we plan to initiate a Phase III trial for Orforglipron in hypertension, adding to the ongoing trials in type 2 diabetes, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea. I'm excited that this year, we're looking forward to reading out multiple Orforglipron trials. We expect to see data from up to 5 studies in type 2 diabetes and 2 studies in obesity. Our goal is to generate efficacy, safety and tolerability profile that is similar to that of an injectable single-acting GLP-1, but through an orally available medicine. The first Orforglipron Phase III trial to read out will be ACHIEVE-1, which is a 40-week study in patients with type 2 diabetes. These patients have a baseline hemoglobin A1c between 7% and 9.5% and a body mass index of 23 or greater. The trial utilizes 6 escalating doses in 4-week increments to a maximum dose of 36 milligrams. Based on prior studies of Orforglipron as well as other GLP-1 therapies, we expect weight loss in people with diabetes to be significantly less than in people living with obesity who do not have diabetes. We anticipate ACHIEVE-1 will read out in Q2 this year, followed by up to 4 additional type 2 diabetes trials in the second half of 2025 and a potential submission for this indication in 2026. The Orforglipron Phase III trials in people with obesity, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2 are expected to read out in Q3 of this year. These trials will form the basis of our first Orforglipron regulatory submissions, which will be for the treatment of obesity, and we expect to occur late in 2025. This year, we also expect data from the tirzepatide cardiovascular outcome study SURPASS-CVOT. Of course, this is an event-based trial, and the time line is dependent on the accrual of cardiovascular events. We anticipate data in Q3. While designed to measure both non-inferiority and superiority compared to Trulicity, a positive outcome in either would demonstrate that tirzepatide reduces the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and would support a labeled indication. Late this year, we expect to see the first data from our triple-acting incretin Retatrutide which combines GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. We believe this potential new medicine can deliver even more weight loss than tirzepatide and could potentially provide additional health benefits. The initial study to read out TRIUMPH-4 is a 68-week study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who have a body mass index of 27 or greater. We'll also see multiple additional Jaypirca data sets this year. Physician feedback is very positive on experience with Jaypirca in the currently approved indications, and we hope that generating data in earlier lines of therapy will enable broader use within CLL and MCL. We could see data from additional trials in the first-line or BTK-naive settings this year. Moving to neurodegeneration. While we don't have a key event listed in 2025 for donanemab, we're closely watching the preclinical Alzheimer's disease study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3. This trial screened patients with a blood-based diagnostic and utilized a fixed duration of treatment with donanemab. By moving earlier in disease progression, the goal is to reduce the risks of developing any symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. While the current primary completion is projected for 2027, the study will read out when the target number of progression events are accrued. A new focus area for us in 2025 will be to study potential new applications of incretin biology across diseases in neuroscience and immunology. With the pipeline of incretins in clinical development and deep scientific expertise in this space, Lilly is well positioned to match the biologic properties of specific molecules to the desired indications being studied. We plan to start several clinical trials, assessing potential benefits of our incretins in areas that could include brain health, substance use disorder, pain, neuropsychiatry and inflammation. We'll be prepared to move rapidly into Phase III trials based on clinical data and where our conviction is high. Lastly, we expect a number of important regulatory submissions in 2025, including Orforglipron for obesity, as I detailed, insulin efsitora alfa for type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide for cardiovascular outcomes and multiple potential data sets for Jaypirca. 2025 will be another exciting year for Lilly R&D. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks. David Ricks : Yes. Thanks, Dan. So we had a strong financial performance in Q4 and throughout 2024. We finished $4 billion above our first-time revenue guide and $4 per share above our first-time EPS guide when taking IPR&D charges into account. The incretin market continues to grow rapidly, and Mounjaro and Zepbound are both gaining share of market. We believe both products are still very early in their launch cycle. In addition, our oncology, immunology and neuroscience therapeutic areas continue to progress, launching new medicines and delivering strong revenue growth. We have an exciting outlook for growth in 2025 as well. New indications, new manufacturing capacities, new access opportunities and new markets are all tailwinds to our financial performance. We made significant advances across our pipeline in 2024 and have several exciting readouts, which Dan just highlighted, expected throughout 2025. So now let me turn the call over to Mike to moderate our Q&A session. Mike Czapar : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call on time. So to that end, consistent with prior quarters, we will respond to one question per caller, and we will end at 11 a.m. [Operator Instructions] Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready to take the first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Timothy Anderson : Just a question on the guidance, the 2025 guidance. So I think everyone knows the prescription uptake trend didn't show acceleration, hasn't shown it yet. That's been viewed by some as a concern. Does the 2025 guidance require acceleration? Or can you get the scripts just continue on the same trajectory and the slope of that line doesn't change? When I do back of the envelope math, it seems like that's frankly all that needs to occur. And one of your slides suggests that might be the right way to think about it as well, but can you just confirm? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Tim, for the question. We'll go to Lucas to talk about the guidance assumptions. Lucas Montarce : Yes. We mentioned in my notes that what we expect to see, Tim, is a continuation of basically the total prescription growth that we have seen in 2024. So that's what we built in our 2025 guide. David Ricks : To the market. Lucas Montarce : For the market, yes. Operator : The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on your expectations for Zepbound payer dynamics and access this year, particularly the impact from the OSA label. I know you've also filed for heart failure and how you expect that to play out over the course of the year? And then anything on next steps on the compounding litigation that we should be focused on? David Ricks : Dangerously close to a 2-part question there, Terence, but we'll go to Patrik to talk about access, and then I'll come back to Dan to make a quick comment about compounding. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much. When we look at the commercial access, it remains strong. We have 8% to 7% coverage in the commercial space still. And of course, the employer opt-in is a second step of high importance that made progress in 2024, and we expect in terms of employer opt-in that we are north of 50% today. OSA remains an opportunity for us to gain access also in the Medicare segment, and CMS confirmed recently that they will reimburse OSA if Plan D plans decides to lift it. And they have 180 days to make that decision from the FDA approval, and we're working with plans right now, and we anticipate to get some Medicare coverage by the second half of this year. And similarly, OSA is also an opportunity for us to get more Medicaid states signed in. We expect PIF when and if approved, to have a similar role as OSA, an access opportunity, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. So regarding compounding, I think our position has been pretty clear. We've been in supply since August and FDA took us off the list formally later in Q4. Of course, the compounding associations are suing to delay that. We opposed that and joined that suit. I think the next date coming up is February 18, where the FDA said that's when you need to stop one form of compounding. Our position has been clear all along. We don't think there's a place for this because we have full supply, and there's no reason to have non-approved kind of illegitimate product out there. So of course, new sheriff in town, new government and court case pending. So we don't know the outcome of all that. But that all said, I mean, I think our business is growing nicely in Q4, and we can see that in prescription trends early this year. It's just an unsafe practice that shouldn't exist and long term probably isn't great for innovators. So we'd like to move on from this and hope that's what the courts and the government decide to do. Operator : The next question is coming from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney Breen : I just wanted to zoom into Orforglipron specifically, and I think you made -- took the chance to make the point about diabetes and diabetes population and their weight loss. Can you just talk a little bit more about kind of the potential positioning, particularly in the context of kind of that single injectable GLP-1 kind of anticipated efficacy that you're guiding to? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Courtney. We'll go to Dan to talk about the right comp for Orforglipron. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes, sure. I'll start on the efficacy expectations and then maybe Patrik can talk about the market positioning here. So you're right, it's a single GLP-1, and we take pains to mention that because we're not expecting the kinds of efficacy or tolerability actually that we see with tirzepatide, which is a dual-acting agent. Still, as you know, monotherapy with GLP-1 has provided important benefits to many patients. And so we're setting our sights there. This is a first study in type 2 diabetes patients where, as I noted, weight loss is typically quite a bit lower than you see in people without type 2 diabetes. So we sort of index on the efficacy that we've seen in the past with Ozempic, and we'll get that data soon and excited to see it. Patrik? Patrik Jonsson : And from a positioning perspective, we like the idea of having an oral with an injectable GLP-1 like efficacy. And there is a big portion of patients that actually have needle fear. It's estimated in the U.S. to be 20% to 25% and also a group of patients that doesn't necessarily need the amount of weight loss or HbA1c reduction as tirzepatide generates. And that might be an opportunity in the maintenance space as well. But lastly and very importantly, it's an opportunity to scale in markets outside the U.S., taking into account that we don't have a need for refrigeration. Operator : The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just another Orforglipron question. You've now launched a pretty wide range of studies, I guess, to say hypertension beyond the initial obesity and type 2 diabetes studies. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what gives you confidence in running such a wide range of programs without having seen those initial readouts, particularly maybe some of the tolerability profiles with the drugs titration, et cetera. I'm just trying to think how you balance kind of the risk taking there with the confidence in the asset you have right now? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Dan for that question. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's a smart question. Of course, going into Phase III with any drug, particularly a small molecule such as Orforglipron, the biggest risk is safety. And I think as these trials proceed, even though we're not seeing the safety data, we grow more confident in the overall safety profile of the drug because the trials continue uninterrupted. Of course, we won't know for sure until we get that first data readout and then subsequent data readouts. But it's correct that we grow more and more confident in the success of this molecule as each day passes. As for specifics around tolerability and titration and discontinuations, those don't really factor into our thinking. We haven't had a look at unblinded data for any of those things. So we can't make assumptions on that yet. Operator : The next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citibank. Geoffrey Meacham : Just had one on commercial tirzepatide in bigger settings like diabetes prevention or if the SURPASS-CVOT is successful. Would these be a tipping point on broader reimbursement or access? I mean it's clear you have a benefit there, but I wasn't sure if commercial payers or Medicare are looking for yet even more data to support kind of risk benefit. David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Geoff. We'll go to Patrik to talk about the broader landscape there. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Geoff. I think the SURMOUNT-1 extension is definitely defined as game-changing at the provider level, and we are in discussions, of course, with regulatory agencies. But there is no precedent for type 2 prevention as an indication. But the data itself, I think we will utilize to really drive increased employer opt-in seeing the benefits of outcome studies and treatment of people with prediabetes and obesity. Daniel Skovronsky : Maybe just a broader point, which we've said before, Geoff, I think a lot of investors are looking for some single event that will trigger the broad reimbursement or not. And I don't think we've ever really thought of it that way, but rather an accumulation and sort of weight of everything that will grow reimbursement steadily over time. And I think that's actually what we've seen since we launched Zepbound last year, U.S. commercial insurance picking up several points during the year and even ex U.S. now with U.K. reimbursement, et cetera. Different payers will make different decisions at different times. And I think the data sets you mentioned will be some of the more compelling to create moves, but still then the way affordability and budget constraints, et cetera. That all said, by the time we get to the end of the decade, it's hard to imagine we are not using obesity medications to prevent what is the precursor condition to so many chronic diseases. And already, the health economics are pretty compelling, and there'll be more data coming beyond that. So long term, we remain really, really bullish on this whole category being reimbursed like we expect to reimburse all other medications. Just the schedule for that is going to be more slow and steady, I would say, as you model expectations on a global scale and in the U.S. as well because of the diversity of the payers. Operator : The next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities. Colleen Garvey : This is Colleen on for Seamus. We just wanted to ask on the sustainability of operating margin expansions. Looking at some of the longer-term forecasting from sell-side consensus, we're seeing estimates nearing 50% by the end of the decade. Do you view this as realistic? Or how are you thinking about the balance between the margins and then also ensuring you're not underinvestigating on the pipeline. David Ricks : Great. Thanks for the question, Colleen. I'll go to Lucas to talk about the long-term operating margin philosophy. Lucas Montarce : Well, we are very pleased with the results that we've seen in 2024 and Q4, and we provided a guidance for 2025 that is a continuation of that margin expansion with -- I mentioned 340 basis points expansion in 2025. Thinking more long term, our view is how we continue to drive growth in a sustainable manner. And in order to do so, we believe that reinvesting into the business, in particular, in R&D to drive that innovation and growth into the future is critical success factor for our business. So from that perspective, we mentioned before that we believe that getting into high 40s or 50% is not actually a good way to drive that sustainable growth into the future. So what we are seeing now on that low 40s is, in particular, at this time, the right basically balance that we have in terms of investment into the business and also the returns that we generate as well. Operator : The next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Conor MacKay : This is Conor MacKay on for Evan. Given some of the slower launches we've seen from peers in the Alzheimer's space, can you maybe talk a bit about the lessons you've taken from those and then as well as sort of your experience early days in the Kisunla launch? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Conor, for the question. We'll go to Anne to talk about Kisunla. Anne White : Well, thanks so much for the question about Kisunla. And I'll tell you, we are pleased with our momentum so far. What our system -- our team is focused on really is system readiness and growth. That's still a significant area of opportunity in the space. So we're partnering with health care providers to scale and reach more patients. As far as how it's going so far, Lucas mentioned key indicators that we're watching. To date, we've achieved P&T approvals of over 80% in our key accounts, we have over 800 prescribers. And then an important leading indicator is the diagnostics front, and those results also continue to be encouraging, and its use is more than doubling in the last year and the use of blood diagnostics grows significantly each month as well. The true challenge here is the system -- health care systems' readiness and I think most critically, the capacity to detect and diagnose patients. And so we have a number of solutions that we're working on with the health care providers to help them increase that capacity, increase the throughput for patients, a lot of educational series as well on how to quickly diagnose and treat these patients. Importantly, I think we're hearing a lot of enthusiasm about the profile of Kisunla, and that actually helps with these capacity constraints, the once-monthly infusions, the ability to stop dosing once plaque is cleared, all of those physicians have told us are going to help with some of these capacity constraints. So it's been a strong start so far. We learned lessons from the first launch that went out there and applying that learning to what we're doing now. But it's been really positive so far in the terms of the level of support and collaboration that Lilly has been able to bring with our expertise in the field and our long relationships with these customers. Operator : The next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer Raffat : It's certainly very encouraging to see the range of new Phase III trials being initiated with Orforglipron in the past few months. But there's one trial in particular I noticed has not been initiated or may not be in the plans, which is an outcomes trial. I'm just curious what's the thought process behind that? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Umer, for the question. We'll go to Dan to talk about the Orfo development plan. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Umer. Of course, we're trying to cover a broad landscape of indications here that we think would be important and fit with the advantages an oral medication has in sort of primary care broad use kinds of applications being prioritized. Outcome setting is an interesting idea. The challenges here in maintaining patients on placebo make it more and more difficult to do those kinds of studies in the U.S., but it's certainly an idea that we're exploring around the world and more thinking to come in the future. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve Scala : I apologize in advance for this question. But over the past 6 to 9 months, there has been a consistent cadence of data points questioning the size of the addressable and accessible obesity market, none of which are news, but include slowing prescription trends, Lilly meeting demand at least a year early, Lilly instituting DTC and extending co-pay cards despite struggling to meet demand, Lilly launching in OUS markets despite struggling to meet U.S. demand and significant stocking fluctuations and challenges in guiding. So taken collectively, these points are concerning. I think you will say that they all relate to the unprecedented size of the market and meeting its demand, but can you state that there has not been any conversations within Lilly questioning whether we are all significantly over our skis on this market and that the manufacturing build-out may simply be too aggressive? Mike Czapar : Great. Well, Steve, thanks for the apology and the question. I'll go to Dave for that one. David Ricks : Yes, Steve, I think you've been calling into our calls for most of my career. I've never had the apology upfront, so I appreciate that. I know why you're asking it. And I think the perspective we have is that it's early days on a very, very large opportunity. There's turbulence. I'll own that. We always seek to put projections out that we can hit with confidence, but that are also within the range of possibilities. And in the back half of that year -- last year, we fell short of that. But everything we've said is true, and we continue to believe in that this is a market with hundreds of millions of people globally that there is a unique thing here and that we can both prevent a large portion of chronic disease with obesity drugs. And last year, we saw proof points on that from Lilly and our competitor that's not just weight loss that translates into chronic disease outcomes. You'll hear and see more of that. And people love taking these drugs. We know that because when we run out, which we did last year, they get very angry with us. And so I have been a person who represents to the Board, the CapEx decisions, I have zero doubt that we have still more building to do and that the capacity we put in the ground so far is not sufficient to meet global demand. You'll hear more about that from us. Of course, as highlighting on this call, we're getting close to, I think, a relief valve on that, which is the idea that you could have an oral which is scalable in a way that injectable systems just aren't really test the question legitimately what is the edge of the demand curve. But we don't think we're close to it right now. We're still gating promotion and gating launches globally. That's a different thing, and we're building facilities as fast as we can to match up those 2 things, what we can make and what we can sell, and although we're supplying the U.S. market well right now, we'll need to do more, and I'm pretty confident in that. So hopefully, that gives you some color on the mindset here, and wouldn't overread the turbulence and prediction challenges we have. But long term, we're very bullish, and you'll see us act according to that belief. Operator : The next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : I have a question regarding sleep apnea. Now that you have sleep apnea on Zepbound label, how have the discussions with the prescribers as well as payers have gone so far? The one pushback we hear is that these patients are often treated by sleep specialists, and there's a general shortage of those specialists here. So could you talk a little bit about the call points and how you're thinking about this? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Mohit. We'll go to Patrik for the question on sleep apnea, what the discussions are like with some of the prescribers and the initial experience so far. Patrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Mohit. Yes, you're correct. It's the first pharmacological treatment ever approved for obstructive sleep apnea. So there is a lot of lifting on our side, and we will approach that as we are approaching any new disease area, partnering with advocacy organization, health care providers and massive efforts in terms of medical education. We expect this to go beyond the sleep specialists. But of course, we are starting our efforts with the sleep specialist community. And I think that's been very well received so far. And we are meeting with them regularly conducting speaker screenings, but with the aim to move to primary care, which is a necessity because this is also a patient population that, to a large extent, remains undiagnosed. So primary care efforts are going to be required. Operator : The next question will be from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. David Risinger : So my incretin-related questions have been asked. I wanted to just pivot to the long-acting relaxin candidate VOLENRELAXIN. And so the company had advanced it into a CKD trial in the fourth quarter, but then recently canceled both the heart failure and CKD programs. Dan, I'm hoping you could provide some more color on what drove the action plus how you now view the long-acting relaxin mechanism, including potential for future development in other cardiopulmonary diseases. David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Dave. We'll go to Dan to talk about the VOLENRELAXIN program. Daniel Skovronsky : Thank you. I was disappointed with the results from the Phase II trial for sure. Relaxin is an interesting mechanism, I think, sort of validated by normal human physiology during pregnancy. But unfortunately, the results that we got in this trial didn't support proceeding with this molecule. I read that as speaking to the mechanism, but rather than the molecule. But I know others are pursuing this mechanism, and I wish some success where we didn't have it. So we'll have to wait and see. Operator : The next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash Tewari : So at JPMorgan, your team mentioned you expect GLP-1 pricing to be relatively stable in 2025. Are you implying that while you'll give additional discounts to the channel to improve access, that will be offset by improved adherence? Or is it more Lilly's reached a steady state on discounts at least until semaglutide gets put under IRA negotiation in 2026? David Ricks : All right. Thanks, Akash. We'll go to Lucas to talk about GLP-1 pricing trends. Lucas Montarce : Thanks for the question. In terms of the pricing trends that I alluded during the JPMorgan conference and getting into 2025, first, we talk about the Q4. And into 2025, what we mentioned basically is a continuation of the trends. Remember that we had in the base period in 2023, an uncovered copay that basically created quite a lot of noise on the year-on-year comparison. So we talk about basically adjusting by that, there is still single-digit erosion on our pricing trends, and that's the same trends that I alluded that will continue into 2025. In terms of some of the dynamics on the access side, I don't know if you want to comment anything, Patrik, on your side. Patrik Jonsson : No, I think we have really good access on the Mounjaro side, over 90% in commercial and Part D, and I've already covered the commercial space for Zepbound. We expect access to continue to improve in 2025 as well. In terms of adherence, I think we just need to reflect on the dynamics that we have experienced in this market, partly due to supply constraints, but we are encouraged with what we see on Mounjaro for patients that started in Q2 2023, we actually see a longer adherence with Mounjaro than we do with both Trulicity and Ozempic. And as Dave referred to earlier, in terms of set bound, we expect adherence to be long here based upon the firsthand experiences that consumers have. Operator : The next question will be from Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research. Alexandria Hammond : With the Rowe partnership, how does Lilly envision this relationship evolving? And a follow-up, can you help frame the opportunity associated with Zepbound vials? And how is that expected to shift over time? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Alex. We'll go to Patrik to talk about Zepbound vials and Rowe. Patrik Jonsson : Yes. We launched the self-pay system with Lilly Direct back in late August, and we are pleased with the performance so far. In terms of TRx for Zepbound, it's still low to mid-single digit. But in terms of new therapy starts, it's actually in the low teens. So a very good start. The partnership with Rowe is not a financial or a marketing partnership at all. It's just the opportunity for eligible patients to have the option of using the Rowe platform to purchase FDA-approved authentic medicines. And it's really about connecting that software to Lilly Direct self-pay pharmacy. And we will lean into additional partnerships along those lines with partners that really want to ensure that the patients get access to authentic and FDA-approved medicines. Operator : The next question will be from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Apologies, I was on mute. So the Orforglipron launch, you previously stated that you're doing manufacturing scale-up to be prepared for a full launch at potential approval. What is embedded in that assumption? Can you talk a little bit about the approach for timing of Orforglipron in terms of diabetes versus obesity? Will it be simultaneous or one before the other? U.S. versus international, we certainly saw the injectable business do a prioritized U.S. launch. And then should we also expect a similar kind of \"new product\" launch cadence with patient assistance programs and the implementation of channel tools like Lilly Direct, should all those be at the outset? Mike Czapar : Thanks, Chris, for the very detailed question. We'll go to Dave to talk a bit about the Orforglipron launch prep. David Ricks : Okay. Yes. Look, the goal here with Orforglipron because it's using different production systems that are available to us. It's a long cycle of processing to get commercial product, but it's very predictable, and we have access to those platforms inside and outside the company. So we are building for a full launch in the normal pharma sense. And here, pointing out maybe the flip of the earlier question about demand, we have had to gate all these things to make sure we carefully match supply and demand for the injectables as is our competitor. We do not plan for that with Orforglipron. So we will plan to launch or submit and have approvals and then launch in a full sense, including activities you're used to seeing for primary care products like sampling, co-pay, full formulary access and globalization of Orforglipron as rapidly as possible. And we're building capacities to do that. And hopefully, that will begin in early '26. I think as Dan mentioned, the first complete package for submission in the U.S. will be obesity. But we expect diabetes to shortly follow and then these other indications that have been discussed today. I hope that answers the question. Operator : The next question will be from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James Shin : Another one for Dan on Orforglipron. I appreciate the earlier comments on indexing Orforglipron's efficacy to semaglutide and the Phase III titration schedule. But can you go over how this titration schedule may impact the Phase II weight loss, A1c and safety results published in Lancet and New England Journal? David Ricks : Great. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. We'll go to Dan to talk more about Orforglipron. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. It's a good question, James, and reminiscent of the theme we had when the tirzepatide trials were going. It was a similar transition from a faster titration in Phase II to a more gradual titration in Phase III. I think that strategy served us well in the case of tirzepatide. I'm hopeful for the same kind of outcomes in Orforglipron, which is to say that it mitigated tolerability concerns. So the GI side effects that are just known to this class seem to be significantly mitigated by slower titration. And in longer studies and the first study to read out is not the longest study we have here. In longer studies, we were still able to obtain the sort of plateau kind of efficacy that we expect for the mechanism. So that's what we're hoping for or for better tolerability and similar efficacy as Phase II. Operator : The next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung Huynh : So for the first ortho study on diabetes, thank you so much for the level set there. I have a similar question on retatrutide. We noticed in your slides, there was a Phase III readout in obesity and overweight patients with osteoarthritis of the knee as a potential event for '25. So one of the primary endpoints is weight loss. Could that be a reasonable comp for the obesity studies in '26, unlike what you flagged with ortho and diabetes? David Ricks : Thanks for the question, Trung. We'll go to Dan to talk about retatrutide. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. I'm glad you asked the question. It's a super smart question. You're probably noticing that the osteoarthritis trial is shorter than any of the other ones. We've commented before that retatrutide is going to need longer trials. Most of ours are 80-week plus trials to reach maximal efficacy. This is a 68-week trial. I think we also know, at least by analogy from the semaglutide trials that looked at osteoarthritis and obesity versus a more pure obesity population that even for similar length studies, there's a diminution of efficacy in terms of weight loss in the OA population for a number of reasons, including different baseline demographics, male, female, BMI, et cetera. So I think we know how to extrapolate out from the OA population to the general population, but I don't think you should take the OA population as a point estimate for what will be achieved in a broader obesity population. We should do quite a bit better than that. Operator : The next question will be from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Nicole Germino : This is Nicole on for Kripa. Can we see some bima data this year? And do you still see some benefit with a muscle preserving drug? The recent data from Ver showed preservation of lean mass but no incremental weight loss. So with bima, do you expect incremental weight loss or weight control but better body composition? Is that what you're looking for? David Ricks : Thanks for the question. We'll go to Dan to talk a bit about how we're thinking about the bima data. Daniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks for a good question on bimagrumab. I think our thesis here has been in combination with tirzepatide that we could get incremental weight loss or perhaps a similar weight loss. But as you point out, with preservation of what we call lean mass. I think to really show a benefit for combining the 2 drugs, we're probably going to either need to see the incremental weight loss or we're going to need to see some real functional benefits to lean mass preservation. I think just lean mass on its own, we don't really know how to understand that, and we've previously noted that we don't see any signs that lean mass changes on tirzepatide or to my knowledge, on any incretin are actually adverse in any way. On the other hand, growing muscle could be a positive in different ways. So we're looking for new positive effects with bimagrumab. The beginning of your question, I realize it didn't come to, which is when do we see the previous Phase II study, which was completed. We haven't been clear on exactly when we'll show that data, but this year is a safe assumption. David Ricks : Great. Thank you, Dan. I think we have time for one last question. Operator : The final question today will be a follow-up from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. David Risinger : I was just hoping you could clarify the comment earlier. I think there was a comment about additional PBM coverage coming in March. I didn't quite catch that. If you could just provide some more color and quantify the potential impact on the opportunity for script trends following that occurring. Daniel Skovronsky : Let me cover that, and then I'll just close. I think Dave, that was referred to Ebglyss, which is very new in cycle, and we do expect 2 of the 3 PBMs to cover it and that gets us excited about activating consumers and raising awareness for that brand. Zepbound, Mounjaro have full PBM coverage already. David Ricks : So great. Let's conclude it there. Thanks for dialing in, everyone, and your interest in today's earnings call and of course, in everything about Eli Lilly and Company. If you've got follow-up questions or things we didn't cover in enough detail today in the Q&A, please follow up with the IR team. Mike Czapar leads that now. And everyone, have a great day.
