J. Hottovy - Morningstar Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group Operator : Good morning. My name is Joana and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands\u2019 First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you, Steve Schmitt, VP of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy, may begin your conference. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Joana. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from David and Pat, we will take your questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands\u2019 Web site www.yum.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today\u2019s call. We are broadcasting this call via our Web site. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. As a reminder, at the beginning of this year we combined our Yum! Restaurant International and U.S. divisions into three global brand divisions; KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. China and India remained separate divisions giving their strategic importance and enormous growth potential. This new structure is designed to drive greater global brand focus enabling more effective knowhow sharing and accelerating growth. Beginning this quarter our financial reporting will reflect our new structure with comparable prior periods adjusted accordingly. Finally, we would like to remind you of the following upcoming Yum! investor events. Our Taco Bell Investor Day will be in Irvine, California on May 15th. And our second quarter earnings will be released on Wednesday, July 16th. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Novak. David Novak : Alright, thank you Steve and good morning everyone. I am pleased to report Yum! Brands is off to a strong start. Based on first quarter results and current sales trends we expect to deliver on the strong bounce back year we promised of at least 20% full year of EPS growth excluding special items. We had particularly strong results in China, emerging markets continue to have positive momentum and developed markets like KFC in the UK and Australia, were strong. However, like most retailers our U.S. business was soft driven impart by cold weather. Now as we see in the release, we\u2019re obviously pleased to report our China division continues to steadily improve, with both KFC and Pizza Hut producing strong sales and margin growth, driving our first quarter EPS growth of 24% prior to special items. In total our China division delivered system sales growth of 17% in the quarter as we opened 123 new units and grew same-store sales by 9%. The China team deserves special tribute as operating profit grew an impressive 80% prior to foreign currency translation. As predicted, productivity gains that began in 2013 now coupled with rebounding sales are driving dramatic profit growth. Clearly the most significant driver of the strong bounce back year for Yum! is a continued sales recovery at our KFC business in China, which delivered same-store sales growth of 11% in the quarter. Remember this compares to a 4% same-store sales decline during the fourth quarter. Our China division also achieved 23.4% restaurant margins in the first quarter. This compares to a full year restaurant margin of 15.4% in 2013. Obviously seasonality plays a role but to put things into perspective, first quarter restaurant margin for our China division was essentially in line with what we delivered in the first quarter of 2012. Any way you look at it we\u2019re pleased with our progress in China. Now if you recall we said last quarter that our focus at KFC China in 2014 was to bring more innovation and exciting news to our customers and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. According to our research, we have regained consumer trust and are now beginning our journey to restage KFC at even more useful contemporary and energetic brand that is innovating for a changing China. This is built on three pillars, taste, customer experience and digital. We\u2019re investing behind each of these for us, so the consumer wins. On March 26th, we announced the debut of an exciting new menu at KFC in our more than 4,600 restaurants in over 950 cities across China. This initiative is unprecedented in KFC\u2019s 27 year history in China and in fact in the entire QSR industry as we introduced 15 products simultaneously. These products are either new or the return of popular items previously offered on a limited time-only basis. The breadth and variety of these products are expected to further strengthen KFC\u2019s leadership in four signature product platforms, sandwiches, rice dishes, snacks as well as drinks and desserts. Going forward, we plan to do a similar menu update at least once a year. Now if you recall, we revamped 20% of the Pizza Hut Casual Dining menu twice a year, so we\u2019re still in a page out of the successful Pizza Hut playbook. On the advertising front, we\u2019re having a lot of fun using four useful and popular celebrities who are representing each of the product platforms. It\u2019s early days but we\u2019re pleased with this initiative and expect it to drive high levels of ongoing consumer engagement. Our advertising has already received over 7 million likes in the past three weeks, so clearly we\u2019re having some fun, our customers are enjoying. Simultaneously, we\u2019re launching redesigned packaging, contemporary staff uniforms, new menu boards and branded service. On the technology front, we\u2019ve begun rolling out Wi-Fi and a number of other new digital initiatives. In fact we will have free Wi-Fi in over 2,000 restaurants by year-end, making us what we believe to be the number one retailer on that front. This is another example of how we\u2019re providing customers a more contemporary environment in which to spend their time. We also have a new mobile app coming which will provide consumers the convenience of pre-ordering with electronic payment. The goal is to consistently bring exciting and dramatic news to the KFC brand across the year and keep it going. So, let me sum things up for KFC China, we\u2019re early in the year but we\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with sales and margins and we expect to build-off our upward momentum balance of year. Now, as I\u2019ve mentioned before Pizza Hut Casual Dining is arguably one of the greatest success stories in our industry the past three years. We\u2019re clearly the number one western casual dining chain in China with hardly any multi-national competition. We have 1,100 restaurants in over 290 cities and we opened 43 new stores in the first quarter further strengthening our category leading position. We\u2019re once again pleased with our same-store sales growth which was 8% in the first quarter. Our Pizza Hut more positioning backed by our strategy to refresh 20% of the menu every six months, as well as offer compelling values, is clearly resonating with consumers and driving results. We\u2019re also continuing to leverage our assets throughout the day by expanding our breakfast offering into more and more cities. Importantly, we have an amazingly strong economic model that generates two year cash paybacks on new unit openings. With the terrific performance we\u2019re seeing, we continue to broaden our new unit development of Pizza Hut Casual Dining and are aggressively expanding into lower tier cities. Without question, Pizza Hut Casual Dining is a growing powerhouse with a great future. The other exciting thing about Pizza Hut is we have a distinct home service brand in China where we deliver an all meal replacement to -- home meal replacement to Chinese consumers. And in fact around 40% of what we deliver is Chinese food. So not only are we delivering pizza but we\u2019re delivering a full array of Chinese menu options. We now have over 200 units in 25 cities and we\u2019re beginning to really scale this brand rapidly across the country. Importantly it\u2019s a high return small box format and sales are almost totally incremental versus our casual dining concept. So, this brand is a separate brand with great potential. Remember Domino\u2019s and Pizza Hut home delivery both have about 5,000 delivery focused units in United States today. With only around 200 units today in China, this brand is clearly poised for rapid growth in the years ahead. In 2014, we will be testing our Chinese concept East Dawning in lower tier cities and we\u2019re working hard to turnaround Little Sheep which has clearly been a disappointment since we acquired it in 2012 and continues to be so. Now looking at the long-term, China obviously has a large and growing consuming class which is expect to double from 300 million people to 600 million people by 2020. We\u2019re clearly in the right place at the right time with great brands that are absolutely loved by Chinese customers and we like how we\u2019re positioned and what is still the world\u2019s fastest growing economy which while slowing is still expected to grow more than 75 this year. So in 2014, our new unit development target of at least 700 new stores remains unchanged as we further capitalize on our leading positions in what remains the number one retail opportunity in the world. Moving to India, where we\u2019re investing in the future in developing a great business which will drive substantial growth for YUM! in the years ahead. At KFC, we continue to innovate around local customer preferences and we\u2019re excited about our second quarter launch of our new vegetarian line of products. We\u2019re focused on strengthening our economic model as we expand in the lower tier cities. Our pizza delivery business is now outperforming our largest delivery competitor from a same-store sale standpoint. And in Taco Bell, we\u2019re making progress developing a scalable economic model with the introduction of a small box format. And while it\u2019s still early days, we\u2019re confident Taco Bell will eventually be a successful business in India. Overall, we have over 700 restaurants in our India division and we\u2019re full steam ahead with development as we expect to open 150 new units this year. This is on top of over 150 new units in 2013 and while country macros haven\u2019t been as strong as we\u2019d like we made the strategic decision to invest in building each of our brands in the country with well over a billion people. Now as you know, we recently combined our Yum! Restaurants International and U.S. divisions in the three global brand divisions, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, our intent is to have dedicated brand teams going to work every day focused only on KFC, Pizza Hut or Taco Bell to drive each even more aggrieve global growth. In fact we just concluded our strategic business reviews and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how the organization is coming together. We\u2019ve also never seen such singular brand focus or higher levels of knowhow sharing between the international and U.S. brand teams which is a big competitive advantage. An early benefit of our new brand structure is we expect to set a new development record with over 1,100 new international units outside of China and India this year. Now let me share our perspective on our new brand division results. Let\u2019s start with KFC. In the first quarter, our KFC division which generates over 90% of its profit outside of the U.S. delivered a solid first quarter in a setup for a successful year. As you may know, we have nearly 14,000 restaurants in over 110 countries around the world, 99% of these KFC\u2019s are franchised. Importantly, we have a strong track-record in emerging markets and we continue to grow our presence with each passing year. In fact 46% of KFC division sales outside of the U.S. in 2013 were generated in emerging markets compared to 40% in 2008. During this timeframe, we increased our store sales base nearly 60%. Looking ahead, our new unit opportunities in emerging markets is arguably the best in retail with about two KFC restaurants per million people in emerging markets we know we have a long runway for future growth. Moving to our developed markets, we have very solid businesses in Australia and the UK which both delivered strong results in the first quarter. We\u2019re really focused on spreading knowhow and best practices from these two businesses to our underperforming markets in the United States and Canada. Now let\u2019s talk about Pizza Hut which clearly had a disappointing quarter. On the positive side, our emerging markets business delivered solid same-store -- system sales growth of 8% in the quarter. Having said this, results were negatively impacted by very poor performance in our U.S. business which contributes about half of Pizza Hut division\u2019s total profits. Same-store sales in the United States declined 5% in the quarter. We launched a new and improved hand-tossed pizza but the news wasn\u2019t strong enough to overcome value focused competitor activity. Looking ahead, we expect that they are much better with competitive value, our national advertising of WingStreet and with product news like our new garlic parmesan pizza offering. We also intend to do a better job engaging the digital consumer where our competitors are frankly doing a better job driving activation. In fact we\u2019ve committed significant additional resources to our digital agenda and I can assure you that we\u2019re moving forward with a high sense of urgency. Outside the United States, we\u2019re accelerating new unit development especially across the delivery and express channels. This is a great example of why we decided to reorganize the business as Pizza Hut now has dedicated brand focus that will drive international expansion at each of these segments. To sum it up, our top goals for 2014 are to accelerate our pace of global development and to turnaround our pizza U.S. business. We intend for Pizza Hut to ultimately become a double-digit profit grower for Yum! in the years ahead. Finally, at Taco Bell, both same-store sales and margins declined in the first quarter while dealing with the challenging weather, higher commodity inflation, and the overlap of 6% positive same-store sales in 2013, which was our strongest quarter of last year. While the quarter was below our ongoing expectations, we remain confident Taco Bell has all kinds of mojo going forward as we expect another strong year. The big news for Taco Bell is that on March 27 that\u2019s the day which falls in the second quarter which went down in history as the day we launched our national breakfast platform. I am pleased to report we\u2019re off to a great start and we are generating tremendous buzz around our advertising and products. I encourage you to try our A.M. Crunchwrap, Waffle Taco, and Cinnabon Delights. We have talked about products and talked about advertising and a breakfast line that is driving rave reviews for quality, affordability and value. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll be introducing mobile ordering at Taco Bell and we have significant innovation plan for our core business that we believe will wow our customers in 2014 including a major new product launch in the second half. Our ongoing product innovation is back by solid operations and strong unit economics, which allows us to open at least 100 net new units this year on top of 78 net new units we opened in 2013. As you know our U.S. business represents 97% of Taco Bell\u2019s global profits. We now have a dedicated international leadership team and have made additional investments in G&A to unlock the enormous development opportunities in front us. Given the power of the brand in the U.S. and its success in several other markets we believe Taco Bell will eventually become our third global brand. Taking a step back when you look at Yum! in total there are two important things to keep in mind; number one, we\u2019re largely a franchise business as over 90% of our restaurants outside of China are owned and operated by franchisees. In 2014 we will generate about $2 billion in franchise fees which is a $1 billion increase since 2004. We simply love the franchise business model as it\u2019s about as higher return business as you can possibly have; number two, Yum! Brands is the clear restaurant leader in emerging markets and we expect to build upon this position in the years ahead. And while we know emerging markets will have their ups and downs, we remain extremely bullish on our long-term prospects in these countries as the consuming class rapidly expands. Remember emerging market economies are expected to grow at almost three times the rate of developed market economies for the foreseeable future. Also remember, we only have two restaurants per million people in emerging markets. This compares about 58 restaurants per million people in United States today. That\u2019s a long runway for growth and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come. So let me wrap things up for Yum! Brands, on the whole we\u2019re off to a strong start to the year we\u2019re extremely pleased with our continued momentum in China and we had impressive results in a number of other markets. And as Pat will tell you on a new division basis we had a solid quarter at KFC, Taco Bell is off to a slow start but we\u2019re confident in the Brands positioning and plans balance of the year and we obviously have major work to do to get Pizza Hut on more competitive footing and we\u2019re confident we will do so. All-in-all we believe we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on the three things we know that drive shareholder value in retail; driving new unit development, building same-store sales growth, and doing these in a way that generates high returns. We\u2019re confident we will have a strong bounce back year in 2014 growing EPS at least 20% and reestablish our track-record of consistently delivering double-digit earnings per share growth in the years ahead. Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO. Pat Grismer : Thank you, David and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report strong first quarter EPS growth for Yum! Brands led by outstanding performance at our China division. This combined with current trends and balance of year initiatives for all our divisions gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance of at least 20% EPS growth excluding special items. We\u2019re also continuing to make investments that position us well to drive double-digit earnings growth for many years to come. Today I\u2019ll provide some additional perspective on our first quarter results and share our outlook for the second quarter and full year. I\u2019ll then talk about what we\u2019re doing to drive long-term value for our shareholders. For the first quarter we reported 24% EPS growth before special items. This increase was led by significant sales, margin and profit growth at our China division. We also have solid operating performance at our new KFC division. However, these results were partially offset by disappointing results at our new Pizza Hut division and at our Taco Bell division which was adversely effected by unusually severe weather in the U.S. Now I\u2019d like to dig a little deeper into each division\u2019s first quarter results. In China, operating profit increased by an impressive 80% prior to foreign currency translation. This performance was driven by same-store sales growth of 9% and nearly 7 points of restaurant margin improvement versus prior year. Given the challenges that we experienced in 2013, the single most important driver of a strong bounce back year for Yum! is continued sales improvement at our KFC business in China. With 11% same-store sales growth in the quarter it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re building momentum with this business and we\u2019re pleased with the overall progress we\u2019re making at KFC. Based on improving sales and the recovery we\u2019ve seen in key consumer metrics at KFC we reaffirm our 2014 guidance of high single to low double-digit same-store sales growth for the China division. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China system sales grew 30% including unit growth of 23% and same-store sales growth of 8% for the quarter. We\u2019re confident 2014 will be another outstanding year for this business as we continue to accelerate new unit development, expand breakfast into more and more cities and leverage our assets even further throughout the day. Now as pleased as we are with China sales I have to say we\u2019re even more pleased with China\u2019s restaurant margin topping 23% in the first quarter excluding an approximate half point negative impact of Little Sheep China division restaurant margin was actually slightly above what it was in the first quarter of 2012. This outstanding result reflects operating leverage from positive same-store sales, new pricing actions taken late last year and significant gains in restaurant productivity which further extend and build upon the efficiencies we realized in the second half of 2013. We continue to drive higher restaurant operating efficiency through improved store level sales forecasting, better labor scheduling and more effectively optimizing operating hours at selected locations. Importantly we\u2019ve accomplished this while maintaining our high standards of customer service. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our China restaurant operations team for their breakthrough performance in achieving new levels of restaurant productivity. Shifting to development, we opened 123 new restaurants in China during the quarter including 68 KFC\u2019s and 43 Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants. Over 70% of these new units were built in tier 3 through six cities where our unit economics and returns are strongest. So to summarize the progress we\u2019re making in our China business. At KFC we continue to see sequential improvement in same-store sales growth and consumer brand attribute scores are essentially back to 2012 levels. Additionally, we delivered strong restaurant margins in the quarter and are seeing significant improvement in new unit performance. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining we continue to have strong same-store sales growth with AUDs higher than KFC and full year margins above 20% we\u2019re generating two year cash payback. We\u2019re aggressively investing behind this growth engine while also increasing our pace of development with Pizza Hut home service, which has compelling unit economics with a smaller investment. These results give us confidence that we\u2019ll not only achieve our full year target of high single to low double-digit same-store sales growth for our China division but we\u2019ll deliver significant full year margin improvement as well. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our progress and confident our China division will continue to be a major growth engine for Yum! Brands for many years to come. Now let me talk about our three new global brand divisions, starting with KFC. Our new KFC division includes all KFC units outside of our China and India divisions. To put this division in perspective KFC division contributed 29% of Yum! total operating profit in 2013, 91% of which was generated outside the U.S. Additionally as of the end of Q1 91% of KFC stores were franchised. For the quarter operating profit increased 4% excluding foreign currency translations. Operating profit growth was negatively impacted by 4 percentage points with the lap of one-time fees from a franchise ownership change in Malaysia in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding this item KFC\u2019s operating profit grew a solid 8%. In the quarter KFC opened 80 new restaurants including 77 new international units. Our franchisees continued to lead the way with development opening 88% of these new units. As a reminder similar to previous years we expect our new unit development will ramp-up significantly as the year progresses. Same-store sales grew 1% in the quarter, these results were softer than we would have liked as weak performance in the U.S. and Thailand partially offset strong same-store sales performance in the UK, Russia, South Africa and the Middle East. In our international markets, same-store sales grew 3% in emerging markets and 1% in developed markets. In the United States same-store sales declined 3%. KFC operating margin was relatively flat versus prior year as the benefits of same-store sales growth and franchise development were offset by the prior year lap I mentioned, as well as a slight decline in Company restaurant margins. Moving to our new Pizza Hut division, which includes all Pizza Hut units outside of our China and India divisions. Pizza Hut division contributed 15% of Yum! total operating profit in 2013, 54% of which was generated in the U.S. Additionally 94% of Pizza Hut units were franchised as of the end of Q1. First quarter operating profit declined 14% versus prior year. Operating profit growth was adversely effected by 5 percentage points from the lap of a UK pension plan benefit realized last year. Excluding this one-time item Pizza Hut\u2019s operating profit declined a disappointing 9%. Pizza Hut opened 69 new restaurants including 39 units opened outside the U.S., 87% of these new units were opened by our franchisees. Same-store sales declined 2% in the quarter driven by a 5% decline in the U.S. which accounts for about half of our Pizza Hut store base. For our international markets same-store sales grew 3% in emerging markets and 1% in developed markets comparable to KFC. Pizza Hut operating margin decreased approximately 6 percentage points for the quarter due impart to the decline in same-store sales and about a 4 percentage point drop in Company restaurant margin. Additionally about 2 percentage points of the operating margin decline was attributable to the pension overlap I mentioned previously. The restaurant margin decline was driven by sales deleverage and higher than expected commodity inflation in our U.S. business, where as I mentioned before the majority of our Company stores are located. We also made strategic investments in field level G&A to open new Pizza Hut markets and drive higher levels of development. As I\u2019ll explain later we don\u2019t expect first quarter results to be indicative of the Pizza Hut's performance balance of year. Moving to our new Taco Bell division, which includes all Taco Bell units outside of our China and India divisions. Taco Bell division contributed 21% of Yum! total operating profit in 2013, 97% of which was generated in the U.S. And as of the end of Q1, 85% of Taco Bell stores were franchised. Taco Bell\u2019s reported results for the first quarter were clouded by a number of factors but we don\u2019t expect these results to be at all representative of the full year results. First quarter operating profit declined 16% versus prior year with a same-store sales decline of 1% on the heels of eight consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. We estimate that unusually severe U.S. weather impacted first quarter same-store sales by about 3 percentage point. Additionally, operating profit growth was negatively impacted by 5 percentage points due to a franchise incentive related to our national breakfast launch. While operating profit was impacted more than you\u2019d expect on a 1% same-store sales decline, it\u2019s important to note that our Company stores are more heavily concentrated in weather impacted geographies and thus underperformed to system average. In addition to the incremental sales deleverage restaurant margin was further impacted by a relatively high mix of labor-intensive and promotional products as well as higher than expected commodity inflation. This yielded about a 2.5 percentage point decline in restaurant margin for the quarter. We view this as a temporary phenomenon and expect second half performance to be much stronger than the first as innovation led sales growth, promotion led mix shift, and new pricing actions deliver improved margin performance balance of year. On the development front, Taco Bell opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter, and 27 of these new units opened by our franchisees. So, in summary for Yum! Brands, our 24% EPS growth for the first quarter was consistent with the guidance that we provided in February to be roughly in line with our full year EPS target of at least 20%. And while our Taco Bell and Pizza Hut results were softer than we would have liked, this was more than offset by strong performance in our China division. For the second quarter we expect EPS growth to be our highest of the year. Remember, in Q2 of last year, the KFC China poultry supply incident and news of avian flu weighed heavily on China division results making the second quarter our low point of the year from an EPS growth perspective. We\u2019ll have the benefit of overlapping these weak results this year, combined with a tailwind from upward sales momentum at KFC in China and continued strength in China restaurant margins. We also expect a much better sales results from Taco Bell with our recent breakfast launch. However Q2 profit growth of Taco Bell will be moderate as commodity inflation will continue to pressure restaurant margins although not to the extent we saw in the first quarter. And finally we expect KFC to remain solid and Pizza Hut to show improvement in the second quarter. Now, before I talk about full year expectations, I want to provide some context for China restaurant margins and how we see this evolving balance of year. First, I want to caution you not to extrapolate our first quarter margin gain to the full year. Bear in mind that with respect to China restaurant margin, Q1 marks our easiest overlap of the year. Additionally, we began to implement new productivity measures during the second quarter of 2013, so we\u2019ll begin to overlap some of those benefits this quarter. And finally we just launched an extensive menu revamp which will add some initial labor complexity including training cost and a slightly higher food cost mix. All that said, we\u2019re confident in our ability to make significant full year margin gains in China. In addition to the labor efficiencies I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve continued to optimize operating hours at KFC and are seeing stronger new unit margins with the increasing weight of our development program towards lower tier cities and towards Pizza Hut Casual Dining. We also took about 3 points of pricing at KFC and 2 points of pricing at Pizza Hut Casual Dining late last year which should benefit the full year. At our December investor meeting, we indicated that China division margin would improve between 1 and 3 percentage points from 2013\u2019s full year restaurant margin as about 15%. Based on our strong start to the year and each of the items I just mentioned, and with expected full year division, same-store sales in the high single to low double-digit range we\u2019ve guided, I\u2019m confident that China division\u2019s restaurant margin will be at least 17% for the full year. So now let me share our expectations for the full year 2014, which as I mentioned last quarter, will look different from our ongoing growth model. This year we expect the growth rate for our China division to be significantly above its ongoing target of 15% this year, or about 40%. As sales at KFC China continue to improve, we expect China division restaurant margins will continue to benefit from operating leverage as well as from productivity initiatives and pricing. We also expect another strong year at Pizza Hut Casual Dining and on the development front we expect to open at least another 700 new units in 2014. Looking at our new brand divisions, we expect KFC\u2019s growth rate to be above its ongoing target of 10%, Pizza Hut\u2019s growth rate to be below its ongoing target of 8% and Taco Bell to be in line with its ongoing target of 6%, just as we mentioned in December. And while Taco Bell and Pizza Hut both had a slow start to the year, we expect Taco Bell to make this up in the balance of the year with a strong second half supported by breakfast, new product innovation, digital initiatives and additional pricing actions. However, it\u2019s likely that Pizza Hut will trail our previous expectations although we do expect significant improvement from our first half as we sharpen our marketing, improve our digital execution and accelerate the pace of new unit development globally all enabled by our new global brand structure. When you add it all up, we expect at least 20% EPS growth in 2014. Now before we open up the call to questions, I\u2019d like to talk about how we\u2019re financially wired to generate strong returns for our shareholders. First with the strong and steadily growing cash flow that we generate from our global franchise business and from our high return equity businesses, we reinvest a substantial portion about 40% in new growth opportunities, largely new store openings. With the changes we\u2019ve made to our store ownership profile over the years, there are a combination of new equity businesses and refranchising, these new stores are increasingly skewed to emerging markets which offer superior returns and significant growth potential thus laying a strong foundation for future earnings growth. Second, we pay a dividend which we\u2019ve grown at a double-digit rate every year since we first paid a dividend over 9 years ago, making us one of only 10 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. This has delivered an annual dividend yield of about 2% which is very competitive for a Company with our growth profile. Third, we don\u2019t hold cash, after covering our growth investments and dividends, we return all available cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Based on the track-record of our staff over the years, it\u2019s fair to say that these buybacks have created enormous value for our shareholders. All three of these levers growth investment, growing dividend and value creating share repurchases work together to drive strong returns for our shareholders. So let me wrap things up. We\u2019re pleased with our strong first quarter results, specifically at our China division. It\u2019s evident, that the actions we took in 2013 to strengthen our business coupled with our ongoing growth investments have set us up for a strong bounce back in 2014. Looking at our three new global divisions, KFC is off to a solid start, Pizza Hut is in turnaround mode and Taco Bell\u2019s year will be more of a first half, second half story as we continue to build momentum with this exciting brand. In addition, we continue to strengthen our position in high growth emerging markets, as we capitalize on the low levels of unit penetration and the growth of the emerging economies. I am confident in the strength of our business model and we\u2019ll continue to make the investments necessary to sustain double-digit EPS growth over the long-term. And with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Question: and: Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Your line is open. Joseph Buckley : Thank you. Pat, can I ask you to elaborate a little bit on the China margin comments. I mean effectively saying up at least 17%, you are staying within the high range of the prior 130 to 300 basis points improvement over 2013. So, kind of would you walk through some of the key elements, food cost inflation, labor inflation, may be what you saw on both of those in the first quarter, what you\u2019re thinking for the second quarter and what you\u2019re thinking for the balance of the year? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Pat, can I ask you to elaborate a little bit on the China margin comments. I mean effectively saying up at least 17%, you are staying within the high range of the prior 130 to 300 basis points improvement over 2013. So, kind of would you walk through some of the key elements, food cost inflation, labor inflation, may be what you saw on both of those in the first quarter, what you\u2019re thinking for the second quarter and what you\u2019re thinking for the balance of the year? Pat Grismer : I am very happy to do that Joe. As a reminder, I mean our Q1 margin in China improved about 7 points, more improvement in KFC than in Pizza Hut but both improved. Same-store sales contributed about 6 points of margin improvement which included about 3 points from pricing with the balance from sales mix and transaction leverage. Importantly transaction, same-store transactions grew in both brands. We also got a 3 point margin benefit from restaurant level labor productivity and our new unit development program also improved our division margin by about a 1 point. So, when you add those up that\u2019s about 10 points of margin benefit, offsetting that was about 2 points of pressure from inflation that included relatively flat commodities and about 7% inflation in labor and another margin point of pressure from Little Sheep and from rent. And so when you add those together that\u2019s how you get to about 7 points improvement in the division. Now, as I mentioned we don\u2019t want anyone to extrapolate that to the balance of the year, but based on everything we\u2019ve outlined in terms of the ongoing momentum in our sales, the continued productivity initiatives, pricing actions that may happen balance of year plus what we know about the commodity outlook. We do expect to be at, at least 17% for the full year which is about 2 points better than last year\u2019s full year results. Joseph Buckley : So, Pat, what are you expecting for commodities and waiver, I mean can you just describe here for the second quarter and then for the balance of the year? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, Pat, what are you expecting for commodities and waiver, I mean can you just describe here for the second quarter and then for the balance of the year? Pat Grismer : Yes well, we do expect commodity inflation to edge up a bit. Our full year guidance is in line with what we communicated in New York, which is low single-digits. Labor, admittedly was a little bit light on inflation in the quarter at 7%. We still expect on a full year basis to be in the low double-digit. So we expect that labor inflation will nudge up over the course of the year. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Joe. Joana next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thank you. I\u2019ve just got two questions, one on China and one on Taco Bell. For China, can you just talk a little bit more about the restage here, just the new menu in the marketing, between the higher cost of sales mix and the investment in training, first question is how many basis points, do you think this will be a headwind of margins versus what we saw on the first quarter? And also anything you can say on the sales reaction since the restage would also be helpful.  Oppenheimer & Company: Thank you. I\u2019ve just got two questions, one on China and one on Taco Bell. For China, can you just talk a little bit more about the restage here, just the new menu in the marketing, between the higher cost of sales mix and the investment in training, first question is how many basis points, do you think this will be a headwind of margins versus what we saw on the first quarter? And also anything you can say on the sales reaction since the restage would also be helpful. Steve Schmitt : So Brian, this is Steve. On the menu restage, it\u2019s too early to tell exactly with precision what the impact will be on food cost, but we do expect it to be slightly higher based on our expected mix. And from a labor standpoint, I don\u2019t think there will be a very material piece of increase in the labor line, but with any new product offering there will be labor training cost that will hit in the second quarter. David Novak : I think just from an overall marketing standpoint, we launched the new menu on the 26th. We began the national advertising on the 2nd. The overall objective is to restage KFC as even more youthful, more energetic and renovating along with the ever change that\u2019s going on in China. The fact is that we launched 15 products simultaneously, that\u2019s our first time we\u2019ve have ever done that in KFC\u2019s 27 year history and I don\u2019t think anybody in the QSR industry has done that. We basically tried to steal a page out of the successful Pizza Hut playbook where we revamped the menu twice a year, 20% of the menu twice a year. And of the 15 products, 15 of the products are either new or they are returns of popular items that we\u2019ve previously only offered like on a limited time-only basis. There are as I said in my remarks are four signature product platforms sandwiches, rice dishes, snacks, drinks and desserts. So we\u2019re obviously increasing the amount of variety that\u2019s offered at KFC. And while it\u2019s early we\u2019re pleased with the initial results. We\u2019ve had great consumer feedback on our new roasted chicken burger, our teriyaki chicken flavored rice, flavored roast wings, we got a great drink that seems to be very popular, sparkling apple juice that people really are responding very favorably to. One of the things we\u2019re trying to do this year is really take the offense and bring a lot of fun and excitement back to the KFC. Last year we were in the defensive position. And this year we\u2019re really trying to bring fun and excitement. We\u2019ve signed four very popular youthful celebrities. We got digital marketing and engagement and we\u2019ve already had 7 million likes in the past three weeks. So we feel good about that. And this is a very holistic approach that we\u2019re taking in the restage. If you walk into our restaurants today, you\u2019re going to see new team members, with new contemporary uniforms that they really like. We\u2019re rolling out new packaging. As we speak we have new menu boards. We\u2019re adding Wi-Fi and at lot of our restaurants with the ultimate goal to have all of them, over 2,000 restaurants with Wi-Fi by the end of the year. And we\u2019ve got digital mobile applications coming. So this is a holistic approach, we\u2019re really trying to drive a lot of excitement, a lot of news behind the KFC brand. And I think just the fact that you get 7 million likes from your marketing now in three weeks. This shows how big and ubiquitous this brand really is, I mean people love the brand. As you guys all know, if you follow this, we\u2019ve been ranked the number one brand in China for a number of years. And so that strength has never left us, and what we\u2019re trying to do is just leverage it even more as we go into the future. So I\u2019m very excited about KFC, the progress that we\u2019re making, and the progress that we\u2019ll continue to make. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Brian. Joana next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Another question on the China business, maybe more specifically, I think, you used the words upward momentum in the KFC business. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us maybe a directional update on what you\u2019re seeing so far in Q2 in terms of the comp for either KFC or the division? Robert W. Baird: Hi, good morning. Another question on the China business, maybe more specifically, I think, you used the words upward momentum in the KFC business. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us maybe a directional update on what you\u2019re seeing so far in Q2 in terms of the comp for either KFC or the division? David Novak : Yes David, we never really give out specific numbers as it relates to current trends. However, what we have conveyed is that we\u2019re very encouraged by not only the results we saw in Q1, but how those results have sustained into Q2 and what we see to be the early response to the compounds every stage of the KFC brand. In my view comps don\u2019t tell the whole story one of the things we look at is the absolute average -- we view seasonalized transaction volumes and what we see there are sequential improvements and it\u2019s based on Q1 results and what we observed from current trends they give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for same-store sales growth of high single to low double-digit growth. David Tarantino : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then may be another question on the margins it seems like you\u2019ve gotten a lot of encouraging productivity enhancements and I\u2019m just wondering where you are in the stage of that initiative whether you think you\u2019ve gotten all that you\u2019re going to get or if there is more on the table in terms of productivity gains? Robert W. Baird: Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then may be another question on the margins it seems like you\u2019ve gotten a lot of encouraging productivity enhancements and I\u2019m just wondering where you are in the stage of that initiative whether you think you\u2019ve gotten all that you\u2019re going to get or if there is more on the table in terms of productivity gains? David Novak : Well as I mentioned we started to initiate these productivity measures in the second quarter of last year so as we make our way into Q2 we\u2019ve began to overlap some of those. However, we also think that our momentum on some newer productivity measures towards the end of last year and also continued into this year. So we expect that productivity will be a significant contributor to our full year margin performance although we wouldn\u2019t extrapolate the gains from Q1 to the full year. But from a number of things so it\u2019s not been any one thing that has driven that result we are much sharper in the way we\u2019ve forecast sales at store level that puts us in a position to do a much better job of scheduling our labor so that we\u2019re more efficient in a way that we deliver service to our customers. And we continue to rationalize operating hours at selected restaurants in ways that ensure that we\u2019re growing profitable transactions increasing new profitable transactions all of this things really have come together to deliver what we consider to be an outstanding result and will help us achieve that at least 17% restaurant margin for the division this year. David Tarantino : Thank you. Robert W. Baird: Thank you. Pat Grismer : The only thing I\u2019d add on that is that the mindset we have in our Company is it\u2019s always the unfinished business on the productivity gains and we\u2019re going to -- we're constantly looking at every process in the ways to incrementally improvement it and hopefully make quantum lead for whatever we can. So we\u2019re organized globally around operations best practice sharing I think anything that we pick up in any market that works we share with other markets and we expect to make continued progress on this front. Steve Schmitt : Thanks David. Next question please Joana. Operator : Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Eric Larson : This is Eric Larson for Dave Palmer, just want to ask you two quick questions here. You\u2019ve got a new menu in marketing in the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut which is likely to impact the second quarter. Are you seeing an acceleration in any of these divisions lately, any numbers or additional color on how these initiatives would be pretty helpful. And then also would like to ask you about your repurchase plans and targeted leverage in the near-term? Thanks.

And then also would like to ask you about your repurchase plans and targeted leverage in the near-term? Thanks. David Novak : Well, I think on the Taco Bell point as you know we just launched breakfast we\u2019re very pleased with the initial results it\u2019s too early to really go in the details on that. At Pizza Hut we\u2019ve recently launched Garlic Parmesan Pizzas and WingStreet and we\u2019re pleased with the results that we\u2019ve had out of both those products. But I can\u2019t really give you any specifics on the actual sales trends. Pat Grismer : And then on the financial structure question with respect to the purchases consistent with what we outlined in New York we expect share repurchases to contribute about a 1 point of EPS growth so we\u2019re still on-track to do that. And then as it relates to our capital structure we\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at how we\u2019re positioned from a leverage perspective and as you know we completed a successful refinancing of about $600 million of debt in the fourth quarter of last year which we believe created significant value for our shareholders so we\u2019re happy with way things stand on a capital structure basis. This is something we continue to look at and we believe that we\u2019re in the sweet spot. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Eric. Joana next question please. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from Jeff Farmer. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Just touching on Taco Bell breakfast again in a little bit different angle here so I am just curious what you have learned about your Taco Bell breakfast customer over more of the extended test period. So are these existing customers coming into the restaurant are they increasing your frequency or again are you tracking new customers altogether and does a breakfast visit from a Taco Bell customer some of these really loyal do you see them essentially doubling down coming to the restaurant twice on some occasions how should we think about that Taco Bell customer and breakfast? Wells Fargo Securities : Just touching on Taco Bell breakfast again in a little bit different angle here so I am just curious what you have learned about your Taco Bell breakfast customer over more of the extended test period. So are these existing customers coming into the restaurant are they increasing your frequency or again are you tracking new customers altogether and does a breakfast visit from a Taco Bell customer some of these really loyal do you see them essentially doubling down coming to the restaurant twice on some occasions how should we think about that Taco Bell customer and breakfast? David Novak : Well first of all on the test markets and what we\u2019ve seen to-date the business is incremental okay so it\u2019s entering the incremental usage. Now the great thing about Taco Bell is that Taco Bell users are heavy breakfast users, I think they compose a 75% of the heavy breakfast users it\u2019s an amazing number. So just getting people converted into Taco Bell users to breakfast for a new different incremental occasion that\u2019s really our closest in opportunity, I was just in Phoenix a couple of weeks ago where we\u2019ve been in test for two years and what was startling to me was how many people didn\u2019t know we were in breakfast until we launched our new advertising. So I think what we learned in the last couple of years is we can get a profitable proposition but it\u2019s really going to challenging to break through the clutter and get people to be aware of your breakfast offerings and get them to try. We think we\u2019ve really done that with the recent advertising which is very talked about and when I was talking to customers they were saying that they\u2019ve seen the advertising and enjoyed it and they came in and tried it. And I think the good news we feel the things that were most and we learned this from test markets and also with the launch people love our products. I think we\u2019ve got, if you look at the A.M. Crunchwrap it\u2019s very portable, it\u2019s the most portable breakfast product in the category, and it\u2019s been tested up against of a like product with competition and we win with better value, the waffle taco, is similar. I mean there is nothing like a waffle taco, it\u2019s a novelty product in the sense that it is just so interesting, if you just go online people are talking about both of the A.M. Crunchwrap. And the Cinnabon Delights, I don\u2019t think you can eat just one. I mean these things are great. And we\u2019ve developed, one of the things we\u2019ve realized we needed to have in breakfast in test markets we need to have a good coffee line of products. And we\u2019ve had great coffee with flavored options which people really like. And we think that that segment will grow overtime. The good thing is, is that our franchisees are very excited about this. They are excited about in Phoenix I was in Columbia and Missouri just last week, I was meeting with our franchisees they have 17 stores, they were I think actually doubting Thomas is a breakfast. But I think they have been converted because the people really liked the products. So you have products, good value, minimum investment. Remember we were able to do this with the significant capital expenditures. So we think we\u2019re off and running, we want to emphasize that we know this is not lay down. I mean I just could talk about in fact we were in Phoenix, when I was in Phoenix and we\u2019ve been there for two years and people didn\u2019t even know until we announced we have already achieved breakeven and you are at a solid breakfast platform to go forward with, but customers didn\u2019t know about it. So we got to break major habits, I mean people have a tendency to do the same thing every day and so we got to -- it's hard to even to get our current users to give this a try. But I think the team is doing a very innovative and exciting ways from a marketing standpoint. We actually train for breakfast. We did more training for the breakfast roll out than anything was ever done from an operational standpoint. We had rallies all around the United States, the team\u2019s pumped up. We\u2019re not in it to be in breakfast, we\u2019re in to win a breakfast. And we\u2019re going to -- we have great products today that have gotten us into the game, we have a lot more products that we can go to and when we want to, that are derivatives to what we\u2019ve done plus some new products. So early days I don\u2019t want to get too excited about it, okay because we know the challenges is immense but I have always said that we can be successful if breakfast and we fully intend to be, there is no reason in the world why Taco Bell can\u2019t go from 5,000 stores to 8,000 stores in the United States. So our goal is to add that $100,000 plus concept layer that really takes already a high returning business to a whole different level and we get much more rapid new unit development. This year we\u2019ll have over 100 net new units at Taco Bell on top of I think around 80 last year. So we\u2019re picking up speed, the development pipeline is getting better and the enthusiasm is very high on this, but the proof is still in the pudding. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Jeff. Next question please Joana. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Hi, thanks. I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to ask two questions if I may. First philosophically when you look at China margins, it does look like labor hours per store was actually down in the first quarter and that\u2019s despite the higher traffic that you say at the brand, and cost of goods sold was the lowest I could find. I mean at least back 10 years maybe even more than that in the division. So, in kind of the context of having a recovery and trying to do a better job for your customer and the employee, is there any thought of reinvesting some of that margin in giving a better store level experience or does it, kind of what we saw in the first quarter in letting the store level economics really earn, is that the right thing for you guys to pursue over the next couple of years? And I ask that of course in the context of getting back to a 20% margin which I think was your long-term goal a few years ago.  JPMorgan: Hi, thanks. I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to ask two questions if I may. First philosophically when you look at China margins, it does look like labor hours per store was actually down in the first quarter and that\u2019s despite the higher traffic that you say at the brand, and cost of goods sold was the lowest I could find. I mean at least back 10 years maybe even more than that in the division. So, in kind of the context of having a recovery and trying to do a better job for your customer and the employee, is there any thought of reinvesting some of that margin in giving a better store level experience or does it, kind of what we saw in the first quarter in letting the store level economics really earn, is that the right thing for you guys to pursue over the next couple of years? And I ask that of course in the context of getting back to a 20% margin which I think was your long-term goal a few years ago. David Novak : Well we fully expect to overtime to get back to that 20% margin that\u2019s the goal. And we think we\u2019re going to get there primarily through sales leverage. As we take the sales up we think that\u2019ll be the number one beneficiary. The one thing that we believe more than anything is and we\u2019ve done this from day one in China is we will never sacrifice the customer experience for any kind of margin. That\u2019s just not going to happen. I mean we in the last four months, we\u2019ve retrained every one of our team members on our standards okay on our expectations on what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re investing in the consumer proposition and our customer majors all say that we\u2019ve been able to do it quite successfully. And the magic of this business is the magic at the end. You want to get the sales growth you want to get to margin growth. And that\u2019s what I think they are demonstrating we have the capability to do there, but make no mistake about it. The primary thing we have to do is make our customers happy. I mean we got to make our customers happy and bring them back again and again and again. One of the things we train people on John is a branded experience. And let me give you an example of that, when you -- what we\u2019re focused on is branded service in China. And this is part of the restage and I didn\u2019t talk about it, but I\u2019m glad you bring it up because it does have operational implications and we\u2019ve taken the time to train everybody on this. So when you walk into store in China everybody raises their hands. Automatically and says n\u01d0 h\u01ceo. Okay. You\u2019re welcomed as a customer. We\u2019ve learned that one of the things we want to do is we want to make our customers feel valued, so when we take the money from and give the money back to our customers we give it them with two hands. Okay. That\u2019s just a recent thing that we just added because we want to help people and we thank people for coming and just like they do at Chick-fil-A. It\u2019s been a pleasure serving you. We actually picked that up from Chick-fil-A here in the United States. We built that into our brand of service experience. So those are just two things that we\u2019re trying to do every single time so that the customer feels it, so I think the big to think about are restage is that this is a -- we look at everything we do to make it better for the customer more product variety more better uniform, better environment through the things Wi-Fi. We\u2019re also this year we\u2019ll be consistently upgrading our restaurants in a number of stores in major cities and showing designs that we\u2019ve created. So the only way you enter a long-term and the short-term obviously is you\u2019ve got to make customers happy. And we\u2019re on just a mission to do that. So I think we are investing. I know we\u2019re investing in the customer proposition. Pat Grismer : Specifically to get at your question around what was happening with cost of sales when you look at the year-over-year decline. You may recall that last year in the wake of the challenges we experienced at the end of 2012, we introduced some value offers, some discount offers in an effort to stimulate traffic. So we\u2019re laughing perhaps this year. Also as I mentioned, we took some new pricing actions at the end of 2013 after going without pricing at KFC for over a year. And we thought that we\u2019re going to do that based on the recovery that we saw in the key consumer metrics and good news is at end of the first quarter, our value scores continue to be very good and we\u2019ve maintained our pricing on the value anchors which are critical to maintaining a strong value position with consumers. John Ivankoe : And of course I\u2019m not sure you do appreciate the question, but when you look at record gross margins and declining labor hours per store you at least have to ask a question whether in fact that customer value position is going up and if you say it is, it is? JPMorgan: And of course I\u2019m not sure you do appreciate the question, but when you look at record gross margins and declining labor hours per store you at least have to ask a question whether in fact that customer value position is going up and if you say it is, it is? David Novak : I\u2019ve always appreciated your knowledge as a category, John. John Ivankoe : No. Thank you, David. And secondly, if I may -- on your KFC and thank you for the transparency it\u2019s great. I mean I\u2019d love to see it, but when you look at the Company store margins there and especially with the majority of Company stores outside of the United States, could you give -- is there is a different experience that the Company stores are seeing in KFC versus for example the franchisees and obviously you don\u2019t pay a royalty in those Company stores for KFC, so are the franchisees seeing different economics on the margin side as those franchisees grow because I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be growing many KFC stores with the margins in the low double-digits? JPMorgan: No. Thank you, David. And secondly, if I may -- on your KFC and thank you for the transparency it\u2019s great. I mean I\u2019d love to see it, but when you look at the Company store margins there and especially with the majority of Company stores outside of the United States, could you give -- is there is a different experience that the Company stores are seeing in KFC versus for example the franchisees and obviously you don\u2019t pay a royalty in those Company stores for KFC, so are the franchisees seeing different economics on the margin side as those franchisees grow because I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be growing many KFC stores with the margins in the low double-digits? Steve Schmitt : John, this is Steve the economics still remains strong and in fact the comment we actually took our international build number up and that\u2019s the number that\u2019s both for KFC and for Pizza Hut from our initial guidance. So, their economics are strong and we continue to expect strong development. I\u2019m sorry, John. Bear in mind what you\u2019re seeing is a global average, right. And there are differences in the profitability of new units and emerging versus developed markets and where more of our growth is coming from is in the emerging markets where the unit development is stronger, where the unit returns are strong. John Ivankoe : And if you\u2019ve done this before, I apologize, but can you quantify that difference of the kind of the growth markets versus the established markets? JPMorgan: And if you\u2019ve done this before, I apologize, but can you quantify that difference of the kind of the growth markets versus the established markets? Steve Schmitt : And we\u2019ve talked about paybacks before especially in some emerging markets and they\u2019re very attractive. There are very attractive returns if they weren\u2019t the franchisees would be growing. John Ivankoe : I understand. Thank you so much for the time.  JPMorgan: I understand. Thank you so much for the time. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, John. Next question please, Joana? David Novak : Remember we\u2019re going to have across the board we\u2019ll have record levels of development this year, 150 international units outside of China and that only comes if you have -- remember 90% of what we outside of China is franchise-owned. So they\u2019re only going to invest if they\u2019re going to be getting good returns. And I think the important point is that the margins that you see that there are low are primarily in the developed markets and the emerging markets we get cash-on-cash returns within two to four years. Okay. Steve Schmitt : Next question please, Joana? Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open. Keith Siegner : Well, thank you. I\u2019d like to follow-up on the KFC China restaging and I appreciate the focus on being more youthful and energetic in the 15 new products, but to ask you slightly differently, is this restaging in these new products, is this outright menu extension, is it more premium focused more value, is there any change in the main part focus any color on that and I guess Pat what I\u2019d ask you is, do you expect any mix impact from this restaging on how your same-store sales develops throughout the year? Thanks. UBS Capital Markets : Well, thank you. I\u2019d like to follow-up on the KFC China restaging and I appreciate the focus on being more youthful and energetic in the 15 new products, but to ask you slightly differently, is this restaging in these new products, is this outright menu extension, is it more premium focused more value, is there any change in the main part focus any color on that and I guess Pat what I\u2019d ask you is, do you expect any mix impact from this restaging on how your same-store sales develops throughout the year? Thanks. David Novak : I think that first of all these products are more premium in nature they\u2019re not value products, so they\u2019re high quality premium priced products. Okay. We now have I think have 66 total options at KFC compared to 59 that we had before. We removed 7 items updated 1 and we increased. And so I think we tried to optimize our menu, but the product themselves are more premium in nature and one of the things we\u2019re doing in China is we want to add entry price points, they are very value oriented and effective with lunch and dinner, okay. So, that RMB 6 breakfast, we will have some RMB 6 breakfast, we\u2019ll have some RMB 15 lunches and then so we have the entry price point but we want to obviously you want to give people, you want to trade people up as much as you can in the higher quality products and that\u2019s really what our focus is. We\u2019re really going for quality transactions. Pat Grismer : And Keith to your follow-on question regarding the impact that the new menu could have to our margin, it\u2019s early days but we expect that as we mentioned before that it will drive some or put some pressure on the food cost and labor but not to an extent that it\u2019s going to change our strong outlook for margin improvement balance of year. And in fact we expect the sales leverage coming from the promotion combined with the ongoing productivity initiatives to really dominate the margin story for the year. Keith Siegner : And Pat as far as the mix impacts are in terms of same-store sales, I mean it sounds like especially given that this is premium besides from the margin impact, it does sound like there could be positive mix benefit from this as\u2026 UBS Capital Markets : And Pat as far as the mix impacts are in terms of same-store sales, I mean it sounds like especially given that this is premium besides from the margin impact, it does sound like there could be positive mix benefit from this as\u2026 Pat Grismer : I mean from a check, average check perspective? Keith Siegner : Exactly.  UBS Capital Markets : Exactly. Pat Grismer : Yes. But as we mentioned, we maintained the strong value offer on the menu as well, so it\u2019s not, although we are moving away from value, I think it\u2019s the power of doing both. Keith Siegner : Thank you.  UBS Capital Markets : Thank you. Pat Grismer : Thanks, Keith. Steve Schmitt : Next question please Joana. Operator : And your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question about Taco Bell, I mean it looked like in the first quarter, you talk about promotional spend and franchisee incentive. Can you talk about kind of whether or not in light of the -- whether or not that was processes through the year and how successful breakfast needs to be for you to be able to hit your kind of ongoing growth algorithm, and I know you talked about $100,000 was kind of the incremental sales layer but I am just trying to figure out this year what the puts and takes there are on the margin with respect to breakfast? And then I also had a quick follow-up question, outside of Taco Bell, if I look at the margin for Pizza Hut and KFC globally recognizing that there were some one-times. I think in the past you said that there is an opportunity there when those were reported as part of YRI to get company operated margin may be a lot higher. Is that still the case? Sanford Bernstein : Thank you very much.

I think in the past you said that there is an opportunity there when those were reported as part of YRI to get company operated margin may be a lot higher. Is that still the case? Pat Grismer : Let\u2019s deal with the Taco Bell question first, Sara. With respect to our expectations around breakfast and what we\u2019re seeing today, we\u2019ve been targeting mid to high single-digit mix for breakfast that\u2019s generally what we saw in the test. And to David\u2019s point earlier that was highly incremental and that\u2019s probably what we\u2019re seeing in the early days of the launch in breakfast. How it\u2019s going to impact our margin, so that\u2019s the sales piece and so if we achieve and we maintain that mid to high single-digit mix for breakfast that\u2019s what we need to deliver our same-store sales growth targets for the year. In terms of the margin piece, the breakfast offer at that mix level is slightly dilutive to margin but only slightly. For us, this is an opportunity to establish an entirely day part that is highly incremental that as it builds overtime it\u2019s going to be overall accretive to our margins. And therefore as David pointed out earlier, will put us in the position to accelerate the pace of new unit development. Sara Senatore :   Understood. And then on Pizza Hut and KFC. Sanford Bernstein :   Understood. And then on Pizza Hut and KFC. Pat Grismer : Well I think the important thing to keep in mind is that in those businesses in the U.S. we have very low levels of Company ownership even internationally. So, franchise development dominates those two brands particularly in emerging markets, we do expect overtime to see those margins improve particularly as our Company store base is increasingly skewed to those emerging markets which offer the benefit of better restaurant level economics with lower labor and lower rent. So, overtime as we pick up the pace of development with the Company stores and emerging markets and those form a higher proportion of our total equity store base, we continue to target margins for KFC and for Pizza Hut, so it will take us into the mid-teen territory. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Sanford Bernstein : Thank you. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Sara. Next question please Joana. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jason West : Yes, thanks guys. Just on the China recovery and particularly KFC, the 11 comp in the quarter, can you talk about kind of how that looks within the two tier groups that you look at, were you are seeing similar recovery in tier 1 and 2 versus 3 to 6 and just overall thoughts on as -- it looks like your brand score is back to normal but the comps on the two year is still pretty negative. Just to -- why the big discrepancy there between the recovery and where the brand scores are? Thanks. Deutsche Bank : Yes, thanks guys. Just on the China recovery and particularly KFC, the 11 comp in the quarter, can you talk about kind of how that looks within the two tier groups that you look at, were you are seeing similar recovery in tier 1 and 2 versus 3 to 6 and just overall thoughts on as -- it looks like your brand score is back to normal but the comps on the two year is still pretty negative. Just to -- why the big discrepancy there between the recovery and where the brand scores are? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Yes certainly, Jason. On the sales side city tier, there was modest variability in KFC same-store sales growth across the city tiers with the results strongest in tier 1 cities particularly Shanghai because you will remember that\u2019s where we experienced the steepest sales declines in the first quarter of 2013. So, there was a stronger lapping benefit if you will, in tier 1 cities Shanghai in particular. So, there was modest variability there not so much on the Pizza Hut side. And then in terms of the two year comps, as I mentioned before, I don\u2019t know that the comps tell the whole story. They become difficult to read, based on the variable lap of the two and three year comps and so forth. We have looked at both. But what I really hang my head on is absolute transaction volumes on a de-seasonalized basis. And this is something that we study, from month-to-month, to really see how we are tracking with our business. And what we\u2019re seeing is continued improvement and upward momentum in that measure. That\u2019s what gives me confidence along with the consumer metrics, that the business is steadily recovering. And overall we\u2019re pleased with where we are at and the progress we\u2019re making, again not only in sales, but importantly the profitability of the sales and how they work together to deliver the bounce back in operating profit. Our goal this year is to get to that high to single to low double-digit same-store sales growth and about 40% operating profit growth in our China division. And frankly we don\u2019t need heroic same-store sales here in China that -- high single to low double-digit growth is fine. What we want to do is to do is put forward -- get our business back on the right footing, get more consumer excitement back, and we prefer to grow on solid controlled manner this year, and then build off the space. So we\u2019re basically focused on building the business, the right way for the long-term. And I think we are making continual improvement with KFC and I think we\u2019re basically on-track. Steve Schmitt : Thank you, Jason. Joana next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jake Bartlett : Hi, this is Jake Bartlett on for John. I have a quick question on COGS, and you levered it more than we would have expected with the pricing that you had in the flat inflation. Was it just lapping discounting of last year? And then on those, along that line, going forward do you expect this kind of benefiting in the quarters going forward or should we just kind of as a normal interplay between pricing in our inflation expectations? Morgan Stanley : Hi, this is Jake Bartlett on for John. I have a quick question on COGS, and you levered it more than we would have expected with the pricing that you had in the flat inflation. Was it just lapping discounting of last year? And then on those, along that line, going forward do you expect this kind of benefiting in the quarters going forward or should we just kind of as a normal interplay between pricing in our inflation expectations? Pat Grismer : Jake, in future quarters we would expect to return to a more normal pattern. So Q1 was unusual as I mentioned because we had some pretty extreme discount offers in Q1 of last year in effort to stimulate transactions that we\u2019re getting a lapping benefit and so we saw average spend grow, from that more than we would expect in a normal quarter. On top of the fact, as you mentioned, that we had the new pricing actions come into a quarter where food inflation was flat. Jake Bartlett : So it\u2019s not about an ongoing say theoretical food cost system, or some sort of productivity gains here, or just efficiency gains here your achieving at the food cost level? Morgan Stanley : So it\u2019s not about an ongoing say theoretical food cost system, or some sort of productivity gains here, or just efficiency gains here your achieving at the food cost level? Pat Grismer : No. Jake Bartlett : And then, in terms of the restage, you mentioned customer experience. Is that involving a re-image of source, can you just remind us? Morgan Stanley : And then, in terms of the restage, you mentioned customer experience. Is that involving a re-image of source, can you just remind us? Pat Grismer : Well I think we\u2019re building off a powerful image, the number one brand in China, all we\u2019re basically doing is trying to invigorate it and show and demonstrate that we\u2019re\u2026 Jake Bartlett : I meant remodels, some sort of a remodel program in China? Morgan Stanley : I meant remodels, some sort of a remodel program in China? Pat Grismer : Okay. We just we constantly remodel every 5 to 7 years; that we just have new designs that we\u2019ll be rolling out this year. Jake Bartlett : Got you. Morgan Stanley : Got you. Steve Schmitt : Thank you. Joana next question please. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good thanks guys. This is Erwin on for Jeff. Just really quickly on the China consumers, or let\u2019s say is confidence in sentiment, are you seeing any changes in the consumer willingness to dine out or maybe in their habits in anyway, I mean also on the broader industry sales versus KFC, that you still see yourself lagging, because of the supply issue or have you kind of regained the lost kind of some of the losses and kind of brought yourself more in line with the category even outperforming? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Well, certainly on a reported basis, given the strong bounce back in Q1 helped by the last year, we\u2019re outperforming the category from a quarterly growth perspective. I would say that the macro situation hasn\u2019t been changed versus last year. It continues to grow overall. And I think when you look at the fact that we had good, very solid results with our Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, that\u2019s a further indication that when you have a concept that is well-positioned and well executed, consumers are going to come. So we\u2019re delighted with the results that we\u2019re getting and as we said we see the China business to be an important one for us for the long run. And even though 7% growth in GDP is lower than it was in recent years. It remains the fastest growing a large economy in the world, and we\u2019ve got a leading position there, so we\u2019re very happy with that. Steve Schmitt : Thank you. Joana next question please. Operator :   Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open. Andy Barish : Hey guys, just wondering about the food inflation, commodity inflation uptick in the U.S. business looked noticeable obviously in Taco Bell which is predominantly domestic. Can you give us some thoughts on that, and then your pricing actions for later this year in terms of the scope of that, and was that initially anticipated or sort of a reaction to some of this commodity ramp? Jefferies: Hey guys, just wondering about the food inflation, commodity inflation uptick in the U.S. business looked noticeable obviously in Taco Bell which is predominantly domestic. Can you give us some thoughts on that, and then your pricing actions for later this year in terms of the scope of that, and was that initially anticipated or sort of a reaction to some of this commodity ramp? Pat Grismer : Well, there is no doubt that commodities have played out very differently from what we thought. In New York you\u2019ll recall, we came into the year expecting 4% inflation in meat and 4% deflation in cheese. Things could not have played out any differently as we\u2019re expecting low to mid double-digit inflation in beef, it was up high single-digit in the first quarter. And then for cheese, we\u2019re expecting now mid single-digit inflation it was up over 20% in the first quarter. So, it has played out very differently and so yes that has played into our pricing actions this year. And that we intend to do balance of year but this is one of the things where we continue to read the business in terms of how consumers are responding to our value offers and to our new product innovation and the progress we continue to make on productivity initiatives and then we determine what we need to do by way of pricing in order to maintain and improve margin so that we have a strong investible position that is going to underwrite future unit growth. So, yes, the commodity situation in the U.S. is proving to be a challenging one but we\u2019re dealing with it just as we have for the last 50 years. Steve Schmitt : Thanks, Andy. Next question please Joana. Operator : Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open. Diane Geissler : Good morning.  CLSA: Good morning. Pat Grismer : Good morning. Diane Geissler : I wanted to ask you about opportunities on re-franchising just where you stand I think there is still some opportunity on the Taco Bell side? And then when you look at the China market overall where do you see yourself basically three to five years from now in terms of do you see more franchising chance to refranchise there particularly as that market matures and you get bigger in India for instance or do you still see a company-owned operating model in China over the longer time? CLSA: I wanted to ask you about opportunities on re-franchising just where you stand I think there is still some opportunity on the Taco Bell side? And then when you look at the China market overall where do you see yourself basically three to five years from now in terms of do you see more franchising chance to refranchise there particularly as that market matures and you get bigger in India for instance or do you still see a company-owned operating model in China over the longer time? Pat Grismer : The philosophy we\u2019ve always had is to earn the right to own. And wherever we own stores we\u2019ve earned the right to own with the exceptions in some markets and countries where we own a few stores just so we can lead for test markets. But if you take a look at Taco Bell, we\u2019ve actually reduced our ownership in Taco Bell with past few years and now it\u2019s about 15% where the Taco Bell has margins that end of last year close to 20% these are clearly the shareholder benefits by some of those restaurants. So that\u2019s the mentality that we have. We look at all of our equity on a constant basis and make sure that the investing we\u2019re making in terms of running the store well exceeds our cost of capital. Steve Schmitt : And specifically to the businesses as you mentioned Diane in the Taco Bell 15% that\u2019s our target, so there isn\u2019t more refranchising opportunity that we see there and we\u2019re generally happy with the returns we\u2019re getting on those new investments and we believe it\u2019s a strong equity position for us. And as far as China is concerned, we have been doing some modest amount of refranchising for the last several years. We see that continuing so we expect that we\u2019ll continue to maintain that ownership percentage to David\u2019s point though under the banner of earning the right to own given extraordinary returns we\u2019re seeing on new unit development with our KFC and Pizza Hut and coming up now Pizza Hut home service, we think it\u2019s a great place to own and operate restaurants. It creates enormous value for our shareholders. But we see China being predominantly equity for many years to come although we\u2019re looking very aggressively at franchising as a way to accelerate even more growth as we go forward. Diane Geissler - CLSA: That\u2019s terrific. Thank you. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Diane. Next question please Joana. Operator : Your next question comes from R. J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open. R. J. Hottovy : Yes thanks. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more into the takeaway some in global brand strategic reviews. More specifically discussing KFC and your ability to take the learnings from the successful developed markets like the UK and Australia and apply them to North America. One, what type of initiatives do you have planned; and two, how do you plan to communicate those to the franchisees? Thanks.  Morningstar: Yes thanks. Just wanted to drill down a little bit more into the takeaway some in global brand strategic reviews. More specifically discussing KFC and your ability to take the learnings from the successful developed markets like the UK and Australia and apply them to North America. One, what type of initiatives do you have planned; and two, how do you plan to communicate those to the franchisees? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Well, I think what we -- when you look at the UK business and the Australia business KFC in particular you\u2019ve got two very successful businesses that are more in the portable food arena particularly with sandwiches. So we\u2019re looking at how we can take some of those learnings and develop a right sandwich platform and be effective in the United States and in that arena as well. I think we constantly share product news that travels, so any new product that is developed in Australia or the UK would move to the U.S. one of the things for example is boxed meals were successful in Australia and we\u2019ve moved them into the U.S. trying to target a $5 price point. And I think when we were organized separately the U.S. teams didn\u2019t really work as closely with the international teams as we\u2019d like and we\u2019re going to see a lot more sharing and I think adoption with those teams together now reporting in the separate or focused CEOs. Steve Schmitt : Thank, R. J. I think we have one final question, Joana. Operator : Your last question comes from Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to Taco Bell breakfast I think you\u2019d mentioned $100,000 incremental layer from the breakfast just curious in test how long did that take for the franchisees to kind of get to that breakeven level? Telsey Advisory Group : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to Taco Bell breakfast I think you\u2019d mentioned $100,000 incremental layer from the breakfast just curious in test how long did that take for the franchisees to kind of get to that breakeven level? Pat Grismer : Well as you know we\u2019ve been developing our breakfast layer for a number of years. Evolving the menu to understand what is going to resonate most with consumers and be perceived as a highly differentiated offering. So we\u2019ve made a number of changes to the menu over that period over that period of time and it\u2019s been with this most recent offering that\u2019s been an active development and test for the last call it 18 to 24 months that we\u2019ve seen the best results that have now given us the confidence to go national. And as we mentioned it was in the those tests that we achieved the mid to high single-digit mix that we needed in order to make the economics work for us and we\u2019re very pleased and encouraged by the early results we\u2019re seeing from the program which are generally in line with what we saw in test. Peter Saleh : Great, thank you very much.  Telsey Advisory Group : Great, thank you very much. Pat Grismer : Thanks Peter. David Novak : Okay let me just wrap-up. I think we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to have a strong bounce back year in 2014. And we\u2019re going to grow our earnings per share at least 20% and we look forward to reestablishing our track-record of consistently delivering double-digit EPS growth in the years ahead. As we go into the balance of the year, we have significant building blocks in place in China in each of our divisions that we think will help us have very sold year. Thank you very much. Steve Schmitt : Thanks everyone for joining the call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our third quarter earnings release will be on Tuesday, October 7. And our 2014 New York Investor and Analysts conference would be on Thursday, December 11, in Midtown Manhattan. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Novak. David Novak : Thank you, Steve. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report Yum! Brands is well on its way to delivering in full-year EPS growth of at least 20% with second-quarter EPS growth of 30% excluding special items. Just as important, I'm confident we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that will sustain double-digit EPS growth in 2015 and beyond. Looking at the quarter, we are obviously pleased with the continued progress we are making at KFC and China as evidenced by strong sales in margin growth as well as improving new unit returns. Our KFC Division which is our second largest profit contributor behind China also continues to deliver solid sales and profit. When taken together, our China and KFC Divisions comprise nearly two third of our total operating profit. So it's great to see both performing well. Another highlight is our Taco Bell breakfast platform is off to a great start and we expect to build up this momentum going forward. Now let me give you more color on each of our divisions. Let's begin with China. Our China Division delivered system sales growth of 21% in the quarter as we opened 104 new units and grew same store sales 15%. It's great to see such a strong top line growth. And fortunately this top line growth flowed through nicely to the bottom line as operating profit grew an impressive 188%. The China team deserves a lot of credit for doing an excellent job driving restaurant margins of almost 17% during the quarter and over 19% in the first half.  At KFC China, our goal is to improve our already strong economic model and make KFC which is the number one, most popular brand in China, even more youthful, contemporary and energetic. We've maintained our value anchors and still have 6 RMB breakfast offerings and 15 RMB lunch offerings but have shifted our focus from price value led growth to higher quality and more profitable transaction growth. Our primary focus going forward will be on more premium innovation, delivered with the superior customer experience.  We are confident we are on the right path to evolve KFC into an even better, higher quality and more profitable business model as we keep the brand contemporary. With the recent launch of the KFC menu revamp in our more than 4600 restaurants in over 950 cities across China, we introduced 15 new products at one time and leverage four popular celebrities to promote four signature product platforms. Our campaign clearly resonates with consumers as KFC delivered same store sales growth of 21% in the quarter. It's important to note that while our guest check has increased, our value scores have also improved. In addition to intensive product innovation, we are enhancing the customer experience with a launch of redesigned packaging, contemporary staff uniforms, new menu board, branded service and a new restaurant design which we will be rolling out over time. On the digital front, we began rolling out free Wi-Fi. We also have a new mobile app coming which will provide consumers the convenience of pre-ordering with electronic payment. And we have more exciting news coming balance of the year.  So let me sum things up for KFC China. We are confident we are presenting an even better KFC our customers will continue to appreciate, and a business model that is rapidly improving new unit return, setting us up for continued, aggressive development in the future.  Turning to Pizza Casual Dining which is arguably one of the greatest success stories in our industry the past few years. We are clearly the number one western Casual Dining chain in China with hardly any mid scale competition. And if you follow us, you know pizza Casual Dining goes well beyond pizza. As almost two thirds of our sales are non pizza items bringing our pizza and more positioning to life. During the quarter, we delivered system sales growth of 16% and opened 36 new units further strengthening our category leading position. Same store sales were flat in the quarter but keep in mind we are overlapping 7% positive same store sales in 2013, which was our strongest quarter last year. Looking ahead, we have exciting product news coming and the business is on track to deliver another solid year in 2014. Most importantly, the business model and new unit returns are firing on cylinders with two year cash paybacks. In fact, we are aggressively expanding into lower tier cities. We are now in 305 cities and expect to have over 1200 units by the end of the year. That's more than double our unit count only three years ago. And we are just getting started. Now the other exciting thing about pizza is our separate and distinct Pizza Home Service business where we deliver an all meal home replacement to Chinese customers. In fact, over 40% of the menu consists of Chinese food. We have borrowed from the innovation and know how we develop with East Dawning, our Chinese fast food concept. So not only are we delivering pizza but we are delivering a full array of Chinese menu options in a small box format that will drive aggressive expansion. We believe we have innovated our way to not only offer a pizza but Chinese food in a scalable, highly profitable fast food format. We now have over 200 units in 26 cities and we are really beginning to rapidly scale this brand across the country. So with the strong foundation in place and with enormous demand for home meal replacement in China that will only grow over time, we expect our Pizza Hut Home Service business will contribute more meaningfully in the years ahead.  Last but not least, we continue to work hard to turnaround Little Sheep which is clearly been a major disappointment and continues to be so since we acquired it in 2012. We like to take a step back and look at the big picture of China. We'll always be focused on improving our unit economics by growing average unit volumes. But what excites us the most is the largest component of our ongoing growth model in China is new unit development. And we are as confident as ever we are still on the ground floor with constant, aggressive expansion ahead. That's because in China, we now generate three year cash paybacks at KFC as we've improved the business model, and two year cash paybacks of Pizza Casual Dining. New unit returns are outstanding for these two power brands and importantly our overall returns are getting stronger as we continue to shift more of our development to pizza at Casual Dining and KFC in tier 3 through 6 cities where our unit economic returns are strongest and the consuming population is getting larger and larger. In terms of new unit potential the macro trend we remain most enthusiastic about is the large and growing consuming class which is expects to double from 300 million people in 2012 to 600 million people by 2020. And disposable incomes are growing right alongside it. In 2014, we fully expect to open at least 700 new units, and the long-term outlook is bright for KFC, Pizza Casual Dining and now Pizza at Home Service.  Moving to India. As discussed, we have made the strategic decision to invest ahead of the growth curve to develop a business that we are confident will drive substantial growth for Yum! in the years ahead. We currently have over 700 units and we are full steam ahead with this development as we expect to open another 150 new units this year. We are well on our way to a target of 2000 units by 2020. We are hopeful the new political leadership in India will create a stronger economy and more pro business environment as we invest in this country with they have well over a billion people.  Now let me shift -- now let me show you some perspective on our three brand divisions starting with KFC. Our KFC division which generates over 90% of its profit outside the United States, deliver a solid second quarter led by strong international performance. Importantly, our international new unit pipeline remained extremely robust. We expect to open at least 650 new units outside the United States this year and grow operating profit consistent with our full year guidance of more than 10%. I recently attended KFC's global marketing planning meetings in Dallas where we had nearly 30 countries represented in one room. Now during these meetings all our CMOs from around the world share their marketing calendars and plans for the coming year. There is no question we are building more know how and getting better at advertising, innovation, value and digital. Our expectation is this will result in higher same store sales growth in the years ahead. And even though we have nearly 14,000 restaurants in over 110 countries around the world with only two KFC restaurants per million people outside the United States, we still have a long runway for future growth. Our business model is powerful and our development pipeline is strong.  Now let me give you an update on pizza. We are obviously disappointed with second quarter result. In particularly with the very poor performance in U.S. business which contributes about half of pizza's divisions total profit. We now expect full year operating profit at pizza to fall well short of our initial expectations. We've had our ebbs and flows versus the competition over the years, and I can assure we will be back. In fact, we intent to launch a number of major initiatives in the United States to reignite sales beginning in the fourth quarter. Our plan is to launch a major new advertising positioning along with the innovation designed to better connect with millennials and separate us from competition. To this end, I encourage you to try our new Hershey dessert cookie. You should also know we will sharpen our focus on value and tend to leverage our more competitive offers to drive digital activations. Our goal is not only to catch the competition on the digital front but to surpass it in 2015. We know we have great brand to work with the Pizza Hut. Even with our recent challenges in the United States, pizza has the highest average unit volumes at our category in over 2800 more restaurants than our nearest U.S. competitor. Over the past two years, we've also been outgrowing the competition in terms of new unit development. In fact, we expect our fourth consecutive year of positive net new unit growth. Importantly the majority of new units will be opened by franchisee which speaks to the strength of Pizza Hut business model. All of this gives us confidences going forward and we expect to show significant progress balance of the year in 2015.  Globally we are sharing best practices to drive sales growth and we are making focused investments to accelerate our pace of new unit development especially across the delivery and express channels. We expect to open a record 450 international new units this year for Pizza Hut and expect this number to growth significantly in the years ahead.  So to sum it up, we are bullish on our long-term growth prospects at pizza. We are confident we have the right teams in place, plans and structure. We expect much better performance going forward and to make significant progress by the yearend.  Finally, at Taco Bell, obviously the big news for the brand is that on March 27, it will be day they'll go down in history as we launch our national breakfast platform. Here the facts. Our breakfast day part mix around 7% of sales in the second quarter. We fully expect breakfast to be incremental. And anywhere from $70,000 to $120,000 per unit in annualized sales. Remember, McDonald's get about a million dollar in sales before we have even open our doors in the past. This is a huge opportunity for Taco Bell. And we are already making money in breakfast even though we've added incremental labor and food cost are slightly higher. We generated tremendous buzz around our products and marketing and we actually celebrated a record breaking sales week in the quarter. And for the long term there is now question we've enhanced our brand position as the choice of the new generation. And in fact, Taco Bell is recently recognized by MPV Crest for being one of only three restaurant brands to over index with millennials along with Starbucks and Chipotle. So overall, we are extremely pleased with the breakfast launch and the direction we are heading for Taco Bell. Now the big question you probably asking is this given the success of the breakfast launch, why did same store sales increased only 2% in the quarter? Keep in mind that during the first two months of the quarter, our immediate emphasis was almost totally on breakfast. Once we returned to advertising our core business, it was with Cool Ranch Spicy Doritos Locos Tacos chicken. And frankly, this product underperformed versus our expectation. We believe that ended up being too much of a niche product to overlap the 15% growth we've had over the past few years with the introduction of Doritos Locos Tacos and then Cool Ranch, two of the most popular product introductions in the history of our entire category not just Taco Bell. Nevertheless, Taco Bell same store sales were positive 2% in the quarter. And we said all along the Taco Bell would be a first half second half story. In fact, trends have improved with the recent launch of Quesarito which proves that when you have great innovation, balance a day, coupled with a strong breakfast line, it is a powerful combination. Looking ahead, we will be introducing mobile ordering and we have significant value innovation plan in our core business to drive growth balance of the year and beyond. Our franchisees are in breakfast to win and they have been also cheering us on to broaden our breakfast offerings with new products that we already in the pipeline. All-in-all, we are pleased to have lots of innovation coming across all day past to drive growth in a very challenging environment. Today's launch of our Power Cantina menu, a line of high protein products that I love is just another example. Importantly, our ongoing product innovation is backed by solid operations and attractive unit economics which allow us to open over 100 net new units this year representing a 10 year high. We are confident; we will ultimately achieve our goal of at least 8000 Taco Bell restaurants in the United States by leveraging our asset throughout the day. We have great progress now at breakfast. We have happy hour, we have the fourth meal, and we see this as a power brand that can be leveraged throughout the day.  Now taking a step back when you look at Yum! in total, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on the three things that drive shareholder value and retail. Driving new unit development, building same store sales and doing this in a way that generates high return. In terms of development, our new unit opportunity in emerging markets remains the best in retail. We have a two to one lead over our nearest competitor in emerging market and our opportunity to expand remains enormous. We have only two restaurants per million people in emerging market compared to 58 per million people in the United States today. Clearly, this is a long runway for growth and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come. Furthermore, we have over 40,000 restaurants around the world with all kinds of ideas in hopper and clearly significant capacity to grow same store sales in average unit volumes. The fact we have under leveraged asset is a great weapon as we go into the future. Meanwhile our returns on invested capital have consistently been among the highest in industry. Over 90% of our restaurants outside of China are owned and operated by franchisees. We simply love the franchise model which will generate about $2 billion of franchise fees in 2014. These franchisees provide us with a large, reliable and growing stream of cash which combined with a profit from our equity stores and enable us to invest in high return growth opportunities and return significant cash to our shareholders. So let me wrap things up for Yum! Brands. On the whole, we are pleased with our overall second quarter and year-to-date results. We expect a strong bounce back year in China and solid full year performance in KFC. At Taco Bell, we are pleased with breakfast and confident in our balance of year plans and expect a much stronger second half. And at Pizza Hut, we expect full year operating profit to fall well below our initial expectations. We obviously have major work to do to get our pizza U.S. business on more competitive footing and we are confident that we will do so and transfer the learnings that we have around the globe. When you added all up, we expect full year EPS growth of at least 20%. Equally, important, I am confident we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that will sustain double digit EPS growth in 2015 and beyond. Now let me turn it over to Pat Grismer, our Chief Financial Officer. Pat Grismer : Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. My remarks today, I will cover three areas. Our second quarter result, our outlook for the second half of 2014 and what we are doing to drive long-term value for our shareholders. With the second quarter, our results were similar to Q1 with the very strong bounce back in China, solid growth at our KFC Division, mixed results at Taco Bell and poor performance at our Pizza Hut Division. Overall, worldwide operating profit increased 34% in constant currency and EPS grew 30% excluding special item. We've now produced two quarters of strong EPS growth and are well on our way to delivering on a commitment of at least 20% EPS growth this year. China Division profit rebound in sharply from the second quarter of 2013 which was the low point of last year and grew 188% in the quarter. Importantly, KFC same store sales improved sequentially on one and two year basis growing 21% in the quarter on the strength of a comprehensive restage of the KFC brand. And while Pizza Hut Casual Dining same store sales were flat in Q2, we are pleased that we grew system sales 16% with continued rapid development of this highly profitable concept. We are also very pleased with our continued margin improvement in China. With first half restaurant margin above 19% and with our current outlook for the second half, we are confident that China's full year restaurant margin will be at least 18% or nearly three points above 2013 and back to where we were in 2012. I am also very happy to report that China's new unit returns have strengthened considerably. As you recall from our December Investor Conference, cash paybacks at KFC in 2013 averaged a very respectable four years despite short term sales pressures. As David mentioned, with a recovery we've seen in our business this year, cash paybacks are new KFC restaurants in China are now three years. Pizza Hut Casual Dining cash paybacks in China remained very impressive two years. This is great news for our shareholders as we expect to open at least 700 new restaurants in China this year and paves the way for high return, new unit development in 2015 and beyond. As for our other divisions, KFC produced the very solid quarter with 12% profit growth in constant currency, a significant improvement over Q1. Taco Bell also improved versus Q1 but results were mixed in a challenging U.S. environment with profits declining 2% in the quarter. Taco Bell restaurant margin decreased 2.7 percentage point as we invested in our national breakfast launch and were impacted by commodity inflation of 5%. Now David mentioned, we are pleased with a national launch of breakfast and we know the business will benefit from this additional sales layer for years to come. We continue to expect much stronger results in the second half from Taco Bell. Our Pizza Hut U.S. division on the other hand is in turnaround mode. We expect results to improve balance of year but Pizza Hut Division to fall well short of our initial expectations. As CFO I can assure that we are not holding back from making strategic investments to right the ship. We are strengthening our global digital capability and investing in field level G&A to open new Pizza Hut market and accelerate our pace of new unit development. I expect our investments in international development to begin paying dividend this year with record new unit openings and to see results from our digital investments and other brand building initiatives in 2015.  Now I would like to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year. In China, we expect to achieve at least 40% operating profit growth for the full year excluding the impact of foreign exchange driven by improvements in both sales and restaurant margins. We expect restaurant margins to remain strong as we remained diligent and making our labor model more efficient at our KFC business. Margins will also continue to benefit from our move towards higher quality, more profitable transaction as well as our development shift to lower tier cities for KFC and a higher mix of Pizza Hut restaurants. Partially offsetting this, we are expecting commodity inflation of about 3% and modestly higher labor inflation that we saw in the first half of the year. So when you added all up, we are expecting full year margins of at least 18% as I said earlier or back to where we were in 2012 even with the diluted impact of Little Sheep. Sales in China continued to be difficult to predict. Our best estimate is that with the more difficult overlapped we faced in the back half of the year, and with the current trends we are seeing in our business, full year same store sales growth will likely be towards the low end of our guidance range or in a high single digit. And as always if we can do better we will. Now David mentioned, Little Sheep results continued to be disappointing and diluted overall China restaurant margin by 0.6 percentage point in the quarter. We are continuing to focus on improving this business. However, if Little Sheep's performance does not improve, we may be required to further impair the business in the back half of the year. Outside of China, we expect KFC to continue to produce solid results. As I mentioned before, we expect Taco Bell profit performance to improve significantly in the second half as pricing should offset commodity inflation, breakfast builds momentum and higher margin products like the new Quesarito drive more dollars to the bottom line. We also expect Pizza Hut results to improve from the first half as we advanced our value proposition globally and bring more product innovation and more compelling value news and digital activation to the U.S. business. Overall, we expect solid growth in the second half and are confident in delivering at least 20% full year EPS growth. And if we can do better, I assure you we will.  Now, I would like to share how we are driving long-term value for our shareholders. Yum! is reliable, cash generating machine. And this year we expect to generate over $3 billion in operating EBITDA, an all time high. This includes over $2 billion in franchise fees from our growing global and diversified royalty stream. We reinvest a substantial portion of our operating cash flow or about 40% to drive the growth our businesses. We also continue to optimize our equity portfolio by increasing the weight of high return businesses including emerging market overseas and Taco Bell in the U.S. where restaurants margins are in high teen. This has positioned us well for future earnings growth and importantly has set us up to achieve higher returns on invested capital which we expect will top 20% in 2014. Second, we pay a dividend which we have grown at double digit rate every year since we first paid a dividend over nine years ago making us one of only 11 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. Our dividend yield is currently just under 2% which is very competitive for a company with our growth profile. And third, after investing behind growth and paying a meaningful dividend, we return all available cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Each of these levers are large and growing franchise business combined with high equity, high return equity investment, a growing dividend and value creating share repurchase worked together to drive strong returns for our shareholders.  So let me wrap things up. We are pleased with our strong second quarter results which were led by outstanding performance in our China Division and solid growth at our KFC Division. Our strong start to the year coupled with our ongoing growth investments has clearly set us up to deliver on a strong bounce back year that we expected in 2014. I am confident in the strength of our business model and we will continue to make the investment necessary to sustain double digit EPS growth over the long term.  And with that, we will be very happy to take your questions. Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets : Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give a little more details on the China same store sales breakdown in terms of price, mix and traffic? Assuming mix maybe was a big contributor here, where is the mix coming from? Is this the change in occasions? Is it less promotion etcetera? And then maybe how do you see those three pieces moving in the second half to jive with the guidance that you just gave for same store sales? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Keith, very happy to do that. So we will focus on KFC where we are at 21% same store sale growth in the quarter. About half of that was driven by mix. And of that mix component the majority is attributable to the fact that we overlap a significant decline in high check family business. Now from last year, you may recall that from last year's result. Average spends however also benefited from the launch of our premium positioned menu revamp. So those two things together drove about half of that same store sales increase. Now we also had about four points to pricing which we felt good about considering that we took absolutely no pricing last year and that was more or less in line with inflation on a two year basis, and as far as we know in line with competition and then we had transaction growth that delivered another six points. I think the important thing here what I most pleased with is that despite the fact we had significant lift in average spend and we had a contribution from pricing, our value scores improved. Our value scores improved with the launch of our new menu. And they improve even with the pricing that we took. So we feel very good about the composition of our sales growth in the second quarter. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino. Your line is open. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird: Hi, good morning. Pat, I just wanted to follow up on your outlook for the same store sales in China for the year. You mentioned that your expect comps to come in towards the lower end of your prior guidance. And I was just wondering if you could add some context to that statement. Is that because of -- simply because of a comparison that you are facing in the back half of the year or are you seeing any changes in the sequential volumes that might concern you and maybe point you more conservatively relative to your prior guidance. Pat Grismer : Well, David, I think the first thing to point out is that we are confident that we are going to deliver at least 20% full year operating profit growth in China on the strength of our recovery and restaurant margin which I mentioned as the high end of our guidance range. Now as we said all along sales are difficult to predict with precision. And we know that China is a volatile market. But our best estimate today based on the currents that we see in our business is that sales, same store sales will likely be towards the lower end of our range. And it's with that combination of higher end margin and lower end sales if you will, so we get to that 40% operating profit growth that we need to deliver on our commitment of at least 20% EPS growth for the year. Now in terms of what driving the softer results in the back half of the year, you got to remember that we have adopted the strategy of pivoting towards higher quality, more profitable transaction and we feel very good about that because that yield a much healthier business model which bodes well for future development. The second piece is that is that the easiest overlap is behind us. Remember, in first half of last year sales were down 20%, same store sales were down 20% in China and in the back half same store sales were down only 7%. So yes we are lapping still in negative number but the overlap is harder in relative term. So it's combination of those things that we contribute to softer results in the second half versus the first half but again still ladder up to the 40% operating profit growth and the 20% EPS growth at least that we've committed to deliver. David Novak : As I've always said in the past, we are going to always have bumps in the road with same store sales. In June, we had a Brazilian Samba themed promotion around football that frankly didn't resonate like we had hoped. We are now moving to signature value program where we borrow from the success we had at Pizza Hut where we are offering one of our revamp products per day at a half of the price, making it-- it is only product. And this has been part of our ongoing plans. So we are just beginning to launch that program. And it's early days; we will see how it does. But one thing that we know as Pat said more moving forward is that we are driving popular transaction trends and improving our business model. And importantly when we look at where we are at today, all of our major attributes for the brand are improving. We are the preferred brand, taste is better, value for the money is better and our safety score are back to where they were 2012. So the brand is certainly bouncing back and when we look at the whole China business in total, giving at least 40% profit growth this year and having at least high single digit sales growth for the full year. We feel very good about that. And it's a great base for us to move into 2015 and beyond. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Jason West. Your line is open. Jason West - Deutsche Bank : Yes, thanks. I guess just going back to the comments around the China unit economics and that the store growth outlook. I mean I guess given what you guys are seeing today in the improving economics is it fair to say you're going to sustain this sort of 700 gross opening rate going forward? Or would you like to see that number go higher over time or do you feel like-- you would like to moderate that number? Just if you could talk a little bit about that will be helpful. Pat Grismer : Well, Jason, I can assure you we wouldn't moderate that number. We expect to deliver at least 700 new units this year that lapping the 740 from last year. We remain as bullish as ever about a long-term growth prospect in China and we feel very good about how our unit level economics have strengthened. David had said before that we did some of our very best work last year in the midst of crisis to make our business even better. And new unit, I know economics are as strong as they ever been. Even last year with the pressure that we felt on sales, we had four year cash payback of KFC, this year we are back to three years, that include tier three cities and below two and half year cash payback from KFC. Pizza Casual Dining cash payback have sustained at two years. So we feel very good about the position of our brand. We feel great about the overall returns we are seeing on this investment. And we have every reason to believe that we are going to try high levels of investment going forward, maintaining the high level of discipline and rigor around our capital investment products. David Novak : I think the other thing that we think going forward we have another weapon in our arsenal with Pizza Home Service. And this is a small pack box format where we are delivering not only pizza but also Chinese food. We think we've actually kind of back our way into Chinese fast food format with great economics coupled with the pizza that allows to get some dramatic expansions we go into future. And again this is small box so the investments costs are not that significant. The main point I would like to make on this is that we have never ever chased a number. We obviously think it will be better than 700, we want to grow that number as we go forward. We are going to stay very, very disciplined as we have in the past. What I have told Sam and the team, and this will continue to be our policy as we've got these incredible brands. They are like diamonds. We need to polish those diamonds and only grow as faster as our people capability can allow us to do it and then we can get the right location in the right places that we need to be and as we go forward. And the beautiful thing about our business in China is that the business models are great. And the business is strong. We are not any hurry. We don't have to hurry. We just need to grow this business the right way. So we will be very focused, very disciplined, look at our returns and only grow as fast as the locations are there, we have a people capability. And remember, I think this year we hired a close to 10,000 management trainees that will come into our system and three years from now will be ready to be restaurant general managers. And we are doing that in anticipation of the significant growth that we expect to have across KFC, Pizza Casual Dining and now Pizza at Home Service. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer. Your line is open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Question on Taco Bell. You mentioned Quesaritos is helping the non breakfast business. Have you been able to keep the breakfast sales stable even when you are pointing your advertising energy to non-breakfast items like Quesaritos. And in the second half we talk about specifically, should we be expecting-- David Novak : Can you speak up David, we can't hear you. David? We can't hear you. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Can you hear me okay now? David Novak : I can hear you better now. We got the first half of the question I think but you might want to repeat it so everybody can hear it. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Let me just repeat that. We talk about; you mentioned Quesaritos is helping the non-breakfast business. Have you been able to keep breakfast sales stable even when you are pointing the advertising energy to the non-breakfast items like Quesaritos? And then in the second half just specifically with the P&L for Taco Bell, are we going to see significant digital launch cost as you roll that out for that brand? Thanks. Pat Grismer : David, I will go and address the digital launch cost. We do expect to be launching that later in the year sometimes in the fourth quarter. The additional investment against that is working and our forecast for the full year and we continue to expect that Taco Bell division profit will be about in line with their ongoing growth target about 6%. So those costs are loaded into our G&A forecast for the year. David Novak : And the breakfast numbers remain relatively stable. We feel very good about the base that we have with breakfast at Taco Bell. We have more news coming and we think we have the combination of the breakfast news plus the other day part news, give us the one two combination that we have to have to really go forward. I actually -- I think breakfast is just critical to us on a number of front. First of all, we got this assets with basically has been empty until 11 o'clock and so we regaining the leverage that asset, we are also leveraging on a profitable basis. Remember, I took that thing for McDonald eight years to make money in breakfast. We are already at above breakeven. So we feel good about get $70,000 to $120,000 in sales per unit on annual basis. So this is a great vehicle for us. And I think this category is very tough. You got to have constant innovation and to be able to innovate across all the important day parts to drive the same store sales versus just the traditional lunch and dinner day part. I think it gives an opportunity to even bring more consumer news, more excitement to the Taco Bell brand as we go forward. And regardless of what we market and how we market it, if you look at what we are doing it all drives the Taco Bell brand forward. The Ronald McDonald advertising took our overall brand imagery I think up to -- some of the highest levels we've ever seen. So we were building the brand in all that we do and now we can build the brand across all the day part. So I am very enthusiastic about breakfast. I just about month ago I was out in California meeting with Taco Bell franchisees. And they are into win, they are seeing now that this is really working for them. And they all understand that what this can do for their business over the long term. So when we got into this it was like how we get in with minimum investment, minimum products, and minimum complexities. Now the franchisees are saying, hey, bring us more new products. Let's really go after this. So that's a good thing. And we have obviously there is pockets of strengths where we are doing better than other places but overall we really are doing extremely well. We have a national proposition and we are going to stay after it. This is something that we are absolutely committed to make successful as we go into future. And we think we believe very much in the one-two punch. We think we got to have breakfast and we think we got to have the day part news -- product news to drive the other day part as well. So we have the Quesaritos, we have the protein group, protein line of products that we just introduced. We've got a number of values, initiatives coming forward with product innovation to go along with it. I think we had analysts meeting where many people tried lot of the products that we had up there, we had a very inventive group at Taco Bell and we think we are going to have a lot of news. So unlike some brands that are wondering what to do next, we've got day parts to leverage and we've got all kinds of product innovation that we can keep brining into hopper. So Taco Bell, we think is in very good shape and feels very good about the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner. Your line is open. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company:  Thanks. Obviously the Pizza Hut business outside of China I guess continues to be drag on the profits. And obviously you are going to try to turn around that pizza business outside of China but I am just wondering if there is a scenario where as you are trying to do so maybe you look at possibly splitting that business off either through sale or spin. Or is that something that's not possible if you want to hold on to the China piece of pizza, if you could just talk about that and why you wouldn't maybe look at transaction like that? David Novak : Well, first and foremost we believe in the power of global brands and we believe we are very good at running global brands and we are going to be able to maximize the sales and profitability of that brand over the long term. We think our structures focus so that we can get after the opportunities that we have. And we think we are going to drive significant growth for pizza in the future. We are very bullish on pizza for the long term. Lot of what we've done this year, you really -- obviously you can't see in the numbers. But we are investing heavily and doing a globally along with digital front and also in terms of driving future development. We think we have significant opportunities in the delivery carry-out business and the express business. And we've got major new initiatives that will be implemented in the United States in terms of both the advertising positioning which we think will be global and also the innovation that we think will be global. And we believe that this will travel and we think we are going to get significant growth at our Pizza Hut in next year and beyond. So we think we are structured just fine. There are all kinds of things that you can do financially to think about reengineering the business and all kinds of scenarios have been brought up over the last 15 years. We look at everything but we are absolutely committed to our current structure, believe it's right and we think our shareholders, they are going to benefit from it over the long term. Pat Grismer : Brian, what I would add to that just to build on David's point. We look at everything through a long-term growth plan so we don't over react to short-term issues in our business. And it wasn't two years ago that pizza was on top. We have a powerful brand. We can beat the competition. Things have softened last couple of years. We've taken our learnings and we are redoubling our efforts to bring the business back next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore. Your line is open. Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein : Just a follow-up on China, if I may. The margins keep beating to the upside I think versus the investors' or Street expectations. Can you talk a little bit about why that is? Is it your costs like commodities and labor inflation are coming in lower than expected? I recognize that you got a lot of leverage and you have more profitable transactions from the menu revamp. But if you can just talk about that in the sense of the outlook for costs. And a related question is Pizza Hut is such a good business in China, the unit economics are still very good. Is the slower comp just the difficult compare? Is there something in the environment? Could it possibly be related to the acceleration in unit growth? Thank you. Pat Grismer : Sara, I will take the question on China margin. We are absolutely delighted with the progress that we are making -- we are continuing make with the six point improvement in margin versus prior year in the second quarter. You are right that the menu revamp helped from a mix perspective as we pivot towards those more profitable, higher quality transactions. With respect to how things are trending and what gets us to the higher end of the range. You are also right that the inflation outlook has tampered. So where as at the beginning of the year we were expecting big higher inflation on food cost or closer to around 1% for the year and labor inflation is at the lower end of our range. We had guided low double digit. So it's going to be pretty close to 10%. So those things together bolster our confidence that we are going to get to at least 80% margin for China Division for this year. David Novak : I think regarding Pizza Hut and Casual Dining, in China obviously our same store sales were flat, is softer than what would have liked but we were overlapping 7% same store sales growth in 2013 which was the highest of that year. Our system sales growth is 16% in the second quarter. And our business model and returns are firing on cylinders. So we got two year cash paybacks on new units, we will have 20% plus margin for the full year. And remember we've grown our average unit volumes 30% in the past three years and we are doing this with basically no mid scale competition out there today or on the immediate horizon anyway. And we are expanding breakfast in more, more cities. We've now breakfast in 229 stores which is about 20% of our units. So we have a pretty amazing growth story and we are bullish as ever about the future growth prospect for Pizza Casual Dining. I think as we go forward we think we have the big story for pizza is to rapid new unit development that we have with two units -- two year returns. And with average unit volumes so they are already generating by themselves today 20% plus full year margins. Operator : Your next question comes from line of John Ivankoe. Your line is open. John Ivankoe - JPMorgan: Hi, great, thank you. Actually a follow-up on that question. It sounds like maybe in the second half for KFC that same store traffic might be pretty close to flat given what your menu mix is. And from what I understand, pricing that was taken in the fourth quarter and maybe some more pricing that was taken in the second quarter. So, maybe elaborate on that. And if I may, it is unusual to see a company focus on margins in a recovery - allow lower traffic growth. In other words, you're not necessarily trying to gain back the traffic that you lost in the previous year. So David you're obviously very experienced just in terms of what you've seen over your career. May be an example of previous success where you can focus on a higher margin customer and almost willingly allow some of your lower-margin or maybe more price-sensitive customers drop out of the brand as you focus on overall profitability. David Novak : Well, John, I think first of all I don't think we are focused on margin. I think what we have been focused on is rebuilding the brand. And making the brand more contemporary for a changing China. And so I think the things that we are most excited about is that with revamp that we have, the comprehensive program we put it in terms of service, uniforms, where we headed with digital all the stuff, is where contemporary since the brand were changing in China. And the research measures basically are all moving in the right direction. So we are building the brand. We got preferred brand, taste, value for the money, safety is back where it was in 2012, all the measures that you want to see going up are going up. So I think first and foremost what Sam and team have been focused on is rebuilding the brand and rebuilding the brand the right way. We look back couple of years ago in 2012 I guess it was, at 2011 we had 20% transaction growth which kind of blew everybody away. And that came primarily from value driven transactions which are good. But they are not necessarily sustainable from a profit perspective in terms of really driving our business model for the long term. So what we've done now is we still have 6 RMB launches and breakfast in 15 RMB lunch items. But we shifted our marketing focus to more focusing on the premium one which we think is more in line with where consumers are going today. And as a result of that we are getting significant same store sales growth. Some traffic growth, but we get the much better business models as we go forward that we can build from. And we really like that as we think about where we are headed. So I don't think that we are just margin driven. I think we are very focused on building the brand and doing so in a manner that will strengthened our business model, that give us a best possible unit economics going forward, it will allow us to open up as many as restaurants as we can. Pat Grismer : And I will just add on that to say we are not going to comment on what we expect transaction growth to be in the back half of the year but building what I have said earlier, we do expect that comps in the second half, one is strong as they were in the first half in the part because we are lagging more challenging numbers. Also there is no reason to believe and you suggested that the pricing we've taken this year is putting pressure on pricing because of the --we mentioned value scores have improved with the brand we launch and with the pricing and we feel that the pricing we've taken is entirely in line with inflation and not ahead of competitors. David Novak : I think that's a big point. We are improving the overall brand dynamics from preferred brand to value for the money scores, both are going up. And we've been very, very mindful of the pricing. When I think about building the brand from margin perspective I -- there is a very brands that I think have been that successful okay in terms of like getting their -- by taking price and not taking price smart way and all that. So you asked me, historically, what have I learned? I mean if you price without being aware of where you stand with your brand and what your brand is capable of doing, you go down a very slippery slope. But we have priced and reorganized our menu and restructured our menu and innovated around our menu to improve the brand dynamics and that's all the feedback we are getting from the customers telling us. They think the best time to take price is before you have big news. So we did in Chinese New Year for example. We did just before Chinese New Year. And then we also did it just before we did the revamp. And so I think the big point I am making is we are not building this brand from a margin perspective. We are building this brand from a brand perspective and we are doing it in a way that happens to get us better margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass. Your line is open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley :  Thanks. Pat, can you maybe just frame what your base case is for Pizza Hut this year? Your profits declined 15% to 20% in the first half. Is it very possible or likely you'll see the same kind of decline at least in the current quarter or the third quarter? And maybe help us more than - maybe just put some numbers or framework around how we should think about the full year. Pat Grismer : John, I am not providing any more specific guidance on full year performance out of the detailed division only to indicate that the results will be below our expectations this year, well below our expectations and we had guided that the results would be below the ongoing growth model that we had established for the division and I really don't care to provide anything more specific than that at the stage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley. Your line is open. Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch :  Hi, thank you. Two questions, I'll throw them both out. Again on the higher quality more profitable sales in KFC China, is there risk that you are going to confuse the consumer? In 2012, you hit value hard; so hard that on that great comp number, your margins got killed. And now in recovery mode, I'm not sure exactly how you're repositioning it higher -- if it's meal combinations or different offerings or what it is. But it sounds pretty different. And if you could elaborate on that, I'd appreciate it. And then just on Pizza Hut, the Pizza Hut international business was pretty weak also. Could you talk a little bit about that? And we're used to seeing Pizza Hut have a tough year, a good year, alternating. And this looks like two tough years in a row. And, again, if you could comment on more on the international piece, I'd appreciate it. David Novak : First of all on KFC. I don't think we are confusing the customers whatsoever. I mean I think the brand is just being presented in a new improved way. We still have value offerings. It is not like we are advertising on television, gee; there is no value at KFC today. We still have the 6 RMB breakfast, we still have the 15 RMB lunches. We are introducing news around new products and new advertising with celebrities. And I think people -- every brand measure is moving up and there is no -- we are not getting anything from customers that says they are confused. So I would say to answer that is no problem. Pat Grismer : And what I would say as well we all know from our experience the great brand follow the customer and give the customer what the customer wants. And consumers in China are ecstatic. Their expectations are increasing. They are becoming even more so sophisticated and this is what they want. We are giving them what they want. That's what they are telling us. David Novak : But I think consumers want great value which we have, best in the category. And getting basis what the number-- best of we've had. They want great taste which is we know is proven -- our measures are high and we are the preferred brand. So I think KFC is absolutely fine. I think Pizza Hut globally -- the division itself is underperforming and I have already detailed all the things that we are doing to get the business turned around and we expect much stronger year next year. We have a very good brand, the best brand we think in the category. And we've underperformed versus competition. And we think we will make significant progress next year. Pat Grismer : And it also reminds you that we expect record level development globally with pizza brand and the vast majority of that will be done by franchisees. Franchisees will not be investing behind the concept unless they believe we have a powerful economic model backed by a great brand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital :  Great, thank you, good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. One, just on that topic of the value versus the premium. Just maybe you can give some color in terms of where the brand stands in terms of sales value versus premium. We often get that color in the U.S. but just - you talked about two years ago, the big value push versus today. Any kind of color in terms of how you mix value versus premium? And separately just the Taco Bell, just to clarify what you said earlier, I guess it's running still mid-single-digit breakfast. I think you had said longer-term you were pushing for high single digit. I'm just wondering how you gauge whether or not it's cannibalizing the lunch and dinner. It seems like the advertising dollars got shifted. But now as it shifts back, how do you get a good read that the consumer is now coming for breakfast and therefore not coming for lunch or dinner? Thanks. Pat Grismer : I'll address the Taco Bell question first, Jeffrey. And we look at a several different ways. But as we read the net list that we are getting in our breakfast day part which we define as sales before at 11 AM, we compare that to what we are getting before we nationally advertised and launched breakfast, we are seeing about five point lift which relative to the mix reinforces for us -- this is a highly incremental layer for us. We also look at the performance of the stores and this is a vast majority starts which offer breakfast versus -- today a small group, but [than] less meaningful group that doesn't offer breakfast and we see a dramatic difference in same store sales growth. Those data points reinforce our belief that what we are seeing here is a highly incremental layer. And we also believe that we have a good read on what drove the relatively soft performance balance of day as we talked about before with the media shift and the underperforming promotions. David Novak : I think in terms of the percent of the KFC menu, it\u2019s value driven, I think it is probably 10%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  Good morning. Just coming back to margins a little bit but from a different tack. So with what you guys have been able to achieve with KFC China in terms of driving margin efficiencies, you've been very good at detailing this in terms of sales forecasting, labor scheduling, reduced operating hours, things like that. I'm just curious what the opportunity is for you to pull some of those same levers as you look at some of these larger developed markets in the KFC division. So I recognize that those are 90%-plus franchise markets, but it just seems to me that there's a healthy opportunity at least on the operational side, to share some of those best practices with some of your bigger franchise groups out there. Pat Grismer : Absolutely, Jeff. We are not pleased with the overall margins we are seeing for our KFC global brand division. Bear in mind working in that number would be -- some of our businesses in more developed market which are in the low end of the spectrum as it relates to margin performance. And then we have some businesses and they are in virgin market which benefit from relatively low labor and rent costs. That's not to say that we don't have an opportunity to deliver better results for both emerging and developed markets. And we are moving aggressively to share learnings around, how we can optimize food cost, optimize labor cost as you say, capitalize on the outstanding know how we have in China given the impressive results they have delivered. And make sure that we are leveraging that to achieve similar gains in our KFC global business. We also continue to look at opportunities we have to optimize our equity portfolio, earn-the-right to own philosophy and where we have equity businesses that are underperforming then we make those adjustments in order to optimize result for our shareholders. So really through a series of tactics leveraging know how we have in our organization and the good strong discipline we have around margin management. We are keen to improve those margins because we know there is an opportunity in our KFC global business. Helpful, Jeff? Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  I'm sorry. Real quick, if I could add just one more quick question just on the P&L. So any type of high-level, absolute dollar interest expense number you can roughly guide us to for 2014 as we think about that relative to 2013? Pat Grismer : I think we guide to about $10 million reduction because of refinancing we did last year, Jeff. Operator : Last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy. Your line is open. R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar:  Thanks. Just a quick question about innovation on a broader level. I know you've been running a few fast-casual tests in the U.S., and just wanted to see broadly what is your plan for some of these smaller concepts? I know it's not a meaningful part of the business. But as you see longer-term -- you just testing for learning or just kind of - just probably get a sense of the fast-casual concepts start to pop up a little bit here and there, West Coast and Texas, just what the thoughts are behind those. Thanks. David Novak : We are testing some fast casual concepts primarily innovation labs where we can really learn more about what customers think about some of these products, some of these products we expect them coming to our base business or derivatives of them. If we have some learning that suggest that we have a bigger idea I guess we might start to think about a bigger. But it is more of a real focus on learning, more about the fast casual segment and using as incubator for what can go into the base business. So, we have got a Mexican concept, it has been opened up on the West Coast. We've got chicken small box format being tested in Dallas. And so we are looking at that. And we are also looking small box derivatives are offered to our base brand to give us more opportunities as well which we think probably is the biggest idea of all. Pat Grismer : Thanks. R. J., just a modification response in the interest expense. So that should be similar to last year. So I think David that's our last question. David Novak :  Well, thank you very much for being on the call. Let me summarize. We expect to have at least 20% EPS growth this year and will be better if we can obviously. The key points that I would like to leave you with is we are back on track with China with the better business model and better brand dynamics. We have three year payback with KFC, two year at Pizza and we are continuing to make significant progress with Pizza at Home Service. Number two, Taco Bell is successfully establishing breakfast. We believe that what we are doing at Taco Bell, how we are building the brand, the one-two combination of breakfast plus the innovation we have coming is going to continue to improve our unit economics and help us take Taco Bell from 5000 stores to 8000 stores. Our franchisees are in the breakfast program and in to it to win. Number three, KFC global is getting better and better around the world. And we expect continued success there. Pizza Hut next is major turnaround mode but we expect to go on to the 2015 very strong and benefit from the fact that we will be overlapping not so high this year and last but not least, one of our big engines at Yum! is new unit development. And we will have over 2000 new units opened in 2014. So we are very confident. We will get back to our ongoing growth model of delivering at least 10% earning per share growth on a sustainable basis. So thank you very much. Appreciate you being on the call. Operator :  This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And our fourth quarter earnings release will be on Wednesday, February 4. With this, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Novak. David Novak :  Okay. Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Despite the recent supplier incident in China which has impacted China sales and reduced our full year EPS outlook, I am absolutely confident in Yum! Brands' ability to deliver strong, sustainable growth in the years ahead. And here is what, we fully expect China to fully recover. KFC Global is having a strong year and building momentum. Taco Bell has successfully and profitably introduced breakfast and is now expanding in the United States with new unit growth. And Pizza Hut Global should have a strong 2015 led by an expected US turnaround, which is in its early stages. For the third quarter, earning per share increased 3% excluding special items. We clearly had unexpected negative sales in China and continued soft performance at our Pizza Hut Division. On the positive side, we delivered solid results at our KFC and Taco Bell Divisions, and have the benefit of overlapping a higher tax rate in the prior year. Importantly, our China sales are on the path to recovery and we expect a strong bounce back in 2015.  Now while it is clearly yesterday's newspaper, let me remind everyone that through the first half of the year, we are well on our way delivering on our objective of at least 20% full year EPS growth excluding special items. First half EPS growth of 27% was driven by particularly strong results in China, where system sales were 19% and we delivered restaurant margins of nearly 20%. However, our strong first half results have been offset by an unexpected and highly publicized food supplier incident in China, which significantly impacted sales at both KFC and Pizza Hut. As a result, we are now estimating full year EPS growth of 6% to 10% prior to special items.  Now I am sure you have a lot of questions about China. So let me get right to it. First here is what happened. On July 20, an undercover investigation was televised in China depicting alleged illegal actions by employees of Chinese food service supplier, Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI, which is a large and global food service supplier to many in the restaurant industry. To be clear, OSI was not a major supplier to Yum!, and represented only a small percentage of our sales at KFC and Pizza Hut in China. However, given our size and category leading positions in China, our sales were disproportionately impacted because we were mentioned with the same media weight as our major competitor, who was a large customer of OSI in China.  Also the fact that this followed the December, 2012, poultry incident at KFC clearly didn't help. Upon learning of the televised report, we terminated our relationship with OSI not only in China, but globally. We also began taking unprecedented measures to further strengthen our supply chain practices in China to prevent and identify fraudulent and deceptive behavior by suppliers going forward. For example, we are now requiring standards for suppliers in China to install closed-circuit televisions and implementation is underway. We are also establishing a whistleblower system to encourage suppliers' employees to report any potential food safety violations.  Unfortunately, no matter how many controls we have in place, it's extremely difficult to prevent a company from deceiving us if they resort to illegal activities. Nevertheless, we will learn from this incident and are committed to developing even better quality assurance processes as we move ahead.  Let me be clear, we expect all of our suppliers to follow the law and we are absolutely appalled with the alleged outrageous behavior of OSI. In fact, their actions are under investigation by the Chinese government, six employees have been arrested, and OSI has publicly admitted to wrong doing. We are waiting the final outcome of this government investigation, and I assure you we will pursue every legal recourse available to recover damages from this incident.  While we are doing everything we can to turn the situation around, what we need most right now is to get to time. As we've said before, experience tells us it take six to nine months to fully recover from this type of events, and this will most likely be the case with this situation as well. But make no mistake, KFC and Pizza are beloved brands in China and around the globe, and are proven to be absolutely resilient. We have complete confidence in a full sales recovery and expect our bounce back to be strong.  Now this is the quarter when we typically share some perspective on the upcoming year. So as we look towards 2015, China is obviously the key variable. I am sure you can imagine it's difficult to predict the exact shape of our bounce back in sales at this stage of the recovery process. However, sales are on the path to recovery and we expect a strong bounce back in 2015. Equally important, we firmly believe we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that would drive strong, sustainable growth in 2015 and beyond. Let me give you a little color on each of our divisions starting with China. As I said, obviously we have a short-term issue and we are weathering the storm. While primarily staying the course with our marketing plans, we supplemented this with the short quality assurance advertisement in August and communicated our action plan via social network.  Our consumer trust scores clearly dropped but our research indicates that we are on our way to rebuilding trust. At KFC China, we have over 4,600 restaurants in nearly 1,000 cities across the country, which is more than twice our nearest competitor. Going forward, we are continuing the roll out of our new restaurant design and introducing new digital technologies to contemporize the customer experience. Additionally, we expect to build up the most successful learnings of our KFC menu revamp and we are launching new group of products in the first half of 2015. Our goal is to present even better KFC our customers will appreciate and restore the stronger business model we had in the first half of the year. Even with our short-term sales issues, we still have the underlying economics that gives us confidence to keep investing in aggressive new unit expansion. Turning to Pizza Casual Dining, which is by far in a way the number one restaurant casual dining chain in China, and it has no major competitor. Pizza Hut continues to lead with menu innovation and everyday affordable value. In fact, 20% of Pizza Hut's menu is revamped twice a year with the most recent update occurring on September 29. We are also continuing to leverage our assets by expanding our breakfast offering into more and more cities. With this new sales layer, our long-term goal is to create and own a mid scale casual dining breakfast occasion in China on a scale that matches what exists in the United States today. This is a huge opportunity and we are well positioned to capture it.  Today, we have nearly 1,200 restaurants in over 300 cities in China for Pizza Hut. We have a powerful economic model that generates fantastic new unit returns. So with strong underlying economics even in a temporary downturn, we continue to accelerate our new unit development of Pizza Casual Dining and plan to open over 250 units this year, further strengthening our category leading position. In fact, no other major casual dining chain in the world that we are aware of is growing units at such a rapid pace. Pizza Casual Dining is clearly a power brand with a great future.  Taking a step back, let me put KFC and Pizza brands in China into perspective. Basically today at KFC, we have restaurant margins of about 15% on depressed average unit volumes of $1.4 million. While these unit economics are strong, this compares to restaurant margins of 20% in average unit volumes of $1.7 million in 2011. There is no question in our minds; KFC will eventually get back to these sales and margin levels. Remember, McDonald's has average unit volumes of $2.5 million in the United States. We firmly believe we are still early on in our journey to leverage our asset base in KFC in China. Looking at Pizza Casual Dining, our average unit volumes have dipped slightly below $1.6 million, and we have restaurant margins of about 19%. This compares to average unit volumes of over $1.6 million and restaurant margins in excess of 20% just last year. Again, with breakfast, late night, continued innovation, a strong economic model and accelerating new unit development, we fully expect to get back to previous sales levels and more in the years ahead.  In addition to our opportunity to grow same -store sales and margin, the biggest opportunity we have in China is to penetrate the country with new stores. Yum! Currently has five restaurants per million people in China with a consuming class is expected to grow from 300 million people in 2012 to over 600 million people by 2020. This compares to or about 60 restaurants per million people in the United States where the consuming class is about 300 million people today. We continue to believe we'll openly have well over 20,000 restaurants across all of our concepts in China.  So in 2014, our new unit development target of at least 700 new unit stores remains unchanged. This means we will open over 1,400 new units in a two year period and we expect another strong year of development in 2015. All of which will provide substantial momentum for China Division as sales continue to recover.  Now let me share some perspective on our three global brands divisions starting with KFC. Our KFC Division which is our second largest profit contributor behind China continues to deliver solid sales and profit growth led by strong international performance. Importantly, our international new unit pipeline remains extremely robust. We expect to open at least 650 new KFC units outside of United States this year, and grow operating profit in this division consist with our full year guidance of more than 10%.  As you may know, we have nearly 40,000 restaurants in over a 110 countries around the world, 91% of which are franchised. We are especially pleased with our continue strength in emerging market led by high growth countries such as South Africa and Russia. Looking ahead, our new unit opportunities in emerging market are arguably the best in retail. With about two KFC restaurants per million people in emerging market, we know we have a long runway for growth.  Moving to our more developed KFC market, we have very solid businesses in Australia and UK and we are also pleased with the progress we are making in the United States. KFC is in strong shape and well positioned for 2015. At Pizza Hut, while we are disappointing with the full year operating profit and it will fall well short of our initial expectations, we are pleased with the progress we are making and expect us to continue in to next year. We sharpened our focus on value in the United States and have leveraged more competitive offers to drive digital activations. And consumers are responding. In fact, sales turned positive during the last few months of the quarter and our digital mix is now over 40% on our delivery in carryout business which represents more than five percentage point increase over second quarter. Our system is now fully aligned around competing more effectively and winning into digital and social world. You will see more evidence of this going forward. Looking ahead, we expect to build up this momentum with a launch of further initiatives to drive same-store sales growth beginning in the fourth quarter. Our plan is to launch new advertising positioning, design to better connect with millennials. We've recently had good success with our Hershey's dessert cookie and bacon and cheese stuffed crust pizza. We plan to reinforce Pizza Hut's leadership, quality, innovation and superior value as we continue to implement a comprehensive turnaround plan.  Globally, we are sharing best practices to drive sales growth and we are making focus to investments to accelerate our pace of new unit development, especially across the delivery and express channel. We expect to open a record 450 new international units this year for Pizza Hut and are counting on this number to grow significantly in the years ahead.  Turning to Taco Bell. We are definitely well positioned to deliver on our expectation for a strong second half. During the quarter, we delivered same store sales growth of 3%, clearly outpacing the QSR category. Importantly, breakfast sales are sustaining with the 6% day part mix without the benefit of high launched level media weight. I would go so far as to say we are one of the very few companies in the history of the QSR industry to launch breakfast successfully and profitably in year one. Not only our breakfast sales largely incremental, but we are making money and sustaining it with margins of nearly 21% in the quarter. Without question, we now have a great platform to grow from. Remember, McDonald's breakfast day part is 25%. So this gives us an opportunity to grow on that day part for many years ahead. Going forward, we will introduce mobile ordering and payments in the fourth quarter and we have significant innovation plan in our core business to drive growth, balance of the year and beyond. With strong unit level of economics at Taco Bell, we are seeing an acceleration of development with over 100 net new units this year which represents a 10 year high. And we have even better development pipeline headed into 2015. We are confident we will ultimately achieve our goal of at least 8,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the United States.  Finally, we are investing for the long-term and develop the great brands in India which will drive substantial future growth for Yum! KFC will be bigger in units than McDonald by the end of the year, Pizza Hut sales of deliver unit economies are getting stronger and more competitive with Dominos. And at Taco Bell, early results are encouraging with plans for accelerating the pace of development.  Now to sum things up, in spite of our short-term issue in China, the fundamentals of Yum!'s growth model remains extremely compelling. As you know, there are three keys to driving shareholder value in retail. New unit development, same store sales growth and generating high returns. In terms of development, our new unit opportunity in emerging markets including China remains the best in retail and our opportunity to expand is huge. We have three iconic brands and while we have about 60 restaurants per million people in the United States today, we only have two restaurants per million people in the Top 10 emerging markets including China and India. This is a long runway for international growth and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come. We also see significant opportunity to grow units at Taco Bell in the United States and make it a truly global brand.  Furthermore, we have over 40,000 restaurants around the world that have significant capacity to grow. And as I said, we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that would drive same- store sales growth in 2015 and beyond. Remember, in China, average unit volumes are well below where they were two years ago, and we expect to get back to these levels in more over time. We are making KFC even more contemporary, have huge upside at breakfast delivery and late night and are building off of our best operations in the world.  At Pizza Casual Dining in China, we will continue to grow the core with constant innovation while we grow the breakfast and late night day part. At our KFC Division, we are sharing know how and getting better at advertising, innovation, value day part expansion mention and digital, which we expect will result in higher sales growth in the years ahead. We are particularly pleased with our progress in breakfast in Asia. The initial results of expanding our happy afternoon hour, through our learnings from Taco Bell, and the beginning of the US turnaround at KFC. At Taco Bell, our breakfast day part is now established and already profitable. What's more, our dollar cravings menu is resonating, product and digital pipeline is full and ready for 2015. And finally at Pizza Hut, we are making significant progress on the digital front and have a comprehensive turnaround plan now in place at our US business that we will expand globally. Additionally, we will be overlapping 2014 results which will give us the short-term boost in 2015. Meanwhile, our returns on invested capital are consistently been among the best in the retail industry. Over 90% of our restaurant outside of China are owned and operated by franchisees. We love the franchise model which will generate about $2 billion in franchisees in 2014. These franchisees provide us with a large, reliable and growing stream of cash, which combined with the profit from equity stores, enables us to invest in high return growth opportunities and return significant cash to our shareholders. So let me wrap things up for Yum! brands. At our three global divisions, KFC continues to be delivering solid results, we are making solid progress at Pizza Hut and we are pleased Taco Bell is delivering on our expectations for a much stronger second half. We had an unexpected issue in China, but we fully expect to be on the path to a full sales recovery and continued aggressive growth in the years ahead. Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO. Pat Grismer : Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover three areas. Our third quarter result; our revised outlook for the full year and our capital allocation philosophy. For the third quarter, I'll highlight some key aspects of financial performance to add further dimension to our reported results. Starting with China. David outlined why our same -store sales declined 14% in the quarter. So I'll explain how this impacted our restaurant margin which came in at 14.9% or 4.6 percentage point below prior year. First, same-stores transaction declined 17% which not only significantly de-leveraged our fixed cost but also made it difficult for our teams to manage restaurant level expenses, leading to inefficiencies in food and labor. Combined these issues to over negative margin impact of about six percentage point. Rollover pricing actions provided approximately four points of margin benefit but half of this offset by 10% labor inflation. Restaurant margins were also negatively affected by inventory write- off related to the disposable of OSI products. Collectively, these items account for the roughly five point margin decline for the quarter.  Clearly, had it not been for the de-leverage and inefficiencies triggered by the OSI incident, we would have reported restaurant margins of over 20% for the quarter. We are confident that as we rebuild sales in China, margins will rebound as well. One of the thing I would like to point out about China's third quarter results, we continue to shift our new unit development program to a higher return investments. For example, year-to-date to Q3, 67% of KFC China development was in Tier 3 through six cities compared to 53% in 2012. Similarly, 36% of total China development with Pizza Hut Casual Dining compared to 23% in 2012. Over time this evolution of our development program will enhance portfolio margins and returns.  Now moving to our Global KFC Division which posted its best quarter of the year with solid improvements in sales, margins and profit. System sales throughout was especially strong in emerging market, up 12% led by Russia, Thailand and Africa. International developed market also delivered solid system sales growth, up 6% led by the UK, Continental Europe and Australia. Profits grew an impressive 14% before the impact of foreign exchange, excluding a two point benefit from the overlap of franchise convention expenses. This compares to 8% profit growth in the first half of the year and demonstrates the strong momentum that we see in this business across both emerging and developed markets including our KFC US business which delivered 2% same-store sales growth in the quarter.  Our Global Pizza Hut Division also posted its best quarter of the year, although still well below our ongoing expectations. While total same-store sales declined 1%, our US business which represents more than half the division's profit, actually turned same-store sales positive in the second half of the quarter. Despite this improving trend, operating profits declined 6% excluding a four point benefit from the overlap of franchise convention expenses. We are obviously not happy with these results. However, comparing this to the 17% profit decline we recorded for the first half of the year, it's clear that many of the turnaround efforts launched earlier this year including the digital initiatives which David mentioned, are beginning to have impact and are providing upward momentum in advance of a new brand advertising campaign in the US.  And finally for Taco Bell. Again, their best quarter of the year. We've long said that Taco Bell in 2014 would be a first half, second half story from a profit, growth perspective. And the division's third quarter result certainly bares this out. Profits grew 14% compared to a 9% decline in the first half of the year. Importantly, restaurant margins swung from a 2.6 percentage point decline in the first of the year to 1.8 percentage point gain in the third quarter as targeted pricing actions and restaurants cost savings more than offset food inflation, which is unexpectedly escalated significantly over the past several months.  Additionally, we are on pace to open nearly 200 new stores this year. Our strongest rate of development in more than a decade. Over 80% of these new restaurants will be franchised demonstrating the brand's attractive unit economics.  The last financial highlight, I would like to draw your attention too is tax. Since the second quarter of 2010, we've disclosed in our SEC filings a dispute with the IRS regarding the valuation of intangible assets. I am pleased to report that we've resolved this matter in the third quarter. In conjunction with this, we made an initial cash payment to the IRS of $120 million, which was effectively fully reserved. Remaining cash payments due under the terms of our agreement are also fully reserved. In the aggregate, these additional payments are expected to be less than the amount we paid in Q3. Including adjustments related to this settlement, our third quarter effective tax rate was nearly 11 point lower than prior year as we lapped an incremental tax reserves that we recorded in 2013. We are pleased to put this matter behind us. I would now like to shift gears and talk about our full year outlook. In China, sales remained difficult to call, however, based on current trends and expected recovery period of six to nine months, and the knowledge that this recoveries are rarely linear, we expect same-store sales to be negative for the fourth quarter. This is obviously disappointing, but I can assure that the team is working very hard to restore consumer trust, accelerate the sales recovery and rebuild margins responsibly. Importantly, we are continuing to build new restaurants and expect to open 700 new stores this year. Although, the current sales declines have dampened our new unit returns, these returns on average still exceed our internal hurdle rates. And because we expect sales will full recover, we are confident that our restaurant expansion program is not only extending our competitive lead, but is also creating shareholder value over the long term. Keep in mind; KFC and Pizza Hut are the leading brands in China with enviable competitive advantages. No other retailer has the scale, the development expertise, the advertising clout, the supply chain infrastructure or the people capability that we do in China. We believe that with the benefit of long-term macro tailwinds, the restaurant category in China will grow significantly over the long run and we are better positioned than anyone else to capitalize on this opportunity. Outside of China, third quarter results at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are indicative of the momentum that we expect will deliver on our promise of second half results that are substantially better than what we delivered in the first half of the year. Trends are clearly moving in the right direction. Now when you added all up and include our updated 2014 tax rate of approximately 25% to 26%, we estimate full year EPS growth to be between 6% and 10% versus prior year excluding special items. As you would expect, the single greatest variable in this equation in China sale, which I said earlier, remain very difficult to predict. This recovery, combined with the fact that the OSI incident occurred in the middle of our peak summer seasons, figures very heavily in our full year results. We will provide an update on our 2014 outlook as well as 2015 at our Annual Investor meeting in December.  Now, I would like to discuss our capital allocation philosophy. Our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Year-to-date, we've generated EBITDA of over $2 billion versus $1.9 billion in the same period last year. And importantly, we remained disciplined in how we use this cash. We concentrate our investments in high growth, high return businesses. And we re-franchise when we believe the franchise model creates more shareholder value. We have a good track record of doing this and this will continue. In fact, we've begun to re-franchise a portion of our equity position in Western Europe, where margins and returns have lagged our expectations. Additionally, as KFC restaurants in higher tier cities in China trend toward lower margin, we expect the franchise mix of these restaurants to increase gradually over time. We also have a good track record of returning all available cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. For example, over the last five years, we've repurchased 57 million shares representing 12% reduction in outstanding shares. And I am sure you read our recent announcement of 11% dividend increase. This marks the 10th consecutive year we increased our dividend at a double digit rate, one of only 12 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. With this latest increase, we also raised our dividend payout target to 40% to 45% of annual net income before special items. Our resulting dividend yield of about 2% compares very favorably to other companies with the similar growth profile.  So when you consider the growth opportunity we have with our brand and the cash we return to our investors, we believe our company is set up to provide a compelling total shareholder return over the long run. So let me wrap things up. We are urgently working to overcome the temporary, negative impact that the China supplier publicity has had on our business. We are confident that we will bounce back in China and regain the momentum we saw in the first half of 2014. This combined with the momentum we are building outside of China, positioned us for an impressive 2015. Most importantly, we believe our double digit growth model will endure for many years to come. And with that I'll hand things back over to David. David Novak :  Okay. Thanks, Pat. We are reading to take questions but before I do, I want to point out that this will be my last earnings call as CEO, and the Greg Creed will be the CEO beginning January 1, which time I will assume my new role as Yum!'s Executive Chairman of the Board. We've been working on seamless transition together and I couldn't be more pleased to have a leader of great stature taking the helm. I have worked with Greg for over 17 years, he lives and drives our culture, he knows all aspects of the business call, he has worked on every brand, and he has been Yum!'s chief operating officer in the past, he has a great brand builder and what he has done at Taco Bell, I think has been absolutely sensational. The Board and I are absolutely convinced that he is just the guy to take the company to the next level. Greg will join me and take a lead at our December Investor Conference in New York. And with that, we are happy to take any questions that you may have. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird: Hi, good morning. And first David, congratulations on your great run as CEO of Yum!, and good luck with your transition upcoming. My first question is really related to the China trends. And I know you mentioned the trends are starting to stabilize or improve there. I am just wondering if you could give a little bit more context on how deep some of the same-store sales declines were initially and perhaps what you are seeing more recently? And then related to that, what level of decline are you embedding in your fourth quarter outlook? Pat Grismer : Hi, David. I am certainly not going to provide specific numbers around what happened in any given month, but happy to speak to overall trends. Now first let me remind you, we had a very strong first half of the year where same-store sales were up 12%, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our brands. So even as we've been impacted here in the last quarter, we expect our brands to bounce back strongly. We remained very confident that we will see a recovery in what we estimated a six to nine months period because we saw in the month of September that sales were substantially better than they were in the month of August which was the month immediately following the publicity incident. So we are clearly recovering. We are also seeing consumer scores improving and that further reinforces our belief in this recovery. But remember, we are in the very early stages of this recovery cycle, so it's appropriate to be a bit more conscious at this stage when we are guiding sales. And we also know from our past experience that these recoveries are rarely linear. The other thing I\u2019d point out is that China's hardest same-store sales overlap this year is in the fourth quarter. So when you add all of those things together, our best estimate today, again based on current trends that we see in the business, is the same-store sales will be negative over the fourth quarter which as a reminder spans the months of September through December. But make no mistake, we expect sales to continue to improve across the quarter and again history tells us that our brands are resilient and we will be prepared to provide more color and context on this at our Investor Conference in December. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird: Great, thank you. And then maybe second and relatedly, is there any more color that you could share on what actions you are taking to restore trust with consumers? I know you mentioned the quality assurance campaign that you ran, but is there anything that you can share about what you are doing currently or planning to do for the rest of the quarter to restore the trends there? David Novak : I think David, we basically have announced all of our action plans to continue to make our supply chain even stronger, and unprecedented things that we are doing to work with our suppliers. That's all been publicized. We had a quality assurance advertising campaign that was very brief, just lucky for now that we are clearly addressing the issue and that our food is safe to eat, which it absolutely is and has been and always has been. So that's what we've done. Right now, we are in the midst of just running our basic marketing programs that we've had. We are currently doing promotions around our rice based products, rice and chicken based products, and we are basically waiting for the business to come back. Like I said, the biggest thing we need is to give the time and that's exactly what we are doing as we are aggressively marketing the brand and hoping that time takes its course and which we are very confident the business will come back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Hi, thanks, and I will add my congratulations, David, I think by my calculation, you probably suffered our questions for 70 conference calls non stop. So I will lob in one more. Can you compare the rate of improvement in China sales this incident versus the prior? I think last time you lost some family business over concerns. So are consumers responding differently? Is there different kind of product mix? And also can you just map out the rate of improvement versus the prior incident in December of 2012? Pat Grismer : John, as you know, two crises are ever the same. However, as we step back and look at how sales and consumers scores are trended in the two months or so since the incident, I would say that the trend is broadly in line with what we saw the last time, but again we are relatively early in the stage of this recovery and we continue to believe that we will see a full recovery in a six to nine months timeframe. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Okay and then Pat, you had indicated sort of the breakdown of margins which was helpful. What in your mind was truly one time and maybe didn't do the math quick enough. You talked about some inventory or food waste. Can you just talk about what you thought was really discrete to the third quarter and what was just sales de-levering? And in the past you have been very good about moderating labor. Have you been even better and faster this incidence? Are you able to correct going forward at a more rapid clip correct labor scheduling to benefit margins going forward? Pat Grismer : Well, John, I would clearly characterize the extreme sales de-leverage as a one time event and this is not something that we would expect would happen regularly. And the impact to our business was quite severe just given how sharp and sudden the transaction decline was. And our teams did the best they could to respond to that situation. You know you never want to pull out labor too quickly because you don't know how consumer traffic is going to trend. And we want to make sure that the consumers who are coming to our brands are having a very good experience. Yes, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there were some inventory write-off that were quite substantial that translated into over half point of drag in our margins for the period just related to the product from OSI. So again I think that it was the transaction de-leverage that clearly was the big driver. And I would characterize that as a one time event. Again, have it not been for all the effects we saw of the OSI incident to our margins; we would have posted a margin and quarter of over 20%. And I think that's the better indication of how we are thinking about our business model longer term and what we are striving to get back as quickly as possible. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital. Your line is open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Good morning. And congrats, David. Two real general investor concerns that we hear about and it might be too broad to comment today, maybe let say for the December Analyst day. And the first is that KFC and Pizza Hut brands in China are somehow impaired due to the result of multiple incidents happening. Are you seeing lower lows and some of these scores in a way that implies to you that these brands are getting hit harder and deeper with each of these incidents? And second, there is a concern that your some thread that connects these incidents, even though they don't seemed linked, maybe it's the fact the press is more active or there is an underline distrust at the food supply chain broadly in China but this implies that Yum! China has a higher risk of sales shocks going forward as well. Could you comment on those two concerns? David Novak : I think the first one the research trends that we see are basically similar, so we haven't seen anything move one way or the other return. In terms of the impact in the future-- I can only tell you that we monitor and respond to social media 24x7 and we actually responded quickly this last time around and the sentiment turned positive a lot faster this time around. We really can't predict future. I would never be one to say that we could never have any incident like this again. And but I can tell you we get stronger from everything that we had-- ever happens like this we get lot stronger and stronger from -- we improve our processes that are already strong. Everything we can do to learn from and get better. We are really confident that the China is going to be a continue growth vehicle for us. We got 300 million people today going to 600 million people by 2020. This consuming class is going to grow, our brand are clearly the leading brands in China. Even as we take short-term sales process, our margins are still very good. We have very good business model as we go forward. I think what we've proven over time is that we are resilient enough and strong enough to weather storms like this. Now, hopefully we won't have another incident like this for a long time to come. Believe me, we are doing everything we can to make sure that-- sure that we don't. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Great, thank you very much. David, congratulations. I've got two for you. One, just specific to the China unit growth, you talk about this year being another year of that 700 plus. Just wondering whether anything that has happened over the past few months or perhaps the past couple of years leads you to change that view and we should think something materially different as we look to 2015, whether it is by brand or by tier or whether we are full speed ahead in terms of 700 plus for the next few years? And then the other question is just in your prepared remarks you talked about China and being obviously a very high growth company operated business model. The rest of the world needless to say is more franchise and slower growth. Are there any updated thoughts on whether you would ever consider separating the China business? It just seems like you are running two different tracks and they might be greater appreciation for people who would like to invest in one or the other but rather not both. Thanks. David Novak : We believe in our business model, it has served us well in the past, we think it's going to service well in the future. We think what we have right now is not a structural issue. We think we have a short term brand issue that we have to deal with. And our challenge is to -- in China is basically to recover and grow. That's 100% of our focus and a lot and I guess I have to rephrase it. I guess like 1000% of the focus that we have. The single biggest thing we can do for our shareholders right now is to put every inch of muscle, fiber, whatever you want to call it and turn this business around and get it back where we really know it's capable. And that's our focus. One thing I would tell every shareholder is that we always have a right to own philosophy. You have to earn the right to own. 90% of our business outside of China is franchise which I think you point out very well. China is primarily our equity business is where we put our capital end. And that's because we have great returns on invested capital and we've had cash on cash returns in three to five years. We expect that to be the same as we go forward. We think that will serve our shareholders very well. And we have that earn to right to own mentality and that's going to guide our thinking our structure as we go ahead. Pat Grismer : And Jeffrey to respond your first question around the pace of development. We have no reason at this stage to back off our commitment to continue to aggressive development. We will however continue to evolve our development program to pivot towards the higher margin, higher return opportunities as we have done for the last couple of years, increasing the weight of KFC new units in lower tier cities and increasing the weight of Pizza Casual Dining restaurant which again offers superior economics. But we remain bullish on the long-term growth opportunity in China. And we believe that we have the very solid business model that is currently under short-term pressure but it is going to bounce back and bounce back strongly. And provide the returns necessary to sustain the high rate of development. David Novak : Greg and I are heading towards China in a couple of weeks. We are going to have the annual operating plan. We are going to hear what the team has to say. We have a very focused new unit tracking systems, where we look at returns and monitor returns on a quarterly basis and see other doing versus our internal rates of returns or CapEx requirements. We will sit down, we will have very, very discussion on that, with the shareholders remind that we have nothing to believe other than the fact that we continue our strong rate of development basis on what we know today. And I don't anticipate any new revelations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open. Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets : Thanks and in addition to you David, please pass the congratulations on to Greg and look forward to giving him some hard questions going forward. David Novak : He is capable handler. Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets : I can't imagine how frustrating this has been especially post restaging the KFC brand earlier this year. But you talked about staying the course, hunkering down, sticking to the basic motions. Just wondering, can you talk a little bit about that decision weighing that approach versus say going and buying back some traffic, getting people back in, reminding them how good the experience is. How do you think about those two approaches? If you could give us some color there that would be great. Thanks. David Novak : Well, first of all, we are working on marketing right now that really gets to exactly what you are talking about. Reminding people of the role that KFC plays in their life, the good time spent you had in the past, the good time you can have today and that we are contemporary and we are on the money in terms of what you are looking for in China as China ever change, so the marketing direction that we are taking I think is very similar to what you're suggesting that we do. When you look at value, value is a very important component of the basic quick service restaurant industry. We've got very good entry pricing today. We will have promotions as we go forward that will entice trial back into the business. We will -- we will be looking for massive retrial of the brands over time. And right now for example we are offering free drinks at KFC. So whether that's put into the right context now to get everybody in the country to come back tomorrow, I am not going to say that. But we are offering free drinks with a soup or rice from --rice purchases at this stage. So I think we are pretty aligned with the fact that retrial and getting last year's backend is clearly the goal and that's what we will be talking about at the KFC team. Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets : Thanks, David. Pat, can I sneak in one real quickly? Just in terms of the margins to follow-up a little bit, are you seeing any major changes, like where is COGS inflation, how do we think about that? Also it is rare to see occupancy dollars down in that China business year-over-year. Was there anything one time that hit that line item as well? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Nothing one time on the occupancy line but also in that category however would be rent large portion something, vast majority of our leases have variable component. So if sales come down and so do rent and so that was account for decline in absolute level of rent expense which fall for the occupancy other line. With respect to COGS sales, that's an area that's going to put a bit pressure on margins in the fourth quarter because we had three straight quarters now flat commodity cost in China, and we are expecting fourth quarter to show 3% food cost inflation. David Novak : Thank you. Just one more point to that. Keep in mind that our advertising is also flat percentage of sales, so as sales come down that line will also be reduced. So thanks Keith. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Joe Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch : I wish you the best. A question on the China sales cadence again. I realize you expect improvement sequentially but because this incident was a second half incident I'm imagining the first half, second half performance in China was like dramatically different. So maybe to put it in some perspective, do you think the fourth quarter will be down less than the 14% full quarter decline in the third quarter? Pat Grismer : Again, Joe, given we are at in the recovery process, we are not going to be any more precise and how we guide same-store sales. We do expect an improving trend consistent with our past experience. And we anticipate full recovery within a six to nine months period. And it just isn't appropriate I think at this stage to be any more specific or precise than that. David Novak : We will know more Joe in December. Joe, we don't know, we don't know. And we will know more in December and we will update you in December with all the color that we have to provide you on that. Joe Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch : Can I switch gears for a moment and ask one on Taco Bell. The 3% comp I think you mentioned a couple of points of price and a 6% breakfast mix. So doesn't that add up to the lunch dinner business being down pretty significantly at Taco Bell? Pat Grismer : Well, there is no doubt that other day part are under pressure, consistent with what we are observing across the entire QSR category in the US. We feel very good about how the breakfast layer has added incremental sales to our business and has helped us to deliver same-store sales growth in the tough environment. David Novak : I think the big thing is our margins were 21% when we launch breakfast. To me we are in different where these sales count. The great thing for us next year 4% or 5%, I don't care if they come from breakfast, late night, lunch, dinner, whatever. I don't care where they come from. We just need them. And what we have now as we have a lot more muscle in the KFC, in the Taco Bell box to go out and get those sales. I love the fact that we got 6% mix of breakfast and our margins are 21% and we know that McDonald has 25% of their business from breakfast. And it killed me for years driving by all those McDonald's that are full and before we even open up our doors. So I think this is like just taking our awareness and taking our usage of breakfast up over time is like the biggest new product we could ever introduce to grow the base business. And that the trade-off, the margin trade-off between lunch and dinner aren't that significant for us. So we are able to leverage the box and that's the name of the game. And when we talk to our franchises, one of the reasons why we really believe so much in breakfast as we thought this was essential for us so we would have more growth options as we go forward in the future. So I think it's just early days if you look at breakfast. Everybody thinks Taco Bell has a great late night business. Fourth meal, our Sunday, Monday, Tuesday breakfast is higher than our late night business. So we got -- we are building a pretty damn good business that's only getting better as we go forward. I am glad, Joe, that we have it in our arsenal. Now, we also launch a dollar craving menu which is being very well received. We launched that recently which we really pulls our value story. The thing about this is that these dollar cravings products are actually products that people crave, and they are really good value for a dollar. And so we think that's going to be a good one. And the other thing that we feel good about with Taco Bell, we are breaking new ground with mobile and digital and our social work is I think best practice not only our industry but for any consumer good as we go forward. So there is a lot of good news. I think the best barometer about breakfast is our franchisees are saying, stay on it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thank you. So I actually wanted to ask about the China growth story as well which is opening 700 new units but actually the net growth looks a lot lower than that. So I guess the two questions are one is, ultimately I think that is what we care about when we are trying to figure out revenue growth is kind of net unit growth. And then also, is there any kind of mix shift going on there and is that what might have shown up in your occupancy cost, more closures in Tier 1 and 2 higher costs markets? And then I will have a follow-up. Thanks. Pat Grismer : Okay. Thank you, Sara. First on the net units. Yes, we are concerned about net units. So it's not just a matter of gross but also looking at the closures. In fact, in closures there was a bigger story which was that disproportionate share of those closure were Little Sheep unit. So not reflection of the overall strength of our business model and the development opportunity with KFC and Pizza Hut. Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, great. And then the follow-up was you said that you responded more quickly as time sentiment turned around more quickly on the China scandal and yet still expecting kind of the same six- to nine-month recovery period. So could you just talk a little bit about that? I know in the past, David, has said accurately that really time is your best friend but just this idea that you learned a lot from last time, you handled it potentially better this time and yet the cadence of the recovery is pretty much the same. David Novak :  Well, I think that what we've learned is that no matter how much we love our brands and we do, I mean we love our brands beyond belief in our company, we have learned instead consumers have lots of options. They do not have to use us every single day and they can figure out when they want to come back. And what we've learned over time it really doesn't matter even almost a big, the issue there if there is a highly publicized event, it takes six to nine months to recover. Just because consumers are cautious when it comes to food intake. And I want to point out nobody was ill because of this, nobody-- no real tangible personal issue that took place because of this other than the fact that we were tainted by this. And it takes time and it was highly publicized and this one was really tough to take, okay. Because this was here we are going the safety behavior that we -- there is no process in the world I think it could overcome. And the fact of the matter is when I watched that CCTV event and I saw the coverage, you had McDonald's, Pizza Hut and KFC, mentioned in absolute equal amount and I would say it would be hard to argue that we might not --we thought they are more mentioned, okay. And it was like when I saw that I said oh, here comes six to nine months a problem that I was not at all surprised by this, okay. So I think that's just what we have learned. We have always said that with our business, we have a great business model. We have great brands, that we have the single biggest risk we have in our business is when we have any publicity around food safety issues. And now that's exacerbated with social media. We are getting better at responding to social media, but it's still out there. So if one of those issues that we are just going to have to deal with and hopefully we won't have future event. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Amod Gautam - JPMorgan: Hi, thanks, it's Amod Gautam filling in and on behalf of John as well, congrats, David. The question was on productivity, could you remind us of when the productivity initiatives were put into place at KFC in China? And then secondly, where does that fall in terms of the priorities of the China team, where do they tell you they are in terms of margin initiatives whether food, waste or labor scheduling? Is there still an opportunity there? Pat Grismer : You may recall last year we started to see significant productivity gains in the third quarter. So and the third quarter of this year we lapped those productivity gain and actually we added to them a bit. So the team remains very focused on sustaining those initiatives to drive higher levels of labor productivity. It remains a priority for them to continue to drive margins back to a level that they were couple of years ago. So even as we look to recover some sales pressure that team is not taking their eye off of the continued opportunity to drive high rates of labor efficiency. As a step going forward as we introduced newer technologies back of house that will provide next leg of opportunity on labor productivity. Amod Gautam - JPMorgan: And if I could just add, how soon might that happen, the back of house technologies? Pat Grismer : Probably in the next couple of years, next month. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open. R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar : Thanks. I had a question about the reach of the food suppliers' publicity in China. More specifically were there any noticeable differences in the same store sales results and the higher tier cities versus the lower tier cities and does the shift you have gone to over the last couple of quarters more towards lower tier cities helping the overall recovery and what I mean over the next couple of quarters? Pat Grismer : We didn't see any meaningful differences in same-store sales performance or they impacted the publicity across city tiers for either brand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited : Good morning. I wanted to ask about your point, David, about the competitor set. So obviously you were mentioned, Pizza Hut, KFC, McDonald's, local brands were sort of swept up into this OSI issue as well. Can you just talk about your dialogue with the consumer, what you are seeing maybe in terms of your market share? Did they trade out into local brands; did they trade away from fast food in general? Just any color around your brand versus the competitive set would be very helpful. Thank you. David Novak : Okay. We have not been able to do a source of business study, okay that where we can really crack where people are going. So maybe the China team will have more color on that and we meet with them in the next couple of weeks. Be happy to share that with you when we have it. Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited :  Okay, great, thank you. David Novak : Okay. I want to thank everyone for being on the call. There is no absolutely no question that we have a taken a tough blow but we performed well in adverse situation in the past and I am absolutely confident we will fully recover in China. And we will deliver strong sustainable growth in years ahead. As I hope we conveyed on the call, we are very confident about the future and Yum! is definitely well positioned to deliver on the three things we know drives shareholder value. The new unit growth, the same-store sales growth and the high returns which we are ever mindful of all three of these key dimensions of our business. I want to thank all of you for the nice congratulation. It has been a great joy and a great honor to be the CEO of this company. And I am really excited for our company to have Greg take the helm in January. And I look forward to working with him to help us continue to build -- we will be hopefully believes it is one of the best global companies in the world. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. I'm pleased that you could all join on my first earnings call and I'm honored to share with you the opportunities ahead Yum! as well a review of our results. Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at the Investor Day in December. Our goal is to continue to build free global iconic brand that people trust and champion. I believe that's critical to delivering sustained growth and I'll share some views during my comments about 2015.  But before I do, I'd like to comment on our 2014 results. As you saw in our release last evening, we grew full year EPS 4% in 2014, despite a 29% decline in the fourth quarter. These results were heavily skewed by the challenges handled in our biggest division, as we suffered two highly publicized supplier incidents in two consecutive years in China. However, we continue to believe this setback is temporary as evidenced by the bounce back we delivered in the first half of 2014 following the first supplier incident. As prudent of our convictions, we continue to invest what our belief is. We are building 700 new units in China this year because we absolutely believe that market offers strong unit economics and return on investment. Based on our expected recovery in China and the positive momentum across the rest of Yum!, we expect EPS growth of at least 10% in 2015.  As outlined at our Investor Conference in New York, this will be a first half second half story with EPS growth negative in the first half of the year then turning strongly positive in the back half of the year. I'd like to reiterate that we are firmly committed to restoring our track record of at least 10% EPS growth and consistently achieving our division targets. So how are we going to do this? Well today I'd first like to update you on what's happening in China since we last met in December. I will then discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our business and after that Pat will walk you through the financials. First China, following the successful menu revamp in 2014, China operating profit increased 116% in the first half of the year and Yum! EPS grew 27%. We were convinced that 2014 would be a year of at least 20% EPS growth. The Shanghai Husi supplier incident changed all of that. We know KFC and Pizza Hut are beloved brands in China with a huge advantage not just in scale but also innovation, quality and people capability, despite the recovery of KFC is not occurring at the pace we expected. The good news is that our consumer perception scores have shown continued improvement. Metrics at KFC including food safety scores and reliable brand scores have improved every month since their August lows. From what we can tell, the biggest setback to this recovery is that we incurred two supplier incidents in such a short timeframe. So what are we doing to address this? We've learnt from other setback that we must innovate our layout and that's what we're doing. We have two menu revamps scheduled this year one in the first half and one in the second half. This proves successful in the first half of 2014 and we'll leverage the success this year. And of course we'll continue to offer compelling value. We've also started our initial rollout of premium coffee in Shanghai KFC stores in December. The initial results are encouraging and firstly ground copy has contributed probably to our breakfast and afternoon data. We expect this to add an incremental sales way that we can grow. By the end of February we have copy in more than a thousand of app stores and by the end of the year we anticipated we should have copy rolled out into over 2000 stores. This is a significant achievement and stepping a different way we'll have premium copy in more stores by the end of the year then Starbucks had total stores in China in 2014. I want to assure you it's my top priority and all hands are on deck to get the China business back on track as soon as possible. Prior to our investor meeting in December Joey Wat, our KFC China President spent several days in Irvine working with the Taco Bell team to learn more about Taco Bell innovation process mobile app and digital customer engagement. Jolly has taken those learning and is looking to improve KFC China in these areas.  This is just one example of have we share now have and best practices from teams around the world as we address the set back with a sense of urgency. Now let's step back and look at where we are KFC China averaging volumes in 2014 where 1.35 million or 20% off at peak levels but despite these margins held at 15%. These fundamentals demonstrate we can still open stores with confidence offering attractive returns for our shareholders. We know still have work to do to regain our customers trust but once we do the opportunity are tremendous. Just recovering average unit volumes to 2012 levels to KFC will result in $1.7 billion incremental revenue and that doesn\u2019t even include the new units we\u2019re building. Pizza Hut Casual Dining is recovering more quickly the brand was not as severely impacted by the supplier event as KFC. Many consumer metrics are back to process where they were in the second quarter of 2014. And we introduced this to the fact of Pizza Hut has only been impacted by one supply instrument not two by no means are we out the woods but we are trending in the right direction. And we are continuing to build the brand by expanding style layers like breakfast in late night. I want to assure you that we remain committed to new unit development and plan to open 700 new units in China in 2015 which builds under 737 we open in 2014. In addition to the massive new unit opportunities have been KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining, we continue to expand Pizza Hut Home Service as well. We have a tremendous sales leverage opportunity in China as sales recover and we fully expect to realize this overtime. There\u2019s a $600 million profit opportunity by simply returning our existing assets to the volumes we had in 2012. And I have great confidence in Sam Su, our Vice Chairman and China division CEO and his ability to get the China business back on track and capture this enormous upside.  Now for the other two thirds of our business. First KFC, our KFC business model is incredibly strong I love the combination of being the emerging market leader being franchise led and having allotments like double digit operating growth well into the future. We expect to open 700 new international units in 2015 after a record year in 2014 of 666 new units. We're clearly entering the year with same stores sales momentum as comps grew 4% in our last quarter. We saw continued excellent system sales right in Russia of nearly 40% and double digit growth in Africa and Thailand all in constant currency. The new use to KFC is our U.S businesses performing much better. U.S same stores sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter and the division is poised with best year in sometime. All of this sets the KFC division after a strong 2015 Micky Pant our KFC CEO is there is lot of credit leading this incredible brand and with this brand positioning is always original I am confident the best is yet to come.  Now to Pizza Hut, we opened a record 465 new international units in 2014 and expect to improve on this number in 2015. Our focused brand structure is clearly paying dividends with Pizza Hut development. However, Pizza Hut\u2019s more than a new unit story as you all know Pizza Hut launch his new menu in the U.S driven by the flavor of new brand positioning in December. I would be remits if I didn\u2019t tell you sales were softer than we expected with our initial launch and I absolutely believe our product in brand positioning arrive but we struggle to get our communications balance to build the new brand positioning while still connecting with our core-customer. However, this is a long term strategic initiative, we are excited by the fact that the people who have tried it, love it. Repurchase in temp is greater than 90%. Look this is just a first innings we are working to drive more customer trial as a rapid pricing campaign evolved to drive self through shopper product and crossing office. And impressively, we've seen operational pick up from the new menu. I know new Pizza Hut CEO David Gibbs and his team our focus on getting the advertising and crossing right to ensure that their brand building efforts pay huge dividends. We also enhanced the Pizza Hut mobile app back in late November. Before the fourth quarter over 40% of delivering in carry out orders we're by digital. Over 50% of all digital orders are occurring through the app and mobile devices and digital sales grew 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  Just this pass through Sunday, we saw over $10 million worth of peaks of app digital devices. Mocking the single biggest digital day in Pizza Hut's history believe me we absolutely understand importance of digital to complete acceptably in the Pizza category and are making significant investment in these area of the business. There is no doubt in my mind that the Flavor of Now is instrumental to building a more relevant consumer proposition for Pizza Hut. We've a long runway ahead of us and we are making the necessary decisions to drive future return both domestically and globally. And finally, the Taco Bell. Taco Bell continues to fire on all cylinders. The breakfast launch last spring of the success and we continue to record strong margins. Breakfast was again 6% of the day part mix in the fourth quarter and we expect to further grow the layer with additional product innovation. I believe a lot of the momentum witnessed at Taco Bell is attributable towards inside driven brand positioning, product development, advertising and social engagement with core users. We are applying this to the other two brands and across the globe. And vice-versa, all ideas don\u2019t have to come from the U.S. or from Taco Bell. For example, we're taking a page from the success of our open-kitchen Taco Bell restaurant in Bangalore, India and I plan to open a similar restaurant in the U.S. in 2015. This sharing of ideas globally is especially important as we work to spread good ideas worldwide and across brand to make the brave decisions necessary to lead this food revolution. Our mobile app launch is also a solid start of Taco Bell. We've seen 2 million downloads so far. We expect 2015 to be another solid year as we focus on furthering our breakfast offerings, generating more innovation across all dayparts and optimizing our presence with next gen footprint. I'm thrilled to have Brian Niccol leading this brand and taking it to the next level Live Mas positioning. The opportunity that lies ahead of Taco Bell is really unmatched as we start to expand internationally and who better to take the brand global than Yum! We have the infrastructure, supply chain, franchise relationships, fixed brand, this brand's domestic success on a global scale. As I see it, we are just in the early days of taking this brand to a new level.  So in conclusion, we have an incredible growth opportunity ahead of us. Without a doubt, we are disappointed about the results out of China but we are addressing issue head-on and I believe the upside from this business is tremendous. Yum! is in a unique position. We have three iconic brands and I think we have an opportunity to make each of these brands stronger. My vision as CEO is to build three global iconic brands that people trust and champion. In order to do that, we have identified each brand's true known positioning that is a clear, compelling and relevant guidepost. As you saw at our New York Analyst Meeting each of the brand leaders is using these brand positioning and underlying principles to drive results through brands that are more relevant, more engaged, more connected and ultimately more caring. I believe this will overly translate to consistent results that will reward our shareholders. And for now it gives me much please to hand over to Pat to take you to thorough details on the financials. Over to you. Pat Grismer : Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas. Our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2015 and our ownership strategy. For the fourth quarter EPS excluding special items declined 29%. Reported EPS was negative, primarily due to a non-cash special item charge of $361 million related to further impairment of Little Sheep assets in China which I'll cover in a minute. I'll start with a broader discussion of our China business and then move into our other divisions. As we outlined at our December Investor Meeting, same store sales KFC China are recovering at a slower pace than we initially expected and declined 18% for the fourth quarter which for China division includes the last four months of the year. Same store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining were more in line with our original estimates and declined 9% for the fourth quarter. These sales declines weighed heavily on restaurant profitability particularly as the fourth quarter is the seasonal low point China's fiscal year yielding a restaurant margin of 7.1% for the quarter. In addition to significant sales deleverage, we were also impacted by food inflation of 3% and labor inflation of 9% which combined had a negative 3% point impact to restaurant margin. While we're not pleased with these results, we expect the combination of sales improvement, modest pricing and responsible cost management to dramatically improve our China division's profitability as the year progresses with a particularly strong second half.  Given our long-term positive outlook for China and our continued belief that the current sales issues are temporary, we opened 737 new restaurants in the world's fastest growing economy. We also continued our disciplined approach to development shifting our new unit program towards high return investments. As evidence of this, Pizza Hut Casual Dining still delivering 18% restaurant margin in a year when same store sales declined 5% comprised nearly 40% of our new unit openings in 2014.  Now before moving to our other divisions, I want to provide some color on the impairment charge that we took in the quarter related to Little Sheep. Due to sustained same store sales declines, significant store closures and the evolution toward a more franchise led business we determined that it was appropriate to further write-down our investment in Little Sheep and therefore recorded a non-cash special item net charge of $361 million. We are extremely disappointed with the performance of Little Sheep since we acquired the business in 2012. It has clearly fallen well short of our expectations and hasn\u2019t yet achieved the unit level economics necessary to justify the expansion we had envisioned for this concept. We have a small dedicated team focused on improving this business and pending the outcome of these efforts will evaluate our options with Little Sheep later this year.  Now moving to our global KFC division which posted its strongest quarter of the year with solid improvements in sales, margins and profit. Systems sales growth was especially strong in emerging market up 12% led by Russia, Africa and Thailand. International developed market also delivered solid systems sales growth up 5% led by the UK, Continental Europe and Australia and the U.S posted its strongest quarter of same stores sales growth in nine years of 6%. Operating profit grew an impressive 19% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation this included a benefit of 3 percentage points from the favorable resolution of the pension matter in the UK. Importantly KFC stead a new record for international development in 2014 opening 666 new restaurants demonstrating the global power of this iconic brand. Our global Pizza Hut division posted flat same stores sales growth for the quarter. Although this was the lower expectations it represented another sequential improvement in quarterly sales performance since the start of the year. Despite this improving sales trends operating profits decline 11% driven by 2.7 percentage point decrease in restaurant margin coupled with strategic investments in international G&A to lay the foundation for future growth. On the positive side the quarter capped a year of record level development for the Pizza Hut brand opening 465 new international units capitalizing on the continued strong growth of the Pizza delivery category globally. And finally Taco Bell which posted their best quarter of the year with operating profit growth of 20% global same stores sales grew 6% including 7% same stores sales growth in the U.S driven by breakfast the launch of our dollar credence menu in our recent Sony big box promotion. Restaurant margin improved 0.1 percentage point to 20.6% raising full year margin to approximately 19%. Additionally, we opened 236 new stores this year our strongest weighted development in more than a decade. Almost 90% of these new restaurants were opened by franchisees further demonstrated the attractive investment returns to the Taco Bell brand generates. I know like to talk about our 2015 outlook we are full committed to delivering EPS growth of at least 10% this year. And consistent with the plans, we laid out in early December at our Investor Meeting we have a path to achieve this target without profit growth from our largest business KFC China. The pace of sales recovery in this business remains difficult to predict and we'll have much better visibility to this trajectory and the implications for KFC China's profit growth and young EPS growth as the year progresses. Along these lines, our path to at least 10% EPS growth has become tougher. The major change is foreign currency translation. We initially estimated exposure of at least 1 percentage point of EPS for the year but based on current spot rates and projections that could now be around 4 percentage points of full year EPS headwinds. To be clear this exposure is largely one of profit translation and does not impact our competitive position as it relates to how we place our products around the world. The vast majority of our input costs on a local currency where we operate so swings in foreign exchange rates have no real impact to our pricing or competitive value.  With respect to China, Pizza Hut sales are about where we thought it is. But KFC continues to recover at a slower pace than we anticipated. Same stores sales for KFC did not improve in the month of December and January as we expected, as recent promotions were too narrowly focused from a consumer perspective. We've taken swift action to develop new advertising and new local store marketing programs to strengthen our overall promotions with broader appeal to our core-customers during the upcoming Chinese New Year period. We expect these actions will deliver improved results in the coming weeks. In spite of these headwinds, we remain committed to delivering at least 10% full year EPS growth for 2015 with the first half negative and the second half strongly positive just as we outlined in New York. However, based on current trends, we expect China same stores sales for the first quarter which is limited to the month of January and February will be in a negative mid-teen range. Combining these with our new expectations for foreign exchange we estimate that young EPS in the first quarter of 2015 will be about 20% lower than prior year. So with a weaker than expected start to the year why am I confident it will deliver at least 10% full year EPS growth for 2015. Here is the key reason number one, we expect China division to have a very strong second half bolstered by A the gift of time and the demonstrated resilience of our brand including the upward trend in our key consumer metrics. B two menu rebounds including new breakfast innovation and the continued roll out of premium coffee at KFC. C, two menu revamps and the expansion of our breakfast afternoon tea and late night programs at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. And D, new product and digital innovation at Pizza Hut Home Service. We are also continuing prudent new unit development of all three businesses, while making the investments necessary to contemporize our brands to keep pace with the changing China. We have enormous profit leverage in our China business, so when sales recovery as we expect they will, we are positioned to realize a significant uplift in division operating profit similar to what we achieved in the first half of 2014. In fact, as sales recover to 2012 levels, we believe there is $600 million of latent profit potential just with our current assets underground. Number two, we expect positive momentum to sustain at both KFC and Taco Bell divisions which together account for about 55% of our global operating profit supported by more breakthrough product innovation, solid franchise driven at new unit pipeline plus the rollover benefit from last year's record development and continued progress on digital.  Number three; we expect Pizza Hut division sales and profits to strengthen across the year as we accelerate the pace of international development particularly in emerging markets building on last year's record level additions which benefit this year. Improve the execution of our brand re-launch in the U.S. with more targeted product news, promotional offers and marketing communications continue to improve and expand our digital platforms and leverage our best product innovation ideas from around the world.  Now I'd like to quickly cover our ownership strategy and how we make decisions where to invest equity. First from a global perspective, we lead with franchise development with our franchisees opening over 1,500 restaurants around the world including the vast majority of new units opened at our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions. Second, we maintain purposeful equity investments on the basis of financial and strategic criteria. On the financial side, we own equity where we generally have high growth, strong returns and strong operating capability. On a strategic side, we have equity positions that allow us to innovate our concepts, build capability and lead the growth of our system. And third, we refranchise when we believe the franchise model creates more shareholder value. In fact after a conducting a comprehensive review of our equity business, we announced in December our intent to become even more franchised as a company.  Currently, we are slightly more than 90% franchise outside of China and India and we're going to take that to approximately 95% franchised over the next three years. With this, we expect operating margin for these businesses to improve from 24% in 2014 to over 30% in 2017. For China and India, we realized there are opportunities to unlock shareholder value to refranchising as well. We will be picking up the pace of refranchising and franchise development in these divisions and expect to be approximately 10% franchised in China and 85% to 90% franchised in India by 2017. We expect the profitability and capital efficiency of our businesses will improve with this refranchising and importantly these actions along with the China sales recovery will boost our return on invested capital which we expect to reach at least 22% on 2017. Finally, we pay a dividend which we've grown at a double-digit rate every year since we first paid the dividend in 2004. This equates to an annual dividend yield of about 2% which is very competitive for a company with our growth profile and we're committed to that. So let me wrap things up, while we see additional headwinds for 2015 and the recovery at KFC China is taking longer than we anticipated, we are committed to EPS growth of at least 10% and restoring our track record of double-digit EPS growth going forward. We are also committed to ensuring the ownership model, create shareholder value and we'll be increasing our franchise mix in the years ahead. And with that, I'll hand things back over to Greg. Greg Creed : Thanks Pat. Before we begin the Q&A, let me just tell you why I'm passionate about this company and believe in the future of Yum! Brands. First, we have three iconic brands with incredible global infrastructure and franchise capability to facilitate growth. That's a strong competitive advantage to start with. Second, we have a China business with leading brands, supply chain, development expertise and of course people. Other companies would kill for what we have. Yes we've had some challenges over the past couple of years which have been painful for our shareholders. But that doesn\u2019t erase the company we built over the years, while the enormous opportunity ahead of us. We're going to turn this business around and when we do, we have a tremendous sales leverage opportunity to capture and I'm confident we will. Our KFC division is an emerging market powerhouse as strong as this business I know it can get stronger. The top 10% of our restaurants are generating sales that are more than double the average KFC. Our assets are under-leveraged. We're going to remedy this by expanding operating hours, leveraging digital and strengthening the core and we expect the recent improved performance in the U.S. to continue. Pizza Hut it's a powerful brand that quite frankly has underperformed over the past few years, but we adjusted a record in new unit openings. Think about this, if we can set a record in new unit openings when the brand is not growing same-store sales, just imagine what we can do when we get sales going. We're making digital our top priority and we're going to perform much better.  Taco Bell is accelerating the unit opening lunch, breakfast and mobile ordering has fantastic innovation in high teen restaurant margins and with more focus and investment behind Taco Bell international I know we're going to make a significant progress in taking Taco Bell global as an organization we're going to build stronger brand we're going to have sharper our brand positioning and inside driven marketing program. And we're going to focus on the following areas more product customization, more transparency, leading innovation and much more engagement through social media and digital. And finally we're going to continue to give back to the community and deliver on our social responsibility commitment. All of these lead my goal of having brands that people stuff and champion is going to take hurries to do the right thing and it's going to take time. But we have to scale and the resources to do it. I firmly believe we're going to build stronger brand and all of these will lead to strong returns for our shareholders in 2015 and over the long term.  So now I'll hand it back to Steve will commence to Q&A. Steve Schmitt : Okay we are ready for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : I just want to see if I caught a comment and then I'll have a question on that. It sounds like refranchising in China and India would actually be additive to profits in the near-term. Is that what I heard? Greg Creed : John I would say I'm not meaningfully additive. John Ivankoe : Okay, but at least not dilutive. And then when we talk about cash flow and returns in some of these other things, it would clearly be accretive. So I guess there are two schools of thought with re-franchising, one of which, you know, you sell stores at a relatively low margin because you can, we talked about, have these sales not be dilutive to profit or maybe even modestly accretive to profit and let the franchisees turn around the system from a fairly low base. And there's another school of thought that you re-franchise stores once the brand has regained strength and is showing increases in same-store sales and margins and what have you, so you can put new stores in the hands of franchisees with some momentum behind them. So do you subscribe to either one of those schools of thought? Or how should we be thinking about re-franchising, broadly, especially when we think about the existing base of margins, for example, of Pizza Hut globally or especially China on a system wide basis? Greg Creed : John generally speaking we love the franchise model we think it\u2019s a powerful way to create shareholder value and we've demonstrated that overtime. Our equity positions have been quite purposeful as we've talked about. But we've always guided our ownership with believe that we earned the right to own and this were we're not continuing to earn the right own and what we believe those units will create more shareholder value in the hands of franchisees capable franchisees who been continue to build the brand and develop alongside us as equity operators that\u2019s the direction we're headed. So our strategy hasn\u2019t changed at all guided by the underwrite to own if anything I would say building on what we presented in New York. Our goal is to be even more discipline in that regard. John Ivankoe : So just to understand, you have no problem re-franchising stores at a relatively low price at a relatively low margin, if that's what you think is right for the long term of the business? Greg Creed : When we structure our refranchising deal we structure prices that we believe are there based on the current operating performance of those unit. And what we believe is there potential in the years ahead fair prices. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Palmer RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Palmer : You mentioned consumer perception scores are improving in China. Have those scores continued to improve even in recent weeks and months, or are those stalling out lately? And versus the competition, are you seeing a divergence in perceptions? Because it does appear that perhaps competitors are recovering more quickly. And what is that telling you about the business? And then lastly, is there anything in terms of your comparisons in the first quarter, perhaps marketing, media waits and other, that we should know about? Thank you. Greg Creed : David let me just say that the good news is that there has been sequential improvement in the metrics. Obviously we get KFC on a monthly basis that we're seen a month to month improvement in KFC obviously on Pizza Hut to get on quarterly basis. But the good news is that whether its food safety or trusts worthy on a liable brand all of those metrics are improving on a month to month basis. So that\u2019s the good news. The second part of your question was. David Palmer : About how does that compare to the competition and perhaps what does that tell you about how you handle it and perhaps how the consumers view you competitively on those trust scores. And then lastly, in terms of the comparisons on your marketing and media wait, is there anything to note there in terms of how we view this first quarter? Greg Creed : I think the good news is that the consumer metrics are in line with our key competitors in China. I mean they were planning in that the same direction at the same time. So I think in that sense there is no really disconnect between the including and metrics are now key competitors metrics. I think as you know a key competitor had greater sales originally then we had I put that down to the performance of the promotions that we were running in both December and obviously as we started running to the New Year. I think what's really important is that I think we're sequentially getting better and I think we've learned that, as Pat actually referred to in his commentary, we try to make the --no we've try to be useful in contemporary and maybe we got a little bit tune out and walked away from our course, but I'm excited about in the discussions I've been having with Sam and Joey, they were already course corrected. The advertising for the Chinese New Year promotion. We've also added some local store marketing for what will be the Chinese new promotion so what I'm really about is that course correcting very quickly when the promotions aren\u2019t working. We realized where we can get better and we're making those changes immediately. Next question please Sharon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Glass, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : If I could just ask one other question on China sales recovery, and then I have one on margin, is there anything to read into the fact that the Pizza Hut business is stronger than KFC, other than that supplier issue? In other words, does it say something about how the consumer is changing there? How do you know that's not the underlying or one of the underlying issues? Maybe can you speak to is it maybe is there an asset base issue at KFC that needs to be addressed as well as some of the promotions? Greg Creed : John I think as we look at everything from the consumer metrics everything else, we do believe that as we know KFC had two incidents consecutively, Pizza Hut had one. Pizza Hut's recovering in line with other people recovering in the marketplace. And we really do believe it's down to the fact that unfortunately KFC had two things. Now let's not forget KFC is the number one brand in China and obviously the growth that we've had from Pizza Hut over the years and continue to have as Pat talked about, so I remain incredibly confident in both KFC and Pizza Hut in China. And I'm just totally-totally confident that we're going to turn the thing around. Pat Grismer : And John to the second part of your question around the role of the asset plays in all of this, as we outlined in New York, we see asset image being a critical component of our overall strategy to contemporize the brand. Last year we remodeled a bit over -- a bit more than 300 units, we'll do more than twice that number this year, as we look to move more aggressively to contemporize our assets recognizing that a fair portion of the stake was built just in the last five years so overall it's a fairly contemporary stake but for some of our older assets we will be moving more aggressively over the next year with a different remodel package in order to make a better progress there. Thanks John. Next question please Sharon. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner, UBS. Your line is open. Keith Siegner : Just to follow on the China theme a little bit longer, at the modeling session at the analyst event there was a 2015 guidance for what was hopefully 16%-plus on restaurant-level margins in China for the year. Given the updated thoughts on the top line, does that margin still hold or can we have an update to that margin outlook, please? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes margin we still expect for the full year -- for the division to be at least 16%. Keith Siegner : Restaurant level margins, right? Greg Creed : Yes, that is correct. Keith Siegner : And if I could just sneak in a second one, is there any way you could give us some color? Are there pockets of weakness, pockets of strength? Is it tier 1 and tier 2, driven either above or below the average? Is it tier 4 through 6? Any kind of color you can give us to any potential pockets of weakness or strength in that same-store sales recovery would be helpful. Greg Creed : Yes Keith in the most recent quarter, we did see Tier 1 stores outperform -- the balance of the market, but really nothing to report other than that and our best assessment of that is that Tier 1 consumers seem to be maybe a little less phased by the supplier publicity this time around we're continuing to monitor this and at present we have nothing else really meaningful to share on that. Next question please Sharon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Two questions -- just one on the China side. You mentioned, Greg, that you've had two supplier issues in two years and that's what you attribute the slower recovery. I was just wondering, first, if you could talk a little bit about the potential of the damage that might have caused to the consumer and what gives you confidence that there isn't necessarily a third? What are you doing in terms of improving the supply chain, since the frequency of that has picked up and might have caused damage to the consumer perception of the brand? And the second question was just on Taco Bell. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on the value versus premium side of things. It seems like we are hearing less about the higher end, maybe more on the lower end. I'm just wondering how you view that higher end opportunity, especially with fast casual doing so well. Greg Creed : Yes well first of all as I said the all the consumer metrics were improving both on KFC and Pizza Hut and obviously there are no indicator what's going to happen and there are also no indicator of consumer confidence, so the good news is that those are improving all moving in the right direction and that's what obviously I think really underpins the confidence I have that when we combine that with promotions that at our core user with better marketing and better value we're going to see the quicker turnaround of the performance in China. So those are the things that give me the most confidence is the consumer, the consumer metrics is moving in the right direction.  On the Taco Bell story, I think Taco Bell had a great quarter as we all know when it was a combination of really everything. We had $5 box promotion with Sony. We had the launch of the value menu and I think that plus I think advertising in that really is resonating with the core user, it's driven out great consumer insights and human truth, so I really believe that Taco Bell is firing on all cylinders whether it's a $5 or whether it's just an engagement with the customer so very confident in the future of Taco Bell. Jeffrey Bernstein : But any efforts to prevent a third type incident? Is there any changes in terms of the supply chain? Greg Creed : Obviously as you can imagine we've put a lot of things in place we\u2019ve now got which will blow our program we've obviously stepped up obviously the I guess the order thing is going on without supply I mean I think the one thing I can't promise is when they've happening if because if people are going to law and sheet do the wrong the thing. But you've got close like a TV which will blow our programs and expensive ordering going on I think we're doing all the right things you aspect to the later. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley Bank of America. Your line is open. Joe Buckley : Also on China, could you just talk a little bit more about the December-January promotions? You described them as being too narrow, and just kind of what that means. And put perspective -- the planned menu revamps, how extensive will they be compared to the late March 2014 brand relaunch at KFC China? Greg Creed : Sure I think the first promotion, there is no doubt the team is right being trying to make the brand more youthful and contemporary. That\u2019s a really good thing that we're doing. But I think in the promotion everywhere this was around the Canadian brand here it so we obviously made it just too narrow and so we didn\u2019t really appeal to about core customer and I think was great and we're youthful and contemporary, the expression which was its Korean brand was actually just much too narrow. And I think the good news the teams learn a lesson but the great thing about when you have these things happen and as I said having spoken to same and Joe I've already course to be advertising for the CRB part of the Chinese New Year has already being shinned with also added extra resources to local store marketing. So I'm really confident that if it didn\u2019t work there intent was right the execution wasn\u2019t and we've learn it and we've already change the execution going forward. So that seems like all really good. The two main re-events obviously the big one will actually have in the first half the second one is not as quite as big as the first one. But I think we have a lot of confidence in menu re-events we know that work for us in the past the first half of last year they've worked and I have the lot of confidence that with the innovation in the product and improvement they're going to make that will see profound effect from this menu re-event. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : One follow-up on China and then I have a question about Pizza Hut, if I may. Just on the China outlook it seems to me that January maybe got actually worse than December, based on what you are guiding to. And frequently as we are getting updates, it does feel like every time we get an update it's slower than expected or worse than expected. Can you just talk a little bit about is there a point at which you will entertain the idea that maybe you don't get back to peak volumes or you don't get back to peak margins, and maybe you think about the ownership structure a little bit differently? Just if we are sitting here in seven -- six, seven months from now and it doesn't look like you are getting the big bounce back in the second half, does that change your thoughts? And then my question on Pizza Hut is really, Greg, you did a great job with Taco Bell, I think really changed perception there. Can you just compare that to what's going on with Pizza Hut and what -- if the problems or the issues facing the brand are similar to what you saw, and how you think about that business? Greg Creed : I'll let Pat handle the first one and I'll take the Pizza there so. Pat Grismer : Sarah on January sales in China I think the comps can be receiving right. So I was like to look at the underlying transactions and so we look at underlying transaction volumes on a weekly to season wise basis. And January was about in line with December so we've necessarily see the business deteriorate but didn\u2019t improved to the extent that we were expecting and so that\u2019s why I said we entered the year plus momentum that we had anticipated when we're all together in New York. As to what the pace looks like going forward as we've said the pace of recovery is slower than we expected best reason why was have the two incidence in two consecutive years. But there is no denying the fact that the business is recovering. We step back and we look at we're things were at the end of July were things were had in August and were things are today and there heck of lot better. We would have like to seen and we had anticipated the stronger recovery. But it\u2019s going to take longer but what we need it to give some time and we have strong believe in a programs of the team is lining which is sharpening as we've talked about to sustain the upper momentum. So that I would say by the time we lap the OSI incident in late July we expect comps to turn positive that is a longer recovery period than we've seen before. But we do see that recovery continuing and we know with that is substantial profit leverage. So we do expect that would be improving sales in the back half of the year will have improving margins and substantial improvement in overall profitability. Very similar to what we saw in the first half of 2014 so we don\u2019t have to go back to far in history to find good hard evidence of the resilience of our brands and our ability to bring the profit back in that business. As it relates to long term ownership again we take a long term view of our business we're in China for the long term and the last two years of volatility while yet painful don\u2019t erase more than a decade of substantial value creation China remains the biggest retail development opportunity in the world and we are the leaders in that market. So our view on the market to long term do we look opportunities to refine our ownership model, yes as we've indicated we've pivoting to quietly higher franchise ownership where it makes sense, where we can sensibly do that, given the nascency of franchising in China today. But we have strong belief in the power of our brands and the strength of our teams and our leading position in that market and we believe that that recovery is going to progress across this year. Greg Creed : So on the Pizza Hut story it's -- the flavor of now I love I think it's a positioning that is so right with what's happening in the entire food market, so I think that to start with. There's no doubt we want to make Pizza Hut more useful, now let's not talk Taco Bell it's a little bit more useful and the good news that's come out of the re-launch so far is that things like [rev] users as I think the 24 gone from like 6% of our business to 24% of our business. So we know that this whole new flavor is now positioning us resonate with them. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t talking to our current abundant users and as we can tell we're now back on that with Rex Ryan and Tony Romo, so I think we're doing the right thing which is the flavor of them has really resonated with the younger customer audience where we've been really going after which is great. At the same time we got to make sure we don\u2019t lose our abundant customer, we want to make sure that that we've offered a great sort of pepperonis at a great price and what I'm excited about is we got 90% repeat on those who try the new products so getting more type of those new products will also be critical so I'm very happy with I think where we're going to take this brand and the positioning would anchor us around. Sharon next question please. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : I'm going to give this question on China one more shot. My question is, how do you conclude that the recent trend was more related to those promotions you mentioned and not some structural issue with the brand that's happened post these two events? And said differently, how do you get confident that this recent trend in the sales volumes isn't more of just a new reality from which you have to grow from? Pat Grismer : I would say our best indication David is the consumer metrics that we're seeing brand I trust food and safety we've seen as Greg mentioned steady improvement month and month and no scores. As we discussed the recent promotions underperformed from the sales perspective, but consumer metrics continues to show improvement, so in our view it's a matter of getting the promotions right and we're taking strict action to show those up in the next several weeks here ahead of the first of our two menu revamps this year. So we have not seen anything at this stage which would give us a reason to believe that what we have here is a new normal. We think that this situation is temporary and again we faced a similar set of circumstances a year ago and we have the dramatic recovery in our China business just in the first half of 2014 so there's recent evidence that our brands are resilient. They'll bounce back. It's harder this time around because we've had the two incidents in two years, so that's why the recovery is taking longer. But as we've said recovery is progressing not at the pace that we'd like but its progressing and we continue to believe strongly that we'll have a strong second half. Greg Creed : I mean David let me just I hadn\u2019t run Taco Bell for a long time. I've had my share of incidents. So I know what these are like. They're not linear. They never recover on a linear basis, but we do know that great iconic brands always recover. And we know what to do, we have to do innovation, we have to get our core customer back engaged and we had a very frank assessment of the promotion in January and December and we didn\u2019t get it right. And -- but the most important thing is, we're making changes going forward and that to me is really important so having been in the same situation that Sam and the team are. I've been in this situation. I have absolute confidence that iconic brands come back and they come back stronger than they were even some times before they went into it. I think Taco Bell is living proof of why I have absolute confidence we'll do that in China. Next question please Sharon. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Karen Holthouse : So sorry to ask the same question in another way, but one of the things I think we've been seeing in general consumer reports about China is that health and wellness is becoming a bigger concern and a bigger focus for the average consumer there. Have you done anything in terms of your positioning in perceptions of health and wellness and/or just your sense of whether that is becoming a bigger focus of the Chinese consumer? And maybe potentially that's an overhang on the brand beyond [new] brand scores and whatnot that sounds like, say, everything should be getting better. Greg Creed : I think that what you talked about we're seeing on a global scale right it's we're not just seeing it in China, we're not just seeing in the United States, we're seeing it everywhere. Clearly what you would call health and wellness those -- the importance of that is clearly growing. So I think that in a sense just like at Taco Bell we offer Fresco and at Pizza Hut we offer Skinny Pie and at KFC we offer grilled, and in China we offer congee, and vegetables and food and milk and all that sort of things, so it's -- I don\u2019t think China is ahead of anyone else, I don\u2019t think China is behind anyone else. I think that at the end of the day, we've got choice with our customers to make, but at the same time we got to make sure that the promotions that we run are relevant and appeal to our core audience and we just simply got to do a better job of that in China. Karen Holthouse : But if you look at some of the products you just mentioned, how big are they actually as a percent of sales versus the core menu that's more fried chicken and fries? And then I have to imagine if you were to look at the overall market, kind of young's share of what you would consider traditional, not necessarily healthy fast food is a lot higher than your share of more traditional congee, vegetable soup, that sort of thing? Greg Creed : Accounted to mean why look at these things mix around 2% doesn\u2019t matter what Taco Bell it doesn\u2019t matter what it is these things started to have huge mixes. But the key is for us to give the customer a choice and I think that\u2019s what we do doesn\u2019t matter on what brand and what country what we got a valuable for our customer is choice. But the mix is we'll probably stepping around 3% I think that there are much bigger things of play I mean making sure that we've got great food a great value making sure that our brands are relevant making sure that this share worthy. I mean all these sort of things I was important there is not one thing is driving it is and a specific thing all these on a global scale and we're reacting to them on the global basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer Company. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : You talk about unlocking shareholder value in China by leveraging the recovery into significant earnings growth and maybe taking a more disciplined franchising approach there. And that's definitely going to serve your shareholders well. But at the same time, the business outside of China -- it's very franchised, very highly franchised. The business is very under-levered and performing very, very well. Taco Bell, KFC -- just great results. And your peers are getting really strong appreciation in the public markets for similar type business models that you guys arguably are not. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can do to capitalize on that dynamic to unlock shareholder value, not necessarily from a business operations standpoint. But maybe is there an appetite to maybe take on more leverage? Or anything that you can talk about, your way of thinking there would be helpful. Greg Creed : Well let me start and then I will handover to Pat. We will always have the often structure to drive shareholder value let me be really clear. Right now obviously we believe turning China around is the key and obviously we believe China is a long term play for us I think that\u2019s very clear. Pat Grismer : And certainly as it relates to ownership level outside the U.S and how that relates to our capital structure. I think I won't understand based on what we outlined in New York that we are pivoting to a more highly franchise model going forward and we expect those franchise percentages to edge up over the next three years. With respect to capital structure we look at things the enterprise level. So we don\u2019t segment our balance sheet by division and we look at our capital structure the enterprise level based on the adjusted leverage ratios that rating agencies look at and how that relates to our cost of capital. As I outlined in New York having taking the advices three large independent Bank who have check our analysis to make sure we're thinking about just right way we believe that our current leverage ratio which is a lowest run of investment great credit. We optimize our weighted average cost of capital. If we were to take on additional debt to an extent that we take us into junk bond territory as we do the number we see what I would characterize as a modest amount accretion and frankly given the trade off in terms of reduced flexibility and our ability to optimize that weighted average cost of capital across economic cycle. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good result it's not in the best interest of our shareholder in our judgment. But we do look at it as I know you'd expect we do look at couple a time in year we put a lot of rigor behind it because we are very concerned about making sure that our capital structure is the right one for our shareholders in long term. The one that supports our ability to return cash to our shareholders the way that we have consistently through a combination of a growing dividend and substantial share buyback were also having the cash necessary to continue to invest aggressively behind growth opportunities. Greg Creed : I would add just some we've got a great track record of driving shareholders value and we obviously believe that model will deliver outstanding returns going forward. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Just following up on several recent questions, specifically a lot of those about the recent products and promotion stuff that's going on at KFC in China -- so I'm just curious. Are you guys able to test a lot of that new product and promotion strategies before you implement them? And if not, I'm curious what gives you confidence that you are making appropriate strategy shifts as we get deeper into 2015? Greg Creed : We have a very rigorous discipline process in China and we can't hit everything I don\u2019t teach and go out test rock bands and rock bands and those like things they get a little bit more difficult to test. But I think the repositioning of tower products or the new product in the more traditional sides we can definitely test and in fact I would say that China has probably has one of the most rigorous testing methods and in fact a lot of this is adopted those methods outside of China among the other brand. So I am confident that over right testing is going we can test some but sometimes you just can't test every possible promotion. Operator : The next question comes from line of Peter Saleh Telsey Advisor Group. Your line is open. Peter Saleh : I just wanted to come back to the China menu revamp. If I recall correctly, last year there was more of a check benefit from the revamp of the menu. And there wasn't a traffic increase, but more of the comp came from increases in the average check. When you think about the revamp this year, at least the first one, are you targeting more of a traffic or maybe more of a check increase similar to last year? Pat Grismer : Peter, we expect with all our innovation to build transaction momentum. Now with the construct of the menu revamp with some more premium products, we also expect to check benefit. This will improve profitability, but our goal, our goal over the long run is to rebuilt the traffic that we've lost and so we do expect that with this menu revamp there's going to be sufficient innovation and continued focus on value to sustain the traffic momentum necessary to recover the business and realize that that full upside profit potential. Next question please Sharon and this is our last question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open. R.J. Hottovy: Just one more quick question on China -- I appreciate the comments about the consumer perception scores improving and your blueprint for sales recovery in the region. I wanted to get a sense on your take. Have you seen any change in demand among potential franchisees in the market following the recent supplier issues? I know you are building towards a 10% franchise goal by fiscal 2017. I just wanted to get any color on any potential changes among franchisees you are targeting. Greg Creed : Yes no changes R.J. We regained the number brand even with the issues that we've experienced. And our pipeline of franchisees comes from our restaurant general managers and area managers, so we continue to develop strong capability there and among our table of RGMs, general managers, our entrepreneurs who are -- who remain quite eager to take on the opportunity to own and operate our KFC restaurants predominantly in our Tier 1 cities, so that continues to be the strategy. We've not seen any slackening of demand in that regard. Greg Creed : Yes so thank you everybody. First of all thanks for being on the call. I just like to thank I think by saying I was personally delighted to see Taco Bell had a great fourth quarter. And I think a lot of the things that we've done at Taco Bell whether it's a very clear trend or whether it's really very insight driven, whether it's we've got really amazing innovation, advertising that connects and a social mobile digital that really engages with our customers, I think that's what has really helped Taco Bell had a great fourth quarter and a great year. So it probably should come as no surprise to anybody those are maybe the things that are going to be driving as I -- in I go further I visit countries and I'm talking to the brands that don\u2019t be surprised to see me focusing on the exactly those same things because I know they\u2019ve worked at Taco Bell. I absolutely believe we can do them in KFC and Pizza Hut in every country around the world. So with that I really appreciate you all being on the call and I look forward to seeing you soon. Thanks very much everybody. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. You can never be pleased when you report an EPS decline for the quarter, but the story behind the numbers gives me even more confidence that we can and will deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2015. I would summarize our performance as our KFC and Taco Bell divisions are firing on all cylinders. China is clearly improving and there\u2019s still much work to be done at Pizza Hut. Let\u2019s start with China. Same-store sales declined 12% for the quarter. The best I could tell the whole story. The fact is that the business is clearly improving. Same-store sales and customer metrics continue to move in the right direction. In addition, the team has done an impressive job managing costs and delivered the restaurant margins of nearly 19% in the quarter. It\u2019s the combination of these three elements that gives me confidence will deliver on the first half, second half performance transformation I described at our Analyst Meeting in December. Just last month Sam Su and I assembled a task force to share insights and experience on other parts of our business with the KFC China team. While the local team clearly has an unsurpassed knowledge of the China market, other teams from around the Yum! world have broad expertise and know how we thought could benefit the China team and vice-versa. It was tremendous team work and best practice sharing going both ways and I was truly impressed by the talent of our teams. We also reviewed China\u2019s marketing plans for each brand and are less even more confident in our outlook for the year and the strong second half we expect and here is why. First KFC. We recently launched the first of our two menu revamps planned for the year. This initiative will be taken over the next three months and includes eight new products focused on the lunch and dinner. In addition to traditional KFC offerings this revamp includes product and the consumers interested in healthy alternatives such as herbal tea and seafood. We\u2019re also continuing our premium coffee rollout priced 40% below Starbucks and 20% McCafe, our freshly grind coffee is offered throughout the day. Initial reading show an incremental weekly sales layout of around $300 per store and we\u2019re just getting started. As of quarter end we were in 1,300 stores spanning 10 cities. By year end we expect to have premium coffee in almost 2,500 stores. Our expectation is that coffee will become a solid sales layer to further build growth upon. And we continue innovate on all fronts not just our menu this includes accelerating active enhancements, digital marketing and leveraging our online delivery platform. Clearly there\u2019s a lot to be excited about with the KFC China. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China,we are also encouraged by the ongoing improvement in same-store sales. We\u2019re leveraging the assets throughout the day with the rollout of breakfast and continue to expand our late night offering. Pizza Hut is a new development product -- development machine and we\u2019re excited about the recent launch of our sizzling fajitas leveraging our [indiscernible] platform. In addition to the Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, we continue to expand our home service offering where we\u2019re approaching 300 units in China. This business offers a diverse menu with Chinese food comprising nearly half of its products. Any way you look at it the Pizza Hut business has a long runway for growth in China. So to summarize China, we\u2019re making continued progress with sales and customer metrics. We\u2019re pleased with the productivity gains in our restaurants and we have confidence in our marketing plans for balance of the year. Most importantly, we continue to develop new restaurants with confidence laying the foundation for future growth in the world\u2019s fastest growing economy. Outside of China, I\u2019m excited to report that the strong momentum at KFC continued. Same-store sales growth of 5% build upon last quarter\u2019s 4%. The division opened 72 new international restaurants in 36 countries. Nearly 80% of these restaurants were opened in emerging markets. I was particularly pleased with the continued impressive growth from our Russia business where system sales grew nearly 50% in constant currency. Simply put KFC is a franchise led global powerhouse with a significant lead in many emerging markets and tremendous growth ahead. With its always original positioning, I believe KFC is poised to deliver consistently strong results going forward. One of the significant competitive advantages KFC has is its partnership with strong international franchisees. I personally believe that our franchisees are one of our company\u2019s greatest assets and one of the key to success in this business is to work with your franchise partners. On February 27th the KFC U.S. team led by Jason Marker reached an agreement with our franchises to work together as true partners. This agreement gives us clear marketing control for the first time as well as an accelerated path to improve assets and customer experience. Pat will share the financial details with you during his remarks. Moving to our Pizza Hut division where our results have admittedly been soft and worse yet we\u2019re being outperformed by the competition. As you know we recently launched a new pizza platform in the U.S. where over half the division\u2019s profits are generated. This new platform gives our customers unparalleled variety with exciting new toppings, crusts and flavors. Unfortunately we haven\u2019t been as effective as we\u2019ve liked with our marketing and need to balance its appeal to Millennialswith mainstream pizza customers. We intend to do this going forward while working with our franchisees to bring more competitive value to the market. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to announce an investment we\u2019ve made which will improve our company\u2019s capability and benefit Pizza Hut and all of Yum! Clearly one of the towering strengths of Taco Bell is its superb consumer insights. Over the years a lot of this came from the Collider laban inside driven marketing company. Because better consumer insights is one of our key priorities we decided to bring Collider in house. It\u2019s very first priority will be Pizza Hut in the U.S. In fact we made its former president Jeff Fox the Chief Concept and Brand Officer of the division. We believe Collider\u2019s insights will be extremely valuable to Yum! overall and it\u2019s going to start with Pizza Hut. On the international front, Pizza Hut continues to expand rapidly and we opened 35 new international restaurants in 20 countries during the quarter. Our brand focused structure is clearly paying dividends on the development front and we expect record international expansion this year. We\u2019re also making the needed investments in digital for all of Pizza Hut. We have a firm grasp on what needs to improve and are taking the necessary actions globally to drive better performance. Now turning to Taco Bell which had another great quarter. Same-store sales grew 6% and operating profit jumped 37%. The division opened 47 new restaurants with franchises opening 89% of these units. I\u2019ve never been more confident in Taco Bell\u2019s ability to reach its goal of becoming a $14 billion business with 8,000 restaurants. By all measures Taco Bell continue to go from strength to strength and I\u2019m thrilled to see the team take the brand to a whole new level. Breakfast is doing well owing a 6% mix and the restaurant margins approach 20%. I recently spent time in some test markets and seen what they have in store and I can assure you our innovation pipeline will remain strong. International also continues to build upon the strong momentum for 2014 with 5% same-store sales growth in the quarter and the particularly strong performance in Latin America and Canada. While internationally it\u2019s only a small contributor today we continue to build brand awareness and to improve our economic model as we look to accelerate our international growth plans. So in conclusion we are making great strides across Yum! I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we recover in China build upon our existing momentum at KFC and Taco Bell and focus on turning around Pizza Hut. I\u2019m especially encouraged by the bench of talent we have across Yum! And how we are leveraging that to benefit the entire organization. We are in a unique position at Yum! With three distinct brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused on the three keys to driving shareholder value same-store sales growth, new unit development and generating high returns on invested capital. I believe this combination of efforts will enable us to re-establish our track record of consistently delivering double-digit EPS growth in 2015 and the years ahead. And with that, I\u2019ll turn over to my partner Pat. Pat Grismer : Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our first quarter results and share perspective on our second quarter and full year outlook. First quarter earnings per share excluding special items decreased 8% which was substantially better than the decline we were originally expecting. I\u2019m pleased with the quality of this upside as it was led by better than expected sales and restaurant margins at KFC China. With overall trend sustaining in China and with the most outstanding momentum we have in our Taco Bell and KFC businesses, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll have a strong second half and deliver at least 10% EPS growth this year even with stronger than expected headwinds from foreign exchange. Now I\u2019d like to provide some color on our first quarter results by division. In China operating profit declined 31% prior to foreign currency translation as same-store sales were down 12% in the quarter. Sales were strong during the Chinese New Year period comprising the last two weeks of China\u2019s eight week fiscal quarter and although restaurant margins of 19% were 4.5 percentage points lower than last year due to transaction deleverage this was a significant improvement over the 7 point decline we experienced in the preceding quarter as pricing and label productivity more than offset inflation in food and labor costs.  What this means is that restaurant level profit flow through is actually getting stronger thanks to the hard work of our local team to deploy labor more efficiently and to manage a more profitable mix of menu items. More importantly this bolsters our belief that China division restaurant margins will return to the 20% range as sales are recovered and that this recovery has the potential to unlock approximately $600 million of operating profit. Another important driver of our growth in China is new unit development and because we continue to shift our development focus to lower tier cities tighten our site criteria and improve our investment model we\u2019ve been able to maintain high rate of new store openings despite the temporary softness we\u2019ve seen in top-line results. In the first quarter alone we opened 171 new restaurants in China that\u2019s an average of nearly three restaurants per day bearing in mind that China\u2019s first quarter spans in months of January and February. We\u2019re confident that these investments will yield strong returns and continue to expect 700 new restaurants this year. Also with the breadth of our market presence and the scale of our development team we have the ability to capitalize on China\u2019s expanding economy in a way that no one else can in our sector. Moving to our global KFC division which posted a very strong quarter with solid growth in sales, margin and profit. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets up 11% before foreign exchange led by Russia, Africa and Thailand. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth up 6% before foreign exchange led by Australia, the UK and Continental Europe. And the U.S. delivered its third consecutive quarter of solid same-store sales growth with comps of 7% the best performance by this business in almost 10 years.  Division operating margin increased about 2 percentage points in the quarter to 26% driven by franchise led new unit development and stronger restaurant level margins across the board. All of this combined to yield division operating profit growth of 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. KFC opened 72 new international restaurants in the quarter and similar to previous years we expect our new unit development to ramp up significantly as the year progresses.  With the upward momentum we have in this business we expect KFC to open 700 new international restaurants outside of China and India this year setting a new record for this growing global brand. Same-store sales were flat for our global Pizza Hut division with growth of 2% in emerging markets and 1% in international developed markets and the decline of 1% in the U.S. Operating margin decreased 1.5 percentage points to 30% largely due to strategic investments in international [audio-gap] to support future growth contributing to a 2% decline in operating profit prior to foreign currency translation. And while the sales and overall profit results are disappointing last year\u2019s global brand restructuring has brought 100% leadership focus to the opportunities.  We have to improve Pizza Huts overall brand position operations and digital experience globally. We\u2019re already seeing the benefit of this in development, as Pizza Hut open 70 new restaurants in the first quarter including 35 new international restaurants setting us up to have another year of record development with 600 new international restaurants expected in 2015. Importantly about 90% of these restaurants will be open by franchisees demonstrating strong belief in the brands potential. We\u2019re also continuing to invest heavily behind digital and are seeing a promising return on these investments. Currently digital sales in the U.S. account for over 40% of delivery and carry out sales versus about 30% a year ago and we expect this to trend higher over the time. This is important because digital orders provide customers with the superior order experience try higher levels of royalty and generate higher average spend and finally Taco Bell posted in exceptionally strong quarter with same store sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin of nearly 20% which is about 4 points better than last year as pricing and favorable menu mix more than offset inflation during the quarter.  As a result operating margin increased about 5% percentage point to nearly 27% lifting operating profit by 37% versus prior year. As Greg said we could not be more pleased with the inside driven brand building efforts to Taco Bell evidence by category leading innovation and disruptive advertising. This obviously includes our new breakfast layer which is sustain sales mix at a very healthy 6% additionally we open 47 new restaurants in the first quarter with nearly 90% open by franchises and our opening 150 net new restaurants this year with international development accelerating in the years to come. Anyway you look at Taco Bell is a category leader and a brand on a move. Now, I\u2019d like to talk about our 2015 outlook. As I mentioned earlier we expect EPS growth of at least 10% this year. Outside of China, we expect KFC and Taco Bell to have very good year\u2019s, while Pizza Hut could remain soft. Therefore the key to double digit growth this year is a strong second half for China. In that regard our monthly sales can be highly variable in a recovery environment. Overall sales trends key consumer metrics and balance to your marketing plans give confidence the China will have a strong second half and as I said before the team has done enough standing job of managing restaurant margin and based on year to date results we continue to expect full year China restaurant margin of at least 16%, as I mentioned previously foreign currency translation has become an even strong headwind for us. Based on current spot rates and projections we now expect the foreign exchange may impact full year EPS by approximately 5 percentage points. This is one additional point of headwind compared to what we signaled on our last call. To be clear this exposure is one of profit translation and does not impact our competitive position as it relates to how we price our products around the world. So if you step back and think about how 2015 is developing, it\u2019s very consistent with our expectation coming into the year which is the negative first half followed by a very strong second half driven by China. Our first quarter performance was better than we anticipated, but still negative. Second quarter EPS will most likely show a steeper decline versus prior year. But let me put this into perspective. First, this is largely due to the fact that we\u2019re expecting a higher year-over-year quarterly tax rate compared to Q1. Second, we will be lapping China\u2019s strongest quarter from 2014 which you may remember included same store sales growth of 15% and operating profit growth of nearly 200% and third while we expecting Taco Bell to deliver another quarter of double digit profit growth. It won\u2019t be 37% as it was in Q1. So for the second quarter we\u2019re estimating EPS will lag prior year by about 20%, but we continue to believe that we have the overall business momentum that set us up for a strong second half to achieve at least 10% EPS growth for the full year. Now before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to provide some financial highlights of the agreements we reached with our KFC U.S. franchises which Greg briefly mentioned. Building on the strong business momentum, that\u2019s been built over the last year and in return for brand marketing control which will empower our KFC U.S. leadership team to sustain a turnaround of this business. We will be investing approximately $185 million over the next 3 years. This investment will include new pack of house equipment and incentive to accelerate asset remodels and incremental advertising money. All of which are essential to contemporize the brand and regain traction with consumers. From the timing perspective we expect to invest possibly $100 million this year with the remaining amount split between 2016 and 2017. Due to the unique long-term brand building nature of these investments they will be classified special items with the exception of advertising of about $20 million per year. Although this is a relatively modest investment in the [indiscernible] it is obviously quiet significant to KFC U.S. and we\u2019re confident it will unlock significant value in the years to come. So let me wrap things up, we\u2019re pleased that our first quarter results were stronger than expected due to robust performance of Taco Bell and KFC as well as the ongoing sales and margin recovery in China. We continue to expect at least 10% EPS growth this year with a very strong second half and we look forward to update you further as the year progresses and with that I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open. Diane Geissler : I just wanted to ask about your overall expectation for same store sales growth in China. I mean obviously the first quarter was ahead of what you had articulated on your last quarterly call. You\u2019ve given guidance negative first half negative, positive second half. But could you just talk about it in terms of what your expectations on a percentage basis. Now that you outperformed in the first quarter and you have new product launches and et cetera. Pat Grismer : Certainly Diane You may recall that we had guided in December to full year same store sales growth of 3% to 7% that still an appropriate range we may be coming in closure to the lower end of that range. But importantly we do expect to see sequential improvement in Q2 sales over Q1 and then the strong second half particularly as we as we lap the supplier incident that occurred in July. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks. Pat, you just said that you expect the same-store sales decline rate to moderate in the second quarter versus the first quarter for China. Did I catch that right? Pat Grismer : That is correct. We do expect sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter and I would highlight even with the stronger comps that we\u2019re lapping from last year. David Palmer : The last quarter there, you were talking about the promotion misses that may have happened in China, the Korean boy band promotion. Is there any color you can offer to us about what changes are already happening? I know there was a new menu that was probably in the works for some time, but perhaps a commentary about that menu. But also some things that you're thinking about in terms of a direction of the market that we may not see here for KFC in particular in China. Thanks. Pat Grismer : Yes sure David. Good question. As we said we had a bad start with the boy band. I was really played with how quickly we reacted and how they very strong Chinese new year promotion. We got back to building an emotional connection with our customers. We got back into original recipe, we got back into buckets of chicken and I think that was a very clear lesson for us. The good news is on the menu revamp, this is going to be 8 new products over about 3 months. What I like about it is the lesson that we\u2019ve learnt this time is that and I think this is for the lessons we\u2019ve talked from the Taco Bell breakfast lunch which is you can put the menu out there. But you actually have to promote specific products. So I\u2019m pleased that we got a very strong menu. But we also have very strong product promotions. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. A question about the China trends. I think the release mentioned upward momentum in the consumer scores that you are seeing. I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit more context on what you are seeing and where you are from a consumer trust and feedback perception versus where you were heading into the supplier incident last year. Pat Grismer : Sure. But I think the good news is as you would know we measure a number of attributes clearly value for money, food safety, trustworthiness and favorite brand. The good news is we\u2019re making a proven across all of those metric and I think that what you\u2019ll see is not a linear improvement. But we can definitely see period to period that we are making improvements across the board. So I\u2019m actually really encourage and it\u2019s across the board in a recovery rather specific elements. David Tarantino : And any context on kind of where you are now versus where you were last June for example, maybe how much of the gap you've closed from the decline you saw post the incident? Pat Grismer : Yes, sure. I think on things like trustworthiness were pretty much almost back to where we were prior to the instrument things like value the money, we\u2019re doing better. The good news is we have the right trajectory on all of the of all the [indiscernible]. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Can you provide the transaction price mix and mix components for that minus 14% KFC China comp, and just beyond that what your pricing expectations are for the balance of the year? Pat Grismer : Yes, in terms of the mix the comp was lead by transaction decline check was marginally positive for the quarter and in terms of pricing. We love to take pricing inline more or less with inflation. We\u2019re targeting about 3 points for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from UBS. Your line is open. Keith Siegner : Thanks. Pat, if you could dig in a little bit more into the China company restaurant margins for us, just a little bit more breakdown about where the costs are coming from. Maybe is it all KFC? What about Pizza Hut? What about Little Sheep? And then can you give us an -- or even amongst labor and your other pieces, you did some high-level, but more granular details would be helpful. And then also what's going on from an underlying labor and commodity cost perspective in China? There hasn't been much volatility in labor. Is that still the case, around 10%, and then what does the commodity cost inflation pressure look like? Thanks. Pat Grismer : So first in terms of how we break down the margin variants year-over-year. We are very pleased with 19% margin in the quarter. It was 4.5% points below where we were in the first quarter last year. We lost about 4 margin points from transaction develarge and another 3 margin points manipulation. But offset that with about 2 point margin benefit from pricing and then the other half point benefit was a combination of productivity initiatives, slightly offset by the impact of new unit. So that kind of breaks down the margin drivers, in terms of what we are seeing by the way of inflation. The good news is on the commodity front things are looking a little bit better than we\u2019ve originally guided. I think in New York we guided around 2% to 3% of commodity inflation. Look like closer to 2% maybe so slightly better there, the labor front the situation hasn\u2019t changed call it low double digit around 10% that we saw in the first quarter and that\u2019s more or less we expect for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : Thanks. Maybe just a few sort of detailed questions, but Pat, the G&A this quarter ran above I think what your annualized rate was. Maybe there was some FX in that. But how do you see G&A playing out this year? Is there more investment spending perhaps required than you thought, or is this just more about timing this quarter? Pat Grismer : It\u2019s more about timing because we\u2019re what you are seeing in early part of the year is the full effect of the strategic investments that we made in our Pizza division importantly and international to built capability in development and digital which is where we see biggest opportunity to strengthen our competitive position. So as we lap those investments that was made up with the course of 2014, you\u2019ll see less of an increase year-over-year in G&A, no reason to change our guidance for full year on G&A. John Glass : Okay. And then just two other quick ones. Forgive me if you said this. What was the labor inflation in China this quarter? And also since tax does play a big role in where you shake out in the second quarter, what is the rate you are implying in the tax rate in the second quarter? Pat Grismer : Labor inflation in China was about 10%, in terms of tax I mentioned in my earlier remarks that is the key driver of the expected difference in Q2 EPS performance versus Q1, tax worked to our benefit in Q1, it\u2019s going to go against us in Q2 and that change among drives about 7 point swing in EPS growth versus prior year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Joseph Buckley : Thank you. A question on China also I guess. So I think, Pat, you said the full-year guidance, the plus 3% to plus 7%, is intact, but you're thinking more the lower end. And I guess that seems curious to me with the first quarter coming in better than expected. So could you comment on that, and maybe at the same time address Pizza Hut? I guess I was a little surprised Pizza Hut was down as much as it was in the quarter. Just kind of the dynamics that are going on in that business would be helpful. Greg Creed : Yes certainly. Well you may recall from our financial modeling session in December that we said we needed at least 3% same-store sales growth in China to achieve our China profit growth objectives consistent with delivering 10% EPS growth or better for all of Yum! So based on current trends we still fall within that range of 3% to 7%. We still have a big chunk of the year ahead of us, so it\u2019s always tough to call these things, but what I\u2019m suggesting is that it may be closer to lower end of the range than the higher end of the range but importantly we have a lot of confidence in the productivity initiatives the team delivered in Q1 and we believe that those will sustain through the balance of the year. So any relative softness in sales will be made up with better performance from a profit flow through perspective. And then quickly on Pizza Hut, as we said before Pizza Hut is recovering more strongly than KFC and that continues to be the case because KFC faced two supplier incidents in two years this is the first incident for Pizza Hut, so we are seeing the consumer metrics and the sales recover faster than at KFC. From a margin perspective, we posted 19% on the quarter. Pizza was actually to 20%. Joseph Buckley : If I just go back to the first question, is there a reason that you were thinking the comp numbers would be at the low end given first quarter better than expectations in China? Pat Grismer : Just as we read on the sales as we extrapolate them to the end of the year. Again it\u2019s always tough to estimate sales particularly at this point in the year particularly in a recovery environment, but if I have to make a call today, I would say that we are closer to that lower end however still gives us the momentum necessary to deliver the strong second half which is important to our ability to achieve at least 10% in EPS and still achieve the sequential improvement in quarter-on-quarter same-store sales. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : On the Taco Bell business the 6% comp you achieved there, was that relatively balanced I guess meaning did you see positive comps outside of your breakfast day part and on top of that what is breakfast mixing as percent of the business now? Pat Grismer : Sure so the answer is yes we saw good bounce in the Taco Bell performance across all day part, so when you grow 6% same-store sales right even though the breakfast was still around 6%. It obviously means we\u2019re getting growth in breakfast, so we saw good consistent growth across all day parts. And I think that\u2019s because we\u2019ve got innovation which is clearly relevant to more than one day part. We\u2019ve got very disruptive advertising and I think all of that is working along with the improved customer service and continued great value. I think that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re delivering such a consistent performance. Brian Bittner : In the mix? Pat Grismer : The mix is 6% in the breakfast. Brian Bittner : And just as quick [audio-gap] on Taco Bell I mean 37% operating profit growth is obviously really good and looks like there was just disciplined up and down in the P&L, but one thing that jumped out of me was the food margins and the 200 basis points you got there. What was going on there? Was that just breakfast being a better food margin business or did you see some commodity tailwinds? Pat Grismer : Brian absolutely we have seen commodity tailwinds and that remains a source of upside for us for the full year. Again taking you back to where we were at in New York when we provided guidance around commodities, at the time we were expecting about 2% to 3% at Taco Bell. It\u2019s now looking like it\u2019s going to be flat, closer to flat and that\u2019s because what we\u2019re still expecting inflation in beef it\u2019s not going to be as extreme as we have thought. We\u2019re actually seeing higher deflation for cheese than we had originally expected and we\u2019re also seeing now deflation in chicken, so all of the things are working in our favor. At the same time, we got the benefit of pricing actions we took last year, so not a lot by way of new pricing actions but importantly roll over from last year when commodity cost had spiked. What makes me feel really good is that even with that significant pricing benefit versus the commodity inflation that we see today are value scores are actually getting stronger and I think it\u2019s because of the way the team has been very thoughtful and very intelligent around the way they\u2019ve taken pricing. They\u2019ve taken pricing when we\u2019ve introduced new innovation. They\u2019ve taken pricing when we\u2019ve offered new value on the menu and I think it\u2019s because of this discipline that they\u2019ve been able to strengthen their value scores and we feel very good about where things are at with margins today at Taco Bell. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Two questions, one just on the China maybe the broader industry perhaps, but just wondering the pace of the recovery obviously went to the second half that you seem pleased with that pace. I\u2019m just wondering whether you think that\u2019s consistent across the broader industry or maybe in your research any reason why perhaps your recovery as you\u2019ve noted in the past is maybe going slower than expected or maybe slower trajectory relative to peers I\u2019m just wondering what has kind of been called out in terms of why KFC might be seeing that slower than previously desired trajectory? Pat Grismer : Jeff I think the answer is we\u2019ve said early the KFCs has not had one but two sequential incidents which we\u2019ve never experienced before I think that\u2019s I think one of the key underlying reasons why you may be seeing the KFC recovery though the good news is it is sequentially getting better maybe while the absolute recovery is taking a little longer. I think that really remains the key reason and that\u2019s the key thing we\u2019re seeing in all the work that we\u2019re doing in China. Jeffrey Bernstein : And if the AUVs I mean the goal \u2013 it sounds like the goal was obviously getting back to full strength, but for whatever reason they didn\u2019t get back to full strength is perhaps the recovery took longer and never got to full levels. Do you think it\u2019s reasonably to still get back to that kind of 20% plus restaurant margin or [indiscernible] the different way? What happened in \u201915 whether its comps, margins, returns what would lead you to maybe slow the store growth in \u201916 and beyond? Will it be if the comp thing get back to full strength or could you still grow at the 700 plus pace set out if you\u2019re still hitting that 20% margin? Pat Grismer : Jeffrey there\u2019s no doubt in our mind that comps that same-store sales will return that is averaging along, it will return to where they will or where they were in 2012. It\u2019s not a question of if, it\u2019s just a question of when. That\u2019s not going to happen in 2015 and we\u2019ve never said that, but we remain very confident in our ability to continue to grow our sales layers and achieve the comps the AUVs that we had in 2012. With that then will come the improvement in margins and just as we\u2019ve seen margins hold up really well even under sales pressure we know that when the sales come back there\u2019s enormous operating leverage in our business. And so I remain confident that we will get back 20%. It\u2019s tough to say exactly when that\u2019s going to happen, but as from where I sit that remains a reasonable expectation for that business in the mid-term. Greg Creed : Jeff I just think we\u2019re a brand building company and every day each one of our brands in 126 countries we operate is really focused on four things. Making our brands more relevant, making them more engaged, making them all connected and demonstrating that we care. And I think if we follow that philosophy on all of our brands in every country in which we operate, we will continue to see strong same-store sales growth across the business. Pat Grismer : And Jeffrey what I would also point out is that when we look and we share these numbers before and we look at the top 10% of our KFC restaurants in China, we see average unit volumes that are well above 2 million close to $2.5 million or more. That compares very favorably to what McDonald\u2019s has achieved by way of global average unit volumes so versus where we stand today there\u2019s nothing but upside and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re not only going to get back to where AUVs were in 2012, we\u2019re going to shoot beyond that. Again it\u2019s tough to say exactly when that\u2019s going to happen, but we do have strong belief in our ability to rebuild sales and to bring with that the restaurant level margin importantly reinforced by all the great work the team has done to drive significant productivity improvement during the period of sale softness. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Karen Holthouse : Actually a question on Pizza Hut, is the comment about working on sort of better value construct for the brand. How should we think about the reasoning behind that, has there been an issue with value scores deteriorating, changes in competitive intensity or maybe the thought process is using more aggressive value as a way to sort of induce trial of the new flavor of new menu? Pat Grismer : I think the answer is that we \u2013 an analysis about performance is just we just went value competitive in the marketplace whether that was entry price point whether that was single pizzas whether it was pays, so we clearly have a lot of work to do. What I\u2019m excited about is that the team with franchisees we\u2019ve had a value summit in the last couple of weeks. We\u2019ve shared all the information and all of our knowledge around that value positioning and what we have to do and I think what you\u2019ll see is us come out aligned as one system in order to make a stronger value statement in the marketplace. Karen Holthouse : And with sort of that just as a quick follow up is there a particular price point you\u2019re focused on and is it going for I think that more as an entry level price point or some sort of bundled value that you need to go after? Pat Grismer : I think the answer is all of the above. We have to have good entry level price points. We have to have good single pizzas. We have to have good pan pizzas and we have to have good abundant value and I think we can and will do much better across all of those elements of the price value equation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Andrew Charles : Pat you talked about the China pricing schedule for the year, it sounds like you had some price benefit in 1Q and you\u2019re now aiming for 3% price at the high end where you got to be analyst a put guidance for the low end of 3% to 7% China same-store sales. Is the situation still fluid enough that you\u2019ll consider holding back on pricing in favor of traffic? Pat Grismer : Well we\u2019re always very thoughtful around pricing in much the same way I just want Taco Bell thinking very carefully around when we\u2019re introducing innovation and making sure that we protect value on the menu as we have done in our China business, for KFC in China we had about 3% of total pricing in the quarter, 2% of that was roll over from last year. Now we took an incremental of 2% pricing action in the middle of January which yielded about 1% of pricing benefit on the quarter. We continue to maintain the value and of course we see no reason to take significant incremental pricing actions beyond this probably the situation based on helping the trending in the business in very sensitive the value of course and the importance of value to regaining traction with consumers. On the Pizza Hut side we took 2 and 2.5% of pricing in late 2014, so we have the roll over effective that of planning out in Q1. There again just being very sensitive to what things are ever brand, looking at future pricing actions potentially time to the introduction of new product innovation and maintaining those strong value and goes on the menu. Andrew Charles : That\u2019s helpful and then Greg the spring menu revamp. How would you classify the price points the more value and should be value oriented, the premium price, the mix, just any thoughts there? Greg Creed : When you go any products across the menu it\u2019s a combination as we said earlier. So there is product for lunch and dinner. It\u2019s a cross variant price points and what I like is that I think the presentation of these products and the position of these product is really good having a chance to do it. So it\u2019s not one particular focus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Jason West : Thanks. I have just two questions. One on the outlook for the year, you guys still assuming flat KFC profits in China in the guidance and then secondly with the cost savings that you realized in the first quarter which I think surprised some of us. Is that a new round of productivity initiatives that have now kicked in or is that sort of a continuation of the productivity that you guys more [comp/count] for a while and if you talk about how that extends into the rest of the year. Thanks. Pat Grismer : I\u2019ll address the second question first and then come back to the outlook for the full year. On the margin front one of the things I love about our China team is that they have a mindset of continuous improvement. So as you know they made extraordinary progress on restaurant level productivity in the middle of 2013 and the early part of 2014, all of those of initiatives and the associated margin benefit have sustained into 2015. But they are coming over the top of that with some new productivity initiatives which proves instrumental to their ability to deliver the better than expected margin performance in the first quarter. In the early three elements to this, the first is with respect to what we call pace setter analysis which is essentially benchmarking the best team labor performance within the specific sales band each one of our brands they moved out from an annual discipline to a quarterly discipline and they set targets accordingly after having conducted market test to ensure that there was no impact to the customer experience. So effectively through that more [regular/vigorous] approach to labor planning. They were able to tighten the labor schedules in a way that ensure that we continue to meet customer expectations. But they do it a lot more efficiently. Second piece was around the mix of student and part time team members. So they increase the mix and that delivered a benefit to labor in the quarter and that sustained balance of the year and then the third which is taking [hard/how] to look at management staffing levels in the context that our sales were out and adjusting plans and managing to that. So again three elements to the work they did this quarter which we sustaining through the balance for the year. Greg Creed : I just wanted to reinforce one point to Pat made. This productivity has not been at the expense of the customer experience. I think it\u2019s very important that we do continually monitor the customer experience as we go through this process and I\u2019m really happy with. The customer experience is actually growing slightly bigger, effective making productivity improvements and so I think overall it\u2019s well for the future. Pat Grismer : And maybe the last one I would make on it is that the combined effect of these new productivity initiatives contributed about 1 to 2 points of margin improvement versus prior year and again we see that sustaining do to the end of the year. Now the first question you asked Jason was about our outlook for China profit and the extent to which we\u2019re assuming some profit improvement at KFC. We\u2019re assuming that KFC will improve profits this year that is working in our full year outlook for EPS growth and when you added all up in conjunction with in order to expecting the other divisions and even with this stronger than expected headwind from foreign exchange we get to at least 10% EPS growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I have a question and then a follow up on your commentary if I may. The question is about unit growth in China and I think that\u2019s always been we keep Yen always in terms of value accretion. It looks like the store closure has certainly come down. I was just wondering if when you think about that 700 growth and looking at kind of what the net through the net would look like. Is it safe to say that you kind of pass the point where you\u2019ve closed all of that kind of low performing stores and I guess can you give us a sense of what their returns on the new stores are looking like now and what the mix is between tier I and II versus lower tier cities? Pat Grismer : Certainly Sara, so first starting with closures, we had a higher to normal level of closures last year for China division beat by [indiscernible]. So it\u2019s we were consolidating these states, there was significant impact to the unit count in China. Most of that is now behind us and so when you look at our core brands actually closures in 2014 were lower than they were in 2013 and we expect 2015 to be below 2014, there will always be closures in a restaurant business the size of ours. But we do see that moderating. And then in terms of the returns we\u2019re very pleased with the returns we\u2019re seeing on our new unit investments as you know we continued to shift the mix of development down to the lower tier cities for KFC and then more probably the Pizza Hut given the relative strength of the Pizza the economic model, so here are couples of start they could help with that, so for KFC in the first quarter 67% of our new units openings were in tier 3 and below cities and that compared to 53% for the entire year of 2012. So, quite a significant shift there and then for Pizza casual dining business for the first quarter that brand accounted for 35% of total division unit openings and that compares to 24% for 2012. So again you can see the shifts that are happening in our portfolio and all of that is formed by our discipline around where we direct our capital. We did redeploy capital to the higher return opportunities that\u2019s been good discipline in China over the years and we\u2019re continuing to move in that direction and so that gives us confidence in the continued investment or making in that business and I would say is related to 700 that we\u2019re expecting this year. There is every reason to believe over the long run as our business grows to that number will hedge higher, back in 2012 we opened nearly 900 units. So we certainly have the capacity and we\u2019ve unmatched capability to do it, for us it\u2019s all about being great discipline not getting too far ahead of ourselves and making sure that our capital is deployed to the highest return opportunities. Sara Senatore : Great, thank you and just a follow up I had for Greg actually was idea of these best practices during he talked about in China. I think one in the, I\u2019m sure concerns you\u2019ve heard is the idea that with the portfolio brand maybe the all that many benefits to have altogether they should be run separately so, can you maybe give an example or talk about what kinds of that best practices can be shared across different brands that where you couldn\u2019t get the benefit of just looking internally within one brand and at the highest performance within that brand? Greg Creed : Sure, Sara. I\u2019ll give you the specific example of the China there are six people that we took, 3 of them worked with KFC outside of China but 3 of them work to Taco bell and I think the Taco bell team included people who are very strong in advertising, product positioning, digital and social mobile and that\u2019s where we think Taco bell probably excels. So I think our ability to take people not just from within the brand or within the geography but across brand and across geography is something that is particularly unique beyond. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : I wanted to follow up on the labor I guess what we talk about this labor efficiency in China. There has been basically 3 years of reduced not just labor dollars per store but labor hours per store more specifically and can you help us understand what productivity means and is it, kind of tightening up the number of hours the given employee works I mean is it kitchen labor, is it front of house labor, is it in the number of managers that you use, maybe it\u2019s even the number of managers that you have in training. Just you kind of put some structure process in terms of exactly what efficiency means and why it is the right thing for the brand in a recovery and I have a follow up as well. Pat Grismer : John, you clearly understand our business very well because everything you mentioned for once part, what the team has done to drive year on year improvement and labor productivity. And as I said before one of the thing we love about the team is that they have a continuous improvement mindset, we continually help them as the best operating team we have anywhere in the world and they continue to take it to the next level. So, they are managing to tighter schedule but that schedule is fully uniformed by us I mentioned more frequent updates to their pay setter analysis and taking it to a full market testing. So we have a confidence as Greg mentioned before that we are not doing this to an extent that is going to adversely impact the customer experience. But at the same time, the team continues to reengineer the back-half. So they have a team of very skilled engineers who look at equipment lab, who look at how labor is deployed behind the front counter to better accommodate \u2013 the lines that develop at a restaurant at lunch and dinner time more cost effectively. So there is a lot of intelligence and thought and rigger that is applied to how we do this but it is that continues improvement mindset that is really at the hard at all. John Ivankoe : Thank you for that. And secondly the performance of the brands tier 1 and 2 versus tiers 3 through 6 and I was hoping that you could elaborate on some of the increased competition that you have seen across the markets whether that\u2019s continuing in this current economy where you might be encouraging people to open less stores and in others words lessening some of the competitive impact. Pat Grismer : The trend continued to show competition intensifying in the higher tier cities, so that\u2019s no change from before but interestingly and this is consistent with what we have said in our Q4 earnings call. We are seeing better recovery, we are seeing actually stronger sales to our sales performance of those tier 1 cities, relative to the lower tier cities, so that trends has persisted. John Ivankoe : And still the development tilt towards 3 to 6 what does that tell you in terms of, does that make sense to shift development or is tier 3 and tier 6 that where you want to be putting a new footprint? Pat Grismer : It absolutely make sense to continue to pivot towards the lower tier cities for two reasons, first of all there is more opportunity because those markets are less penetrated and we have the ability unlike competitors to move quickly and gain at that first mover advantage and then secondly there is this superior cost structure, where labor and rent cost are lower in the lower tier cities. Therefore the sales hurdles are lower and therefore we get higher returns on investment because remember we are getting the same AUVs \u2013 average unit volumes in lower tier cities as we are in the higher tier cities so we get the same sales volume but with the higher margin and with the similar investment. So the returns are superior and there are more opportunities out there because those cities are more rapidly developing and they are less heavily penetrated. Greg Creed : Just to further built on that, they know how sharing. I think the labor productivity is an another example where we share labor productivity around the world. So as you probably know we have some pretty high labor markets, Australia and UK and we are able to share those earnings on like transactions per labor hour and obviously share that best practice not just around but all around the world and again not just with in KFC but all the other brands. So I think the labor productivity is another example of the paradigm. Operator : We have question from R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open. R.J. Hottovy: Thanks. Just had a quick question about the KFC segment, I really have two questions, first is just kind of, give us some examples of what is driving that that strong 7% sensor sales growth and expectations going forward and then secondly just a little bit more color on the new franchise agreement that you have in place just in terms of the 100 million of the 185 million in terms of the timing of that investment and more importantly when you start of the some of the benefits from the marketing and the re-imaging capacity that you are going to bake into that investment program? Greg Creed : I think the success has been, [indiscernible] and what we have done we stayed on as far other box and traditionally at KFC we tend to have, our sandwich promotions that we got in the markets and the challenge is as you put, it doesn\u2019t matter how many people\u2014out of the eat out of the $20 bundle it\u2019s still $20 on the television and I think what the team has learned and its really stay rigorously on is the fact on the box. So now we have about four different versions of it, so there is obviously variety that we can offer the customer and also enables to come back with different insights and new communications but I think the consistency of staying around is really powerful entry price point has really been one of the key of success a KFC in the U.S. Pat Grismer : And then on the agreement we have reached with our U.S. franchises in the financials around that, $185 million in total, most of that being recorded as a special items, the advertising piece which amounts about $20 million per year about $10 million or so is going to fall into 2015 that will flow through regular operating income and that is reflected in our guidance still of at least 10% EPS growth this year.  In terms of the benefits, this is a multi-year program, so we expected that the benefits will accrue over the long term as well and we expect to see benefits from each element of that program. So we do expect sales to be better with the incremental advertising. We do expect to see sales lift from the incentive that we are offering to accelerate the pace of remodels such that 70% of our KFC which stable will be a current image by 2017 and that we are expecting to see sales left from the investments we are making for franchises in new equipment which puts them in a position not only to offer the more contemporary menu but to do so in a fashion that provides a better customer experience with better reliability and there will a sales benefit associated with that and we expect that will built over the time and that\u2019s the underlying business case here. The size of the investment for a business of KFC U.S. size but we do expect to see the value that business improve significantly on the back of these investments and with the outstanding brands strategies that Jason Market and his team have put in place. Greg Creed : So, I thank everybody for being on the call. I know today is a very busy day with a lot of restaurants releasing earnings. So that you took the time to be with us, we really appreciate. I just want to reiterate that we believe that we are well set to deliver at least 10% EPS growth not only in 2015 but beyond. Thanks for being with us today. Much appreciated. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Finally, we would like to make you aware of the following upcoming YUM! Investor Event. Our third quarter earnings will be released on Tuesday, October, 6. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. As you saw in our release yesterday, EPS in the second quarter while below prior year exceeded our original expectations. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made and have every reason to believe we\u2019ll deliver a strong second half and full year EPS of at least 10%. Overall, I would summarize our second quarter performance as very similar to our first quarter results. Taco Bell is firing on all cylinders; KFC delivered another solid quarter; China continues to improve and while we are making progress, there is still much work to be done at Pizza Hut. Let\u2019s start today\u2019s discussion with China. Same store sales continue to show steady but slower than expected progress. This quarter\u2019s 10% decline marks an improvement from the 12% decline last quarter despite a more difficult overlap. There is no doubt in my mind that we will make a full recovery over the long term and return to historic average unit volumes. We have the two strongest brands in China by a wide margin, but frankly the recovery is taking longer than we would like. We need to be more aggressive, more innovative and much more disruptive to step change the business. I\u2019ve challenged the China team to do all these things with a sense of urgency, because we know that when we step up our performance in China, our brands perform. So to be clear, we are 100% committed to not only recovering but growing our unit volumes in China. With overall customer metrics trending up we know we can achieve this, by sharpening our communications and bringing new excitement to our menu. We\u2019ve learnt from experience that we must innovate our way to recovery and that\u2019s just what we are going to do. To this point in the second quarter we launched the first of two menu revamps at KFC. This consisted of eight new products focused on lunch and dinner. In addition to the traditional KFC offerings, this revamp included products aimed at consumers interested in healthy alternatives such as herbal tea and seafood. We also recently launched our second menu revamp focused on breakfast. We know breakfast is an under developed day part for us in China comprising about 7% of sales. These two menu revamps provide new products throughout the day and give us a one, two punch of innovation we know our customers will love. Additionally we continue to rollout our premium coffee. As of quarter end we offered our coffee in over 2,000 stores, providing an incremental sales lift of about a point for the stores offering coffee. The key to success in this business is grow existing or create new sales layers to build on. We\u2019re excited that premium coffee is already driving sales and profits, while giving us another platform to grow from going forward. We\u2019re also making progress with digital marketing and our online delivery platform. We believe these initiatives make KFC even more contemporary maintaining a high degree of relevance to the Chinese consumer. In short, the KFC business we are building back will be based on new product innovation and balance nicely with everyday value anchors. We are continuing down the path to make KFC even more useful and contemporary. All of this is part of making China\u2019s number one foreign brand even more relevant going forward in an increasingly competitive market. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China we continue to expand units at a high pace with great returns. Same store sales declined 4% in the quarter, but this marks an improvement from our first quarter performance and the brand is positioned for a strong second half. We continue to leverage the asset throughout the day with the rollout of breakfast and our expansion into late night. We are also excited about Pizza Hut home service offering where we have nearly 300 units in China. Anyway you look at it; Pizza Hut in China has a long runway for growth ahead. In conclusion, we are making continued progress in China and remain bullish on our long term prospects there. With cash paybacks of about 3 years, we are confidently investing in new unit expansion. We have leading brands and an enviable competitive position in the world\u2019s fastest growing economy. We expect to open 700 new units in China this year, and believe we can substantially expand our footprint over time. Moving on to our KFC division, I am pleased to report the division continued to produce solid results. Same store sales grew 3% and the division opened 122 new international restaurants in 39 countries. Nearly 75% of these new restaurants were opened in emerging markets. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the impressive growth we continue to see out of Russia where same store sales grew 14%. I travelled to Russia in May and I have to tell you, this is one of the most impressive teams we have anywhere in the world. The combination of brand positioning, operational excellence and product innovation gives me confidence that we will continue to win in this important market. In developed markets, the UK and Australia once again posted impressive results with excellent same store sales growth. This is evidence that our KFC brand can deliver remarkable results in both emerging, as well as developed markets. I believe we can apply the same strategy such as breakthrough product innovation, compelling value and world class operations, which are propelling these businesses to other developed markets. Just think how our results would be transformed if we could achieve Australia\u2019s 2.3 million average unit volumes in all of our markets. Now turning to the Pizza Hut division; same store sales were even in the quarter, but trends in the U.S. sales improved across the quarter. We complemented our innovation focus with compelling value offerings such as any medium pairs for $6.99 and the $12.99 Big Dipper Pizza, which provided momentum. We also continue to make strides around driving more digital sales. For example, home meal replacement digital orders were 42% up 10 percentage points from the second quarter of 2014. As we discussed last quarter, we are working to attract new millennial customers with our Flavor of Now menu, while also providing our loyal mainstream customers with their favorites. I firmly believe Pizza Hut has enormous potential that recent results do not reflect. We are intently working to become more competitive. Turning around these results will not happen overnight, but through our focus on value, our assets, digital and messaging, we are relentlessly working on realizing the full potential of our brand. We are encouraged that Pizza at international continues to develop at a high rate and we expect record international expansion this year, laying the groundwork for future growth. Last but not least, Taco Bell. I am very pleased with the results out of the division this quarter. Same store sales grew 6%, operating profit increased 29% and we opened 58 new restaurants. Keep in mind we launched breakfast at Taco Bell in the second quarter of 2014. So this marks that first quarter we are lapping breakfast. With breakfast at 7% of mix, restaurant margin exceeding 20% and a flourishing innovation pipeline, I am confident that we\u2019ll see continued positive momentum going forward. Taco Bell\u2019s goal is to be America\u2019s favorite millennial brand and we are making substantial strides to deliver on that aspiration. For example, we just announced we are expanding our delivery testing with DoorDash in select locations. I\u2019m delighted with the strong initial test results and this is just another example of Taco Bell proving it is on the cutting edge of QSR. Taco Bell International continues to build awareness and improve its economic model. Same store sales grew 7% in the quarter with particularly strong performance in Latin America and Canada. We have now opened 18 new restaurants this year, including four with open kitchen formats. We are still in the first innings of international expansion for Taco Bell, but I know that this one day will become our third global brand. So in conclusion, we have multiple opportunities for growth across each YUM! division. We are making continued progress in China. Taco Bell is going from strength to strength. KFC continues to build on its momentum and Pizza Hut is in turnaround mode. I could not be more thrilled to lead this company into the next phase of growth. Our brand building agenda led by consumer insights is underway in driving our brand and product position. As I mentioned last call, we recently acquired the Collider Lab to help elevate this agenda. I\u2019m especially pleased with how Kaleida has intergraded its thinking into each brand to improve our insight driven marketing. I am also pleased that Pizza Hut team has added expertise in big data analytics. This is allowing the brand to segment customers in ways we\u2019ve not done before that should lead to more effecting marketing going forward and in a true the YUM! fashion, we are planning to spread this knowhow throughout the organization. Since assuming my current role I\u2019ve been on the road visiting many of our international markets. To say I like what I\u2019ve seen would be an understatement. I\u2019ve walked away from each visit grateful that I\u2019ve inherited such a strong business with great franchise partners, fantastic leaders and the potential for enormous growth. Of course everywhere I go I see opportunities to improve our company, but I\u2019m confident that our band building focus combined with the technology innovation, marketing and operation efforts underway will help unlock this potential. Now some of you may want to ask today about our views around corporate structuring related to our China division, including a shareholder suggestion that was well publicized this quarter. We don\u2019t plan to discuss that and distract from our second quarter results. But we want you to know this, the YUM! Board of Directors regularly review strategic options to optimizing long term shareholder value, including those involving corporate structure. We routinely dialog with shareholders, listen to their ideas and thoroughly evaluate those, which maybe in our shareholders\u2019 best interest. In any event, our top priority is to get our China business back on track and we are making steady progress as evidenced by our first and second quarter results. As we\u2019ve discussed, we expect to have a strong second half of the year based on continued progress in China and fully expect YUM! to deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2015. In summary, we are in a unique position at YUM! with three distinct brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused the three keys to driving shareholder value; same store sales growth, new unit development and generating high returns on invested capital. I believe this combination of efforts will enable us to reestablish our track record of consistently delivering double digit EPS growth in 2015 and the years ahead. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn things over to Pat. Pat Grismer : Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our second quarter results and share perspective on our full year outlook. For the second quarter as Greg mentioned, our results were very similar to Q1. Earnings per share excluding special items decreased 5%. This was substantially better than the decline we had originally estimated. I\u2019m pleased with the quality of this upside as it was led by better than expected restaurant margins at KFC China and outstanding sales and margin performance at Taco Bell. With the continued progress we are expecting in China, we remain confident that we\u2019ll have a strong second half and deliver at least 10% EPS growth this year. Reported EPS declined 28% in the quarter. This includes a $68 million non-cash special item charge related to our decision to sell Mexico real-estate, negatively impacting reported EPS by $0.13 in the quarter. This item reduced our ex special tax rate by approximately 2 percentage points benefiting ex special EPS growth by 3 percentage points this quarter. Now I\u2019d like to provide some color on our second quarter results by division. In China operating profit declined 25% prior to foreign currency translation, led by a same store sales decrease of 10%, which was sequentially better than Q1\u2019s performance despite a more challenging lap. Restaurant margins were 14.6% in a seasonally low quarter. This was 2.2 percentage points lower than last year\u2019s Q2, yet it was a significant improvement from the 4.5 percentage point decline we saw in the first quarter demonstrating continued progress. The margin decline resulted from transaction deleverage and inflation, partially offset by pricing and labor productivity. Our team in China continued to do an outstanding job of driving restaurant operating efficiency through our improved store level sales forecasting and better labor scheduling. Importantly they accomplished this while maintaining our high standards of customer service. This continues to bolster our belief that China division restaurant margins will return to the 20% range as sales recover and that this recovery has the potential to unlock approximately $600 million of operating profit from our existing store base alone. In addition to the profit leverage we will realize as sales recover, we continue to open new units with confidence, which is a key driver of future growth. We opened 80 new restaurants in the second quarter bringing our first half total to 251 new units in China. We continue to shift our new unit development towards higher return investments, as we are more selective in Tier I and Tier II cities and continue to upweight development in Tier III through Tier VI cities. Similarly we continue to shift more of our new unit development to Pizza Casual Dining, which generates our strongest returns in China. Based on the results we are seeing in these new restaurants, we are confident that these investments will yield strong returns and we remain on target to open 700 new restaurants this year. Now moving to our KFC Global division which posted another solid quarter with growth in sales, margin and profit. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets, up 12% before foreign exchange led by Russia, Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth, up 5% before foreign exchange led by Australia, the UK and Western Europe. And KFC in the U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of solid same-store sales growth with comps up 3%. Division operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points in the quarter to 21.9%, driven by same store sales growth, franchise led new unit development and stronger restaurant level margins across the board. And while increased advertising expense related to our ongoing U.S. turnaround program impacted the divisions profit by 2 percentage points in the quarter, KFC global\u2019s operating profit still grew 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. An important element of this is robust franchise led international development as KFC opened 122 new international restaurants in the quarter and is on pace to set a new record this year opening 700 new international restaurants outside of China and India, including a recent new market opening in Myanmar, demonstrating the strength and broad appeal of this iconic global brand. Same store sales were even for our Pizza Hut Global division with growth of 2% in emerging markets and 1% in the U.S. and a decline of 2% in international developed markets. Division operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 22.6% as strategic growth investments in international G&A offset improved restaurant margins which benefited from lower cheese costs. While sales were even with last year and short of expectations, we are confident we are making the right investments to improve Pizza Hut\u2019s overall brand position operations and digital experience globally. New unit development continues to be a bright spot for Pizza Hut as the division opened 101 new restaurants in the second quarter, including 66 new international restaurants. Franchisees opened 92% of these new international units underscoring their confidence in the brand. We are confident we will have another year of record development with about 550 new international restaurants in 2015. And finally, Taco Bell posted another exceptionally strong quarter with same store sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin of 23%, which is more than 5 points better than Q2 of last year. As a result, operating margin increased 4.7 percentage points to 29.5% lifting operating profit by 29% versus prior year. We could not be more pleased with the performance of our Taco Bell team and their continued focus on category leading innovation across every aspect of their business. This obviously includes our new breakfast layer increased to a very healthy 7% sales mix. Additionally we opened 58 new restaurants in the second quarter with nearly 90% opened by franchisees and are well on our way to opening at least 150 net new restaurants this year with international development accelerating in the years to come. Anyway you look at it, Taco Bell is a powerhouse brand with outstanding momentum. Now I\u2019d like to shift gears and talk about our full year outlook. We fully expect to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% this year. Given our first half EPS decline of 7%, we\u2019ll need nearly 30% EPS growth in the second half of the year to reach this target. We believe this is achievable. The key to this EPS bounce back is a sales recovery in China and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll deliver solidly positive sales numbers going forward, especially as we lap the supplier incident from July 20 of last year. I\u2019m extremely confident that as sales return, profits will flow through nicely, given the continuous cost management initiatives we\u2019ve seen through our first half. With first half China restaurant margin already over 16%, we now expect full year restaurant margin to be closer to 17%. As a reminder, 60% of China\u2019s operating profit historically is earned in the second half of their fiscal year, which includes seven of 12 months. Outside of China we expect KFC to have another solid year and Pizza Hut to fall well short of its ongoing growth target despite the improving results we expect in the balance of the year. For Taco Bell, although we expect solid performance in the balance of the year, we expect much more moderate profit growth as we overlap stronger sales and margin performance from last year. I do want to point out foreign currency translation remains a strong headwind as we continue to expect this to impact full year EPS by about 5 percentage points. However, this impact is included in our EPS forecast of at least 10% growth. To be clear, this exposure is one of the profit translations and does not impact our ability to price our products competitively around the world. So if you step back and think about how 2015 is developing, it\u2019s very consistent with our expectation coming into the year, which is a negative first half followed by a very strong second half driven by China and importantly, we continue to invest behind the business, opening 2,100 new international restaurants in 2015. Outside of China approximately 90% of our new units will be opened by our franchise partners. So let me wrap things up. We\u2019re pleased that our second quarter results were stronger than expected due to robust performance at Taco Bell, as well as the continued recovery in China. We expect at least 10% EPS growth this year with a very strong second half. And with that, I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Tarantino with R. W. Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. My question is on the China sales recovery and I guess first part is how would you frame up your current expectation for comps for the year now. I think last quarter your point was the low end of your 3% to 7% guidance. So I just wanted to understand what you\u2019re thinking now and then specifically you mentioned that the recovery is going I guess slower than expected. So could you talk about maybe why you think that\u2019s the case and whether you think its macro related or more specific to the brand metrics that you\u2019re seeing? Pat Grismer : David, this is Pat. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question and Greg will respond to the second part. So as to our expectations for full year, same store sales growth in China, at this stage of the year it still remains difficult to call. We\u2019ll certainly keep you updated as the year progresses, but certainly based on everything we\u2019ve seen to date and our forecast balance of the year, full year same store sales growth in China could be in the low single digits. We do expect both KFC and Pizza Hut same store sales growth to turn strongly positive as we lap the initial impact of the OSI publicity later this month. This will fuel a strong second half for China and enable us to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% for the year. Now I\u2019d also point out that from a profit perspective stronger than expected margin performance has offset the impact of the slower than expected sales recovery in China and we expect that this will continue through the balance of the year, thereby preserving our overall profit outlook. Greg Creed : So David, let me answer the second part of that question. I think the good news is that sales are recovering. We went from minus 12 to minus 10 despite a more difficult lap of plus 15. The good news is that the consumer metrics are improving trending in the right direction. As always, these are never linear unfortunately, but we do know that we compare this to previous recoveries. We\u2019re going in the right direction, making progress across the board. So I feel good and we remain obviously bullish on China. We continue to invest in China and I think as you know, these customer metrics are the harbinger of future sales performance. So I think with all that said, we remain very bullish and confident and continue to invest. Steve Schmitt : Thanks David. Next question please Jona. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Thank you very much. A follow up on that and then maybe an addition as well. Could you diagnose why specifically you think China was below your own expectations in the second quarter, especially given the customer metrics which have been trending up throughout the year? And secondly, it is clear that with it being a little bit below your expectations and perhaps a tweak down in the comps in China for 2015, it is interesting to juxtapose that with the China margin numbers going up. So just a philosophical question is, why not reinvest some of that margin to regain the traffic or in other words, how confident are you that the focus on margin is in a reason in and of itself why comps might be slightly below expectations. Greg Creed : Yes, I think the slower than expected recovery \u2013 remember we\u2019ve had two safety issues, which we\u2019ve never had before alright, so we\u2019ve never been able to model two safety issues and there\u2019s obviously some slowness in recovering that. But there\u2019s been no impact on our customer metrics as we measure from an operating point of view and so I think in that sense we are going to continue to push aggressively. We need to be more innovative and the way I look at it is, with where we are today, Pat\u2019s giving you the right guidance, but we\u2019ve still got six months of the year to go and right now what I\u2019m trying to do is aggressively bring outside ideas from YUM! into China. As we said earlier, we\u2019ve got really a number of that KFC businesses on file, whether that\u2019s Russia, the UK, Australia or South Africa and I think there\u2019s a number of product innovations, there\u2019s a number of valued plays that those markets have played and I\u2019m very confident that we can bring those to bear. And that said, I still expect a strong second half in China. Sales will go positive, we will continue to make progress and I think we can bring the power of YUM! to bear by taking those ideas from those powerhouse countries and have China test those. Pat Grismer : And John, this is Pat. I\u2019ll just add a couple of other comments, which is that we feel very good about the productivity gains that the team has made in China. We believe that they are sustainable as Greg mentioned. They\u2019ve not impacted customer service levels and frankly what they\u2019ve effectively done is strengthen the underlying unit level economics, which not only gives us continued confidence to invest at the rate that we are behind new unit development, but also reinforces our belief that as sales recovers that we\u2019ll see significant profit leverage in the business. Greg Creed : Yes, I mean if I was to make one last comment I\u2019d say we need to balance value with innovation and there is no doubt innovating our way out of this is the best way to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to stay focused on. Steve Schmitt : Thanks John. Jona, our next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : Thanks. Good morning. First on China comps, yes so the recent decline in the Chinese stock market had any impact on sales. Do you notice a correlation there at all? Pat Grismer : We don\u2019t. John, this is Pat. John we don\u2019t see a correlation. We think actually a very small percentage of customers have been impacted by that as to whether or not it is impacted broader consumer confidence, we have no reason to believe it at this stage if that is the case. John Glass : Greg, if I could ask one more. Greg, you did open up and you talked about the possibility of this China spin notion. I know you don\u2019t want it to be a distraction. Do you view that as a distraction in and of itself for the recovery of China, so that you might want to wait till China recovers before entertaining that idea? Greg Creed : I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we don\u2019t want to talk about it. Obviously we review our shareholder proposals, but I can assure you the China team is focused on one thing; their number one priority and my number one priority is getting China sales back into sort of stronger growth. Steve Schmitt : Thanks John. Jona the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open. Diane Geissler : Good morning. Greg Creed : Good morning. Diane Geissler : So is it safe to assume that you've kept your guidance for the full year at at least 10% EPS growth because of the uncertainty around the China comp. Is that the biggest holdback despite the fact that the margin is so much better than you expected. And then also \u2013 I\u2019m going to let you answer that first. Pat Grismer : Hi Diana. This is Pat. Happy to respond to that question. I think what your implying is that maybe the full year guidance is conservative and I would say absolutely not and I do want to put it in perspective, because you have to bear in mind that we\u2019re at that midpoint of our year. EPS is down 7% and as I said in my prepared remarks earlier, to achieve full year growth of at least 10%, EPS needs to grow nearly 30% in the second half of the year and I don\u2019t think of that as an overly conservative number. Obviously it's heavily dependent on the results of our China division where profits were down about 30% in the first half of the year, and in order for China to deliver on its expected share of second half EPS growth, second half profits there need to be more than double of what they were last year. But we\u2019re confident China can deliver this result, but with 60% of their profits being generated in the second half, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent to adopt a more aggressive stance and lean in on this. Additionally as I mentioned, foreign exchange headwinds are much stronger than we had originally estimated, but this is factored into our overall EPS guidance. So I just want to make it very clear, we expect to have a strong second half based on continued progress in China and we fully expect to deliver at least 10% EPS growth for the year. Diane Geissler : Okay, thank you and then I wanted to ask on the comments about the new unit mix leaning more heavily on lower tier cities and also into the Pizza Hut franchise and home delivery. Can you talk a little bit about your development expectations for this year and even into next year in terms of what we should be thinking about KFC versus Pizza Hut versus Pizza Hut Home Delivery and then higher tier cities versus lower tier cities? Just trying to kind of frame that up. Pat Grismer : Certainly Diane. As I mentioned, our capital investment follows returns and so where we generate the higher returns is where we\u2019re directing more of our capital spending. That has been the case for the last few years and just to put it in perspective, for the quarter 60% or 62% of KFC new unit openings were in Tier III and below cities. Back in 2012 that number was 53%. So you\u2019ve seen a pretty significant shift there and then as it relates to Pizza Hut Casual Dining for the quarter, that business accounted for 35% of total division new unit openings. In 2012 that number was 24%. You can expect that those trends will continue, because again that\u2019s where we see the stronger returns and our capital investment will follow the returns. I\u2019m not going to give preliminary guidance for 2016 as it relates to either number of units or the mix of units, but I will tell you that we\u2019ll continue to direct more of our capital investment money towards the higher return opportunities, which at the moment are with Pizza Casual Dining and for the KFC business in the lower tier cities. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Diane. Diane Geissler : Thank you. Pat Grismer : Next question please Jona. Operator : Your next question comes from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks. Could we talk a little bit about the marketing and menu news from China in particular and how do you think that new menu is performing at KFC China and any data points would be helpful with the impact to your marketing, even as we look into 3Q. Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes, I think as we said David, obviously we saw sequential improvement from minus 12 to minus 10. The new menu items are accounting for that 15% of sales, so they certainly got traction with the customers. I think that\u2019s also another good data point and I think the consumer metrics continue to show improvement. So I think you look at our continuous improvement. You look at the percentage of mix from these new items and you look at the continued improvement in our consumer metrics and I think that all bodes well. As Pat has said that we will have a strong second half. We will go into positive same store sales growth and I remain completely confident. Now can we take ideas from around the world between now and the end of the year and test those? Yes. Do I still have the sense of urgency? Yes. Could we do things more speedy? Yes. So as you probably expect, that\u2019s occurring and that\u2019s why we\u2019re at the half year mark and there\u2019s still plenty of time for us to still evolve and tinker with the calendar between now and the end of the year. David Palmer : Is there anything specific that you learned that you think weren\u2019t tweaking that you could call out from the first half; things that worked and didn\u2019t work? Greg Creed : The other way I look at it, there\u2019s some great products outside of China that are doing very well, whether it\u2019s the UK, Australia, South Africa or Russia. So what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve put the China team obviously in direct contact with those businesses and I know that a number of those ideas are currently being contested in China as we speak. So it\u2019s been more that I\u2019ve seen some really powerful ideas outside of China that I think have relevance in China and then I\u2019d really ask the China team to concept test those and if necessary we\u2019ll make changes to the calendar in the back half of the year. David Palmer : Thank you. Steve Schmitt : Thanks David. Jona, next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Joseph Buckley : Thank you. A couple of questions on China as well. Do you think that the slower than expected sales trend, do you still relate it to the Shanghai Husi Incident or you think its related to broader things happening in China, whether competitively or just somewhat slower growth. Pat Grismer : Joe, this is Pat. I think it is fair to say that what the brand or the brands are recovering from is the incident from last year, because that\u2019s what had the dramatic impact to sales starting in the middle of last year and we are continuing to recover from that. I think it\u2019s also fair to say as we have said on previous calls and at our investor conference that the environment in China has changed in terms of becoming more competitive and so consumers do have more choice. That has raised the bar on us to innovate more than we have in the past, to keep pace with changing Chinese consumer and to continue to move even more aggressively on things like digital. So I think it is fait to say that the environment has changed, but that we are changing in response to that. Greg Creed : And just if I can build on that Joe, we have markets that are much more competitive than China that we compete in and we compete very successfully and so again we can use YUM! now to share where we\u2019ve been very successful, in markets that have even probably two or three time the amount of competition. We can bring that knowhow to bear, to help the China team as they obviously move to more rapidly improve this out performance. Joseph Buckley : Do you have a sense of what the Chinese restaurant market as a whole is doing? Has that slowed significantly also? Greg Creed : I don\u2019t. I mean that\u2019s \u2013 no I don\u2019t have\u2026 Pat Grismer : No, I mean I think that generally the economy is growing at a slower pace. So it\u2019s fair to say that and that that is putting pressure on retail generally. I think we also need to bear in mind that with GDP growing this year at around 7%, it remains the fastest growing large economy in the world. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Joe. Next question please Jona. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thanks very much. My question is I think I\u2019m just a little confused on why there is kind of a tone change in the way you\u2019re talking about how sales are tracking versus your expectations. Just because your gains for the second quarter was for a sequential improvement, you did that. We haven\u2019t even started lapping the July 20 fall off in the business yet. That comes in a week. Is there\u2019s something that\u2019s happened say in June since the quarter end that\u2019s causing the tone change or were you expectations for the quarter just a significant sequential improvement relative to what occurred. Pat Grismer : Brian, this is Pat. Nothing specific that has changed to drive that. Just as we step back and we look at the performance in the first half of the year, it\u2019s fair to say that same store sales while recovering, haven\u2019t been recovering at the pace that we had originally anticipated. Thankfully we are seeing that offset through improved productivity in the stores and those margin gains are therefore muting the profit impact of this lower than expected sales recovery. But make no mistake, the sales recovery is happening, not only based on what we see in terms of same store sales and the fact that in the second quarter we lapped a harder comp, so we got sequential improvement on top of lapping a harder comp. But also based on what we see in our key consumer metrics, which as Greg mentioned are a leading indicator of where sales will go. But we felt that it was important to acknowledge that sales are progressing at a slower than expected pace and that is factored into our full year EPS guidance of at least 10%. Greg Creed : But I think I want to make sure everyone understands, we still expect a very strong second half and that we will deliver at least 10% for the full year. Brian Bittner : And you also mentioned \u2013 am I still here with you guys? Steve Schmitt : Yes, go ahead Brian. Brian Bittner : You also mentioned that same store sales in China could be low singles for the year, which would still imply double digit comps in the second half. Is the confidence behind that just the way the core trends accelerated from the first and second quarter, like on a two and three year basis, because that\u2019s what ultimately gives you the most confidence in double digit one year comps in the second half. Pat Grismer : Well, you\u2019re right that we do expect the very strong same store sales growth in the second half, particularly as we lapped last year\u2019s OSI incident and there are multiple indicators that substantiate this view; one year, two year, three year, four year comps for KFC. We look at absolute transaction volumes on a de-seasonalized basis, we look at key consumer metrics, which again are all moving in the right direction. So all of that together giving us confidence that we\u2019ll get the second half bounce back necessary to achieve the profit growth objectives in China, which underpin at least 10% EPS growth for the year. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Brian. Jana, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is opened. Jason West : Yes, thanks guys. I\u2019m not sure how much you\u2019re willing to talk about the other structural ideas, but the idea of recapitalizing the balance sheet has come up, particularly given the substantial franchise assets you guys have and I\u2019m just wondering, if you could give your updated thoughts on that particular as you move towards sort of a 95% franchise mix outside of China. Does that start to change your thinking around the capital structure and then also looking at what\u2019s happening across some of your franchise peers? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Jason, this is Pat. No change to our policy, which is to optimize our capital structure based on what we believe is in the best interest of shareholders, which is to maintain that low investment grade credit rating and so our policy hasn\u2019t changed and no specific guidance as to what that capital structure might look like when we complete the three year refranchising program we announced in December. Jason West : Okay, but even as a more franchise business you would still like to keep that in investment grade. Pat Grismer : Well, we look at our capital structure from an enterprise perspective. We don\u2019t segment our balance sheet according to one part of the business versus another. So we have to bear in mind that in our China business we have a substantial equity presence with all of the operating leases, which function as virtual debt if you will, which plays into how we optimize our overall capital structure for our shareholders. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Jason. Jana, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi, just a couple of questions on Pizza Hut. So I guess you\u2019ve taken some aggressive stances with your value positioning more recently, but I guess it doesn\u2019t seem to be resonating with the customer or maybe asked another way, do you think it\u2019s a value issue, a trial issue, a frequency issue or anything else, because obviously your peers are generally doing extremely well. Greg Creed : Yes, Karen, thank you for asking a non-China question. In all seriousness, if our peers actually are performing, I think there is no one silver bullet to this solution. You saw us in the quarter playing at more stronger value which actually over the quarter did show improvement across the quarter\u2019s performance and I expect that to continue going into the second half of the year. But this is a sort of total relook, which is we have to have assets to be upgraded. We have to have the compelling value, we have to have compelling innovations, we have to deliver superior experience. We have to improve our e-commerce digital experience. So there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s got to get done. I\u2019m very confident in the team that\u2019s in place to make that happen. We\u2019ve got some new people onto the team in Pizza Hut, so we\u2019ve invested in areas like digital, marketing, food innovation, e-commerce. As we said on the call, we\u2019re actually getting into big data analytics and we\u2019re really starting to see some early signs of \u2013 I think that will help us position the brand better and actually really understand where the business has gone to. So it\u2019s holistic, we\u2019re on it, we\u2019ve brought people into it. I\u2019m very comfortable and happy with the leadership that we\u2019ve got in place to deliver on it. We\u2019re not happy with the progress, but we are making progress and I think you\u2019ll see us continuing to make more progress as the year unfolds. Karen Short : Great. Thanks. Greg Creed : Thanks Karen. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Karen. Next question Jana please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. Just unfortunately I wanted to get back on China for a second. Two things; one just on the comp. I\u2019m wondering as you looked at it perhaps slightly below expectation, whether you see it, maybe this performance by market or day card or weekend, weekday, I\u2019m just wondering as you slice that down 10%, which we can\u2019t do, is there any particular area of concern. Another question was just broadly on the positioning of the brand. I think most recently it kind of was focused a little bit more premium with motions and what not. I\u2019m just wondering whether the recent challenge is digital once again, maybe broaden that out, focus a little on value to retain that lower income consumer. Thanks. Pat Grismer : Hi Jeffery, this is Pat. I\u2019ll respond to your first question and Greg will answer the second. First, with respect to what we\u2019re seeing in the comps and whether when you look at various lengths of segmenting that we\u2019re seeing material differences, the only thing I would highlight is that we are seeing stronger performance in our Tier I cities at both brands. It seems that the Tier I consumers are less phased by the supplier publicity this time around and I would say that that\u2019s especially encouraging, because that\u2019s where we have a higher concentration of stores and also face the strongest competition. So I think that\u2019s further evidence of our brands ongoing recovery and resilience. There are some regional economies that are more dependent on industrial production and they are feeling more pressure from slower economic growth and we are seeing the effects of that in weaker sales performance in those regions, particularly in some lower tier cities and in response to that KFCs recently launched regional promotions with 10 RMB Burger to help stimulate traffic. That\u2019s the only thing that really bears mentioning in terms of any variations in comps across the entire market. Greg Creed : So just to talk about the positioning, I think yes, we probably have to find a better balance between innovation and value. Again, if I go back to the KFC markets that are really outperforming, whether it\u2019s Russia, Australia, South Africa or the UK, what you will see in those markets is we have great entry price points, we have great value for money, we have really chicken focused innovation and we are really doing disruptive things in the markets place. So, I think that \u2013 and then we have, I guess it also goes without saying we have great leaders running those business as well. So I think that we are going to have to find more balance, but I am very confident that we can find that balance and I am very confident that we have got the ideas and resources around YUM! in order to accomplish that. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Jeff. Next question please Jana. Operator : Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I have two follow-up questions. One is about Pizza Hut and one is, not to belabor the point, also about China. So on Pizza Hut, could you just talk about the developed markets outside the U.S. and in particular diagnose maybe are the issues the same out there, is it stepped up competition, digital value marketing. Just so I kind of understand, because it feels like broadly the brand sort of stepped back a little back in the last couple of quarters. And then the follow-up on China is really one about timing. And I guess you laid out sort of $600 million in EBITDA which is a big number, but its less impressive as it takes 5 years to materialize and so do you have internally a sense of at what point you decide, okay this business may not go back to peak volumes and likewise, how long do you decide when you are looking at strategic alternatives, how long do you give yourselves to make decisions. So I\u2019m just trying to frame timing from both fundamental and strategic standpoints. Greg Creed : Let me answer the first part of the question. I think with our Pizza business, strong U.S. \u2013 I\u2019ll say strong global business, there is no doubt about that. So having said that, I think that outside the United States our assets are in much better shape than they are in the United States, but I do think in terms of things like value, e-commerce and digital we need to accelerate our progress in those areas. So I think our assets are in great shape, I think our food quality is in great shape. I think the food innovation is in great shape, but there is no doubt that I think value, as well as the whole customer experience and e-commence are areas that we need to make sure we remain competitive and as leaders in those places. Pat Grismer : And Sara, this is Pat. I\u2019ll respond to your second quarter as to the timing around recovering the $600 million in EBITDA. We\u2019ve never been specific as to a timeframe for that. What I want to let you know however is that we are absolutely confident that the business will return to those 2012 peak average unit volumes and we are absolutely confident based on the progress the team has made to improve unit level economics that as the sales recover there will be significant profit flow through on the sales. As to the timing of that, it\u2019s tough to call and I\u2019m not going to make a prediction based on that, nor am I going to talk about how that may play into the timing of any structural moves. Because our top priority regardless of what we do structurally is to bring that business back in terms of sales and profits and so that\u2019s why the focus is as Greg mentioned earlier, on more disruptive innovation, continued strong value offers, all the things that we need to do to make our brand positions even stronger and in an environment that has over time become more competitive. Steve Schmitt : Thanks. Jana next question please. Operator : The next question is Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open. Keith Siegner : So Pat, I\u2019m going to apologize, but I\u2019m going to follow-up a little bit on that. Look, margins in China have come in much better than you expected. You reiterated 20%, with the confidence in the 20% long term. We talk about this $600 million and that\u2019s not sure in this timing, but look when that timing would happen. But let me ask you in a different way; given the success and the productivity, initiatives and what you\u2019ve achieved on the margins, it would seem to me that you should be able to recover the 20% long before you recovery the PKUVs. Is there any reason why that wouldn\u2019t be the case. Pat Grismer : No, I think that\u2019s a fair statement, because the underlying economics have gotten stronger. So as the sales come back, the flow-through will be at a much higher rate. Keith Siegner : That\u2019s it from me thanks. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Keith. Next question please, Jana. Operator : Yes, Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Karen Holthouse : Hi, I\u2019m actually going to not ask a question about a China, but instead look at the Taco Bell business in the U.S., where your tier trends continue to accelerate. Just thinking through the moving pieces of that, could you help us understand how much of that might be coming from \u2013 you still continue growth in the breakfast day part versus value versus any other specific products innovation. Greg Creed : I think the good news is the Taco Bell performance in the U.S. is holistic, which is it has great entry price point value. They\u2019ve had growth in breakfast from 6% to 7% mix, which I think takes it to like $90,000 and the West Cost the mix is now over 10%. The innovation that was run in the quarter was compelling, disruptive and the assets are in great shape, the customer experience is improving. It\u2019s holistic, its all of the things and at the same time obviously they are starting to experiment with things like delivery and on the cutting edge of that, the mobile app. I think everywhere you turn, this brand is so relevant to its target audience and I think so clearly positioned with products that are driven out of real consumer insights. I think that\u2019s why they\u2019ve had a great first half and that\u2019s why we remain confident about how they are a great second in obviously 2016 and beyond. Karen Holthouse : Great. Thank you. Steve Schmitt : Thank you, Karen. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Andrew Charles : Thanks. Two questions from me. First, if the key to the China term will be innovation and breakfast only represents 7% of sales, it seems to be performing well already. Why not double down efforts on lunch and dinner in the back half of the year and continue innovating on these day parts to turn China faster? Greg Creed : I think my answer would be having done this myself when I was running Taco Bell. You got to balance this out, which is you've got all these day parts that we are going to try and get growth from. And what we have seen in the past, even if we sort of over invest in certain areas, it\u2019s better to have a balance spend behind breakfast, lunch and dinner and then even if you\u2019ve got enough money, you know the day parts like late night and snaking, right. So I think that this is \u2013 we\u2019ve got great product, we are putting the right amount of resource behind it. We got the current promotion on the wing bucket which is off to a nice start and I think this balanced investment behind all the day parts is the right way for us to invest in the business. Pat Grismer : Andrew, this is Pat, I would just build on Greg\u2019s comments by highlighting the important role that coffee will play in building multiple day parts. So while it\u2019s an important part of our breakfast day part, it also contributes to afternoon tea time and it contributes to late night and we are very excited with the results we are seeing from coffee and how its lifted sales as the 2,000 units that have already gotten the coffee, the premium coffee program that we will expanding that to more units by the end of year. Andrew Charles : Got you. So far this year there has been a seasonally high amount of KFC China store closures. Are these stores \u2013 how would you categorize them? Are they primarily located in Tier 1, Tier 2. I mean, what\u2019s driving the decision to close these stores rather than refranchise them? Pat Grismer : Well, this is Pat, Andrew. We make those closure decisions one unit at a time. It\u2019s not always a function of underperformance. There may be forced closures due to \u2013 we come upon the end of a lease and were unable to renew on favorable terms. So there could be a variety of things driving that, but we don\u2019t expect a substantial increase in KFC closures for the full year versus last year, and in fact we expect total closures to be slightly down versus last year, because last year\u2019s number was propped by substantial consolidation of the Little Sheep estate. Greg Creed : Thanks Andrew. Steve Schmitt : Next question please Jana. Operator : Jeff Farmer has your next question with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Thank you and sorry Greg to keep hitting you in on China. But the last time KFC China saw a rapid same store sales recovery. Concept has a sizable mix in menu pricing tailwind where it looks like mix alone represented more than half of that 21% same store sales growth. The concept is still in the second quarter \u201914. So with that, how should we be thinking about the role mix and menu pricing are expected to play in the China same store sales recovery in the coming quarters. And to that point, have you already begun to see the return of the higher average family visits that were a big benefit a year ago in the recovery process. Pat Grismer : Jeff, this is Pat and I\u2019ll respond to your question and Greg may add some things. But from the same recovery standpoint, our focus is primarily on traffic, its rebuilding traffic. From a pricing perspective our policy is unchanged, which is that we generally look to pricing to work with productivity to offset inflation. We are very conscious of the important role that value plays in building traffic over time. So we wouldn\u2019t expect mix to be an outsized contributor to sales growth going forward. The emphasis will be more on traffic driven through a combination of value and innovation. Greg Creed : I would just echo that, which is this is going to be a balance of disruptive innovation and value and I think the combination of those is exactly what we need to focus on. Jeff Farmer : Just a quick follow-up, where does pricing stand right now, menu pricing, actually heading into the back half of \u201915. Steve Schmitt : Jeff, this is Steve. Pricing is about 3% and that should be pretty consistent through the year and just another data point on your question. The quarter check was relatively flat. It was up about 2%, but it is primarily driven by transactions. Jeff Farmer : All right, thank you. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Jeff, Jana, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open. R.J. Hottovy: Thanks. I actually had a question on India. Obviously, it's a small part of the business today, but one that you've spoken about in the past having a great long-term potential. You've now had three quarters of double-digit comp declines in the region. Just curious what's driving that, and if that's changing some of your thinking about long-term unit potential in the region. Thanks. Greg Creed : I think we remain very bullish on India. In the long term there is no reason not to \u2013 there is massive population and urbanization of that population and there is obviously underlying economic growth. I think that we did expect \u2013 I think with the Modi government change that there might be a sort of perceptible change in consumer perception and I guess that probably hasn\u2019t had, we haven\u2019t seen that. What I like is that, we have an incredibility strong team in India and I have to say they are probably the best team we have at building knowhow. The Indian team do not suffer from not invented here and they are really aggressively learning what we got and what is working as I said in countries like Australia, South Africa, the UK and Russia. And they are already concept testing and they recognize that value remains an issue; entry price point value remains an issue and obviously innovation, so the same things we keep talking about. But what I want to give them credit for is really reaching out to the rest of YUM!, building knowhow, taking the advise back into India and with a real sense of urgency, actually putting them into the market place. So I\u2019m long term bullish. I love the team and I think they are doing all the right things in order to accelerate the sort of improved momentum in same store sales. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Jana, I think we have one more question. Operator : Yes, your final question is Paul Westra with Stifel. Your line is open. Paul Westra : Great. Thank you very much. Just for some clarity on China, maybe help here with the last question. When you say that the comp performance is a little bit below expectations, you mean below your original positive 3% to 7%, so your comments today saying comps could be in the low single digit positives. Second-half comps are still looking to be more positive than the first half that was negative. I just wanted to make sure that's clear. Pat Grismer : That is correct. Greg Creed : Absolutely correct, Paul. Paul Westra : Great. And then when you mentioned your transaction trends on a DC line basis continue to sequentially improve, you are seeing sequential, again month-to-month traffic recovery versus\u2026 Pat Grismer : Paul I wouldn\u2019t say month-to-month, certainly quarter-to-quarter. We never said that the recovery was going to be linier and so there is natural choppiness from month-to-month, but as we step back and look at how traffic has rebuilt since the incident last summer, we are seeing a nice steady improvement in that curve. Paul Westra : Okay. I guess then my last sort of new real question, I guess go back to the color on your China average check strategy, I guess maybe before the dual crises. My understanding and I know part of the renovation program was if anything designed to enhance KFC's sort of premium brand positioning maybe moved the check up of all things being equal, move people up the menu, we certainly can understand the focus on traffic here. Is that still a sort of latent opportunity intermediate-term or how does that play in I guess the new menu here? Greg Creed : Paul, I think there\u2019s a couple of things; one, the amount of remodeling going on in China is accelerating. I enjoy what\u2019s coming and I think they are on the way for us to be much more focused on our remodeling of the assets. So the good news is we are sort of doubling the number of assets we are getting remodeled. So that is a great way of keeping our assets relative and then I think it\u2019s just back to the point we\u2019ve been making along, which is about balance. We actually have to balance the pay menu with what I call disruptive innovation and wow value and I think our ability to do that, as well as it will improve the assets and obviously deliver a superior customer experience. All of those combined will be what sort of makes us long term successful and as we keep saying yes, we will have a strong second half, we will go positive. We remain very confident in the long term of China. Steve Schmitt : Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today and this concludes our call. Thank you. Greg Creed : Thanks everybody. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And with that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Delivering 14% EPS growth in today\u2019s environment would normally be considered a very good result. But these are not normal times and our performance is anything but satisfactory. I know that you all want to hear about China today and have many questions that we are going to answer for you. But before I spend most of my time today on China, I do want to talk about the performance of our three global brands. Taco Bell, as you have rightfully come to expect, had another great quarter. Same store sales growth of 4% rolled over plus 3% from a year ago and with another 3% sales growth from new units. Year-to-date, this has doubled the number of new units from last year and margins are now over 21%. This brand is doing all the right things in all the right places. KFC had another solid quarter. Same store sales growth of plus 3% with another 3% from new units. We saw notable standout performance in Australia, Russia and Japan and some underperformance versus trend for South Africa and the UK. While KFC in the U.S. is still a small component of the global brand, it continued a steady progress with transactions plus 4% to the category, as the innovation pipeline is now starting to be a force. Pizza Hut was relatively flat, which we could argue was pretty much in line with expectations. But let\u2019s be honest; we\u2019re still significantly lagging the performance of our nearest competitors and we clearly have much urgent work to do for this brand to fulfill its potential, which brings me on to what we all want to talk about which is China. Let me start by being really clear. We all and I personally take full accountability for our results in China. And while there is clearly a macro softening going on including headwinds from unexpected foreign exchange pressures and yes, the online ordering aggregators who are delivering for mom and pops are in a death battle for supremacy with heavy discounting and the malls look more like fancy food courts than shopping centers, the simple facts are that the economy there is still growing and there is every reason and no excuses to why we should not perform better. I also want you to know that our new China CEO Micky Pant and his team also get it and as I\u2019ll detail are taking significant measures to get sales, traffic and profits back to historic levels. If I step back and look at our own research and independent research, they both show that KFC and Pizza Hut have very strong positions. KFC is the undisputed leader in QSR and Pizza Hut owns western casual dining. And both own the hearts and minds of the Chinese customer. And as I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say again, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anyone. So the obvious question is what\u2019s going on; why is this taking way too long to recover and in particular, what happened over the past six to seven weeks, particularly in Pizza Hut casual dining? Let me start with KFC, which did see sequential improvement and is on trend to continue that improvement into the fourth quarter and beyond. With Micky Pant now at the helm, we have a fresh set of eyes and we are taking the following immediate actions. First, we are sharpening our brand positioning and we will position and market KFC as the unequivocal Chinese favorite; always original, always Chinese. Second, we are rejuvenating the product pipeline and dramatically improving our discipline and effectiveness around products testing. We have also begun to test new simplified menu boards that will speed up the ordering process and importantly return and celebrate our core chicken products. Third, we will introduce more disruptive value innovation. We will drive transactions, which we know we can do profitably with box meals and day of the week specials, like we have done in the rest of the world. And fourth, we will take our proven pipeline of successful chicken innovation from around the world and adapt it to Chinese taste. Both Micky and are confident that these actions will reinvigorate the KFC brand and help us fully recover and more over time. So, this leads me to Pizza Hut casual dining in China. Historically we have delivered amazing growth by revamping 25% of our menu every six months. However, it\u2019s clear to all that recent promotions have not performed at historical levels and let me give you a couple of examples. In mid-August, we launched a premium-priced steak product, in hindsight, just as the macro started to weaken. Furthermore in recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen companies cut back on parties, dinners and entertaining. So, while our weekend business is going okay, this has impacted our weekday dinner results significantly. So what we are doing about it? We are adding a weekday value dinner promotion on top of the scheduled menu revamp that starts October 19th. And if I look back at our previous success, it\u2019s when we\u2019ve offered five-star service at three-star prices. The calendar this year has had things that are more like six-star products such as fajitas and premium steak at six-star pricing at a time when consumers are seeking value. So, we are going to get back to what made us great five-star pizza, pasta and wings at three-star pricing.  I know that we are rightly in show me time versus tell me time. But I\u2019m confident that our current performance is no indication of our future potential and that our best days are still ahead across China, India in the three global brands. So, in conclusion for Yum!, this is proving to be a more challenging second half driven by a slower recovery in China and the foreign exchange headwinds. However, we believe in the long-term strength of our company. As further evidence of this, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend last night. This marks the 11th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend at a double-digit rate. In summary, we are in a unique position at Yum! with three category leading brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused on the three keys to driving shareholder value : New unit development, same-store sales growth, and generating high returns on invested capital. We believe this combination of efforts will enable us to generate consistent shareholder value in the years ahead. Now, before I hand this over to Pat, some of you may want to ask today about our views around corporate structure and whether any of the news we\u2019ve shared with you today has any bearing on how we think about our company. The fact is we have a great collection of businesses and they have produced excellent results over the long-term. As I\u2019ve said before, the Yum! Board of Directors regularly reviews strategic options to optimize long-term shareholder value including those involving our corporate structure. We are not going to comment today on any strategic options with our company. As usual, we will discuss our growth plans for 2016 and long-term strategies at our investor conference in December and I hope we will see you there. And with that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Pat. Pat Grismer : Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results and share some details behind our current full year outlook. As Greg mentioned, Taco Bell continues to be strong, KFC is solid and Pizza Hut remains in turnaround mode. But the big story is our China Division which is recovering but obviously and disappointingly at a much slower pace than we previously expected. Recent week sales in China have significantly dampened our balance of year outlook, particularly at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. I\u2019ll spend a fair bit of time on China. But to quickly recap financial results for the third quarter, earnings per share excluding special items increased 14%, a marked improvement from the 7% EPS decline we delivered in the first half of the year. Same-store sales not only turned positive in China but were also positive in all three of our global brand divisions. Worldwide restaurant margins at company owned stores were 18%, an increase of 3 percentage points versus prior year. Foreign currency translation adversely impacted our EPS growth by nearly 6 percentage points in the quarter including an unexpected devaluation of the RMB in mid-August. Here are the highlights of each division\u2019s results and the implications for full year performance. China Division operating profit increased by 64% prior to foreign currency translation with restaurant margins approaching 20%, nearly 5 percentage points better than last year. The China team continued to do an excellent job of managing costs and I\u2019m confident that the team\u2019s sustained productivity improvements will yield meaningful profit upside as sales recover over the long term. As expected, sales turned significantly positive as we lapped last year\u2019s supplier incident which occurred in late July, specifically in the first seven weeks of the third quarter leading up to the supplier incident lap, same-store sales for the division averaged minus 11% and then for the next four weeks averaged plus 31%, representing a 42-point swing to the positive, giving us optimism that the recovery was underway. For the entire quarter, same-store sales grew 2% for the division including 3% growth at KFC and a 1% decline at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. So that\u2019s the past but what about the future, more specifically now that we are in the fifth week of China\u2019s fourth quarter, how are China sales trending and how does that shape our perspective on full year results; and as importantly how could we have missed our previous forecast by so much? I\u2019ll answer both questions. Encouragingly, KFC same-store sales in China are continuing to recover as evidenced by our most recent sales results. As a point of reference, KFC China\u2019s same-store sales were plus 9% for the month of September which is the first month in China\u2019s fourth quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect Q4 will be another quarter of sequential improvement for KFC in China. To be clear however, this recovery is occurring at a slower pace than we previously estimated and this is weighing on our prior outlook for fourth quarter results. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, the situation is much more severe and impactful. In late August and continuing into September, we witnessed a very substantial deceleration in same-store sales versus our forecast. The loss of sales momentum is causing significant deleverage in our Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, which represents about a third of China Division profits. Based on our current assessment, we believe the drivers are three-fold: Number one, extraordinary volatility in financial markets, the surprise currency devaluation and overall softer economic conditions are weighing more heavily on the higher ticket casual dining sector in China. Number two; we are experiencing what we believe is a short-term but significant impact of online ordering aggregators entering the casual dining space. And number three and most importantly, our marketing promotions materially underperformed our expectations, as Greg said and we lost significant momentum in the business which we\u2019re now working to recover and believe we can fix. We did not foresee this confluence of events and quite frankly we are very surprised by the business trends that began to unfold at the end of August. As another point of reference, Pizza Hut Casual Dining same-store sales were actually down 3% for the month of September, demonstrating a very rapid downturn in the business. This was 25 points below our previous expectations, a major miss and something we didn\u2019t see coming in August. Based on current trends now about one-third of the way into China\u2019s fourth quarter, we expect Pizza Hutt Casual Dining sales in China will remain negative through the end of the year possibly into low double digits. On that basis, we now estimate the China Division same-store sales will be mid-single-digit positive for the fourth quarter and low-single-digit negative for the full year. This is obviously a very disappointing result and well below our previous expectations even as the China team is working with urgency to improve sales momentum at both KFC and Pizza Hut. So what\u2019s our current outlook -- so that\u2019s our current outlook but why didn\u2019t we forecast this. As I mentioned earlier, the deceleration in China sales was led by Pizza Hut and the drivers behind that decline emerged very rapidly and without much warning. In today\u2019s volatile environment with the recent macro and competitive pressures we mentioned, it continues to be difficult to forecast sales in China for both brands. We make our best judgment at any point in time based on the information available. We will provide another update on China sales at our investor meeting in December. Turning to our KFC Global Division, we saw another quarter of growth in sales, margin and profit prior to foreign currency translation. Sales were particularly strong in Australia, Japan and Russia and we were pleased with same-store sales growth of 2% in the U.S. as it included same-store transaction growth of 3%, demonstrating continued improvement in this business. These results were partially offset by softer sales in South Africa, Thailand and the UK. Despite the benefit of sales leverage, division operating margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to increased advertising expense associated with our U.S. turnaround program which also impacted the division\u2019s profit growth by 2 percentage points in the quarter. Division operating margins were also impacted by 1 percentage point due to strategic investments in G&A and increased pension expense. All in, KFC\u2019s operating profit grew 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Importantly, KFC new unit development remains strong with 335 new international restaurants opened year to date. And on a net basis, we\u2019ve opened over 40% more new international restaurants in the first three quarters of 2015 versus 2014. This gives us great confidence in the strength of the KFC brand and its growth oriented franchisees. At Pizza Hut, same-store sales grew 1% including growth of 4% in emerging markets offset by flat sales in developed markets including the U.S. Total operating profit excluding foreign exchange was unchanged versus last year, despite same-store sales growth and lower cheese prices; this is primarily due to strategic investments in international G&A. As Greg mentioned, we clearly have our work cut out for us to Pizza Hut. However we are taking positive steps and making necessary investments to improve Pizza Hut\u2019s brand position, operations and digital experience. From an international development prospective, we opened 105 new units in the quarter, bringing our year to date number to 206. Finally, Taco Bell continued to post excellent results with same-store sales growth of 4%, overlapping 3% growth from last year. A strong combination of value and innovation drove this result. We were also pleased with the performance of our breakfast daypart which contributed 6% sales mix and gives us a great platform from which to grow. Restaurant level margins of 22% were 140 basis points better than a year ago helped by a tailwind in commodities as beef and cheese prices had both declined about 13%. From a development perspective, we opened 111 net new restaurants year to date which is nearly double our number at this point last year and demonstrates a compelling economic model and strong franchisee investment in the brand. So, how does all of this ladder up to a revised full year outlook? I\u2019ll start by acknowledging that this is well below our previous guidance led by a much lower sales outlook at Pizza Casual Dining in China and exacerbated by incremental foreign exchange pressure. As outlined earlier, we now estimate the China division same-store sales will be low single digit negative for the full year. As a result, we expect China Division\u2019s full year profits will grow versus prior year in the mid to high single digits excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Collectively, our global brand divisions are largely in line with our previous expectations with better than expected performance at Taco Bell compensating for lower than expected performance at Pizza Hut. And finally, stronger than expected foreign exchange headwinds including the mid-August R&D devaluation are putting an incremental 1 to 2 percentage points of pressure on our EPS growth rate for the year. On a full year basis, we now expect foreign exchange in total to be about 6 percentage points of EPS headwind, significantly more than what we expected as we entered the year and the most pressure that we\u2019ve ever experienced in the history of our company. With all of this in mind, we are lowering our guidance for 2015 and now expect EPS growth to be low single digit positive. To be clear, the key drivers are a significant reduction in China sales and a meaningful increase in foreign exchange headwinds, neither of which we saw coming at the time of our last forecast update. In terms of new unit development, we expect to open about 2,000 units outside the U.S. this year. Now, I know many of you are wondering why we are continuing to open new restaurants in China at a fairly rapid pace and I\u2019ll share a point of view on that because we continue to expect about 700 new unit openings in China this year. First of all, cash paybacks in our current new units across both KFC and Pizza Hut continue to be in the range of 3 to 4 years which we believe provides an attractive return on invested capital. Obviously this assumes that current conditions are temporary which is what we strongly believe and are continuing to monitor. Now when it comes to development, we take a long-term view of the growth opportunity in China which despite recent volatility, continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world with strong long-term tailwinds for the restaurant industry including a doubling of the consuming class. When you step back and look at what the industry will be 10 to 20 years from now, we believe we are still in the early innings. We have leading brands with strong competitive positions and unmatched development capability in this market. Remember, new unit development has been a number one driver of China Division profit growth over the years and we expect this to be the case in the future. And one thing we know about development is that once you lose momentum in terms of indentifying and securing retail sites it\u2019s tough to regain it. Now, don\u2019t think we have our head in the sand regarding recent results in their implications for development. We absolutely take account of these results and evaluate each new unit development opportunity in a very disciplined fashion. And we are certainly taking a very close look at the situation that is unfolded at Pizza Casual Dining and determining how that may impact near term development plans, similar to how we scale back on KFC development in recent years. At the same time, we are just getting started with Pizza Hut home service and continue to be confident that Chinese consumer demand for delivered meals will rise rapidly. We are still in the process of shaping our plans for 2016, so it\u2019s premature to give guidance for next year\u2019s development in China. However it\u2019s quite possible that we will temper the pace of Pizza Casual Dining development until we are absolutely sure that we have a solid understanding of what\u2019s happening with the brand and how that may impact our investment returns for the long run. We will provide an update on this at our December investor conference. Outside of China and India, nearly 90% of our new units this year will be opened by our franchise partners. And we are building momentum around the world to evolve to the more franchise owned model we talked about at last year\u2019s investor conference. This refranchising activity will gain momentum over the next couple of years and will vary by brand but in the aggregate we still expect to achieve a mid-90s franchise ownership percentage by the end of 2017 excluding China and India. Before I conclude, I\u2019d like to point out that our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated EBITDA of almost $2 billion and importantly, we remain disciplined in how we use this cash and have a good track record of returning all available cash to our shareholders. As evidence of this, we announced the 12% increase in our quarterly dividend last night. As Greg mentioned, this marks the 11th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend at a double-digit rate. With this latest increase, we also raised our long-term dividend payout target to 45% to 50% of annual net income before special items. You might have also read about some good news we received from Moody\u2019s recently. With the change in their rating methodology whereby they\u2019ve reduced imputed debt from eight times annual rent expense to six times annual rent expense, we\u2019ve gained nearly $2 billion of additional debt capacity while maintaining our investment grade credit rating with Moody\u2019s. We\u2019re pleased with this decision and our evaluating its implications for our capital structure holistically. We\u2019ve consistently been very disciplined about optimizing our capital structure for our shareholders and as usual, we\u2019ll talk about our capital structure and any potential changes at our investor conference in December. So in conclusion, 2015 is now on a very different trajectory than we have previously expected, largely due to slower than expected sales in China, particularly at Pizza Casual Dining and higher than expected pressure from foreign exchange. However, we remain confident in the long-term health of our business, we have a past double-digit EPS growth and we look forward to sharing our plans to get our whole business back on track in 2016 at our December investor meeting. And with that, I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks, good morning. I realized you\u2019re going to be reticent to talk about structure changes with the business but I mean one fundamental observation about Yum! today is that the last three years have been one where the company is no longer hitting the 10% plus EPS growth, the combination of growth rate and consistency is broken down. Thinking about Yum! going forward, obviously structure change could be part of the solution there but if the company doesn\u2019t make a structure change as you\u2019re observing the business today, what can you do to restore the consistency in growth? Greg Creed : So David, let me just start, I think as you know, over the last three years particularly in China, we had two food safety incidents and obviously we\u2019ve had marketing missteps. So clearly, what we got to do is primarily turn around China. I think where we do perform well, we\u2019ve got the following in place, we\u2019ve got very clear brand positioning, we have insight driven product innovation, we have disruptive value, we have upgraded assets, we have social, mobile and digital at the cutting edge and we deliver the customer a superior experience. So we know those are the things that when we deliver, we deliver outstanding results. So, I think the thing we have to do in all the divisions is to get back and execute against those basics. So that\u2019s what I got the organization absolutely focused on. So my number one priority is to turn around China using all of those I guess tools or directions that I\u2019ve just articulated. David Palmer : And just a follow-up on the China business that low double-digit decline for Pizza Hut, if that\u2019s in the low 20s percent of that China business, that low double-digit decline would imply the mid-single-digit system same-store sales something like mid teens comp for the KFC brand. Is that math about right and how do you feel about the two-year trend and the momentum on the KFC China side? Pat Grismer : David that math actually isn\u2019t right. We\u2019re expecting mid-single-digit same-store sales positive for KFC -- for the division, excuse me, in the fourth quarter. So with negative same-store sales for Pizza Hut, they could be in the low double-digits. The KFC number could be in the range of high single-digits to low double-digits. David Palmer : Okay, thank you. And how do you feel about that momentum on a two-year basis or just -- versus your plan before is KFC part of this guide down at all? Pat Grismer : Well obviously, it\u2019s well below our previous outlook. There is no question whether you look at a one-year or two-year or three-year relative to where we were as of our Q2 earnings call, there has been a substantial reduction in overall momentum. The important thing is that the recovery is continuing with KFC, albeit at a slower than expected pace and we have evidence of that. The real issue we have is with Pizza Hut Casual Dining where we saw a very sudden and sharp deceleration take shape at the end of August and persist now into the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Karen Holthouse : Looking at the unit growth in China instead of the comp growth, we\u2019ve seen another tick up in unit closures at KFC. Can we just get a little bit more color on where those are coming from? Is it more, higher tier cities or you might be coming up against lease renewals, lower tier cities that might have some more macro issues? The rates doubled sort of since last quarter and more than doubled year-over-year. So what\u2019s driving that step function? Pat Grismer : Definitely there has been an uptick in China unit closures relative to our original expectations. Part of that is Little Sheep; there continue to be closures in Little Sheep and that is placing a drag on net unit growth; we do expect about 60 closures there this year. But every year we have a base of store closures including forced closures, relocation opportunities and lease expirations. So even if we had no underperforming stores, we would go for closure. But at KFC, it is true that performance driven closures have been higher than we anticipated coming into the year and that\u2019s really the cumulative effect of three years of softer than expected sales. We do look at these on an individual basis and there are unique circumstance supporting each one of those decisions. As to how the mix may have shifted to where the closures are coming from, for KFC about 70% have been in the higher tier cities and we are seeing a higher mix in the lower tier cities but that only involves a handful of stores. From a trade zone perspective, we\u2019re not seeing material shifts between commercial, residential and retail although within retail we are seeing a higher proportion of closures at hypermarkets and malls as opposed to department stores. And then I guess the last thing I would point out is that in terms of the mix of closures based on the year that the stores were opened, we are seeing a slight uptick in the percentage of stores that are being closed that relate to the ramp up in our development in 2011 and 2012 and we think that that may continue. But I just want to reinforce that with what we see by way of new unit returns and the confidence that provides us around development and how that creates value for shareholders, we continue to expect to open about 700 units this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA. Your line is open. Diane Geissler : Another question on China; I wanted to talk about the online delivery which seems to have been sort of a cutthroat this year and probably the source of the biggest surprise, maybe in disruption. I know there are some rumors in the media about one of the big O2O and restaurant review apps merging, which maybe reduces the number of players but how can investors have confidence that the situation will improve in 2016? Because it just seems so competitive and I guess, as you look at your Pizza Hut business in China, what are you doing specifically to get yourself where you need to be to either -- to be more active in delivery or have a bigger slice of that? Because it just seems like the O2O players are pushing the mom and pop restaurants and that\u2019s obviously to your competitive disadvantage. Can you talk a little bit about what you plan to do specifically to address the competitive pressures in the delivery business? Greg Creed : Let me answer that holistically. First of all, delivery is -- we have about 300 delivery units which is a small part of our overall business compared to Pizza Hut in China. But as you said, there is definitely what we call a savage battle for supremacy going on about -- around the aggregators who are obviously heavily discounting. We are actually putting our foot in the water and playing with them but it\u2019s a very small part of our business. So, I think the answer is that we don\u2019t believe that the economics will sustain all the people that are currently in the market playing at these discounted prices. And I think as we\u2019ve seen these aggregators in other parts of the world because China is not the only place where this is occurring, what tends to happen is they are all fighting for market share dropping the prices but then eventually the prices have to go up. And secondly the actually delivery experience from these aggregators we would argue is not as good as delivery experience that we deliver from Pizza Hut. So, I think the answer is there is a lot of savage market share fights going on. We don\u2019t believe in the long term that they can sustain these discounts. We know in the rest of the world prices go up; we know that their performance -- their delivery performance is not as good as ours but that does not mean that we haven\u2019t -- we are not dabbling in this area, obviously testing as part of the Pizza Hut strategy. Diane Geissler : If you look at experience sort of outside of china when this has occurred before, what has been the average length of time that it\u2019s taken for the industry to sort of shake itself out? Greg Creed : Well, I think that it\u2019s very early as this is occurring -- it\u2019s very early days for this whole aggregator business but I can assure you that we are monitoring it on a global basis whether it is Europe, Asia, North America, Australia wherever it is going on. It\u2019s way too early to call how long that\u2019s going to take but it is very clear that -- while I guess it\u2019s a little more mature we\u2019ve seen these businesses move from burning a lot of cash or heavy discounting into taking price increases and obviously that\u2019s going to stunt consumer demand. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : I have two questions, one -- both follow-ups on China. One is really a communication question. Back in late August when you were about 10 days before the end of the quarter in China, you put out a filing that remarked on the significant recovery. I guess a lot of us are really surprised that the 3Q number came in so much below our own expectations, given that the language or what would seem to be the message is that things are on track. So, did we misinterpret the filing; did something happen in the last week and a half? I guess I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what seems to have been positive commentary fairly late in the quarter with the 3Q results and setting aside maybe what may have happened in September and subsequently in 4Q. And then, I\u2019ll have another question. Greg Creed : Well, I can\u2019t speak to how you or others interpreted what we said. But as I said in my remarks earlier, the facts are that in the seven weeks leading up to the lap, the average same-store sales for the division were minus 11 and then for the next four weeks swung 42 points to the positive to plus 31. So in fact, same-store sales had turned significantly as we lapped last year\u2019s supplier incident. Sara Senatore : But were you then expecting low-single digit comps for the third quarter because the second half guidance implied low-double digits for the both halves? So, I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out, to your point maybe it was our interpretation but did the third quarter surprise you? Greg Creed : Clearly third quarter results in total were below the expectations we had as of our second quarter earnings release. So, at the time of our second quarter earnings release based on results we saw at the time, we expected as we mentioned that the recovery would continue across the second half of the year. And I believe on the call we effectively affirmed for the second half double-digit positive same-store sales growth and that was our strong belief at the time based on what we were reading in the business. As of the date of this announcement that you mentioned, we referenced that sales turned significantly positive as we lapped the supplier incident from last year which was the fact supported by the numbers that I shared with you. Sara Senatore : And then my other question, this goes back to again -- I know you are not going to discuss strategic actions but I think pretty much every quarter, we\u2019ve been disappointed by top line versus expectations at an increasingly wide gap. So, there is some question about the strategy and you\u2019ve talked about that. Clearly the stock market is saying that Yum! is not creating a lot of value right now. At what point do you decide if it\u2019s not three years of flat earnings, at what point is it time to reconsider the view that you are absolutely the right people to run the day-to-day operations of Yum! China, or to have the structure that you have right now? Greg Creed : Well, the key for us is to turn this business around with particular focus on China. I think that anything else is speculation. But I can absolutely assure you that we have three great global brands that we are absolutely focused on doing the things that I talked about earlier brand positioning, product innovation, disruptive value, upgraded assets, social, mobile, digital and in then the superior customer experience. We have to get that in all five divisions. When we get that in all five divisions, then we\u2019ll obviously earn the right to have the share price that we believe this business deserves. So that is my absolute focus. Having said that we are always open to looking at alternatives and I\u2019ve said we are looking at alternative. But right now my absolute focus is on getting these five divisions firing pretty much like I\u2019d like them firing like Taco Bell is firing right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : I know I am probably not going to get an answer to this, so maybe it\u2019s just more of a statement than anything. But look I acknowledge that China has fit historically into the long term growth plan and as everyone has been talking about, it has been hurting the model and the valuation of your stock for three years now. But the problem here is the visibility looking forward is no better today than it was last year or the year before. And Greg, you started the call talking about everything but China, because you really wanted to highlight the strength in that business. But the way Yum! is structured today, China is all that matters and we all know that. And at some point I wonder when the board and the management team believes that the China turnaround story no longer makes sense to completely dominate the investment conversation for Yum! Brands and at some point, when they would believe a separation is a more realistic option I think for the sake of what appears to be an undeniable opportunity for value enhancement, not just in the near-term but the long-term? I mean, you are basically getting no credit for having the China business in your portfolio today. I could argue you are almost getting zero dollars of value for that business. And at some point, a China turnaround may happen and could happen and there could be a plan where investors still participate in that upside but also get the choice to participate in that upside and can invest in the ex China business which is performing beautifully. And I\u2019m just wondering if there is any timeline or more focus in the board room on understanding that and thinking about that? Greg Creed : I think what I can say is we\u2019re always going to believe in China and we\u2019re always going to participate in its growth. Let me be really clear. I think we\u2019ve also got a new leader on the ground in China and with the new leader comes fresh ideas and a fresh perspective. And there is no doubt that he is taking a lot of the ideas that we know have proven and worked around the world and we\u2019re putting those into test aggressively whether it\u2019s KFC or Pizza Hut in China. So that\u2019s what I believe is the best answer which is we continue to believe in China, we all like to participate in China\u2019s growth, we\u2019ve got a new leader, he is bringing massive action to bear, which is great because he ran the Global KFC and Pizza Hut businesses in his prior job. He knows what\u2019s worth; he knows what\u2019s resonating with customers; he knows how to adapt certain taste to local taste. And that guy is doing everything he can do. He is being incredibly well received by the China team. People are saying he is incredibly smart. He is incredibly experienced. He is incredibly humble. He is incredibly collaborative. And he has an action agenda. So, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019ve got a new leader in place who is going to bring all of his ability to bear to turn it around. And as I\u2019ve said we\u2019ll always believe in China and we\u2019ll always going to participate in its growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jason West : Just I guess going back to the competitive issues, particularly on the order aggregators and I guess if there is anything else that\u2019s really surprised you. But that seems to be one of the bigger surprises that\u2019s emerged more recently. And you talked about the impact on sort of delivery at Pizza Hut but you also mentioned the Pizza Hut Casual Dining was impacted by this. But are you saying that the order aggregator sort of delivery model would impact Pizza Hut Casual Dining specifically or is this also not going to be an issue for KFC, which also offers similar type meal occasions? Greg Creed : No, I think it\u2019s clear that right now with the massive discounting just going on, you can get a meal that you would traditionally go out for, delivered to your house at very low price. But as I said, we know these economics are not sustainable. We know they are burning through all this cash. That\u2019s why on the Pizza Hut delivery side, we are experimenting with it. But I think that we feel and we have seen as we have practiced in other markets around the world, eventually these prices go up; when these prices go up, demand wanes. It\u2019s the fact of life. So, we are watching it; we\u2019re monitoring it; we are doing it on a global basis. We have got our toe in the water. And as you also know, we are testing delivery with Taco Bell in the U.S. So, we\u2019re not just limiting our testing to either KFC or Pizza Hut, we\u2019re also adding some testing with Taco Bell. Jason West : So, just one follow-up, going back to the store growth outlook and new store performance, it sounds like store performance is holding up reasonably well in the new stores but you also mentioned some closures in some stores that were open a few years ago. I guess can you talk broadly about the portfolio, particularly at KFC if you have pockets of stores that were maybe were opened in regions that were expected to be economically developing that really haven\u2019t come along yet and there may be pockets of large store closures that could really help alleviate some of the comp pressure or is it really not -- the comps really aren\u2019t broken up in that way? Pat Grismer : There really hasn\u2019t been a significant shift in the mix of closures, as I mentioned earlier in response to Karen\u2019s question whether we are looking at type of trade zone or city tier; I mean there\u2019s some changes around the edges but nothing really meaningfully different. But what is meaningfully different versus prior year is that because of the cumulative effect of three years of underperformance at KFC, we are looking at more closures this year versus last. But the composition is largely in line with what we\u2019ve seen in last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. Your line is open. Keith Siegner : My first question is I just want to tease out a little bit more of this macro versus aggregators issue. So, is the aggregator issue prevalent across all tiers? And let\u2019s just talk KFC for example on this too. Is it present across all tiers? And then maybe to add to that, how is the tier performance doing; are you still seeing tier one and tier two do better; is KFC weakness more concentrated in those three through six? How are those two pieces playing out? Greg Creed : I don\u2019t think the aggregator impact in China is having a huge impact on our KFC business. I think what we\u2019ve got to do in our KFC business is introduce what I would say is disruptive value and get our positioning much clearer, go on the offense, talk about all the positives, get back to the core products which every time we go back to the core around the world, we know works. So, I don\u2019t believe that is a huge impact on the KFC business. And then as I said on the Pizza Hut business, obviously the aggregators are more active in the higher tier markets than they are in the smaller tier markets. And again from a Pizza Hut perspective, it\u2019s clearly having some impact on our performance along with the macros. But as I said, I think whether they can sustain this discounting to sustain this performance, I think we all believe is very questionable. Pat Grismer : And Keith, in response to the second part of your question, very similar to last quarter when we look at same-store sales growth across city tiers, the higher-tier cities are performing better. And that\u2019s largely because among the lower-tier cities we have some markets that are very heavily dependent on industry. And industry as you know has been soft in China. And so that\u2019s weighing on consumer confidence and spending in those regions. Greg Creed : So Keith, I guess if you had to sort of prioritize it, I would say first of all marketing missteps; second, the softening Chinese economy; and third, the impact from malls and aggregators. And obviously, we\u2019re going to take massive action to turn around certainly the marketing missteps that we\u2019ve taken. Keith Siegner : And then one quick follow-up, Pat. You mentioned earlier the change in Moody\u2019s analysis of your implied debt in the $2 billion of extra capacity. Is it safe to assume that you leverage this that you tap into that capacity and if not, why not? Pat Grismer : We have not. However, as I mentioned earlier, we look at our capital structure holistically. So, we consider a number of different things before making a decision to take on more debt as an example. Last year, we increased our borrowings through our short-term credit facility. So, we are certainly not averse to doing that. But we look at these things holistically and we\u2019ll provide a further update at our December investor conference in how we are thinking about this. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : First, if I could just go back to the KFC and draw the dotted line in sales between the 31% increase you experienced, let\u2019s say, ending in mid-August, and the 9% in September, was that a linear deceleration; did it happen all at once to around for example, I think the devaluation happened around then? And are you -- how did September trend; where are we in that continuum now just to get the expectations right for the fourth quarter? Pat Grismer : John, first of all, the 31% was a division number. So, that was not a KFC number. And I\u2019m not going to give brand-specific numbers around those data points. But you\u2019ll have to bear in mind what we were lapping from last year and the overall shape of that as is the case any time we experience some event, which is the impact is sharpest at the beginning and then it begins to diminish over time. And so the reverse applies to when you are lapping that. So, you have the easier compares in the early weeks following the event. And then those compares become tougher. And I would say that generally follows the shape of our expectations into the fourth quarter. John Glass : So when you -- so just to be very clear, when there was an event like the devaluation that did not abruptly slow sales, it wasn\u2019t a specific macro event you saw that bent that curve for example? Pat Grismer : Well, what we did see was in the last one to two weeks of August in China, I think we\u2019ve all read about what were very significant events. Remember it was in mid-August that the currency was devalued quite significantly and a surprise to everybody. And it was less than two weeks later that there was a significant change in the stock market which again was unprecedented and caught everybody by surprise. And that does coincide with when we saw a material change in the shape of Pizza Hut Casual Dining same-store sales. And just to remind you also, the impact of ForEx, apart from the impact that it had to our business in China, very significant impact to our earnings per share 1 to 2 points in the quarter and full ForEx impact of more than 6 points on the year. John Glass : And then Greg, could I just ask, what is the right timeframe to look at this recovery? You\u2019ve got a new CEO in place. Are we going to hear next quarter that look it\u2019s going to take some time to rebuild the product pipeline and how much of this will be revolved or resolved with pricing? How much of this is maybe resetting pricing or is that not what you are really contemplating as this recovery takes shape? Greg Creed : No John, as I speak to Micky, and I -- as you can probably imagine, I\u2019m speaking to Micky an awful lot. The discussion we\u2019ve had is that there are some clearly proven ideas that we\u2019ve had success around the world, whether it\u2019s box meals for lunch, day of the week specials, product innovation, and he is in the process of putting all of that into test into China as quickly as he can. So I think that in December, what we\u2019ll be able to do is give you an update, a much clearer update of the things that we\u2019ve taken that have been successful around the world that we\u2019ve put into China with a KFC or Pizza Hut. We will hopefully have some preliminary numbers, even if they are just early test market days. And I think we\u2019ll also have the overlap benefit. So, the way I look at it is a lot of proven things about to go into test in China. They include disruptive value so the equivalent of the $5 box meals; the $20 dinner meals, as well as product innovation around core. So, we\u2019re probably going to have more tests going on in the fourth quarter in China than we\u2019ve seen in a long time in China. And I believe that Micky will be able to give us an update, some progress on those tests when he presents at the December conference. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Westra of Stifel. Your line is open. Paul Westra : I know you don\u2019t want to give too much color on the outlook for \u201816, but my question is how lasting should we think about what your implied fourth quarter combined China margins could be? And I guess Pat, your full year China profit growth guidance of high to mid-single-digit implies a fourth quarter profit number that might be slightly above $100 million which represents a 65% drop in profits from your actual third quarter performance that\u2019s about double what it normally is historically. And frankly the cause of that drop is not really coming from the top line miss, because your fourth quarter comp guidance pretty much matches your third quarter comp miss, at least for us on the sell side. So at least on paper, given that math, it seems as though Pizza Hut Casual Dining\u2019s profitability is almost being wiped out here in the fourth quarter. Assuming these numbers are even remotely close, are there massive turnaround investments planned for fourth quarter? And if not, are there contingency plans at least in place, so that this margin degradation doesn\u2019t flow too much into next year? Pat Grismer : You\u2019ve asked two questions, so I\u2019ll respond to them in turn. First with respect to 2016 outlook, it\u2019s premature and we\u2019re not going to give any guidance on 2016, other than as I said in my prepared remarks, our overall goal is to get our whole business back on track, and we\u2019ll provide more specific plans around that and set expectations at our investor conference in December. Specifically with respect to China\u2019s fourth quarter profit outlook, you\u2019ll have to remember that the fourth quarter is one of the lowest seasonal times of the year. So absolute profits historically for China have been very low, whereas -- relatively low, whereas the third quarter is the peak summer season when profits are relatively high. So, it\u2019s not fair to draw those sorts of comparisons between Q3 and Q4 on an absolute basis. But the outlook we\u2019ve given for China Division profit performance for the full year takes full effect of what we\u2019ve guided by way of same-store sales growth for both KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China and the corresponding impacts to their levels of profitability bearing in mind that it\u2019s a low seasonal period for the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : First, Pat, could you give us some perspective on what KFC was cycling in the month of September, so we have a good understanding of how to frame up the plus 9% comp? And then I have a follow-up. Pat Grismer : We didn\u2019t provide monthly comps last year. And I don\u2019t know that it would be necessarily helpful to do that at this stage. David Tarantino : My real question has to do with the KFC business. And I guess if I look back to the business since the 2012 supplier incident and following this most recent one in 2014, it doesn\u2019t look like the traffic has really rebounded much following either of those incidences. So, I guess the question is, do you think you\u2019re seeing a step change in the transaction counts that just represents a lower base from which you\u2019ll have to grow going forward or do you see something in your consumer metrics that would suggest an outsized recovery or an outsized rebound is really possible at this stage? Because I guess the trend-line would suggest it\u2019s more of the former than the latter. So, I was just curious to hear your thoughts on that. Pat Grismer : David, the one thing we are sure of is that the business is going to fully recover over time. We can\u2019t be precise about the exact timing of that. It is very difficult to call and there\u2019s no denying the fact that the shape of the recovery today is weaker than we had previously expected. But we do have good evidence of the recovery in terms of both absolute transaction counts and how they have improved from last year\u2019s event and consumer -- key consumer metrics or brand perception metrics which have improved versus a year ago. So, we do have different indications that substantiate our view that the recovery is continuing and remain confident in the long-term that we will fully recover those transactions. Greg Creed : I would just add that as I talk to the brands around the world and I look at the businesses around the world where KFC or Pizza Hut or Taco Bell are successful, we\u2019ve got a very good value platform as part of our brand offering. And I think it would be fair to say that we probably should have played and could have played value and I don\u2019t mean at the expense of margin, because we know how to do both. And that\u2019s why, as I said earlier, Micky is taking proven things like the box meals for lunch and the day of the week specials that we\u2019ve run very successfully, particularly in the markets that we continue to do well in, Australia, Japan, South Africa, Russia. So, you will see us play more disruptive value. And you will see us be much clearer around our brand positioning, always original, always Chinese. So, I do believe that those will help our transaction growth, both as we enter the fourth quarter and obviously next year. So, let\u2019s be honest. We have an incredibly strong brand. It\u2019s really up to us. We know that this is a retail business and we know how to get consumers to respond. So, we\u2019re going to do all the things that we know we\u2019d do when we do it, they\u2019ll respond and it will work. And as I said, the discussions that I\u2019m having with Micky are all around that fact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. Your line is open. Joseph Buckley : Based on number of the comments, it sounds like you think your brands in China are lagging the overall industry. Would you comment about that; is that the case; what do you think is going on with the restaurant industry as a whole in China? Greg Creed : Sorry, I missed -- I actually missed -- can you just repeat the question, Joe? Sorry. Joseph Buckley : Sure, I\u2019m sorry. Let me pick up the handset. The comments you\u2019ve made about your brands in China, it sounds like you think you are lagging the overall industry in China. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s the case. And what you think is going on with the restaurant industry as a whole in China compared to your sales results? And then I have one more please. Greg Creed : It\u2019s not as easy in China to get an accurate picture of the category or the market like it is in Australia or the U.S. or the UK. So it is difficult to get an absolute number. Look, there is no doubt that we are the number one QSR brand in KFC and the number one casual dining brand in Pizza Hut. And as I said earlier, both our research and independent research suggests that the brands are still in incredibly strong positions. As I said, I do think we can tighten up the positioning; I do think we need more core product innovation; we do need more disruptive value. So, I think all of those things which are things that Micky and I are working on, we need to put in place in order to take advantage of the strong brand positioning that we\u2019ve got. Joseph Buckley : And then I\u2019m going to sneak two into one for this question. Could you share checking traffic metrics for the quarter in China? And then my other question is, as we look at some of the costs in China that are contributing to this great margin performance, the labor costs per store have been down pretty significantly and that\u2019s in nominal terms, probably down even more in real terms, assuming labor costs inflation is still there. Is there -- should we be concerned that the cost management is so tight there that it might be crimping the ability to get sales recovery? Pat Grismer : Joe, we absolutely do not believe that the significant productivity initiatives undertaken by the China team are impacting the customer experience. We have very clear measures that we use to assess how the customer experience is improving and we don\u2019t see impact to that. We are delighted with the significant productivity initiatives undertaken by the team. We mentioned on the last call that there were a variety of things they were doing to drive improved labor efficiency. We have seen those gains sustained and that is driving the result you\u2019re seeing in terms of cost per labor hour. Greg Creed : Joe, just to build on that, I think the scores that we get suggest that we have not impacted the customer experience but equally, Roger Eaton spent a week in China as the COO, touring a lot of stores. And then, obviously Micky has also been out in a number of the markets in a number of the tiers also visiting the stores. And his feedback or both their feedback to me was, this is not impacting the customer experience. So, I think given Roger -- having been the world-class operator and now running the KFC brand and Micky, their first hand experience gives me confidence that I can trust the numbers that we are getting, which is that we are not impacting the customer experience. So, I think there is this -- it\u2019s interesting coming from either two what you call high labor markets, certainly Australia, probably a very high labor market in the U.S., there has always been this thing that when labor is cheap, you tend to use too much. And I am not the world-class operator, but that\u2019s sort of been my observation. So, I think what we are doing is we are using mature what I\u2019d call mature market productivity. And this was something that Roger really championed as the COO which was to take all the learnings from markets like Australia where minimum wages are like $17, $18, and apply the same rigor even though the labor is cheap to apply the absolute same rigor transactions per labor hour and all this sort of stuff that he has brought to China. So, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re doing all the right things; I\u2019m very confident we are not negatively impacting the customer experience based on these productivity gains. Steve Schmitt : And Joe, the first question you asked -- this is Steve, around the mix of the comp transactions for the division were down about 3 points. So, we got about 5 points combined from pricing and mix benefit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Karen Short : I just want to try to understand something, so I guess I\u2019m hearing two comments that I guess I think are somewhat contradictory. I think you seem to believe that the higher margin structure in China is sustainable but also have indicated that you need to have a greater focus on value, both at KFC and Pizza Hut. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could just maybe give a little color on those, both? Greg Creed : I think from a -- I\u2019ll talk about it from a brand and marketing perspective. I\u2019ll use two examples; obviously, one is Taco Bell. We have the lowest average prices and probably the highest margins. But the second one and more relevant one would be a market like KFC Australia. In KFC Australia, we have average unit volumes around $2.3 million. This year, our sales growth is about 9%. We are obviously in a very high labor market, but yet we\u2019ve got margins in the high-teens. And so, we leverage obviously the sales that we\u2019ve got; we are very smart around how we put these box meals and these day of the week specials together. We\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated around our pricing metrics and analysis on how to execute. And even in the box meals, driving a lot of drink into the box meals actually improves the perception of the box meal but also improves the margin. So, I think we\u2019ve got clear brand positioning. We know and we\u2019ve demonstrated in markets like Australia that we can have disruptive value and high-teen margins. And I think that Micky is taking all that knowledge and applying that to the China business. Steve Schmitt : And the other thing I would say Karen just to build what Greg has said is that we know that the biggest driver of margin improvement for China long-term, to get us back to the 20% range which we still believe is a reasonable target and will be achieved is transaction leverage in the business. Because you have to bear in mind the extent of the transaction losses of the last couple of years. And so as we restore average unit volumes to where they were in 2012 which will happen at some stage then there\u2019s significant upside in the business. And I would say even more so in light of all of the significant productivity gains that the team has delivered over the last couple of years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Andrew Charles : Most of my questions were asked, but Pat, can you just give the pushes and pulls in the China margins that you\u2019ve provided in the past? Pat Grismer : Certainly; very happy to do that. So, as you know, margins improved by about 5 percentage points for the quarter, productivity drove about 3.5 points of margin improvement, and then our pricing actions in the quarter drove about another 2.5 margin points. Offsetting that was inflation, which shaved off a 1.5 margin and then the transaction decline as Steve referenced, which took off about another point. And then we had about 1 point of benefit from other things, including lapping an inventory provision from last year. Andrew Charles : Was the productivity really related to labor? Pat Grismer : Yes. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Greg, I guess with the backdrop of the 90% plus franchise model around the rest of the world that you talked about, clearly I think people appreciate the high margin annuity stream of royalty income that generates. And being that Greg you came from Taco Bell had that stability, I\u2019m just wondering whether you could talk, at least holistically rather than any plans you might have or would ever consider but if you could refranchise the entire China business or the China portfolio today, it would still allow you to kind of participate in China and participate in the growth. But what would be the pros and cons? I mean it just seems like the China volatility just remains so outsized and the franchise model is so much appreciated, I\u2019m just wondering how you size up the pros and cons if you were able to do something like that. Greg Creed : Well, Jeff, it was a nice try. I think that as you know, as you said, outside of China and India, we are currently 90% franchised; we are moving to 95%. As I said earlier, I think that our key objective or my key objective is to take three global brands and make them global iconic brands with all the things that we\u2019ve talked about. And then I think the decision about whether we run them or we put them in the hands of a franchisee is really not what this is all about. The value is really in the value of the three brands. So, obviously if you -- to hypothetically answer your question, the cons are that you would lose leverage, but the pro is that everything the franchisee pays for and you get a fee. So, I think there\u2019s nothing new around why you would franchise or why you wouldn\u2019t franchise. And that\u2019s why as I said earlier, my focus is on getting the brands in all the countries, improving in their performance, making them iconic, and doing all the things that I\u2019ve talked about that I know we need to do and I know that we can do in order to get this thing. But in any case, as I said, we obviously consider all alternatives. And the focus right now is on getting this business back on track. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney of Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is open. Howard Penney : I have two questions. The first one is when you were going through your three-quarter routine whatever that may be, did you think the stock was going to be down and did you think it was going to be down as much as it is? And then the second question is on the China strategy. I understand you laid out the case if you will for China and why you want to continue to grow in China -- not that you can\u2019t continue to grow in China. But it sort of feels like and I apologize for this analogy because I can\u2019t think of a better one kind of a [indiscernible] China-shop strategy in the sense that the economy has gone from 10% to 7% to 6%, and probably going to 3%. And you\u2019ve got volatility in currency and the stock market causing volatility to your business. Do you have an internal economist or somebody that is guiding you on what\u2019s going to happen in China for the next five years in saying the economy is going to go from 6% to 9% or -- I still don\u2019t understand -- I understand the consuming class is growing in China, but I guess I don\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t heard from you a reason why ownership and owning those assets in China is still the right way to go. Because it feels like China is headed in one direction and yet you are going in another. Greg Creed : Why don\u2019t I have a first crack at it? Obviously I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to the share price. If I could predict that, I\u2019d be a very wealthy man. So, I\u2019m going to leave that to others to do. I think on the question of what\u2019s happening in China, look, we are in 126 countries around the world. And in these 126 countries, we have either growth, no growth; lots of competition, no competition. I mean, value is important and there is so many permutations and combinations. I think in China, we\u2019ve still got growth in China that\u2019s still greater than it is in most of the markets we operate. We do believe that the consuming class will go from about 300 million people to 600 million people by 2020. And whilst we can certainly look at the competitiveness of the China market compared to a few years ago, if I compare that to the competitiveness of the market in the United States, it\u2019s not even close. So, I\u2019m still bullish on China. I still believe it\u2019s a place that we can get significant growth both for ourselves and for our shareholders. And I think we are still on the ground floor of what is a huge opportunity. How we take advantage of that opportunity. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll decide over time. But the most important thing is to position these two brands to capture all the potential growth that we can. Pat Grismer : And Howard, just to build on that, I think what you are highlighting is the difference between a short-term perspective and a long-term perspective and we\u2019ve always taken a long-term perspective on our business. And our thesis on China and its long-term growth potential is unchanged, notwithstanding the significant volatility we\u2019ve seen in the market and that our brands have experienced in the last couple of years. Because I mentioned we do take a close look at investment returns. Our paybacks on -- our cash paybacks on new units remain in the range of three to four years. It\u2019s an attractive investment return opportunity for our shareholders. And, as Greg mentioned, our focus is on continuing to drive significant improvements in the business. We have new leadership in place to help deliver that. And so we remain optimistic for the long-term. And as we\u2019ve said many times over, despite the challenges we\u2019ve experienced, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anybody. We have leading brands in the world\u2019s largest growing economy and we are on the ground floor of growth. Howard Penney : So, if you don\u2019t mind, can I just try asking the same question again? So, the China economy has gone from -- the last four years, call it beginning of 2012 from 10%, I don\u2019t have these numbers right from 10% to 6%. And you\u2019ve opened 3,000 units over the same timeframe and your stock has gone nowhere. And if the China economy goes from 6% to 3% and you open up 3,000 units, are you going to be able to turn -- with the economy declining at an accelerating rate, are you going to be able to turn this business around in that environment? Greg Creed : I mean, the way I would answer is we\u2019ve had two incidents, two massive incidents in China, which obviously we are still recovering from. We\u2019ve got a new leader in place who as I said has a fresh perspective and who knows what proven ideas have worked in other parts of the world for both KFC and Pizza Hut. He is already and the team there are already starting to put a lot of that into test, and we\u2019ll continue to do more of that in the fourth quarter and going forward. And I think that when we get to December, we\u2019ll be able to update you on just the progress that those tests are making. We won\u2019t have a massive sort of result changes in a revolutionary sense, but I do believe the huge -- the sheer amount of testing that is now going to happen in China, and the process and the discipline that we are reapplying to that testing in China, I look forward to being able to present with Micky to everybody in December. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Barbula of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : It\u2019s John Ivankoe. I think you just touched on this in the previous question, but I wanted to get a sense of how Micky was really going to run the business differently than Sam. Certainly, Sam would\u2019ve told us years ago, sharpening the focus of the brands is something that he probably would\u2019ve always done. And I think it would have been assumed by everyone on the call that the idea that China was putting in products made for the Chinese consumer that were proven successful elsewhere in the world, would have always been done, not just in the past three years, but probably in the last 15 years. So what I wanted to get a sense and Greg, I guess you\u2019d probably be the best person to answer this is, how much really is going to tactically change with Micky running the market versus Sam running the market? Not just from a tactical product development and brand focus point of view but even how the China market is managed and structured. In other words, are we a little bit too early to be talking about a complete reorganization in terms of who does what in the organization? And do you think that\u2019s something that in fact should be executed in the relatively near-term? Pat Grismer : I think Micky has been on the ground for less than six weeks. I mean he came over with us after the Sam retirement announcement. And he has stayed there. So, he and I have obviously been in constant contact. So the first thing is obviously he is looking at the business through new eyes. I think that\u2019s the most important thing. That\u2019s what you always get when you get a new leader. Secondly, whether the business is performing good, bad or indifferent, there\u2019s always unfinished business to look at. I do think that the always original positioning around KFC that Micky has led around the world, we are going to bring to China with a tweak of always original, always Chinese. I think the discussions I\u2019ve had with him around we probably need to simplify the menu, get more focus back on the core products introduce this disruptive value that\u2019s worked elsewhere. And I think in a brand positioning sense, play more offense. So, I would say that look, it is really early days. I\u2019d probably -- he and I are in constant dialogue. But he has new eyes. He\u2019s got seasoned professional eyes. And so he sees the business as he\u2019s looked through the businesses that have performed elsewhere. We know we\u2019ve got unfinished business. We know we have to make the positioning clearer. We both believe we need more disruptive value, and we have to start playing offense when it comes to brand positioning; all of that. John Ivankoe : And with respect, Greg, I mean that sounds like the kind of things that a CMO would do or perhaps the president of the brand would do but the CEO job for the CEO of China -- the job, the scale, the responsibilities is -- it\u2019s much bigger than marketing and positioning. So, if you could talk about the organization, how it\u2019s run, what the responsibilities are, how it\u2019s structured, what have you? Greg Creed : As I said, his job right now is turning around the business. So, I don\u2019t care whether he\u2019s the president, the CEO, the CMO or whoever he is. He and I both realize that what we\u2019ve got to do is turn around the sales and transactions of this business. And so, those are the roles that he has really focused on in his first whatever 30 or 40 days that he\u2019s been there. He and I pretty much talk almost every day. Now, will we get to structure in China? And does he have the right structure? And has he got the right people? Look, we\u2019ve got a seasoned leadership team there that has a new leader that\u2019s looking at the business through new eyes. And I think you can call it whatever you want to call it, but I think he\u2019s doing all the right things. And certainly the feedback I\u2019m getting from the other team in China is that they think he\u2019s doing all the right things. And certainly the things that I know he is putting into test, he has my full support on. In fact, those are the things that he and I talk about pretty much on a daily basis. So, getting sales and transactions turned around is his number one priority. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy of Morningstar. Your line is open. R.J. Hottovy: One final follow-up question on brand positioning and I respect that you can\u2019t give away all the internal metrics that you used to measure brand\u2019s strength. But I was wondering if you could give us a little of at least direction or color on what metrics and what gives you confidence that the brand perception hasn\u2019t diminished in China? I think that would be particularly helpful. Greg Creed : I think a lot of the customer metrics that we measure are obviously making progress since the two supplier incidents. I think the one that we have not made the progress on that we need to make progress on is value. So, I think that as the economy turns, as the macros become tougher, and your value score is the one that\u2019s probably lagging in a recovery sense, I think it indicates that we need to play disruptive value more aggressively. But I want to reassure everybody not at the expense of margin because we do know how to do this and we\u2019ve done it successfully in many other markets. So, do we continue to improve our metrics on food safety, favorite QSR brand, trustworthy all of our brands? Yes, we do. But on value for money, we clearly have a lot more work to do. So, any more questions? Steve Schmitt : Thanks R.J. Greg Creed : So, I want to thank everyone for being on the call. I think it goes without saying we\u2019ve obviously had a very disappointing quarter. And as I said, I and we and everyone at Yum! take responsibility for it. I think what I don\u2019t want you to do is count us as out. We will come back. And as I said earlier, this is really up to us to execute. We know what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got to have very clear brand positioning. We have got to have innovation that is driven from insides. We\u2019ve got to have disruptive value. We\u2019ve got to be strong and great in the whole social mobile digital space. We\u2019ve got to upgrade our assets. And we\u2019ve got to deliver a superior customer experience. We know what we have to do. What we all know we have to do is execute better than we\u2019ve done. The long-term potential for this business is huge whether it\u2019s emerging markets, developed markets, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is. We have three great brands. We are going to turn these into three great global iconic brands and take advantage of all the emerging opportunities that exist for us. So, it\u2019s on us. Yes, there\u2019s some macro headwinds and yes other things happening, but at the end of the day, around the world, I know what we have to do to be successful. In a number of the markets where we do that, we are incredibly successful. What we\u2019ve got to do is not just do it in a number of markets; we\u2019ve got to do it in every market including China in which we participate. And I can absolutely assure you, everybody at Yum! knows we have disappointed you and our shareholders this quarter and this year, and we are going to come back stronger and better than ever. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Finally, we would like to make you aware of the following upcoming Yum! Investor Events, our first quarter 2016 earnings will be released on Wednesday, April 20th. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results. Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day in December. 2016 will be a transformational year for Yum!, as we complete the spinoff of our China division, ultimately creating two powerful independent focus growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum! however is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world as strong brand critical to delivering the same growth and creating shareholder value over the long-term. I\u2019m pleased with the positive sales momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! In the fourth quarter. KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. This was a sequential improvement from the third quarter and in line with our expectations. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a one and two-year basis. Our U.S. results in the fourth quarter were particularly strong for all three brands, as KFC posted six consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. Taco Bell continued to outperform the category and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2%. On a tuning basis our fourth quarter comps in the U.S. were the best of the year with Pizza Hut at plus 2%, KFC at plus 8%, and Taco Bell at plus 10%. These successes complemented our international results in the quarter where KFC posted 2% same store sales growth with solid results in both emerging and developed markets and Pizza Hut grew same store sales 3% in emerging markets. Fourth-quarter EPS grew 11%, with full-year EPS growth of 3% in 2015 despite a 7% decline in the first half and 6 percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, which is in line with our ongoing growth model targets. This was led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell, a remarkable result given the significant investments we made in the fourth quarter to position the brand for continued momentum and category leadership for the years to come. Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally expected sales results. We added more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015 and as I look forward out to 2016 to be a year of improved performance building on the fourth quarter's momentum. This year we expect to open nearly 2,400 new restaurants, which means we\u2019re opening over six restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we initially gave you in December. Given the results we have seen year-to-date and the plans we have laid out for each of the brands, we're confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016. Now I'd like to discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our businesses. After that Pat will walk you through the financials. So first China, as I mentioned, KFC which represents about 75% of the division's operating profit grew same store sales 6% in the fourth quarter continuing the sequential improvement we saw throughout the year. System sales grew 9% in the quarter as we added 114 net new units, so crossing the 5,000 unit mark. I'm thrilled the China team is applying global best practices, fresh thinking and new insights to revitalize the brand and achieve attraction with consumers. Early test results of proven global sales volume package are encouraging and the implementation of this program should drive transactions and benefit the division later this year. One example is box meals which has proven successful globally and we expect to be similarly well received in China. I can assure you we are taking the right steps to grow the business and the momentum we are seeing makes me confident, we will. Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China which represents -- has represented about 25% of China's operating profit, has proven more challenging. System sales in constant-currency grew 4% in the fourth quarter, as we added 151 net new units, but same-store sales declined 8%. The macroeconomic environment and volatile stock market has impacted the Casual Dining segment and we know we have to generate more exciting news and value to counter this headwind. We'll be more focused on value going forward with work day lunch specials and value pieces as well as other initiatives to drive traffic. We have our work cut out for us here and we'll be moderating our redundant pace a bit this year. Nevertheless the China team has a number of strategies and concepts in test that we expect to improve results. We now have substantial run rate for new units and same store sales growth for China's leading western Casual Dining brands. Before I move on to the other divisions I want to give you a quick update on January sales in China. We are encouraged by what we are seeing at KFC, but Pizza Hut sales remain soft. It's difficult to gauge exactly where the first quarter will finish, especially given the earlier timing of Chinese New Year. But at this point we expect same-store sales growth to be up low-single digits for the division which sets us up well for the balance of the year. We expect solid KFC sales going forward and even with the potential of negative results at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in the first half we are reconfirming our full year guidance for the China division to generate same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%, operated profit growth of 10% in constant-currency and to open 600 new restaurants. Now turning to our three brand divisions, KFC is a franchise led emerging power house. Franchisees opened 85% of our 705 new international restaurants in 2015. Total system sales grew 11% in emerging markets for the year with particular strength in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. In fact Russia has generated system sales growth of at least 40% in each of the last four years. I'm also encouraged by our recent performance in developed markets such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These results reinforce my confidence in the brand's ability to drive sales going forward. We don't only have an ability to generate meaningful growth in mature markets where we have a long established presence; we also have tremendous potential in emerging markets where we have a significant lead over the competition. So, we are taking our global brand identity and unifying that with local cultural insights to expand and grow our business pull around the world. We are 100% focused on our real, authentic and freshly prepared food and merging that with value and innovation to drive results. On the international front, we've enjoyed success with lunch and dinner box meals and we're delighted by the ideas created in the United States are finding their way into the system. For example we just introduced Nashville Hot in the U.S., this is a spicy version of our crispy chicken inspired by one of Nashville's most famous dishes. The New Year pipeline at KFC remains impressive. In KFC's top 12 emerging markets, excluding China, we only have one restaurant for a 1 million people. Today with an aggregate population of 3 billion people in these markets, think of the potential. Across the world we have plans in place to grow sales and to build on the division's consistent operating growth performance. I'm confident KFC will continue to excel and reward shareholders for years to come. At Pizza Hut U.S. we are starting to turn the corner with our focused emphasis on making it easier to get a better pizza. This runs the gamut from improved operations and insight driven food innovation to digital enhancements and consistent value. While we recognize there's a lot more work to do, we are now generating consistent public transactions and same-store sales growth in the United States. Equally significant and as you heard in December, we reached an important agreement with our U.S. franchisees. Starting in January we began overhaul of our assets replacing ovens and upgrading in-store technology. From a marketing calendar perspective we are focused on a balanced approach. This begins with premium product innovation such as our recent launch of Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza to protect and improve unit level economics. You may also have seen the launch of our $5 Flavor Menu, the most compelling value menu in the pizza business. In conjunction with our ongoing $6.99 any pairs deal, it will provide our customers with great value on an ongoing basis. We are encouraged by the solid year at Pizza Hut in United States and we believe we have the right strategy going forward. Our international business at Pizza Hut is led by strength in emerging markets but offset by weakness in some of our developed markets. We believe we can apply best practices from the U.S. business to drive growth in these developed markets going forward. Finally Taco Bell delivered a fantastic 2015 surpassing $9 billion in system sales and we expect a solid year in 2016 as well. Taco Bell is on the cutting edge of QSR and it again received gold standard for social engagement, product development, brand positioning and advertising. We have several new exciting products launching this year including one we'll announce during the Super Bowl. So, be sure to watch the first half to see the national introduction. Our innovation focus extends beyond just food. We are encouraged by early results of our delivery program and our developing expansion plans for additional cities. The addition of our loyalty program in November built on our mobile app and will increase brand affinity as it rewards social behavior. So furthermore we are focused on our core value messaging to drive transactions. We continue to build on our breakfast daypart where sales are growing at twice the rate of our business as a whole, in fact we grew breakfast transactions 6% in the fourth quarter. Given the brand's strong economics and broad franchise appeal, we continue to accelerate New Year openings both domestically and internationally, with a record number of U.S. openings in 2015 and we expect to build upon this in 2016. I am particularly excited that we're starting to some traction, expanding the brands internationally. We know this process will take time but we're making real progress here. Our growth spends both domestically and internationally will lay the ground work for higher operating profit growth in the years to come. With all this progress you can see why I am very excited about what's happening in our company. We are underlying the biggest strategic move in the history of Yum! with our spin-off of the China business. We are confident this will create two large optimally structured independent companies with unique investment profiles. Yum! China will target 50% ongoing EPS growth as it focuses solely on Mainland China and will pay the new Yum! a 3% license fee. New Yum! will become a high margin global franchise company targeting 15% shareholder return. Recapitalization plans are underway and will be completed in the first half of this year. We see substantial value in our shares at common prices as we have repurchased 23 million shares from the announcement of the separation through last night. I want to assure you that while the spin-off transaction is critically important, we're not going to let it distract us from running the business in China or anywhere else. All three of our brands have significant opportunities for growth as they progress along the journey to brand excellence. We expect to achieve 10% constant currency growth and operating profit this year as a company and are setting up two separate companies that will lead the restaurant industry going forward. Yum! is in a unique position. We have three iconic brands and are making them even stronger. As you've heard me say before, my goal as CEO is to build three global iconic brands that people trust and champion. We are well on our way to achieving this, led by our brand positioning, courageous leadership and committed team members and franchisees. Needless to say there is lot to be excited about Yum! and I could not be more pleased to lead this company into its next stage. And finally as you all know this is Pat's last earnings call with Yum! and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for his leadership, his hard work and an unwavering drive to raise the bar of Yum!. He will be missed across the organization. As you may have seen in our 8-K filings we have appointed our current Corporate Controller, Dave Russell, as interim CFO and I look forward to working with him, while we complete our search for a permanent CFO. And with that, it gives me great pleasure to hand the call over to Pat. Pat Grismer : Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I'll cover three areas; our fourth quarter results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on the separation of our China business. I too am pleased with the overall sales momentum that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter where EPS excluding special items grew 11%. Reported EPS growth was considerably higher as last year's fourth quarter included a non-cash special item charge related to the impairment of our Little Sheep concept in China. Excluding special items and the impact of foreign exchange, operating profit grew a healthy 17% in the fourth quarter led by system sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin improvement of over 3 percentage points. I'll now take you through our results by division, starting with our China business. For the division overall, same store sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter. As we pre-announced, KFC grew same store sales 6%, which was sequentially better than Q3 as we expected. We're encouraged by the positive momentum in our KFC China business particularly as it is sustained into the New Year. Same store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining however have remain sluggish and declined 8% in the fourth quarter. As Greg said, the China team is addressing this matter with urgency and we will update you on our progress through the year. Restaurant margin management continues to be a bright sport in China's performance. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margins more than 4 percentage points versus prior year to 11.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC and productivity improvements across the division more than offsetting sales to leverage at Pizza Hut. As a reminder, our fourth quarter is a seasonally low sales period for the China division, so the absolute restaurant margin tends to be lower at that time of year. Full year restaurant margin was 15.9% for the division an improvement of 1 full percentage point. It's not often that you see restaurant margins expand with declined sales, so this highlights the extent of the China team's efforts to improve profitability through cost controls. I am proud of the team's continued focus on productivity and confident this bodes well for further profit growth in China as same store sales continue to recover and unlock significant profit leverage in the business. Given our continued strong belief in China's long-term growth potential and encouraged by continued strong cash paybacks on new units, we opened 743 new restaurants in 2015. And while we're prudently dialing back the pace of the new unit development in 2016, targeting about 600 new restaurant openings, we also expect fewer closures this year. So our net new units will be similar to 2015. Our decision to temper the pace of development balances the reality of current market conditions with the opportunities we have to enter new trade zones and expand our presence in existing ones. We are also making good progress on modernizing our estate. In 2015, we remodeled about 500 restaurants in China, and we plan to remodel about another 550 in 2016. By the end of this year, we will have remodeled or newly built about 45% or nearly half of our China's estate in a three year period. Now moving to our global KFC division, which posted its eighth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets up 10% led by Russia and Southeast Asia. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth up 6% led by Australia, Japan and Western Europe. And the U.S. recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth at 3%. Restaurant margins grew 90 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and improved to 150 basis points for the year to nearly 15%. Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting this for the lap of a one-time favorable pension resolution as well as incremental advertising expense associated with our U.S. acceleration agreement, operating profit grew 11% in the quarter roughly in line with KFC's ongoing growth model. Importantly, KFC set another new record for international development in 2015 opening 705 new restaurants, demonstrating the power of this global iconic brand. Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 1% same store sales growth for the quarter led by 2% same store sales growth in our U.S. business, which accounts for about half of division system sales. Operating profit improved 6% in constant currency driven by higher franchise fees and higher restaurant margins, partially offset by an increase in U.S. G&A including severance and other one-time costs. Restaurant margins actually improved 240 basis points in constant currency for the quarter driven by same store sales leverage and commodity depletion. For the year Pizza Hut opened 429 new international units. While this was below our initial forecast for 2015, we now have a more robust development pipeline and are confident that we'll open at least 525 new international units in 2016. Finally, Taco Bell posted 4% same store sales growth in the quarter. Restaurant margin improved 3.1 percentage points to 23.7% raising full year margins to approximately 22%, a remarkable achievement for this power house brand. Operating profit however declined 7% in the fourth quarter due to an expected increase in G&A related to performance based incentive compensation, strategic growth investments including restaurant technology and international supply chain and other non-recurring costs. We believe these investments will strengthen the brand and help to sustain positive momentum in the business. As evidence of the one-time nature of these expenses, we actually expect Taco Bell's G&A will decline in 2016. Additionally, we expect restaurant margins to remain above 20%, even with our more aggressive push on value. On the development front, we opened 276 new stores in 2015. This included 41 units outside the U.S., four times the number we opened in 2014, demonstrating the progress we're making to ramp up international development. 87% of the division's new restaurants were opened by franchisees reflecting the attractive investment return the Taco Bell brand generates. I'd now like to talk about our 2016 outlook. Supported by the results we've seen year-to-date, we continue to expect to deliver operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency this year. And while I won't be providing quarterly guidance, I'd like to point out that certain brands are facing hurdles, both prior year laps and timing of current year expenses which will weigh on first half results. As a consequence we expect second half operating profit growth will be directionally stronger in the first half. This is consistent with our plans coming into the year and we remain confident we will achieve our full year operating profit guidance. Now I'd like to quickly cover our spin-off plans. We're making good progress and are on track to complete the separation of our China business by the end of this year. A major part of our plan is to optimize the capital structure of Yum! Brands and return $6.2 billion to shareholders prior to the separation to the issuance of new debt. From the time we announced the separation through last night, we've repurchased 23 million shares. While our weighted average basic share count for the quarter was 433 million, our basic share count as of February 2, 2016 was 411 million. We see value in repurchasing our shares in what we consider to be a discounted price and view this as a prudent use of shareholder capital. I'm also happy to report that we're on schedule to complete our recapitalization in the first half of the year, issuing incremental debt of approximately $5.2 billion and plan to maintain roughly 5 times EBITDA leverage going forward. We're now in the process of finalizing the form and timing of this financing. Now I'm sure you've noticed the volatility in the high-yield debt market particularly within the energy and materials sectors. We'll continue to watch this closely, but we're pleased that the rates on our future debt remains very attractive on a historic basis and we're coasting ahead with our plans. So, let me wrap things up, 2016 will be an exciting year for Yum! Brands. Not only do we expect to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency, but we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China division into an independent publicly traded company. Yum! China will have no external debt and will self fund growth capital, while generating significant free cash flow in year one and on an ongoing basis. The New Yum! will be a global diversified franchise company with an optimal capital structure. By 2017 we will be 96% franchised with a stable but fast growing free cash flow strength. I'm pleased I was able to participate in this landmark decision for the company and that we are optimizing shareholder value by creating two powerful investment opportunities. I'm very confident in both companies future growth prospects and look forward to their ongoing success. And with that I'll open the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass : Pat first could I just follow-up on the question, comments you made about certain brands are facing certain hurdles in the first half. Well are these sales hurdles, profit hurdles, which brands, can you just directionally point us in the right direction so we can model in appropriately? Pat Grismer : It is a combination of both sales and spending. Clearly in the case of Pizza Hut in China our expectations for the first half are more muted and we expect their sales recovery to improve in the back half of the year. So, that'll be around the first half results. At the same time we have spending in some of our global brand divisions that will be more heavily concentrated in the first half of the year and then in the second half of the year we'll be lapping some of the investments that were made in G&A and so that will contribute to the shape of earnings over the course of the year. John Glass : How much did Pizza Hut China impact the margins this quarter, in other words, is there real bifurcation occurring? I assume there is but maybe you can quantify how much the weight that Pizza Hut is placing on the margin for China? And also can you just talk about why not -- is this the moment you start developing Pizza Hut delivery more aggressively, since that seems like there's a huge untapped opportunity at the same there's some issues obviously with the dine-in business? Pat Grismer : Yes, first with respect to margins in China, I'm not going to bifurcate by brands but it is fair to say and as you've seen from the comps that we've reported that the sales performance at Pizza Hut Casual Dining was not as strong as for KFC in China. And that's largely due to more significant transaction declines in that business and so did weigh more heavily on Pizza Hut China margins in particular. And then with respect to development you're absolutely right, it's early days for the Pizza delivery business in China and so we will be picking up pace development for that particular concept as we look to temper the pace of development of both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining in 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Palmer : Just a question on the role of value at Pizza Hut China, could you just give us perhaps a little bit of a retrospective and looking forward about what value you need for that brand? Did Pizza Hut China really get away from the five star dining at three star prices in recent years, making it more vulnerable now? And can you share what you brought out so far and the sort of value you might be thinking about for the brand and do you think that's going to enough to offset the casual dining weakness in the country? Thanks. Greg Creed : Sure, David. Well I think first of all, obviously the macros which have got worse since December, since we were all together in December and I think we all know that macros impact casual dining more than they impact QSR. So, I think there's definitely that issue. I would agree with you that we've not had enough value in use to overcome this backdrop. I think we've also as we've spoken out in previous calls, there is a lot of discussion around steak and fajitas and there wasn't as much discussion if you just think about around pizzas. And so I think our ability to talk value but to talk value around pizzas, I think you'll see more of that going forward. So, yes, the answer is we got to focus on the core to strengthen our brand positioning. We have got to target value to increase transactions such as smart value across daypart. We also have to I think improve our in-store experience in order to stay ahead with the competition. And I think the other thing we have got to be a leader in digital we got to say relevant. And I think there's a lot of things that we can do in that market as well. To I guess round out the answer, we've got about five value programs in test for Pizza Hut in China. We're going to see some early encouraging results but that's going to take us some time to get into the marketplace and as Pat I said I think you'll see a much better second half than you'll see first half out of Pizza Hut China. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from UBS. Your line is open. Keith Siegner : Two quick questions, sorry folks, the first one being when we look at the success of the three global brands particularly here in the U.S. in recent quarter on both sales and margins perspective, how should we think about that margin trajectory into this year? We've got easing costs, we've got very intense competition, how do we think about the margins for those three segments this year? And then to follow that up, can you give us an update on the plans to refranchise those three brands, the plan to go from 91% to 95% by the end of '17, how is that progressing? And maybe to be some extent how does the success of those brands recently impact that refranchising effort? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Certainly, Keith. First in terms of margin performance in the three global brands, bear in mind our equity ownership in those three global brand businesses I think collectively is in the order of 10%, so it's a franchise driven business. But nonetheless we do focus on restaurant margins both for the benefit of our company as stated and importantly to ensure that our franchisees are realizing good returns on their investments. I would say overall we're pleased with the progress we're making on margins for our KFC global division to improve about 1 percentage point versus last year was quite a significant accomplishment, a combination of same store sales growth and productivity improvements contributing to that. At Pizza Hut equally happy with the progress we've made this year to your point supported by the commodity inflation as well as in the last quarter some sales growth. And then for Taco Bell another banner year with restaurant margins on a full year basis, we are on 22%. As we build on that momentum into next year, we are expecting our KFC and our Pizza Hut businesses to continue to realize margin improvement aided by same store sales leverage as well as more modest commodity outlook than we've seen in some years before. In the case of Taco Bell, my expectation is that margins will be up above 20% perhaps a bit below where they were in this year because of the more aggressive push on value and a more temperate approach to pricing. And then in terms of the refranchising, the teams are very much committed to realizing the objectives that we laid out to achieve 96% franchise ownership by the end of 2017. In the last 30 days Greg and I have met with each one of the global brand divisions to review their refranchising plans and their very discreet plans around specific geographies and pacing associated with that. Given the complexity of some these transactions, we would expect the refranchising activity will be more heavily concentrated in 2017. Greg Creed : Can I just add a point on the brands, just want to build on the point, Keith you asked. What I am really excited about, and I guess this is in Southeast Asia in January is that the positioning for the three global brands is really starting to be -- I am starting to see it on a global basis. So there is always original KFC whether it's this whole idea that we need to make it easier to get better at Pizza Hut and obviously a holding month at Taco Bell. I happened to be in Thailand, about less than two months after we sort of rolled out, need to make to easier to get better at Pizza Hut, I am in Bangkok and I am seeing really focused plans about what we have to do to get better and what we do to make it easy. So I think the thing I am really encouraged about is now that we have got this positioning clear for the three brands. It's the pace at which I am seeing that appear in the markets in 126 countries that we authorize that's giving me encouragement that we can continue to drive same store sales growth going forward. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open. Diane Geissler : I just have a question on the new unit development and maybe just more a clarification. So when we think about the units that you're opening in China this year, can you give us a breakdown between KFC and Pizza Hut and then as the Pizza Hut slowdown just in your model is it temporary or is it more a shift from actual buying into delivery units? Pat Grismer : Certainly, Diane. When we look at the 740 or so that we opened this year, about 350 were KFC, 280 at Pizza Casual Dining and the balance split between the Pizza Home Service and Little Sheep. When we look out to 2016 and our expectation of around 600 new unit openings, that\u2019s about 20% reduction. That about 20% reduction applies almost equally to KFC and the Pizza Hut. So we're looking at deceleration in the pace of development for both KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. And we don't expect that, that is an indication of how things are going to play out much longer term. It's just that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks earlier, given current market conditions, we feel that it's prudent to dial back in that but we continue to be very confident in the value we will create from these investments as we're continuing to see cash payback to around three years and we know the long-term growth potential of the market remains significant. So we do expect that at some point in time the pace of development will increase for all brands. Greg Creed : I think the discussions that I have been having with Micky are really around, we still see 20,000 plus restaurants on the horizon as an opportunity. I think that we still believe in the growth story of China, the consuming class, the EPS, the economics not what they used to be but it's still better than most other places in the world. And I think as we get these brands fully positioned and we get back to doing the things that we've spoken about that we need to do. I think long-term we remain still committed that this is at least in what I'll call my horizon 20,000 restaurant unit opportunity for the China business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Karen Holthouse : Hi, thank you for the question. You guys, I was surprised to see a tick down into your conference in emerging markets, at KFC and a little bit more material at Pizza Hut, particularly in light of commentary about strength in Russia, strength in Eastern Europe. I am curious if there is any particular regions of the world you would point to that are causing a little bit of softness there and what might be causing that? Pat Grismer : Karen, what I'd highlight for both KFC and for Pizza Hut in terms of the emerging markets which remain strong overall given what we're seeing by way of system sales growth is that the same store sales growth has probably been a bit below our expectations for some of the emerging markets in South East Asia. Karen Holthouse : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you very much. Actually just two restaurant margin questions. One in China, Pat, I think you said for this full year it was 59 plus 100 basis points and that was quite impressive considering the sales decline. As we think about 2016 and you talk about 2% to 3% comp growth, I'm wondering, why perhaps the guidance? I think you've mentioned in the past maybe 15% plus margin in '16. Wondering why it wouldn't be significantly higher if presumably due to those positive comps? And maybe you can offer some food and labor commentary. And a similar question on Taco Bell, I mean Keith said right, greater than 20% margin in '16 but down from '15 it sounds like there is a big value push perhaps coming. So I'm wondering, if you guys can just talk a little about the category, with a little bit discounting going on seems to have intensified of late and where Taco Bell is well positioned to respond to that. Thanks. Pat Grismer : Certainly, and we'll start with China. We finished the year from a margin perspective in China stronger than we'd expected. And so our current expectation is that margins in 2016 will be about in line with 2015, so around 16%. As you mentioned we're expecting to realize some benefit from same store sales growth but we're taking I'd say a more tempered approach to pricing, given the focus on value as the team's emphasis is on building transactions, building healthy transactions. And so that may mean that we wouldn't take pricing that we might have in the past to fully offset inflation and we'll be much happier with an outcome where we'd build transactions with that margin, as opposed to growing margins. And so that's the outlook for China. As it relates to Taco Bell, I'd say things are a little bit similar in the sense that the emphasis will be on value to build on a great momentum we had in 2015. We are expecting modest inflation I'd say probably more than we've realized historically in the labor category for our company stores. We're anticipating there could be some movement in wage rates and I'd say modest outlook on commodity inflation for the Taco Bell business. Greg Creed : Just let me talk to about whole question about value, I think the great thing is that Taco Bell is incredibly well positioned, it remains the value leader. But look, we've all seen what's been happening in the marketplace in the early year : five for $4, four for $4, two for $2, so let's not kid ourselves. So, there's been a fair amount of value initially out there. So as you would expect from a well positioned brand, they are back looking at the calendar, I think you'll see some changes that will come out. Obviously they have got this great new product launch coming out on Sunday, so I think that will have a positive impact on the brand. They will do the right thing and I'll make sure that they continue to be well positioned in the value leader in the marketplace going forward that's what you should expect great brands to do. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thanks, guys. I've two questions, first is on China, kind of following up. In the fourth quarter you did have great margin leverage again and operating profit growth of almost 200% on a 2% comp and you're expecting similar comps going forward as you had in the fourth quarter. So can you just talk again a little bit more about what investments are being made in China that are going to keep the margin and profit growth more in check as your guidance kind of suggests? And then I do have a follow up. Pat Grismer : Well, first in terms of China margin for 2016, as I mentioned there will be much stronger emphasis on value in order to simulate traffic and as a consequence we're not necessarily expecting that pricing will fully offset inflation. What we're expecting by way of inflation in 2016 is about 1% for food and high single-digits for labor, but again we're not expecting to fully offset that to pricing, as maybe has been our past practice, as the team is refocusing on building transactions. We're counting on continued productivity improvements probably not the heroic improvements that we've seen in years past. If we do better than 2% to 3% comps in 2016, we would expect margins to improve but we're not planning for that right now. The other variable though is labor efficiency, because the team let's face it has consistently surprised us to the upside and that could provide further tailwind to China margins in 2016. We think at this stage guiding about flat margins year-over-year, is appropriate. Brian Bittner : That make sense. And then the second question just on the pending recap that you expect to be completed here in the first half. You said at the Investor Day that you are targeting 5.25% blended interest rate, is that still an achievable targeted rate as you stand here today? Larry Gathof : Yes, Brian. It's Larry Gathof. As Pat mentioned, the markets have been very volatile and spreads definitely have widened across the market. That said, there's a lot of bifurcation in the market. The good credits are still getting done at fairly good and attractive rates, especially on historic basis. So it really depends on exactly what we execute and we're evaluating and doing some specifics around both the tenure of the debt and the types of the debt we've put out there. So the 5.25% I would say was still in the game, but it's probably 5.25% or plus, not on the lower end of that at this point. Pat Grismer : And Brian, that 5.25% that we referenced was for the entire debt portfolio of Yum!, not just the incremental debt. So just wanted to make that clear. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : A question on China margins. Obviously you guys were happy with margins, given the comps in 2015. You were happy with the levels in the fourth quarter as well. But the question that has to continue to be asked and certainly we've been asking it for the last couple of years; to what extent that attention to cost controls, labor efficiency, other OpEx efficiency, what have you, has actually in some way contributed to the lack of traffic recovery that you guys have consistently expected? So I just want to see whatever research or information, anything qualitative, quantitative that you may have to make everyone comfortable that you haven't gone too far. And in that context, is some of the guidance on China margins in 2016 an admission that there are no more structural cost cuts or tactical cost cuts that exist within the China system and that margins are really now going to be a function of comps? Greg Creed : Let me just start with that one. I will take that. I think the -- certainly the customer metrics -- certainly on KFC, the customer metrics are now back pre the incident, so I think it doesn't matter what metrics you look at. I would say all of those metrics are obviously way back. In an absolute sense, the Pizza Hut metrics are actually higher than the KFC metrics. Probably haven't regained as much momentum, but they are in an absolute sense higher. I think the other thing, just to address your question, is there's a lot of work being done on menu simplification as well. And so I think what we've got to do is, obviously besides looking at labor and other costs that go into it, is how do we simplify the menu so that we make it easier for the customer to speed up the experience? In KFC's case or in Pizza Hut's case, I think, you know, really deliver the best casual dining in-store experience in order to stay ahead. So there's a number of initiatives around simplified menu boards, box meals make it actually easier for the customer to order rather than standing in queue and lining up. So we're spending a lot of time making sure that the margin improvements do not impact the customer experience. And all of the evidence that I can see suggests that there is no impact on the customer experience. And Micky has the bit between the teeth on improving the speed of service, particularly in KFC. And there's a number of initiatives in place that I think will actually enhance that experience, enhance throughput, and obviously lead to sales and transaction growth. Pat Grismer : And John, what I would add to what Greg has said is that we continue to believe that long term, 20% is an appropriate margin target for the China business. And you have to think about that in the context of where average unit volumes are today and where we know they can go. We're not putting a time frame on it, but we know that there is enormous profit leverage in the business, given all the productivity gains that have been made in the last two to three years. And that as the same-store sales continue to recover, we will see significant margin improvement. To your point, that is from comps, but I also wouldn't underestimate the opportunity for the China team to continue to realize some structural improvements in the business. They've consistently delivered well beyond our expectations. They have enormous capability, and I think that the next leg of productivity improvement in the restaurants will be unlocked by technology. And it's fair to say that the digital capabilities of our China business are the best that we have in our entire company. We are all very excited about how that's going to transform the customer experience and that will unlock further productivity opportunity in our restaurants and contribute to that improving margin over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : My question is on the Pizza Hut business in China. And I know this might be hard question to answer, but I was wondering, if there is any way you can dissect how much of the comps weakness you've seen recently is more related to macro issues versus internal issues? And I guess said differently, is there any benchmarks within that market that you're looking at that would say you are underperforming or over performing relative to the industry there? And then I have a follow-up. Greg Creed : Okay, David, let me take one. We don't have obviously the sort of information we have in the U.S. We don't have credit and MPD data to try and get to the specifics that you're asking. I think we all know -- and we've seen this not just in China, but outside that casual dining is impacted by macros. It's just what happens. And it always has a bigger impact on casual dining when macros are volatile and changing than it does on the QSR business. So if I were to say what are the four factors, I would say macros. I think the second one would be not having enough value news in order to overcome this sort of macro backdrop, which is why we've got a number of macro tests in the marketplace right now. And obviously with a sense of urgency, we need to get these tests into the marketplace. I think there is definitely competition. There's definitely more competition in the marketplace. I don't think a lot of this competition is going to try and scale up on the broad scale like Pizza Hut is. And then I think that the last thing or the last point or factor I think would be aggregators, but that's a small percentage of total sales. So I would say it's macro, it's value, it's competition, and it's aggregators. That would be -- I can't put a percentage on for you. I know you would like it, but those would be the four factors. And that's why our response has to be focus on the core to strengthen the brand positioning, target value increased transactions, deliver the best in-store dining experience. And then leading digital, as Pat said, whether it's free Wi-Fi, queue ticketing, pre-ordering, and then partnerships with people like Alipay and WeChat to drive cashless payment as well as the loyalty program. So that's the things we're doing in response to the four things we see driving the performance we're not happy with in Pizza Hut China. David Tarantino : Great. And I guess the follow-up to that -- that's very helpful. But the follow-up is if it ends up being mostly macro, it seems like you are swimming into a pretty stiff current on some of this. How much contingency have you built into the plans, if the Pizza Hut business doesn't stabilize as you expect in the second half? Greg Creed : Well, I think there's two things. First of all, we do have a number of tests, so I don't want anyone to go away thinking that we haven't developed a number of test scenarios. Now, I think the difference between KFC and Pizza Hut is, in KFC we can draw on proven ideas from the other 100 countries we've got KFC. There's less opportunity to do that, but I can assure you that Micky and the team are really focused on what I would call these value platforms being tested and obviously what we're trying to resolve the impacts. We need to see positive sales impacts and I think some of the early day test results suggest we're seeing sales impacts in these tests somewhere between plus 1% to plus 7%. So we've still got a long way to go. We've got to get them into the real world, but I am at least optimistic with what I'm seeing in the tests. But this is a hard slog. This is definitely a lot harder than KFC in China. We're going to have to work really hard, but we've got the right team in order to come up with the right ideas to overcome all the values that even macros or competitors put in our way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Karen Short : So a couple questions on Pizza Hut. I guess your U.S. comp seemed to come in at the low end of expectations, at least as you stated at your December Analyst Day and international is a little uninspiring. So first question is any color as to why? And then I guess two related questions would be, you outlined the path to achieving a 3% comp at Pizza Hut at the Analyst Day with various initiatives, but it seems a little optimistic on a blended basis. And then the last portion of the question is there any way to accelerate the common POS conversion? Because it seems like one common system might really be the backbone that you would need before comps can really re-accelerate. Thanks. Greg Creed : Let me start with the U.S. comps. I mean, they were plus 2%; it was our best quarter in three years. And I agree, it doesn't -- it sort of pales with the KFC two-year conservate and talk about a 10%, but it was our best quarter in three years. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, I'm very encouraged by the start for 2016 for Pizza Hut. And what I'm encouraged about is how rapidly this whole idea of we need to make it easier to get better is going around the world. I know that in the past if I had turned up in Bangkok two months after we came up with an insight of easy beats better, I probably would not have seen that being impacted or reflected in the work either to make us better or make this easier. So I'm encouraged by the start for Pizza Hut in 2016. I have confidence that you will see us deliver sequential improvement in same-store sales this quarter versus the fourth quarter. And every journey has to start somewhere and I think that journey started in the fourth quarter of 2015. And then I am encouraged by how rapidly we are taking this idea and seeing it now being impacted and addressed by all of our teams around the world. Pat Grismer : And then, Karen, as to your question regarding the common POS, the team estimates it will take a couple of years to migrate all of the restaurants in the U.S. to a common platform. So they are targeting end of 2017 to accomplish that. It is a high priority, but given the extent of integration between those different POS systems and back-of-house and other applications, it will take some time in order to do it properly and minimize disruption to our business. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jason West : Just two separate questions. One, can you breakout in the China comp for the quarter kind of where you are on pricing and then I guess if mix was meaningful there as well? And then separately, Pat, now that we are a little closer to the leverage event, do you have any updates on how you're thinking about use of proceeds? Would you lean more on an accelerated share repurchase or are you also considering a special dividend or more of a gradual buyback? Thanks. Pat Grismer : Certainly. In terms of the China comp for the fourth quarter, the 2% increase reflected a 4% benefit from pricing and then we also had a positive benefit or impact of mix -- sales mix, and then that was offset by some transaction decline in getting to the 2% comp. With respect to our leverage event and use of proceeds, as you know, a lot of it comes down to valuation and where things are at, at the time. So it's early to say exactly how we're going to be returning the cash. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Andrew Charles : Pat, just a quick housekeeping, if you can give us the puts and takes on China margins this quarter. And then separately, as China food costs continue to be quite favorable, I know there's a little bit of inflation for next year as well as some more resilient pricing. Should we expect you to sacrifice this favorability for traffic in order to more aggressively pursue value in 2016, both China brands, relative to the promotions you ran in 4Q? Pat Grismer : Okay, Andrew. First in terms of the drivers of Q4 margin, we were very pleased with the performance in the quarter. Margins were up versus prior year about 4.5 percentage points, and here's how it breaks down. When you take the 4% pricing, add to it the mix benefit, and strip off the impact of the transaction decline, that's about a net 2 point benefit. On top of that, we had a 3 point benefit from productivity, and another 1 point benefit from closed stores. Offsetting that was a 1.5 margin attributable to inflation. Commodities were flat, but we had 6% inflation on labor. And so that's basically the lock to the 4.5 point gain in margin versus prior year. In terms of how we are thinking about 2016, as I mentioned before, the team is very much focused on building transactions. So while we do expect some modest inflation from a commodity perspective, up about 1% and high single digits for labor, we're not planning to take pricing to entirely offset that. We will look to some ongoing productivity improvements to help mitigate the impact of inflation. But the goal is to at least maintain margin year-over-year at around 16% and to achieve meaningful improvement in transactions. Andrew Charles : So essentially, food costs should be flat then within that construct? Pat Grismer : Andrew, we thought it would be about 1 point of inflation from a commodity standpoint for the year, if you're asking about 2016. Between flat and 1 point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Farmer : Just a single follow-up on a handful of earlier questions. So I believe it was at your December Analyst Meeting you noted that Pizza Hut Casual Dining is listed with several of the online aggregators. I think you said the sales mix coming from those channels is something less than 5% mix. I'm just curious : do you expect that sales mix to grow? And then more broadly and more importantly, what's the longer-term strategy with those aggregators as you move forward and they potentially become a little bit more powerful? Greg Creed : Jeff, I think to answer your question, they are still low with the percentage of the sales mix. I think in Q4 I think at KFC, they were about 2% of total sales. I think Pizza Hut Casual Dining was about 2% of total sales. I think Pizza Hut other service was about 30% of total sales, but obviously that's a small part of the pizza business. Yes, we are obviously working with these aggregators and we continue to participate with them. I think -- I would like to say they are now turned, so we don't lose the customer data or erode our brands in that process. So I think that's the critical part of the relationship is that the aggregators like working with big brands like us and we like obviously not -- making sure we keep our customer data and we make sure that we keep our plan positioning really clear in this marketplace. Jeff Farmer : And just one final question in terms of just gauging momentum. I know it's hard to do across multiple concepts, but is this still building or are you getting to sort of a tipping point where maybe it's got about as far as -- gone about as far as it is going to go and then it maybe it sort of settles back down as we get deeper into 2016 or 2017? Or again, really is this still continuing to be a building competitive issue as you move forward? Greg Creed : Do you mean aggregators? Jeff Farmer : Yes. Greg Creed : Yes. Look, I think, as I said, of the four factors that are impacting our business, when I spoke about earlier, I think for Pizza Hut, which were; macros, value, competition, and aggregators. I think they are the fourth. I think they will probably stay the fourth. I think our ability to deliver new value news in the marketplace will be a much greater driver of our improved performance than I see much growth with that. But it will continue to grow. There is no -- I'm not suggesting it won't continue to grow, but I think that because we have strong brands and the aggregators want to work with us as strong brands. I think that puts us in a more driver's seat in terms of how we play with them versus the small guys, who I think the aggregators will have different terms and arrangements with. So I feel good about where we are. I can tell you that the China team is all over it. Micky is very well versed. He's definitely met with the aggregators personally, so we're watching this. It will grow. But I think in that growth and value will be in the short term more important for us to address. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open. R.J. Hottovy: Had a technology question. During the prepared remarks, you said you were pleased with the level of mobile engagement at the Taco Bell brand and the deliveries that may come out of that. I just wonder, if you had any additional color on that and kind of the quantitative measures that we might be able to look at? And then secondly, any kind of takeaways or learnings you can apply to either the rest of the U.S. or even potentially on a global basis from those technology endeavors? Pat Grismer : Yes, I would say that we are very pleased with the progress we're making on the digital front at Taco Bell. You'll recall that we launched our Taco Bell app in the fourth quarter of 2014. To-date, we have about 5 million app downloads. When we look at the behavior of those customers who are ordering through the app, the average check is higher by about 30%. So we're very much encouraged by those early results. We are looking to build awareness of the app to drive utilization. And an important part of that is the introduction of a loyalty component to the app, a game. That was launched in late 2015. It's the first loyalty program of its kind that rewards social behavior and the first reward that was offered for customers who play the game was a free Taco Bell Freeze. So there is a lot of excitement around that. The app is also configured in a way that drives exploration of the menu. So it has helped to create a lot of buzz and a lot of active engagement with our heavy users, very high levels of social sharing of the rewards we've observed and the overall user response has been very positive. So the focus now is having launched the app and more recently, the loyalty program is to drive awareness. And so we do expect to see even greater trial in the coming months. The goal is, you know, for Taco Bell is to strengthen its position as an on-demand brand and so leveraging technology to do that is an important part of the brand's priority going forward. Greg Creed : What I really love about it is the customization that is going on. We recently just got certified by the American Vegetarian Association for Taco Bell. And we can highlight that -- we probably can't run an ad on TV to highlight that, but using the app, we can. And it's really interesting to see that we are actually getting people customized out of beef and into beans as a protein. And from a margin point of view, that's really good for us. But it also makes the customer happy. So what I love is that we can use the mobile app as a vehicle to actually talk a more discreet story about the brand. It's a great story, it's a good story, but it's something we wouldn't traditionally do on mainstream TV. But we can use this to get that message out, and that's making the brand more relevant. And making any brand more relevant is the name of the game. A - Steve Schmitt Thanks, R.J. Okay two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Westra from Stifel. Your line is open. Paul Westra : Two quick ones. One more on China. I was wondering, if you could give us general sales trends update on maybe where you saw some weaknesses or some strength by tiers or geographies or perhaps locations? And then second on Taco Bell. Was wondering, if you could give us a little bit more color on those G&A investments. What were they exactly? Can you confirm that the majority of the year-over-year spike in G&A at Taco Bell was of one-time nature, which you alluded to? Pat Grismer : Certainly, Paul. So first on China same-store sales, similar to recent quarters, performance was stronger in Tier 1 cities at both brands. Our view is that customers in lower tier cities have been more significantly impacted by the softening economy, particularly around the industrial cities, which have been more heavily affected by China's slowing export trade. But that's the only meaningful difference really to call out. And then as it relates to Taco Bell's G&A, as we mentioned, the increase in the fourth quarter was expected and it's fair to characterize a large chunk of the incremental G&A as being nonrecurring. So some components would include performance-driven incentive compensation, because they had an absolute blockbuster year, and so they were paid accordingly. We plan for a 100% payout, so that contributes to a year-over-year decline as we think about 2016. There were some investments that were made and some strategic growth initiatives that would highlight international supply chain development. I would also highlight the digital initiatives, like the ones we just talked about. And so that contributed to a spike in the fourth quarter. And importantly, we think about those as investments to sustain the positive momentum of the brand. I think good businesses that are strong performing businesses reinvest profit upside to sustain the momentum and that's exactly what's happened at Taco Bell. Greg Creed : The way I look at it, look the new plants that you -- trees that you plant and the ones that are growing both need water. You just can't throw water on the new plants. You got to throw water on the big strong trees to make sure they continue to be big, strong, and keep going. And that's what I saw in that investment in the fourth quarter. I'm glad we made it. I'm delighted we made it. It was the right thing to do, and you are going to see that in the performance of Taco Bell going forward. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Joseph Buckley : Thanks for squeezing me in. Two more questions on Pizza Hut China. First, you mentioned the smaller tier markets being hit harder by the macro. The Pizza Hut expansion numbers the last three or four years have been pretty aggressive, and have you extended the brand into areas where the economic development did not follow or are there cannibalization issues behind Pizza Hut? And then secondly in Pizza Hut, I know you mentioned a 20% reduction in expansion will be across both brands. But within Pizza Hut, how will that break down in financial plans for 2016 between home delivery and casual dining? Pat Grismer : Yes, for -- first of all, I will address your last question first, Joe, and that is that the slowdown in development for the Pizza Hut brand is only for the casual dining business, not for the delivery business. And then as it relates to the performance of Pizza Hut across cities, I would not attribute variable performance to development decisions and higher than expected cannibalization necessarily. It would be more a function of variable levels of macro pressure across these cities. Joseph Buckley : Okay. And Pat just to follow-up then. So the Casual Dining Pizza Hut expansion would be down much more than 20%, with the difference made up by faster home delivery? And what about the sales volume differences there in terms of trying to figure out the growth? Pat Grismer : No Joe, the 20% -- the approximately 20% applies exclusively to the casual dining business. That's not a composite number for both businesses under the Pizza Hut banner. Joseph Buckley : Okay. But it's 20% for both KFC and Pizza Hut or are they both\u2026 Pat Grismer : For KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. We are not slowing down the development of Pizza Hut home service. Joseph Buckley : Okay. Will that accelerate the latter? Pat Grismer : We are expecting it to be at least as much as we developed in 2015. Joseph Buckley : Okay. Okay, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Greg Creed : Okay. Well, I think that wraps it up. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. Thank you for taking the time to be with us. And I know I've said this as well, but I do want to thank Pat. Pat joined Yum! at Taco Bell when I was the CMO and he was the Head of Strategic Planning. He has been a true friend. He has been a great resource. He has been a great leader, and I want to thank him. And I want to wish he and his family all the very best for the future. Thanks. Thanks everybody.

LLC Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Amy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands' First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Thank you. Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy, you may begin your conference. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; and Dave Russell, our Interim CFO. Also on today's call is Larry Gathof, Yum!'s Treasurer, and we're very pleased to have Micky Pant, Yum! China CEO on our call as well. Following remarks from Greg and Dave, we'll open the call to questions from the entire team. Please keep in mind, Micky is dialing in from Shanghai, so there could be a slight delay in some of his responses. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands website, www.yum.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. We would like to make you aware of the following upcoming Yum! Investor Event, our second quarter 2016 earnings will be released on Wednesday, July 13. Now, before I turn the call over to Greg, I would like to bring your attention to two items you may have noticed in yesterday's release. First is new terminology, we reported core operating profit growth of 21% for the first quarter of 2016. Core operating profit growth is our operating profit growth year-over-year, excluding foreign currency translation and special items. Second, as previously announced, effective January of this year, the company's India business integrated its three brands into our global brand divisions. Prior year figures have been restated in the release. Now, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016, with better than expected core operating profit growth of 21% in the first quarter. This includes 42% growth in our China business due to outstanding Chinese New Year results at KFC, underscoring the power of the KFC brand in China when we deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. Company-wide, all four of our divisions posted positive same-store sales and operating profit growth in constant currency. Furthermore, we are on track to finalize the spin-off of our China business by year end, creating two powerful independent, focused growth companies. As you saw in our release, we're raising full year core operating profit growth guidance for Yum! Brands to 12% from 10% previously. Even though it is still early in the year, we are confident about the revised guidance, and will update you as the year progresses. Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then Dave Russell, our Interim CFO, will walk you through the financials. So first China. For the China Division, same store sales grew 6%, led by 12% same-store sales growth at KFC. Our KFC business, as a reminder, represents about 75% of our operating profit in China. We saw particular success at KFC during the Chinese New Year with Bucket Meals, which we tailored across four customer groups, ranging from kid's buckets to larger group meals. As a result, buckets mix had a much higher percentage than normally. This lifted average ticket as we focused more on group occasions. And we gained even more consumer insights this year, which will help our business both going forward as well as next New Year. Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which represents about 25% of our operating profit in China, remained challenging. System sales declined 1%, and same-store sales declined 12% in the quarter. A tough macro environment and competitive landscape continued to weigh on performance. We're addressing this with urgency, but realize a recovery will take time. So wrapping up on China, we're pleased with our first quarter's overall operating profit growth, which came in well ahead of our expectations. The strong margin performance reinforces our confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we generate sales growth, profit flow-through is impressive. As Steve mentioned, Micky Pant, our China Division CEO, is on the call today and will be happy to assist in answering questions you may have on the China business. Now, turning to our three global brand divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 1% in the first quarter or 5% on a two-year stack. Operating profit grew 7% in constant currency when adjusting for incremental advertising spend in the U.S. The division opened 79 new international restaurants in 32 countries. 77% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 71% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets. System sales and international developed markets grew 5% and international emerging markets grew 8%. I recently visited with the team in Canada and was thrilled to see the assets being upgraded and the marketing position around Always Original. With 6% same-store sales growth in the quarter, I would say it's working. I'm also pleased to see success in emerging markets, which are a key contributor to KFC's growth story. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse, and I'm confident the brand is getting even stronger and will produce strong growth this year and for many years to come. Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in the quarter, and was led by 5% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. Our $5 Flavor Menu helped drive system transactions, with company stores leading the way, up 8% in the quarter. Our discipline around making it easier to get a better pizza is holistic and driving traffic. We are focused on the entire customer experience, from ordering, payment and delivery tracking, to our assets and menu. And I believe this quarter's results are further testament to our maniacal emphasis on this way of thinking. We are on track to replace over 1,300 U.S. ovens in 2016. For those stores replacing older ovens, this should result in average energy savings of 25% in ongoing operational costs and a faster cook time. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focusing on balancing premium price innovation, such as Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza to protect and improve unit level economics with compelling value offerings such as our ongoing $6.99 Any Pairs deal. All of this will enable us to provide our customers with a better pizza at great value. Our international business at Pizza Hut saw systems sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were especially strong in Latin America and Canada but offset by weaknesses in Korea, Australia, and India. We are committed to offering consistent everyday value to our customers, and will leverage proven value strategies across markets with similar characteristics. We have high expectations for the international Pizza Hut business. Over the last five years, we have opened 1,200 international restaurants, and we will continue to grow this business over time. The bottom line is that we have established solid momentum with our strategy in the U.S., especially around the $5 Flavor Menu. And as we roll this overall strategy out internationally, we hope to achieve similar success. Now, turning to Taco Bell, same-store sales grew 1%, lapping 6% growth a year ago, and operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Restaurant margins were an impressive 21%. While 1% same-store sales growth is not what we're used to seeing at Taco Bell, the timing of our key launches had an impact on same-store sales growth for the quarter. The Quesalupa, which launched in February, makes it almost 10% and drove a meaningful lift in transactions. We also launched our $1 breakfast menu in March. The $1 price point is consistent with Taco Bell's reputation as the value leader in QSR. Taco Bell's new breakfast $1 Value Menu differentiates itself from the competitors and puts it at the forefront of value in a growing daypart. We now have 10 $1 items on the breakfast menu, and are seeing breakfast sales hold at 8% and transaction growth accelerating. The Taco Bell team is exhibiting great flexibility to read and react to the competitive value pressures, and adjusted their 2016 promotional calendar accordingly to highlight even more value. Insight-driven innovation, cravable food, and breakthrough value such as the upcoming launches of the $1 Beefy Crunch Burrito and steak value later this year, should boost sales and further the brand's momentum. So, we're off to a great start at Yum! Over the past several quarters, we have really had three businesses that needed dramatic improvement : KFC China, Pizza Hut China, and Pizza Hut U.S. I'm pleased that we have been able to turn two out of these three businesses, as KFC China and Pizza Hut U.S. are on more solid footing. Now, let's be clear, we're not out of the woods on these businesses, but we've made a lot of progress and will continue to focus on delivering better results. As you heard me say before, this is a transformational year for Yum! as we finalize the spin-off of our China business, creating two powerful, independent focus growth companies. Our brand strength, unwavering focus on the customer, and innovative food offerings driven by consumer insights will allow us to grow Yum! into an even better global company. This is an exciting time and pivotal time for our company, and I look forward to what the future holds. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Dave. David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas : our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on our planned recapitalization and a spin-off of our China business. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results where core operating profit increased 21%. EPS before special items grew 19%, including a five-point negative impact from foreign currency. These results were led by better than expected sales and restaurant margins at KFC China. EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our first quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. I'll now take you through our results by division starting with our China business. For the China Division, overall, same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. KFC grew same-store sales 12%, which was sequentially better than Q4, and exceeded our expectations. A successful Chinese New Year promotion drove results. As Greg said, the KFC brand in China is really powerful when you deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining remain sluggish, declining 12% in the quarter. We are working to turn the Pizza Hut business around in a difficult macro and competitive environment. Restaurant margin improved 3.5 percentage points versus the prior year to 22.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC, productivity initiatives, and commodity deflations, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. While our first quarter is a seasonally high sales period for the China Division, restaurant margins of over 22% give us tremendous confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we deliver solid top-line growth, the profits are impressive. One other note on China's first quarter results, we had a leap year benefit that added an additional $6 million of operating profit in Q1 to China's results. However, we pulled sales from the leap day out of our same-store sales calculation, so the extra day had no impact on our reported 6% same-store sales growth. The way our reporting calendars work here at Yum!, none of our other divisions saw any impact from leap year in Q1. Now, moving to our global KFC Division, which posted its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales and profit growth. Emerging and international developed markets, each grew comps 1%. The U.S. recorded its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth despite overlapping 7% comps in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins improved 30 basis points in constant currency, and core operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental advertising expense associated with the Acceleration Agreement we reached with our franchisees in 2015, core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, the Acceleration Agreement with our U.S. franchisees, which went into effect during the second quarter of last year called for us to invest incremental media of $20 million in 2016 as opposed to $10 million last year. Our global Pizza Hut Division delivered 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 5% same-store sales growth on our U.S. business. Same-store sales growth and lower G&A expenses drove core operating profit growth of 9%. This is the best result we've seen on Pizza Hut U.S. in years, and we believe our strategy is working to drive incremental transactions. I am pleased to see momentum behind the business, and believe we can transfer our U.S. learnings to benefit the system globally. Digital continues to grow in importance to our sales, comprising 46% of U.S. delivery and carryout sales, a three percentage point increase versus a year ago. On Super Bowl Sunday alone, we took over 500,000 digital orders, representing about 50% of sales on what was an all-time record day for the business. With digital orders comes higher levels of loyalty and higher average spend, so we are investing as you would expect. Along those lines, we are making progress in migrating to a single point of sale system in the U.S. by the end of 2017, which will allow us to be more nimble as we roll out digital initiatives going forward. Finally, Taco Bell faced increased value pressure from the burger chains in the first quarter, and posted 1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved throughout the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving 3% same-store sales growth for the year, with a stronger second half than first half. Despite the lower than expected full quarter sales, operating margin improved 150 basis points to 28%, and operating profit grew 4%. Restaurant margins also improved 150 basis points at 21%, and we expect full-year margins to be greater than 20% this year, albeit slightly lower than last year. On the development front, we opened 49 new restaurants in the first quarter, with 90% opened by franchisees and licensees. Of our new openings, seven were international units. We expect to open a record number of Taco Bell units internationally in 2016 as we continue to make progress in building out the unit level economics as we enter the new countries. I'd now like to shift to our 2016 outlook with our strong first quarter results and a change in China's tax laws whereby a value-added tax, or VAT, is replacing the business tax, we are raising our full year core operating profit growth forecast to 12% from 10% for Yum! For a little bit of background on the VAT, China recently announced further reform to its retail tax structure, which is intended to be a progressive and positive shift to more closely align with the more modern service-based economy. Under this reform, a 6% output VAT would replace the 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be credible to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. This change is effective May 1, 2016, so it in no way had any impact on our first quarter performance. While it's difficult to estimate the impact of this VAT reform prior to its actual implementation, Yum! China currently expects a positive financial benefit, further enabling continued investment in the business, and creating thousands of additional jobs in China. While we are raising our forecast for core operating profit growth from Yum! from 10% to 12%, we are maintaining our guidance for China same-store sales of 2% to 3% for the full year. From a modeling standpoint, there are two other things to bear in mind as you build your forecast. First, the second quarter in China, which is typically our seasonally low quarter, happens to be our toughest hurdle of the year on a two-year, three-year, and four-year stacked same-store sales basis. Second, we have an RGM convention in the second quarter that we did not have last year that we expect to cost around $7 million. It is important for you to note that these factors were fully factored into our initial guidance and our first half and full year performance is expected to exceed our expectations coming into the year. All in for Yum!, we outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, and are raising our full year guidance to 12% core operating profit growth, including the 53rd week. This takes into account the strong first quarter produced by KFC China, weakness at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, and the expected VAT benefit in China, in addition to our brand divisions continuing to produce results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. It is early in the year to raise guidance, but we feel confident given where things stand and we'll update you as the year progresses. Now, I'd like to quickly update you on our spin-off plans. We remain on track to complete the spin-off by year end. We plan on filing our initial Form-10 by early May, and conducting comprehensive road shows ahead of the separation. This spin-off will establish two unique investment opportunities, and create one of the largest U.S.-listed China retail businesses. Another key aspect of our strategy is to optimize the capital structure of Yum!. Given the significant improvement we've seen recently in the debt markets, we'd like to announce another milestone in our previously communicated plan of targeting company-wide leverage of approximately 5 times EBITDA. In early May, we plan to enter into a new financing facility of at least $2 million, securitizing Taco Bell U.S. royalties. As the next step in our plan, subsidiaries that operate our KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell's businesses, excluding the Taco Bell subsidiaries included in the securitization financing are expected to enter into a new senior secured credit facility and issue new high-yield notes. More details will be forthcoming in a separate release later today. In line with what we've previously communicated, we plan to complete our rate (19:26) capitalization and have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding by the end of the second quarter. Finally, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have bought back 24.7 million shares at an average price of $71, returning a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, excluding dividends. As previously announced, our recap will enable us to complete an additional $4.4 billion return of capital return to shareholders. So let me wrap things up. I'm pleased we started 2016 off with a strong quarter. We're confident we'll deliver 12% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business into an independent publicly-traded company. We're working diligently to set up both companies for future success and look forward to updating you on any progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Greg. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Dave. Before we start Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update on our plans for the China business. You may have seen recent news stories about a sale or a potential strategic investor. I want to assure you that we are fully committed to maximizing the value of our China business for the benefit of our shareholders, and we will carefully consider all options to achieve that goal. As you know, we announced in October that after careful consideration, we believe that the best way to maximize shareholder value is to spin off our China business by the end of this year, and we are making great progress towards the spin-off. We won't have any further comment on this. And with that, I'll open the call up to Q&A. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Gentlemen, your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Fundamental question about China for Micky, if I may. Regarding Pizza Hut, what have you done so far, perhaps even through the second quarter to date, with regard to the menu and the marketing? I know you wanted to get back to that five-star dining at three-star prices. Have you done stuff so far? How is that working? And how has your thinking generally evolved about the timetable for a turnaround for the Pizza Hut brand? Thanks. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Thank you, David. I hope you can hear me, because I had a bit of trouble. I'll speak slowly. First, on Pizza Hut, I just wanted to say to all of you that it is an extremely strong brand in China. All our consumer metrics, the brand image tracking that we do regularly shows that brand regard value scores, food scores are very high and they recovered fully from the crisis that we had a couple of years ago. We opened 280 new Pizza Huts last year, and new unit returns are very good. Over the last four years, we have opened 1,000 Pizza Huts dine-in restaurants alone and we dwarf the competition. So it is a very strong brand. It is true that same-store sales have been negative, but in 2015, for example, our system sales were up 10 points, and we do track through CREST in 22 cities, and also through publicly reported companies that operate in casual dining here the overall casual dining performance. And it is our understanding that we gained market share. Part of the reason the casual dining sector has been hit has been due to a decline in consumer confidence. And as we explained in December last year, part of it was on account of the fact that home delivery through aggregators was growing. This latter phenomenon has tapered off a bit on account of burnouts, et cetera. So we fully expect that Pizza Hut will turn the corner. It is a strong brand. Margin performance has been good. Our sales were minus 1% system sales in the first quarter, but our goal is to get to same-store sales positive. I cannot put a date on it, David, because the market is volatile, but we are doing a number of things. First is that we have shifted the focus back to the core menu with a lot of pizza activity. So we will have more pizza innovation in the next six months than we've had in a long time, and these have tested very well. The second, I believe, is our value scores are actually good. You can eat lunch at a Pizza Hut at just a little more than at a KFC. So there's no need for any margin compression, but we do need to communicate that value better, which we have started doing. We have clarified the brand position significantly, and we've hired one of the best celebrities in China to bring that point home. And lastly, we continue to emphasize customer service for the programs that will be presented in December. So with that, I feel much better about Pizza Hut than I did a few months ago, but of course, I'm disappointed that same-store sales are still negative. And I might also remind you, as you know very well, that Pizza Hut is about 25% of our sales and our profit. So one way to look at it is that three of the four engines that drive the Yum! China business are KFC. And with KFC performing well, I think we have the ability to sort Pizza Hut in coming quarters. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Micky. Thanks, David. Amy, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Micky, I'll keep you on the line. On KFC, you talked about the bucket promotion being an essential driver. So how much of the success in the first quarter was related just to that? And I guess related, how if it was very \u2013 if it was a successful promotion, how much of that sustains going forward? If you can talk about sustainability of those sales, maybe since we're well into April here. And can you also just \u2013 commodities were significantly deflationary this quarter. I think they are supposed to be up this year. So are you changing your view on commodities, or was this just the timing of better commodities in the first quarter but not for the year? Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, it's Greg. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Yeah, John \u2013 go ahead. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll just...no, no, I'm just going to jump in first and then obviously let you provide the detail. Look, first, I want to commend Micky and the entire China team for what I think is a fantastic Q1. KFC China delivered 12% same-store sales growth, and as you can see from the 42% growth in op profit, the earnings power of the business is extraordinary when sales are working in our favor. And we're very encouraged that we have now had three consecutive quarters of same-store sales at KFC China. I think, fortunately, we didn't assume and we don't need heroic numbers like this to continue throughout the year to reach our 2016 guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth. And recent history shows that sales in China have been difficult for us to call. So regarding our expectations coming into the year, KFC sales were obviously much better in Q1 than we could've imagined. In Q2, we are closer to where we thought we would be for KFC as we believe that our successful Chinese New Year may have pulled forward some of our early Q2 sales into Q1. That said, six weeks into the quarter, KFC sales are slightly positive, and we're encouraged by where the business is going. And obviously, I'll let Micky speak to that in more detail. And as \u2013 we know that we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut in China and quarter-to-date, sales have remained double-digit negative. But again, as Dave mentioned, our Q2 laps at both KFC and Pizza Hut's more difficult, especially when you look at these multi-year stacks. We feel great about the start to the year. We're confidently raising our guidance. We still expect China full year \u2013 China Division same-store sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, which is consistent with our expectations. So with that, I'll just let Micky take over. I just wanted to compliment Micky and the team for a job well done. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Thank you, Greg. I think, John, there were some factors that were unique to Q1 and that is to do with the Chinese New Year. It was the Year of the Monkey, and we were fortunate that the \u2013 actually, it was not just fortune, but the team of KFC has really hit their stride. So Joey Wat, who is a very accomplished retail executive, has now really understood the rhythm of the KFC business. And they put together sort of a one, two, three punch around the Chinese New Year, extending it from the traditional 10 days to about four weeks, centered around a very powerful bucket promotion. But also then with activity afterwards featuring a grilled sandwich, which was good thinking, because after a heavy Chinese New Year, people are looking for a healthier fare. So that aspect is unique to the Chinese New Year, and I think it was a spectacularly successful promotion. Somebody asked me how we will ever lap that next year, and I think the one bit of good news we have is next year is actually the Year of the Chicken, so we started work already on the sort of promotion that we will be running. But some of the factors that worked in Q1 actually give me encouragement for KFC overall. The first is the success of selling our core products : fried chicken, hot wings, french fries, egg tarts, and all the familiar favorites in China. And we are extending that principle by doing more activity around buckets in the back half of the year, and also introducing Box Meals, which are a proven international success where you can buy fairly good \u2013 just like a little bit more money, but significantly more product. As you can imagine, following a very large success in January and February, we hit almost record volumes in the amount of chicken that we did sell, and also that sale was accompanied by corresponding traffic growth. The ticket impact on our sales of plus 12% in Q1 was about 3%. So it wasn't as though the \u2013 sorry, the pricing impact. It wasn't as though we took pricing to get there. The price impact was only plus 3%. The rest of it was on account of the fact that party sizes for these large buckets were very large, and also there was a significant increase in the number of items bought per person, because the promotion was very well run. In Q2, we're about halfway through the quarter. The pleasing thing is that KFC is positive. But as Greg said, there's a lot of volatility around it. It's a difficult quarter because we've got tough laps. We've had some expenses. Our goal as a team here is to make Q2 this year the fourth consecutive quarter of positive KFC same-store sales. But I cannot say that that's a guarantee until we have more visibility. But the fact that the flow-through was very strong in profit terms, the simplification of the menu boards, which was well conducted, the strength of the marketing calendar in the back half gives me and the team a lot more confidence that we had six months ago. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Micky. David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : First, to further what Micky said a little bit, too \u2013 the timing of Chinese New Year, with it being a little bit earlier this year, did provide a slight benefit to Q1 which will be a little bit \u2013 hurts Q2 a little bit. So that was a little bit on the sales line. As far as your commodities question, John, we saw a 2% decline in commodities in China during the first quarter. And we are still on our forecast for plus 1% for the full year. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, John. Amy, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Joseph, your line is open. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thank you. You gave a little bit of this in answer to the last question, but could you talk about traffic versus price versus mix for both KFC China and KFC Pizza Hut during the quarter? Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Yeah, Joe, it's Steve. For the division, we had about \u2013 for the 6% comp for the division, we had nine points of check growth and a three-point decline in transactions overall. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Presumably, though, positive transactions at KFC? Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : That's the number for the division. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Yes, we had positive transactions at KFC. And as I said that the transaction number as we measured it is the number of tickets we cut in the store. But as I explained, the size of the ticket was bigger on account of shareable meals, principally the bucket. So we estimate that the price impact on our sales was about 3%, and the rest of it was on account of traffic plus a larger check on account of more items being bought. So it was a fairly healthy growth. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. And then just switching topics for a moment, Pizza Hut U.S. numbers look pretty good. Pizza Hut international slightly negative. Can you talk a little bit about Pizza Hut international, and what's going on there, and what changes you can implement there? Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, certainly, Joe. I think the good news, as you said, is Pizza Hut U.S. had an excellent quarter, same-store sales up 5%, company transactions were up 8%. I think a combination of the $6.99 Pairs and the $5 Flavor Menu have certainly worked. And obviously, what we're doing now is in the process of taking that success and all the tactics that are associated with that and expanding that rapidly on a global basis. So like all things, this business is very much driven by our U.S. success, and I think what we're doing now is in the process of rolling out that U.S. success and taking it around on a global basis. I happened to be in Thailand, actually in January, earlier in the year and you can see already that that team was starting to take the successful tactics that were working and start to see how we can implement those in that country. And that's happening around the world. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Joe. Next question, please, Amy. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Two unrelated questions, if I may. First one for you, Micky. For a number of years now, labor costs, labor dollars per operating week in China have been a pretty major contributor to margins. As you do plan to re-grow customer traffic, obviously, in the segment and want to stay competitive with wages, are we at the point now where labor starts to inflect the other way, and adding back costs into the system that have been taken out over the last several years? Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Well, it's true that over the last five years labor has inflated in China on account of minimum wage increases by the government. But we've seen a moderation of that. I think the authorities recognize that the economy has to be supported, so I think we're seeing a more reasonable picture there. What we did get in the quarter particularly was some good productivity gains on account of using more part-time and student labor, which is a phenomenon that did not exist in China in the long past, and that is making a difference. So looking forward, it's always a risk, but I don't see labor price inflation as being a significant risk. I think the key for us is going to be product innovation, sensible pricing, and get traffic scores back. So I hope that helps. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. And then secondly, I thought the commentary on the capital structure was interesting in that part of the new capital structure is going to be a royalty securitization only to Taco Bell, which I don't think your previous debt actually assigned itself to individual brands. So I just wanted to understand the symbolism behind the debt security that's only related to Taco Bell. And could people's imagination start to think that Taco Bell doesn't necessarily remain a part of Yum! over the long-term if an opportunity arises? W. Lawrence Gathof - Treasurer & Vice President : Hi, John, it's Larry Gathof. I'll answer the debt aspect of it anyways. But what we're doing is we're trying to take advantage of the debt markets in total. So we're looking at doing both a securitization, bank and bond debt. So we're putting debt across all the different avenues to again get the best pricing and optimize our balance sheet. The Taco Bell securitization is only going to be on the U.S. Taco Bell franchise and license fees. So it's just that part. The rest of the Taco Bell business will also be part of the other borrowings. So again, the securitization market, quite honestly, isn't deep enough to do any one of our entire businesses. So we just peeled off the piece that we thought was most appropriate for a securitization and are accessing that market. And then again, we'll have the balance of the borrowings across all three brands after that's completed. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, John, to put it bluntly, I wouldn't want anyone to take away any thinking that we're going to be doing anything to Taco Bell, other than love it as a part of the portfolio, love its growth, love its profit contribution, and love that it is a brand that we can take global. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, John. Amy, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with UBS. Keith, your line is open. Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Greg, just a question for you, having come from the Taco Bell brand and having watched that brand be one of the leaders in terms of overall digital engagement, mobile ordering and more, where do you \u2013 how do you feel about the rest of the U.S. portfolio and positioning now? Are you making the progress you want? Is Pizza Hut becoming more of a leader in its categories? Is KFC also coming along? And then what about tests on delivery for other brands like home meal replacement for KFC and even for Taco Bell. Is the rest of the U.S. portfolio catching up to Taco Bell? Where do we stand? Thanks. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Keith, good question, and I would say yes. I think the great thing is we can codify what makes Taco Bell successful; and obviously the other two brands can obviously track with what they've done and obviously attempt to replicate it, but in their own brand voice. So I'm very pleased with the progress that Pizza Hut's making. I think its positioning around making it easier to get a better pizza, I think not only the sales growth but the transaction growth that we just got. Obviously, part of making it easier was to get our value better on Pizza Hut, which we've done. But I think you \u2013 as we also said on the call, we are investing in technology. We do need to get from nine POS systems down to one POS system. But as we also said, 46% of our delivery carryout sales are digital and that's growing. So I do think we're making good progress there. On the KFC side, I think the Always Original positioning, the move back to Finger Lickin' Good, the great thing about KFC in the U.S. is it's the brand that's now being talked about. And I think for a long time it wasn't on anyone's radar screen, so I'm very comfortable. I think the launch of Nashville Hot has really helped. Obviously, there is a value game being played by the burger boys because of beef pricing; but I think the return to $5 boxes has been a good move by the KFC team. And then for Taco Bell, yes, the answer is I think we're now in 500 stores doing delivery in a couple of the key cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas. I'm not quite sure where else, but \u2013 so that's been expanded. And I think if you just take the overall concept of easy beats better, which I know the Pizza Hut team originated, but what it basically says is yes, we've got to find ways to make it easier for our people, for customers to get to our brands. We do that two ways : we build more units, but we also obviously will start looking at delivery as a way to get our food to customers in their home. So very good question. We're making progress. The other brands, I think, are moving to where the Taco Bell brand strength is. A lot of work to be done, but I think we're moving in the right direction. I'm encouraged by that. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Keith. Amy, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David, your line is open. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. My question is on the guidance for the year. And I was wondering if you could provide some additional detail or insight on what you're assuming for China profit growth for the year in that guidance and maybe also the margin that you expect to deliver in that business for the full year. David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : Sure. So, the first thing I'd say is if you're going to have a good quarter at Yum!, you want it to be the first quarter of the year, which is what we certainly did and had a blowout quarter in China. So when we looked at that first quarter, as well as some of the other \u2013 the tailwinds we have in the business with regards to the VAT we talked about earlier, though, it's very difficult to quantify the benefit, we know there's something there, some of the commodity deflation that we're seeing, we felt very confident that even with some of the other headwinds we're facing, particularly Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, of getting to a number that was up 12% for the year. As we said, we have not yet \u2013 we have not adjusted the same-store sales forecast for the balance of year for China. It's just too difficult to call given we're only three and a half months in. But at this point, we feel very comfortable with the 12%. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean the way I look at it is to raise guidance in the first quarter demonstrates a degree of confidence we've got in the year. As we said, there will be some puts and calls as the year unfolds, no doubt; but we felt confident in raising it from 10% to 12%. David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : And you asked specifically about the margins in China. Given they are so dependent upon sales, we're still thinking somewhere along \u2013 we're not coming off our guidance from the beginning of the year around 16% at this point. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And I guess \u2013 if 'm still on, I guess if the margin guidance still is around 16% for the year, I guess I'm a little confused on that, given the over-performance in Q1. Was there something that changed about the outlook for the last three quarters? Or is this some level of conservatism that you're baking in or perhaps... David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : No, I don't think so. I don't think we're thinking about it necessarily in that level of detail. I think we're saying it's just too early. We're off to a great start. With the Q1 success that we had, we feel very good with the 12%. But I don't think you should be reading that into the balance of your forecast. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, David. Amy, next question, please. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two things. Just one, I was hoping to get a little bit more color from Micky on the China side. Obviously, with the short-term strength, which seems to be attributed to the New Year's promotion, just wondering how, in your mind, you perhaps separate that from the longer-term recovery efforts? Just it seems like you're confident that the brand, I think, you said has really turned. But then it seems like maybe in March and in April things have really eased. So I'm just wondering how you think about the business over the next 12 months in terms of just short-term spikes because of promotion versus the long-term trajectory improving. And then I had one follow-up on Taco Bell U.S. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Yeah, well, thanks, Jeffrey. Like I said, I think the team and myself are feeling very much more confident. We just this week had all of our store managers, so we had a stadium in the city of Dalian with 8,000 people talking about the theme for the future, which is From Strength to Strength. And in particular, when the KFC section was discussed and we put out plans for the rest of the year and the positioning and the proposed marketing, there was just an unbounded confidence. So I feel that \u2013 I really feel the brand is making a lot of progress. It is much stronger. I think the positioning is very clear. The calendars are strong. We are doing sensible things around the core of the brand. We've already cleaned up the menu boards. We will do that even more. We're introducing proven international winners. I think you always have to be cautious when you come to China, because there is economic volatility, and there is also unexpected twists and turns. So there is nothing hidden; it is not as though we are worried about some specific event or there is something happening that causes us to worry. But you just want to be cautious. We've had two years or three years of a lot of volatility. So the way we are looking at it right now is it's a show me, don't tell me sort of story. And we're hoping quarter after quarter to improve and strengthen the business. I think it's been mentioned a number of times Q2 is going to be a difficult quarter on account of a variety of factors. But we are very focused on seeing whether we can deliver positive same-store sales and take it from there. So, on KFC I feel confident. I feel that the brand is making a lot of progress. The other thing we didn't talk about today is that we've spent a lot of energy and are going to be taking very good care of store refurbishment. We have good designs, we've got good plans for aggressive refurbs of some of our older stores. We are opening a symbolically important 5,000th store in Shanghai, which is, I think, maybe the best KFC in the world. It's a state-of-the-art green store which will open next week. So I think the brand is making progress on every front. On Pizza Hut, like I said before, I am very disappointed at negative same-store sales. And I don't see any reason why we cannot turn it around. There is no intrinsic reason. All our scores are good; our competitive position is fantastic. There really is no international competitor with the name. And in addition to the 1,500 dine-in stores we've got about 300 delivery units which dwarf the competition. So I feel the brands are really genuinely making progress. It's just that it's been two months \u2013 the first quarter was two months. And to make a call on the rest of the year knowing what we've seen over the last three years seems to be out of the bounds of what we should be doing. So that hopefully gives you some context on the way we're looking at it. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: For sure. And then just, Greg, I just wanted to follow up. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: You made a comment about the Taco Bell U.S. It seems like maybe it was a little light of your internal expectation, which I think you attributed to maybe some of the QSR burger competitors taking advantage of favorable beef. So I'm just wondering, just to get a better understanding of your response, does it seem like getting more aggressive presumably on value? I know you've obviously been with the brand for a long time and gone through these phases before. But just the idea that you'd progressively pursue the discounting versus staying the course with your initial plan, just trying to get your thoughts. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Jeffrey. I think the first thing I want to do is just correct it. Apparently in my prepared remarks I think I said the breakfast mix was 8%; it's actually 6%. The 8% is actually the transaction growth that we got in breakfast in Q1, so I just want to clarify that. By the way, I'm very happy with 8% transaction growth in breakfast with one of our competitors doing All Day Breakfast. So let me just say that. So to answer your question, yes, we had tied the launch of the Quesalupa to the Super Bowl. I tried to get the Super Bowl brought forward a couple of weeks because that would have really helped us, but unfortunately the NFL wasn't going to play along. So we were so tied up to the launch with that event that there was a couple of weeks where we were a little naked, I would say. And so obviously, sales and transactions up to there were soft. The good news is that after that event, the Quesalupa has mixed at over 10% and has done well for us. But I think even more importantly Brian, who is doing a great job leading the brand, he and the team have already changed the calendar and in fact, today, we will launch some new $1 items into the marketplace. There have been a number of revisions to the calendar. So I think we can still be an incredibly innovative brand, a socially conscious brand, led by digital. But we can also just get our value so it's more than competitive in the marketplace. I think talking to Brian the other day, he and I still have a lot of confidence we'll deliver the at least 3% same-store sales growth for the year at Taco Bell. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Jeff. Amy, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management. Howard, your line is open. Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC : Hi. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help me with the Chinese culture and what the zodiac calendar and chicken means next year in terms of what that asset potentially could do for business. Thanks. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Yeah. I don't think it is a very serious factor, frankly. The Year of the Dragon and the Monkey are particular significance. Every year is important. One interesting feature that Joey and the team put together was they actually introduced a Christmas Bucket in 2015 December which was reasonably successful, so they are dialing that up. So I think the point really is that if you do a good bucket-oriented calendar in December for Christmas and then Chinese New Year next year, we can look to a good performance. The success of the Monkey \u2013 the Year of the Monkey promotion has shown to us the importance of choosing the character well, the toys that go with it, the kids meals that accompany it, which will all help us to build for the future. And I think the Year of the Chicken does help. There is no better authority on chicken than KFC. But I don't think it's going to be culturally that significant that people have to eat chicken in the Year of the Chicken or something like that. So it's a help. And all I was saying was that to lap this very successful Year of the Monkey promotion, that's one little gift on our side. Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC : Okay, and if I could ask... Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Go for it. Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC : Sorry. Thank you. So, Greg, nine months ago, obviously, the quarter wasn't as strong as you would have hoped. And then we go through the process of you spinning out the China business and talking about the change of the structure of the company and now nine months forward things look a lot better. I was wondering if you could maybe put tangible evidence around an intangible question. And that is, what the changes internally to the employees of Yum! and Yum! China have done to help turn the business around? I don't know if I'm asking that correctly, but I think part of the reason for doing this spin was maybe to focus on the different assets. And this obviously was a fantastic quarter and for all those reasons \u2013 maybe some of those reasons \u2013 I'm struggling to ask the question properly. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's all right. Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC : But just wondering if some of them \u2013 thank you. Sorry. Go ahead. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Howard, I'll have a go. I think I couldn't be happier to have Micky leading the team. Micky has an enormous amount of just experience, has the confidence of all of us, and did an amazing job running our international business for such a long period of time on all three brands. So I've got a leader in there who I have the utmost confidence in and who has rallied the team in China. We've got great people leading the brands, Joey and Peter. They are just \u2013 they're really \u2013 I think I was there in March looking at the plans, looking at what they've learned from the lessons. Our culture is alive and well in China. So the whole recognition culture and our belief that culture fuels results, I think, was absolutely evident. And I think at the same time, what's also happening in the whole business is that we're getting much better at brand building and strengthening our brand positioning. And so I think China \u2013 I would say the words aren't exactly always original; I thinks it's: be your true self. But they pretty much resonate. We've now got this brand on a global positioning so we can leverage things. Micky has reached out and taken things like the $5 boxes that have been incredibly successful in a number of markets. As he said, they will go into the market soon in China. The Pizza Hut team is looking at a new positioning for Pizza Hut. And as Micky said, I think focusing on the pizza and less on the more and getting back to the core will help that brand as well. So I would sum it up as new leader, great leader, fresh perspective, great team, more global alignment, and a real focus on brand building, all underpinned by our fundamental belief that we leverage culture to fuel results. Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC : Thanks. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Howard, thanks. Next question, please, Amy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian, your line is open. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Thanks a lot. I just want to ask a question on Taco Bell. You did roll out your pretty aggressive $1 breakfast menu in March you said; so it didn't really impact the full first quarter. Can you just talk about how this is impacting the overall business? Is it accretive to your sales trends? Is it doing what you expected it to do? And externally, us looking at the margin, how should we think about how this impacts the food margin going forward or the COGS margin? Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the good news, as I said, we had 8% transaction growth in the breakfast daypart in the first quarter before we really got a full impact of the $1 menu. So, I think we feel really good that that's going to continue to have an impact on our breakfast business. Our food and paper costs for breakfast are in line for the balance of the business. So whether it grows or grows faster or slower doesn't really impact the overall food and paper costs. The good news is, obviously, Taco Bell is benefiting from the price of beef right now, and that's obviously why you're seeing in the marketplace a lot of value by both the burger chains and why Taco Bell can play an aggressive play in beef as well. David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : I would just add, Brian, that at 6% mix, the breakfast doesn't change the overall Taco Bell story much. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, yeah. I think the good news is it's growing. It's growing in the face of us being focused. We're doing the right thing, which we have got innovative products, we've got value now in that category, in that daypart. And I feel really good. I was out in restaurants in the U.S. just recently, visited Taco Bells for breakfast, got great food, and had a great experience. And I think the general feeling is that this is something we're going to invest in for the long-term. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Brian. Amy, next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Andy, your line is open. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Yes, just a quick follow-up on that and then one other quick one. On the Taco Bell margin maintenance in terms of your guidance for the year, even with a more sharpened value focus, is lower commodity cost really the primary reason you feel confident in that still? Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think two things. I do believe we'll deliver at least 3% same-store sales growth for the full year. So obviously, we got off to a slower than expected start. But as we said, we are rolling out the big numbers, plus 6%. But in the discussions I've had with Brian, he still feels very confident. So I think we're confident we will deliver the same-store sales growth that we're (54:15) in the U.S. and obviously commodities are favorable, and I think all signs are that certainly beef will stay favorable probably through the balance of 2016. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : And then just quickly on emerging markets at KFC, I know you called out a couple of Pizza Hut markets. That number was only up 1%. Is there any specific country or area that was a little softer this quarter? Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, I think that when you're in 120 \u2013 130 countries, I always \u2013 I'm never quite sure how many countries we're in on any one day, I think the good news is we had \u2013 in 130 countries, you're going to have some up markets and some downs. India was minus 1% but Russia was plus 27% in system sales for KFC. We also had strong developed markets. Australia delivered another really good quarter. They were plus 5%, which \u2013 if you think about what they've been rolling over. So we were soft in a number of places, but there is also real signs of real strength both in emerging and developed. And I think that Roger Eaton and the team believe that they also can obviously get sales up into at least the 3% same-store sales growth number for the year. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Andy. Next question, please, Amy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, a question on China that's actually not on comp sales but on new store productivity. It looks like there is still a growing gap between comp growth and average weekly sales growth. And just curious if you could comment on that. Is it being driven by one of the two brands, units in one area or another? And any sort of update on how to be thinking about unit economics per year because I think the last disclosures we have really only go through like 2014. Thanks. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Okay. Karen, what were you quoting as the reason why you had that feeling? Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That if you look at overall store productivity growth, so just sales per unit versus comp growth, it looks like the gap between those two numbers is still getting wider. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : I see. Well, when we look at our performance by peers, it's pretty consistent. So I don't think there's a particular factor there. And I really can't at the moment think of a particular reason. That certainly has not struck me that the new units that we are building are in any way have inferior economics or any such. It's not as though we're building necessarily smaller units. It is true that we built more stores in smaller cities, but our comp sales growth across peers has been fairly consistent. We are experimenting with multiple store formats to take into account the fact that there is still a very rapid build-out in infrastructure in China. So we're expecting \u2013 very large number of malls are already under construction; the high-speed rail network is being expanded. And then in China, unlike the U.S., there is not the phenomenon at the moment of highways with drive-throughs or the rest stops, and all those are being developed. I don't really see the character of our productivity per unit changing in the years to come. I think worldwide there is a trend to what we call small box, which is because in-lines are becoming more popular in mall stores, et cetera. So there may be in the longer term a slightly smaller format unit. But China is not that impacted, because we hardly have any drive-throughs here. You hardly have any drive-throughs at all, so most of them are in-lines anyway. So maybe we need to think about this question a little more. But we don't intrinsically see any reason why the sort of growth we've enjoyed should not be projected long-term into the future. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Karen. Next question, please, Amy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is open. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Thanks, guys. Two questions. One, if \u2013 Micky, I'd love to have your thoughts now that you've been over in China for a while on the idea of franchising certain brands or markets or stores in China. Just your outlook and thoughts there. And then secondly, Dave, could you walk through again the math or the reasoning behind the VAT change and how that impacts the business and why you think it would be positive? It would be helpful just to understand that a little bit better. Thanks. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Okay. So, the VAT question I will leave to Dave. I don't know, Dave, whether you want to take that first or... David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : No, go ahead, Micky. I'll go second. Go ahead, Micky. Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Okay. And just remind me, sorry, your first question was? Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just your outlook for franchising in China. Would you like to convert more company stores to franchise, yeah? Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Yeah, right. Sorry. Right, yes. Right. Well, at the moment, as you know, we have stayed at about just over 7,000 stores. About 10% are franchised and 90% are equity. I think at the moment as long as we have \u2013 and the way we never chase a number of stores that we have to build. But when we get new trade zones opening and opportunities that make commercial sense, and there's a very disciplined process for capital allocation and measuring new unit returns, we have a lot of surplus capital, as you know, in China. All the stores here have been built with Chinese-generated capital. There is no intrinsic reason why we would want to give that up to franchisees. The two reasons why we do expect, however, franchising to up marginally is, firstly, there are regions of the country where it makes sense for franchisees to operate. We recently opened in the autonomous region of Tibet, our first store in Lhasa, Tibet. And for a variety of reasons, including difficult operating conditions and local market knowledge, that was given to a franchisee. And that's been successful and I think that will grow. So there are parts of the country where we will do it for reasons that it makes sense to do it that way. And the other is that there will be opportunities to do franchising, for example, with gas station chains, et cetera. And for those technical reasons the percentage of franchising might go up from 10% to maybe 15% or something in the foreseeable future, but we don't expect a significant change in there. And of course, if we do not find the ability to invest our capital in productive equity investment, sure, we'll look at franchising more actively. We are not \u2013 at the moment, we are agnostic to whether it's franchising or equity, frankly. But both have advantages. Franchisees can \u2013 obviously, they're capital light and also they're very innovative. But at the moment, with the capital that we have, especially as we become independent, I think it will be a good use of the capital to continue to invest. China is a growth market the way we see it, and we still have the vision of doubling or trebling our store base. So that's the way we're looking at it. So I would say the franchising percentage will edge up, but it will not be a game changer in our business. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Micky. Dave? David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : Okay. So, on the VAT, so currently, China is paying 5% of all their sales in the form of a business tax to the government. What's happening now is China is moving to a more traditional VAT regime, which is similar to the regime in many other parts of the world, where we will pay 6% of those top-line sales to the government; but we'll get a credit for some of the inputs that we have into our P&L, commodities, utilities, rent, against that 6% credit. What's difficult for us to say right now is exactly how that those credits are going to accumulate and what exactly is going to be creditable. And we are working through that. As you can imagine, with 6,000 stores this is going to be a monumental effort. And there is also some lack of clarity around the rules at this point, still. So we're going to have a lot more for you in July. We'll have one month worth of this in our Q2 results \u2013 the benefit in our Q2 results and we'll be able to quantify it in much more detail at that point in time. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Jason. Next question, please, Amy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Micky, as you saw success with an operationally simple promotion at KFC in the first quarter, I realize Pizza Hut is not as time-sensitive of an occasion, but there are opportunities to implement better operational practices of that brand particularly around the breadth of the menu? Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China : Yeah, absolutely, Andrew, there are. I think the menu is complicated. I think I had mentioned this in December as well. It's a tabbed menu. You actually have \u2013 it's a very large number of pages. It's a book. It's a little difficult to navigate, so simplifying that is a priority. Pizza Hut is celebrated and known for the variety of menu here, so we do not want to lose that. But at the same time, I think we can make it far more controlled. It also speeds up service. And table turns are an issue at Pizza Hut at peak times. So for those reasons, we are rationalizing the menu. We are also, like I said earlier, pointing out the great value that we have through lunch combos and other offers. So we are redesigning that part of the menu as well. And lastly, I'm constantly amazed at how advanced China is digitally. It's got twice the number of cell phones, smartphones, as the U.S. population. And even in our offices, people go up and down the elevator to go to lunch, they're looking up where the offers are available and where they can book a table, et cetera. So the action is shifting very rapidly to mobile devices, and both the menu as well as digital marketing is becoming very significant. So we're working on that. The good news is that for both our brands we are in a leadership position when it comes to that whole digital interface, cashless payment, et cetera. But to your question, yes, I think the operational simplicity at KFC, making it easier for consumers to choose our best-selling products and the general philosophy that the menu should not be a \u2013 it should be used more as guiding customers to our best-selling products than to give open choices, which they get confused about is something that is applicable at Pizza Hut as well. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Micky. Thanks, Andrew. Amy, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is open. Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning and thank you. Can you guys provide us with a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about the re-franchising efforts in terms of cadence across the divisions? How we should be thinking about it over the next six months to three years out. Thank you. David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller : Sure. So, the plan is still to be 96% franchised by the end of 2017, which that will include the China units, post-spin. This year, more of what's going to get done are the U.S. re-franchising, which is going to be KFCs and -- I'm sorry, Taco Bells and to a lesser degree Pizza Hut. We would expect significant gains in those regards. Quite frankly, selling some of the international markets is a little bit more difficult, so that will take a little bit more time. We expect that to be more 2017 loaded. Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy : Thanks, Brett. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Brett. Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So, I just want to thank everyone for being on the call. Obviously, we're pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016, that we've raised full-year core operating profit guidance to 12% from 10%. I also want to thank Micky, Larry, and Dave for joining Steve and I on the call today. So thank you all, and look forward to catching up with you in the near future. Thank you.

Greg Creed : Thank you, Donny and good morning everyone. Yum! Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items of 9%. Given our strong first-half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our full-year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14% from 12% previously. I'm particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China which delivered better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 3%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at KFC China despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint. Importantly, our China Division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positive same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks. Outside of China, challenging industry conditions in the U.S. contributed to soft sales results. However, our three brand divisions in the aggregate delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full-year core operating profit growth targets. We're confident in our plans to drive second-half sales improvement led by a continuous focus on innovation, value and our core products. This is a transformational year for our Company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31, 2016, ultimately creating two powerful independent focus-growth companies. Our capital structure is fully in place and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders both prior to and after the spin. And I look forward to sharing additional details on the transformative initiatives we're undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised Company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday, October 11. Today I will give you an overview of each of our operating divisions and then David Gibbs, our CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that the team and I will be happy to take any questions you might have.  So first, China, as I mentioned, I'm particularly pleased KFC which represents about 75% of our operating profit in China, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth with 3% comps in the second quarter. This was driven by stronger results in the second half of the quarter as our bucket-related promotions resonated with consumers. It's great to see the team's focus on the core end value translating into tangible results. Furthermore, we've simplified menus, improved efficiency and conveyed our value proposition to customers all the while maintaining our consumer perception scores. In fact, we've done all this while simultaneously improving restaurant margins in each of the last four quarters versus prior year. I'm also encouraged by KFC China's plans for the balance of the year and am pleased to report our third quarter which began June 1 and is historically our highest from a profitability standpoint, is off to a great start with same-store sales results quarter to date up low double digits. We rolled out Box Meals in June and are currently promoting our historically successful wing bucket which we pulled forward a week earlier this year. As you all know, Box Meals have proven effective globally for KFC and we expect success in China given test results. It's great to see knowhow sharing across our global knowledge base and we look forward to leveraging this on an ongoing basis across all of Yum!. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, system sales declined 2% and same-store sales declined 11% in the quarter. The good news is based on our third quarter results to date, it appears the China team's strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. As evidence, quarter-to-date same-store sales are slightly negative and I'm pleased to report they have turned positive in recent weeks. Our renewed focus on pizza and ensuring customers understand our value proposition are critical to brand success. It's too early to declare victory but we know the potential of this brand and are further enhancing our core, simplifying the menu and leveraging ideas from Indonesia and Hong Kong, where we have other successful casual dining concepts to execute on our strategy.  Overall we're clearly pleased with the progress we're making in China and our third quarter results to date. We caution overlaps do get tougher though for the balance of the quarter. So now onto our three branded divisions, in our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 2% in the second quarter or 4% on a two-year stack. Operating profit grew 6% in the quarter and the division opened 132 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 88% of these units were opened by franchisees and 68% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets, as I think this really speaks to the global strength of our brand. In the U.S. for example, we reported our eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. As further evidence we're gaining traction with our strategy in the U.S., our two-year same-store sales growth lapped 3% growth in the prior year, so on a two-year basis, comps were plus 5%. System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and in international emerging markets grew 10%. We remain on track to open at least 475 net new international restaurants this year and the U.S. is committed to delivering about 1000 remodels in 2016. After the spinoff of our China Division, KFC will be the largest contributor to new Yum! from multiple perspectives including absolute profit growth, restaurant count and profit growth to name a few what really excites me are all the opportunities for growth that exist for this brand. Today we open approximately three new KFCs a day globally or one every 8 hours, we're on a path over time to open one every 5 hours which would nearly double our annual new unit openings. Pizza Hut had flat same-store sales in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth in the U.S. which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. While second quarter results in the U.S. were softer than expected as competitors responded to our first quarter success with more aggressive promotions, we're pleased to see transaction growth in the U.S. and a continuation of the positive sales trends in our U.S. business. We believe our focus on making it easier to get a better pizza, whether it be by providing consistent value through the $5 Flavor Menu and $6.99 ANY Medium Pairs Deal or by improvements in technology as we upgrade our web experience and migrate our system to one POS will continue to enhance our business model. As a testament to our strategy, our Company-owned stores which are executing against a comprehensive suite of easy and better initiatives including a locally competitive value message driven by data science that is complementary to the national message and new operations programs geared to accelerate improvements in customer satisfaction, delivered second quarter same-store sales growth higher than the system with transaction growth more than five percentage points higher. This Company outperformance is obviously encouraging as it is a clear indication that we're on the right track and we're excited about the impact these initiatives will ultimately have on the entire Pizza Hut system. Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were strong in Thailand, Canada and the UK but offset by weaknesses in Korea. Last quarter I mentioned that we were planning on rolling out proven, successful tactics in the U.S. in international markets. I'm pleased to say that we have started this and are seeing success with the $5 Flavor Menu in Australia and other markets and have plans to roll this construct out to additional markets later this year. This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U.S. in its turnaround. And finally, Taco Bell, operating profit grew 1% when adjusting for the impact of refranchise and this was after lapping a plus 29% from the prior year. However, U.S. same-store sales declined 1% as we left a plus 6% from the prior year. While a plus 5% on a two-year stack is ahead of the category, we expect more out of Taco Bell given the strength of this brand. In the current environment, we need to pair innovation with value that clearly resonates with our consumers. For example, our $5 Cravings Deal bundle improved results toward the end of the second quarter and through the first five weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales are positive. We believe that the Taco Bell brand is extremely well-positioned to exceed in a challenging environment. In market research, Taco Bell always ranks as one of the top brands in providing value and innovation to consumers. We plan to leverage this decisioning in the balance of 2016 and going forward. Furthermore, we remain on plan with new unit development for the year. We're accelerating international new unit openings and are excited to see momentum behind this strategic objective. While it is early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long term growth and look forward to continued progress. Now before I turn it over to David Gibbs, I just wanted to share with you some of the highlights from our recent biannual franchise convention that was held this year in Las Vegas. I think it's fair to say our franchisees are extremely bullish about the transformation we're undergoing at Yum! as evidenced by a record 1100 attendees representing over 100 countries, including numerous participants from our China Division. This showcased the power of Yum! at its finest as we brought all three brands together to build and share know-how on development, advertising, innovation, value and digital. We're on a clear path to become a world-class franchisor and an even sharper brand builder. So as I said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We're confident we will deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth and I'm pleased with the momentum in our China business as we near completion of the China separation. The Yum! China team is excited to reap the benefits of a continued growth in the consuming class and as an independent Company, Yum! China will continue to unlock massive growth opportunities while further capitalizing on what remains the number one retail opportunity in the world. At new Yum!, I couldn't be more excited about the plans we have to become an even more unique and more powerful world-class franchisor. We will not undergo an evolution from Yum! as you know it but instead another transformation as we increase our franchise mix to at least 96% by the end of 2017 and sharpen our focus on four key areas, brand building, franchisee capability, market and asset development and our unique culture. We will make all decisions based on this construct. We will transform our mindset from equity-led to franchise-led and commit to a cost structure that enables us to build on these pillars. And I look forward to sharing additional details of this transformed vision for new Yum! at our investor conference in October. And with that, I will hand it over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Greg and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will cover three areas, our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. Let's start with a high-level overview of our second quarter performance. Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 7% in the quarter. Our China Division reported flat same-store sales growth despite it being our toughest compare of the year. As Greg said, we're pleased with the progress we're making in China and with sales results to date in the third quarter which is historically the biggest quarter of the year from a profitability standpoint. Second quarter core operating profit in our China Division grew 6% and was impacted, as expected, by an additional $14 million enclosures and impairment expense versus prior year as well as a $4 million expense related to our RGM convention. These expenses were partially offset by a benefit from recent value added tax reform in China which went into effect on May 1 and positively impacted restaurant margins in the second quarter. In aggregate, our three brand divisions delivered 3% core operating profit growth in the quarter. This was led by 7% growth at Pizza Hut and 6% growth at KFC partially offset by soft results at Taco Bell.  Overall, EPS before special items grew 9% including a 4 point negative impact from foreign currency changes. The EPS benefited from a 6% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our second quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. Now I would like to discuss our 2016 outlook. Given our strong first-half performance and current trends in China, we're raising our core operating profit growth forecast for Yum! from 12% to at least 14% including the 53rd week. We started the year by saying that we expected Yum! core operating profit growth of at least 10%. Outside of China, our three brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial targets. Therefore, the increase in Yum!'s 2016 guidance is essentially due to upside in China including strong year-to-date KFC sales, margin and profit growth and a balance of the year that will be aided by the VAT change partially offset by a return to commodity inflation and higher labor costs. As you might recall, last quarter we walked through the pending changes to China's retail tax structure which became effective May 1. As a reminder, under this reform, a 6% output VAT replaces a 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT is creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. We believe this change will have a material benefit to Yum! China Restaurant margins for the balance of the year. However, the scale and nature of the policy along with implementation and transition challenges, make it very difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact. While we won't provide any further detail on VAT today, we expect to be able to provide more clarity on our third quarter call after we have a full quarter of results behind us. I want to point out that for the balance of the year we do expect labor and commodity inflation to partially offset this benefit. With this and our first-half outperformance in mind, our current guidance for full-year China restaurant margins is now at least 17% versus 16% previously. Outside of China, our three brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. We expect any potential softness in top line performance to be offset by a favorable commodities environment. That being said, we're confident in our plans to drive sales improvement balance of year and are encouraged with our positive results third quarter to date at Taco Bell. On the development front, we added over 370 new units globally in the second quarter, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to over 650 units. Consistent with prior years the development will be weighted more towards the second half as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. In China, we have increased our focus on refurbishing and remodeling stores this year and we believe the momentum that we're seeing in the business today can be partially attributed to this investment in improving the guest experience. In fact, we're reallocating our capital to increase our pace of remodels to nearly 800 in 2016, up from our previous target of 550. At the same time, we're reducing both our gross and net new unit numbers for the year by around 50 to 100 openings versus our original expectations. This is primarily due to fewer new Pizza Hut Casual Dining units this year. But to be clear, our confidence level in the long term growth prospects of our brands in China remains undiminished. Also keep in mind as a division, we expect about 100 fewer closures in 2016 than we had last year and we continue to get cash paybacks for new KFC and Pizza Hut units in the three- to four-year range, both great signs of the underlying strength in the business model and the potential for future expansion. And finally outside of China, for the full year we expect another strong year of development with total gross openings of nearly 1,800 units. Turning now to foreign exchange, given the recent vote by the UK to exit the EU, I want to remind investors that one of the many great benefits of Yum! is our global and therefore diversified presence. In 2015, approximately 6% of our operating profit was generated from the UK and approximately 2% from the remaining Eurozone. That being said, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most of the world's other major foreign currencies, at current forward rates, currency translation is now estimated to negatively impact balance-of-the-year operating profit by about $50 million which represents an increase of $10 million versus our initial expectations. As always, please take this as directional guidance only as rates will inevitably change as we move throughout the year. In addition, keep in mind this does not impact our core operating profit growth forecast of at least 14% which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Now I would like to provide you with an update on our refranchising targets. As you know in connection with the China separation, we've committed to become at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. In the past four quarters, we re-franchised over 300 restaurants outside of China, including 82 units in the second quarter. Re-franchising will, simply put, improve our business model. Proceeds from re-franchising enable us to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders while creating an even larger and more stable stream of franchise fees. It also produces immediate G&A savings as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. That being said, we realize there are additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and look forward to sharing more detailed plans around our ongoing re-franchising strategy and G&A roadmap at our investor conference on October 11. Now I would like to quickly update you on our spinoff plans. We remain on track to complete the spinoff with a targeted completion date around October 31. We filed our initial Form 10 on May 3 and filed an amendment earlier this week. Our comprehensive global road shows will follow our investor conference. In conjunction with our spinoff, we're also optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. To this end, I'm very pleased to report the successful completion of our planned recapitalization in June. In aggregate, we closed on $6.9 billion of new debt consisting of a $2.3 billion financing facility, securitizing our Taco Bell U.S. royalties; a $2.5 billion senior secured credit facility; and a $2.1 billion of high-yield notes. With the completion of our recapitalization, today we have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding at an attractive blended interest rate of less than 5%. This marks yet another milestone in our previously communicated commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital, excluding ongoing dividend payment, to shareholders. In fact, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have repurchased $3.3 billion of shares which equates to $3.3 billion of shares which equates to 42.9 million shares at an average price of $0.70. We continue to believe that our stock represents a good value at current prices. But make no mistake, this is just the beginning as we target an additional $3.5 billion in capital return across 2017 and 2018. This will take our total capital return program, including dividends, to $10 billion over about a three-year period and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering meaningful cash returns to our shareholders. So let me wrap things up. We're confident we will deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth for the full year and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business. Our brand businesses are performing in the aggregate in line with our initial expectations and I'm pleased with the progress we're making in China as it approaches its first day as independent company. As Greg said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We look forward to sharing additional details with you at our New York investor conference in October. And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joseph Buckley : A couple of questions, could you elaborate a little bit further on the Pizza Hut Casual Dining opening plans that I think you mentioned you scaled back? And then are the remodels, the increased number of remodels in China, concentrated on Pizza Hut? Is that the capital trade off you are making? Micky Pant : This is Micky. Pizza Hut Casual Dining, as you probably remember in 2015, we opened 280 units and over the last four years, we virtually doubled the estate. And we saw the trend over the last year of same-store sales and our judgment was that we should pause for a bit, so we will still build. We will be the leading developer of casual dining restaurants by far in China, but we paused for a bit. I think we're encouraged by the trend that we're seeing currently when same-store sales come back to positive territory and we will re-step up the build rate of Pizza Hut Casual Dining.  As far as refurbishment is concerned, that is applicable to both our brands and it was our judgment that it was very important to improve the customer experience and also to be able to bring our estate in line with retail in China which has been modernizing in general very rapidly. So we've, as David Gibbs mentioned in his comments, we increased our remodel rate across both brands and in aggregate that will be about 800 this year, so we've effectively, in the last 18 months, doubled our rate of refurbishment to bring the estate to acceptable levels. So it's not as though we're reinvesting only in Pizza Hut. We're reinvesting in both the brands. I hope that answers your question. Joseph Buckley : It does. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : I'm just going to try to sneak in a two-parter on China, if I may. Firstly and thank you for the color on the quarter to date basis regarding trends, but in the third quarter last year it was really a tale of I think two very different quarters where I think the first seven weeks was down 11 and then the next four weeks was up 31. So you guys kind of get to see the trends and normally I wouldn't ask you to forecast results for the rest of the quarter. But how might that significant change in trend between the first quarter and the second quarter perhaps influence the quarter-to-date numbers that you are talking about? Then I have a follow-up as well. Greg Creed : I think we're not going to forecast obviously the balance of the quarter and I think as we said, we're pleased with the way the quarter has opened, whether that be in obviously China on both KFC and Pizza Hut or whether in the U.S. where we've actually seen Taco Bell sales turn positive. So I think we're excited by the positive momentum we've got. We do know and we spoke about the fact that, obviously as you said, the lap gets harder. But I do see some encouraging signs in the progress we're making in a number of the businesses around the world. John Ivankoe : And then secondly, our calculation is never perfect for this, but we do look at new unit volumes in China the best that we can based on what you all report and it does look like first-half new unit volumes in China are well off average and well off what the trend has been. So I guess I wanted you to confirm or deny that and make some comments about the overall trend of new-unit volumes in China as you continue to develop both brands. David Gibbs : John, I can give you a couple of technical points on that and then Micky can give you some color, but you are right. The average unit volumes that are opening are slightly down and I can give you some of the reasons. In the pool right now, we've got 100 small-box units that were test units that are obviously at slightly lower volume. We've got a little heavier weighting on Pizza Hut Home Service and our new-unit development is a little bit heavier weighted towards tiers 3 through 6. In fact, the majority of the development occurs there while some of the stores that we're closing are a little heavier weighted towards Tiers 1 and 2. When you add up all of those smaller points, you get to a little bit of a drag on new-unit volumes, but most importantly critical to us, is we're very happy with our development programs. We're getting positive cash paybacks, three to four years. Margins are improving, sales trends are improving. So we feel good about our development program. I don't know, Micky, if you have anything else to add? Micky Pant : No, I think you covered it well, David. I just want to reassure you -- I think this question came up in the last earnings call as well, is that is there anything fundamentally changing about our strategy or the delivery of sales and profits from new units as we go forward as compared to the past? And I think in general terms the answer is, no. We continue to build aggressively. The brand mix changed a bit and you know as David mentioned, we did build Pizza Hut Home Service restaurants that tend to be lower volume and KFC had slowed a little bit because of the two years of difficulty in sales. We fully expect KFC development this year to be ahead of our original plans and in general terms, we see the efficiency and delivery from new units as being just as good as it's been in the past. In general terms, our focus at the moment is to raise traffic and sales in all our stores and that's one of the reasons we moderated new unit builds this year. We're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing and we hope we can continue to deliver growth in sales. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Eric Gonzalez : It's Eric Gonzalez on for Dave Palmer. Just wondering if you could talk about Pizza Hut Casual Dining in terms of what's happening there in terms of price construct and media message? And also KFC seems to be on firmer footing. Maybe you can comment on some changes that are happening there? And then for both brands we were wondering how is the innovation pipeline different today in terms of tested innovation and how does that compare to a year ago? Micky Pant : Okay, well Pizza Hut Casual Dining I think is in a much better position with regards to the consumer proposition than it was even I would say three months ago. The positioning of the brand is quite clear. It's been explained and carried forward through the organization. It's an integrated position which covers new product development as well as service down to uniforms etcetera. and I think it's resonating well. It's called Love to Share and it's appropriate because unlike KFC where most people come in single or order their meals individually; in Pizza Hut, it's a group that tend to order their meals together. And also as you know there's a big phenomenon now of sharing the food experience through social media. And all of that is working in our favor. On both brands, the emphasis has been to continue our rate of innovation and to continue to give consumers great news. The difference is that we're doing it in a way that is operationally friendly so that it does not slow speed of service or cause problems with value. In the case of KFC, for example, as Greg mentioned, that includes Box Meals which has a well tried-and-tested formula globally that offers consumers not three but five items for a slightly higher price and offers great value. The innovation across all platforms is strong, but the big difference I think is that it is now a practical innovation that gives choice without complicating operations a great deal. Across all dayparts also, we've made significant investments in high quality coffee machines in both brands and high quality ice cream machines in the case of KFC to be able to improve our delivery and our quality of product. Greg Creed : Let me just add. I think what you are seeing in China is what you are starting to see in the rest of the world which is on the KFC brand, we're very focused on what buckets, boxes, burgers and wings and on Pizza Hut it's back to pizzas and pan pizzas in particular, so I think a return to the core and belief in the core that it can drive same-store sales is what you are seeing in China. I think it's resonating there and it's what you'll also see in the balance of our business around the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : I just wanted to go back to this inflection in China because I think it's important, but if I recall correctly you were down 11% in the first half or first seven weeks of the quarter last year and then you we were up like over 30%. So first of all, is that correct? What drove that inflection last year just so we understand what the hill we have to climb this year is and what we're up against and you didn't update your total comp guidance for the year for China. Last quarter you said you didn't want to either. Do you have any updated thought just on the year holistically so that we can think about this beyond the next few weeks? David Gibbs : I guess what I would say is, it's really quite hard to look at one, two, three year comps in China and with any certainty be able to forecast sales. We're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing right now. We're not changing our annual guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth in China. We're in that range today year to date, but certainly if the current trends continue we would be able to beat that number. We do caution that the second half laps get more difficult, but again it depends on how you look at them. The initial food event that we're lapping occurred towards the back half of July and that makes the comps really hard to look at. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, sir. Brian Bittner : I will try to wrap two questions into one. Couldn't help but notice the at least language that's in the new profit guidance, that at least language wasn't in the old guidance. Was that deliberate? Are you starting to see some nice potential upside to profits on the back half given the potential operating leverage that you get out of China and maybe some easier profit laps from some of the non-China segments? And also on the G&A side, Greg, you talked about an optimized cost structure when you have the franchise model in place. Is that something we're going to hear more about at the Analyst Day or is there any initial thoughts you can maybe give us on how you are thinking about that today? Thanks. Greg Creed : I will take the second one first which was G&A. I think as we've said and continue to say, we will have a comprehensive review of our G&A structure in October when we meet. Obviously we're going through the whole strategy structure, the culture process and I'm very confident that we will be able to share in great detail those numbers when we meet in October. So I think we're only a couple of months away. We're finalizing all of those plans and we will be able to provide a greater amount of detail about the efficiency we can bring to the business. With that I will throw the first part of the question back to-- David Gibbs : Just in terms of our forecasting through the year, the use of the word at least obviously indicates that we see some upside to the numbers that we're communicating, but as we've all learned, these are difficult businesses to forecast with any precision. I feel more comfortable conveying where we're at with those terms. Operator : Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : I will also ask I think a two-part question here on China, if I may. First, I was interested to hear you say that you are still going after the lower-tier cities in the sense that all of the macroeconomic indicators seem to be weaker in many of those cities than they are in the higher tiers. So I just wanted to ask about new unit economics, confirmation that they are still very good in those lower-tier cities given what we're hearing about just the macro backdrop? And I guess the second point was about the China margins. I know you gave some color on that. Also surprised to see the commodity -- it looked like the food margins were good in the context of it seems like an emphasis on value, so maybe you could just help me think through what the complexion of those margins should look like going forward? Will we continue to get that kind of tailwind and will there be headwinds on the labor and expense side? So the unit economics and margins, if you will. David Gibbs : I will take the margin question and then I will turn it over to Micky for some color on developments which is what I think you are looking for. On the margins, you can see we had 1 point of margin improvement in China in the second quarter. That was really fundamentally the food and paper outperformed the inflation that we saw in labor to give us a 1 point benefit. What went into that food and paper upside is really sort of four components. It was a price benefit, a mix benefit. We did have deflation and then of course, the VAT shows up there and in a couple of other line items. And then I will turn it over to Micky for some color on development. Micky Pant : Yes, I think one of the strengths of Yum! in China is that we're so widely present across the country, as you know over 1,000 cities with KFC. As mentioned earlier, our Pizza Hut development rate this year has been moderated a bit, but KFC will be on or ahead of plan. I can confirm that our new unit returns are very high. They are at the highest they've been for four years in terms of percentage of units beating hurdle rate as set in the CapEx. So we're very confident that we're not over-expanding at all in the smaller-tier cities. It is our belief that under challenging economic conditions you get the best long term deals and if we're able to secure long leases for these stores, we're very confident these stores will make good returns in the future. So I don't think we're concerned at the moment with the rate of return on our new store sales. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : My question is about the divisions outside of China which you said on a combined basis are tracking to reach their profit plan, but it does look like they might miss their original cost plan. So the question is, what is supporting the profit outlook and does that comment apply to each of the divisions individually or is that a comment on the combined basis? David Gibbs : I think on a combined basis, we did talk about that the second half of the year would be better for us from a profit standpoint and that Q2 was a difficult quarter for us. So as I reiterated in my prepared remarks, we feel like the divisions from a profit standpoint are on track. Greg Creed : And I think the other thing is, as we said we're seeing some improvement as we start the third quarter. Taco Bell which obviously was negative in Q2 has turned positive in Q3 through the first five or six weeks of the quarter. The KFC U.S. number is also stronger than the plus 2% we had, so I think we're feeling that there's some momentum. Obviously, I think as we all know in the U.S., the market is a little soft, but I think that we see some momentum in sales. I think that we believe that commodities will be under control and I think as I even may have said on the last call, we're confident we can deliver the outside of China profit numbers even if the sales numbers are just a little tough to get to. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir. Joseph Buckley : I wanted to just check on the check and the traffic components of the same-store sales. I'd love to get it for both China KFC and Pizza Hut individually and then for the U.S. comps for KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. David Gibbs : Yes. So for China, we can provide you at a division level that price contributed 2 points, mix contributed 3 points and that covered a 5 point decline in transactions. Of course as we talked about on the last call, the transaction decline is not necessarily per person, as we think our party size has increased given the promotions that we're running. Greg Creed : And if you, if you want to talk about the U.S., I think that was also part of the question. I think the Taco Bell miss was a transaction miss pretty much. I think that's probably the best way to describe it. And our look at the category also is probably for the trailing 13 weeks the U.S. is probably running about minus 1 same-store transactions and probably around plus 1 same-store sales. So that's the sort of numbers that we see. But the Taco Bell miss was essentially driven by transactions. But as I said, I'm happy that in the first five or six weeks of the third quarter we're back in positive territory on Taco Bell. So that's a nice change in momentum. Operator : Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Karen Holthouse : Just actually a follow-up to the pricing piece in China, it seems like it's a little bit more price than we seen since some of the food safety incidents happened. As you are getting farther away from that and you sound pretty positive on underlying momentum in the brands and the positioning, do you think that's giving you permission to potentially get a little bit more aggressive on the pricing front if you want to? David Gibbs : Let me clarify something, Karen, then I will turn it over to Micky. On the pricing, that was all roll-over pricing, there was no pricing raise in the quarter. But I will turn it over to Micky for more color. Micky Pant : Thank you. Karen, in general we had as you know, commodities were very favorable in the first half, so we really didn't see any reason to take pricing. We continue to offer bigger meal bundles and especially buckets and they offer a great value anyway. The net impact of pricing is actually two which is all rollover. The rest of it one shape, way or form is on account of more customers or more food per customer which are both good news. We have to watch commodity inflation in the back half.  At the moment we feel pretty confident that we can deliver through other productivity initiatives our profit targets without having to take recourse through pricing. But obviously we remain sensitive to commodity and we will not be stupid about it, but we do want to contain pricing for as long as possible, to maintain price stability in the market as well as to continue to offer great value. We're very focused on transaction growth, but we will not do it at the expense of profits come to that. The way things are at the moment, we feel pretty comfortable that through the year we do not have to take any further pricing, but we're watching commodity, especially poultry very carefully in the back half. Karen Holthouse : And if you are not going to take any pricing for-- Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Just two related questions on the China separation and the cash flow it's generating. One just on the separation, I'm just wondering whether there's any consideration at all for options other than the current spin plan? There's always talk about a sale of part or all to third parties or other opportunities and I'm just wondering whether you would offer any insight onto that? And then the second question was just on the cash return. I think, Greg, in your prepared remarks you say we're going to return a significant amount before and after the spin. I'm just wondering whether we should assume it's a traditional open market share purchase which I guess gives you the flexibility or are you considering maybe ASRs or special dividends or other forms of that? Thank you. Greg Creed : I think with regard to the spin, I think as we've said multiple times, we looked at a number of options to maximize shareholder value and we believe and continue to believe that a separation or a spin is the best way to maximize shareholder value. We're 100% focused on that. As we said in the Form 10 filings -- everything else is going ahead in China, starting things like Board selection. And so we're really doing all the things you'd expect. We're right on our timeline in order to hit the separation on October 31, plus or minus a couple of days. And we continue to believe that is the very best way to maximize shareholder value. I will hand over to David who can just give you an update on cash return. David Gibbs : Yes, as far as cash return goes, obviously we feel good about the share repurchases we've made year-to-date at attractive prices and that our stock is priced attractively for continued share buyback. But that's something that we will continue to evaluate. There's other options, special dividends, tender offers and we will continue to revisit that decision as time goes on, but the intent obviously is to return that cash this year. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : A lot of my questions has been answered but, Micky, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of positive gross margins in China, so I just wanted to ask holistically about your willingness to sacrifice some of that margin in order to drive traffic by focusing more aggressively on value. I know obviously you are going to have some pricing that rolls off and inflation is likely to reaccelerate. But just thinking about how that ties into the margin profile of Box Meals? And then separately, David, just a follow-up on that last question. Was just hoping you guys could take about how you are evaluating the remaining $3.3 billion of cash return to shareholders through October. Current trading prices, we're estimating this is going to be about 20% of your daily trading volume if you were to repurchase that all over the course of every day over the next three-and-a-half months. So it just seems like an ambitious endeavor and just want to hear what kind of factors would lead you guys to relocate some of the cash through a special dividend? Thank you. Micky Pant : I will just take your pricing question and then hand over to David. We do not really see any need at the moment to sacrifice margins. We believe we have good price points now. We've captured key velocity price points around the RMB29 mark for individual meals for slightly bigger meals for individuals at RMB35 mark and I believe our buckets are competitively priced. We're very keen to hold that for a period, but we don't see any reason to lace up the transactions any further. I don't think it will get helped particularly by pricing. We're however doing more and more effective marketing activity through digital media, etcetera. which is a complicated topic, but we're getting higher and higher efficiencies that's allowing us to target specific consumers that will allow us to drive traffic to our stores and develop sales satisfactorily. So the short answer is we're not looking at all to dilute our margin. David Gibbs : Yes and then on the share buyback question, just a little bit more detail on that. Our plan is to get the vast majority of the buyback done by the separation. But obviously we're going to be smart about it and recognize that we have to comply with the regulations on that. So some of that may spill over but we still think we will get it all done by the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Greg, can you talk a little bit more about the brands in the U.S. and how you feel you are positioned on value currently, particularly at Taco Bell? Any surprises over the last few months that you've seen from competitors or the changes in consumer sentiment that has made you change your approach and get even more aggressive than you had otherwise planned into the back half of the year? Greg Creed : That's a good question. I think, as we said earlier, there is I call it a malaise in the U.S., is probably the best way to describe it. And I think there was an interesting report out yesterday that I think 75% of people 18 to 30 believe that the U.S. is either falling behind or failing as a nation, according to a GenForward Survey. So that's not particularly good news from just what are people thinking. As I said earlier, we believe that in the U.S. the market is on a trailing 13 is about a minus 1% in transacts, it's probably plus 1% in sales. As I said, I think the good news is we have started the third quarter stronger than we had in the second quarter. I think what it means is for brands like Taco Bell, we've got to make sure that we get our communication really tight and focused. I don't necessarily believe it means we have to drop our prices anymore. I think we've got to do a better job of communicating our value. And we also have to remember that the Taco Bell brand always responds to incredible breakthrough innovation. So I think you'll see more of that coming from Taco Bell. I have to give the KFC U.S. teams credit. I think George Hamilton, as the new Colonel behind Extra Crispy is brilliant and that is having a positive impact on our sales momentum at KFC in the U.S. right now. So we've gone back to a core product. We haven't had to discount. We've obviously wrapped it around $20 buckets and $5 boxes, but we've just done a much better job of breaking through with the communication. And then I think on Pizza Hut, we've announced that we're moving to a new agency. We will get to a new campaign sometime before the end of the year and I think the Pizza Hut team would agree, we can do a better job of communicating both better and easy. So I'm positive about what's happening now and I'm positive about what the guys are working on. And as I said, kudos to the KFC team, who I think have taken a core product and demonstrated you can deliver above-category growth by making sure you really have breakthrough communication. So better communication and making sure we've got the right price point, making sure we've got breakthrough innovation. I know that's what the three U.S. brands are focused on. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing and I'm encouraged by the momentum we have going into the third quarter. Greg Creed : So what I would like to do, I think just to quickly wrap up. So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. We really appreciate it. Pretty much my last answer probably summed up a lot of it which was we're encouraged by the progress we're making, particularly in those businesses that we've been focused on which is both Pizza Hut and KFC in China as well as KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. As I said, we're off to a good start in the third quarter in both China and the U.S. and all of us and particularly I'm looking forward to catching up with everyone at the Investor Conference in New York on October 11. Thanks for being with us today. We really appreciate it. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Greg Creed : Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Yum! Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from, at least, 14% to at least, 15%, owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly. Today, I\u2019ll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO will walk you through the financials. After that the team and I, including the Micky Pant, CEO of Yum! China; and Ted Stedem, CFO of Yum! China will be happy to take any questions you might have. For those of you who don\u2019t know Ted, he joined the Yum! China team in August. He has been with Yum! for the last seven years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently as a General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to Micky\u2019s leadership team, as they prepare for the separation. Now, let\u2019s begin today with China. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first six weeks of Q3, as sales were ahead of our plan. However, tougher laps in the second-half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast were compounded by an international court ruling regarding claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. At its peak, the demonstrations significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones and this was during our busiest season. The impact to our sales was sudden and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter our best estimate is, there was a 400 to 500 basis point impact to the division\u2019s same-store sales in the quarter. Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September has seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We\u2019re encouraged by recent trends through the important Golden Week holiday, which is currently ongoing and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter. In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales. But thanks to solid execution it appears to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business. As we prepare to separate the China business, there is a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum! China as a standalone public company operating in China. Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We\u2019re building the world\u2019s greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales. Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year. And with Ant Financial\u2019s Alipay, we\u2019ll continue to grow. Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery for more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities. And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation what is ironic is Yum and the China division have never been closer from a know-how and idea sharing perspective. And this will continue post-separation. You\u2019ll hear a lot more about all of this next week. Now, onto our three brand divisions, where I\u2019m excited to say, we are on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament to the talents and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we\u2019re very pleased that in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations. And what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, two of our three brands have been delivering solid results and have continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far. Our KFC Division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter, or 7% on a two-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. System sales in international developed markets grew 4%, and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continues to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe, and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open, at least, 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program. In particular, I\u2019m pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. Two-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading. And this is our 9th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an aligned franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core, innovation and value. The KFC U.S. team in partnership with the franchisees have really turned this brand around in the last two years. And the brand\u2019s continued strength in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success, as we share best practices across the system. Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by an unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can perform when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive. Now, I\u2019m confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place and now execution is the focus. Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven, ownable value bets to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another. In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch. Other markets now are taking learnings from this significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway. Finally, I\u2019m very pleased to talk about strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%, U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions, or over 2 percentage points better than the industry. Our strategy of bracketing value with $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value allow us to grow transactions and boost check. Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14%, driven by a $1 breakfast menu. We\u2019re now taking the learnings from this success and promoting our All Day dollar menus. This all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now leading the category in good value for money. As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential and we are excited to see the momentum behind this strategic objective. While it\u2019s early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress. So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing, nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China\u2019s largest employers with over 400,000 employees, serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is a powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy. As we announced on September 2, investments like Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial bring strategic value and additional local and digital know-how immediately and over the long-term. In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum! China with Dr. Fred Hu, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group to serve as Non-Executive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this Board will offer the marketing insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum! China to reach its full potential. Including the Primavera investments, Yum! China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn\u2019t be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company. And I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come. So in conclusion, at New Yum! the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation, we will be roughly 93% franchised with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming, at least, 96% of franchised by the end of 2017. We\u2019ve given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company, best position for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profit, and cash flow. And we\u2019re excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday. So stay tuned. And with that, it gives me pleasure to hand over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll cover three areas. Our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. Let\u2019s start with a high level overview of our third quarter performance. We\u2019re pleased the Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our three brand divisions, excluding China delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut. This growth is especially impressive, given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.. Combined, our brands are outperforming the category and we\u2019re pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter. In our China division, core operating profit grew 14%, despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of a value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales to leverage, primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling. As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compound by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise, given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is, this had a 400 to 500 basis point impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. It was most severe in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower tier cities, where the protests were most intense. The impact continues to dissipate and sales have recovered off their lows. Overall, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6 point negative impact from foreign currency changes. Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we\u2019re raising our 2016 full-year core operating profit growth guidance to, at least, 15% from at least, 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China, despite temporary sales headwinds, as we discussed. As expected, third quarter margins in the China division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last two quarters, we highlighted the changes to China\u2019s retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month-to-month, as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clear. As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that, we expect it to be worth, at least, two points of margin upside on a go-forward basis. We still expect full-year China restaurant margins of, at least, 17%. This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation, as well as our investment back into generating sales. Now, let\u2019s talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter, as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. For the full-year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units and for New Yum! Brands to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China. With regards to re-franchising, we\u2019ve committed to becoming, at least, 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised. Over the last four quarters, we\u2019ve re-franchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we re-franchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Re-franchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders, while reducing G&A expenditure as field level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency of Yum! with you next week. One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items was $44 million, with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full-year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items. Now, I\u2019d like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was five days into our third quarter. As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion. Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about five times EBITDA at New Yum!, while Yum! China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation. In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%. With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016. We\u2019re fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our Analyst and Investor Day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China division. In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date. Now, I\u2019d like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the Board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of one share of Yum! China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution. We expect to complete the distribution of Yum! China common stock to shareholders on October 31. When issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum! China will begin on the NYSE on October 17, and Yum! China will begin trading regular way as an independent company on November 1. As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum! China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investments, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume weighted average trading price in days 31 through 60, following the separation of Yum! China. Additionally, they will receive two warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche, with strike prices equating to Yum! China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion. This is an attractive structure for shareholders, as it minimizes upfront solution and highlights the long-term value in Yum! China as an investment. More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers to Yum! China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Dr. Fred who leads Primavera will become the Non-Executive Chairman of Yum! China, and Ant Financial will have an observer seat. Given the value of these ideal partners will bring to the table, we believe Yum! China is set up for success immediately and over the long-term. So to wrap things up, we had an exogenous and temporary event hit China sales mid-quarter. But we\u2019re able to hold the line on operating profit in China and with the strong performance of our brands outside of China, in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full-year. As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum! We\u2019re nearing completion of the separation of our China business and have secured strong strategic partners. We\u2019ve enhanced our capital structure and we\u2019ve made progress on re-franchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York Investor Conference next Tuesday. And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara, your line is open. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Thanks very much. I would like to ask just quickly about China and this \u2013 the protest. And in the context of, I think, you\u2019ve laid out sort of comps that over the long-term you would target in the mid single digits. But it feels like, we\u2019ve had a hard time getting there with periodic things that are outside of your control. So, I guess, the question I have is sort of twofold. One is, is there just a higher country risk now? And does that mean that long-term targets of kind of 4% to 5% maybe are going to be harder to reach? The second point, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth? Because it looks like unit growth gross units has continued to come down a little bit? Thanks. Greg Creed : Micky, we\u2019ll let you take that. Micky Pant : Yes. Well, thank you, Sara. I think the first point nobody likes giving weather and politics and reasons like that for sluggish sales. So trust me, we\u2019re very disappointed with the negative comp number. But this was very unusual. As you know, the first-half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, third quarter \u2013 second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending through the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the July 13, this matter started and we saw a very sharp sudden decline in sales. The good news was that thereafter the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have this impact. Two things, first is that unlike a food safety incident research that we\u2019ve conducted has shown that, there has been no damage whatsoever to the brand. Our trends have continued to improve. And I think the other point, which was mentioned in the \u2013 by both Greg and David, the spin-off coupled with the two very strong strategic partners we\u2019ve got have very deep respect in China I think that will help us in the longer-term in issues and matters like this. I think, if you are at the October 11, Tuesday Investor Meeting in New York, we\u2019ll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow comps into the future. But had it not been for this incident, we would almost certainly have had comp growth in Q3, and we\u2019re expecting from this point onwards through the rest of the year to get back to growth. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Sara Senatore : Great. Micky Pant : As far as the new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, I think the impact was, yes, it\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut dine-in build rate down from last year\u2019s 280 to about 150. That was done 150 still on a base of 1,500 is about 10%. We felt that was a responsible thing to do and to get Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. And once that is done, I think, we\u2019ll get back on to a strong growth path. So we don\u2019t see really a sort of ongoing decline in our new unit build rate in China at all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning, guys. A question on the non-China business. The Taco Bell and KFC businesses are going to be, I think, a little over 80% of new Yum!\u2019s profits after the separation. So it is really nice to see the comp acceleration in the sales at both of those brands. And I guess, this has seemingly happened without an industry acceleration underneath you. So what was it that changed so quickly in the third quarter for both of these brands to really divert from the industry so dramatically? And how much follow-through does this have going forward, the strategy that drove that? Greg Creed : Thanks, Brian. Yes, I think, I wouldn\u2019t say it was an abrupt change. I think certainly if you take the U.S., I mean, KFC U.S. has just delivered its 9th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. There\u2019s no doubt the plus 6 rolling over plus 2 and plus 8 is definitely means, we\u2019re growing share in the category, which is great. I put it down to, and if you think about what we ran in the quarter, we essentially ran extra crispy chicken, which we\u2019ve had for over 40 years in a $5 dollar box and a $20 bucket. I think what it demonstrates is, when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think, what you\u2019ll see is, you can get the customer to actually come in more often. And so I think that was certainly the KFC story. I was particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did and how quickly they reacted to their Q2 minus one number to change the calendar for Q3. It\u2019s not easy to do. So a huge callout to the Taco Bell team for basically getting us back into 1.29 flatbread, the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which did incredibly well and obviously then putting it in a $5 box. So, I think, the answer is, we\u2019re back to the core selling great core products. We\u2019ve got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning and I think that\u2019s the cornerstone for success. Brian Bittner : And the $1 all day menu at Taco Bell that you talked about, is that the same as the $1 cravings menu that you\u2019ve had, or is there something incremental coming on the all day $1? Greg Creed : Yes. So they ran a $1 breakfast menu through the quarter. And that, as you saw, delivered a really impressive 14% transaction growth in that daypart. What they\u2019ve done is, they\u2019ve now taken that to an all day value menu play, which has only just started in the marketplace. I think, as I said, what is impressive is not only do we have now the market leading position for a lot of prices we now have the category leading position for every day great value. And so I think that you\u2019re seeing these brands, particularly both of these brands strengthen in the marketplace. Brian Bittner : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open. John Glass : Thanks very much. Micky, I wanted to maybe just go back to you and talk a little bit more broadly about how your strategy in China is evolving. I think when you came in you focused more on the core, the buckets, and the value boxes. So what\u2019s working now in China? Do you need more value \u2013 and how have you used this crisis and how have you responded to it maybe differently than you\u2019ve done in prior periods if there has been any response? Can you talk a little bit about product evolution and price evolution? And I think in the past you\u2019ve given sort of the breakdown in China between traffic ticket and pricing, if you could provide that for this quarter? Thanks. Micky Pant : Sure. Firstly, what\u2019s working is, I was struck by when Greg was talking about the KFC U.S. business is very similar things. As you probably know, we did divert capital to store refurbishment in a very large way, so we\u2019ll give more details on the 11th, but we\u2019ve improved the look and feel of our stores quite considerably, especially in the larger cities. We did focus on our core bestsellers. So we did simplify the menu just a little bit. But the core bestsellers, including fried chicken, [indiscernible] sandwich were dialed up, and that is having a beneficial effect. Key price points, especially that crucial RMB29, RMB39 price points, which are the last two price points in this market. And lastly, digital. I think digital has been probably the most significant growth area for us. Our cashless payments have grown from 10% to 20% in a very short period of time. We expect that to continue as we partner up with people like Alipay to expand it. And our loyalty programs are significant now. So the percentage of transactions that are being scanned at the till for loyalty points is very significant. And overall spend on digital has become a very large part of our total marketing spend. All this put together is having good results. And we\u2019ve accordingly geared our calendar for the balance of this year, as well as for next year. So both on KFC and Pizza Hut considerable attention to core product key price points and continued in-store execution. And that really is what\u2019s working. John Glass : And just the breakdown between traffic ticket and pricing Micky Pant : That strategy \u2013 sorry, the second part of your question. David Gibbs : Sure. To give you the breakdown, we had a pricing impact of plus 1%. We had a mix impact of plus 3%, and we had transactions down 6% to deliver our same-store sales. John Glass : Thank you so much. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open. Michael Barbarula : Yes. Hi, thank you for the question. This is Michael on for John. Just on G&A in the context of being a 96% franchised business and post-spin, how is the company going to think about G&A? Will you look at G&A on a per store basis, or a percent of system sales? We are just trying to get a sense of what the right metric is and if there\u2019s a target or a benchmark? Thank you. Greg Creed : Yes, that\u2019s something that we plan on addressing in great detail at the Investor Conference next Tuesday. And we\u2019ll probably give you a couple of different ways to think about it and some frameworks. But we\u2019ll mostly be focused on G&A as a percentage of system sales. Michael Barbarula : Thank you. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America. Joe, your line of open. Joseph Buckley : Thank you. The question is on China, as well. I know you said that the sales impact is dissipating and you expect to be positive in China for the balance of the quarter. Does that mean that for the full quarter you\u2019re expecting China comps to be positive? And then also on China, you mentioned the VAT tax having at least a 200 basis point benefit on a go-forward basis. Was that the benefit in the third quarter? Can you share that with us as well, please? David Gibbs : Let\u2019s take the first. Micky Pant : Yes, sure. Look there was a benefit in the third quarter and it\u2019s an ongoing benefit and it\u2019s significant. I\u2019ll let Ted answer that question. So maybe, Ted, do you want to start with that and then I can get to the other part. Ted Stedem : Sure. On the VAT, as David said, we\u2019re still in the early months of the implementation of the VAT and the impact it has fluctuated since it was implemented. In the third quarter, it\u2019s fair to assume that the VAT was the primary driver of our margin improvement. David Gibbs : This is David. Just on the question about the guidance for the quarter, we don\u2019t, as you know, we don\u2019t typically provide guidance for sales in the quarter. But we did obviously mention, that we feel better about the balance of the quarter. We\u2019ve got some great promotions on the calendar in November and December that we\u2019re really excited about. And that\u2019s why we feel bullish on the balance of the quarter. But I\u2019ll let Micky talk a little bit more about some of those promotions and the impact we\u2019re expecting on the business. Micky Pant : Yes. Well, as you know, it\u2019s a four-month quartet and we\u2019ve passed September, which is a tough lap for us. We\u2019re in the middle of the Golden Week, which is the second most significant holiday after the Chinese New Year, and that is going well at this time. It\u2019s a peak selling period and comps are good. Thereafter, what we\u2019ve got in the month of November is a winning item that\u2019s been tested very well and we\u2019ve done well in the past extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique in the sense that the snack platter has got four parts to it and three of them are familiar to people from anywhere in the world, which is French fries, popcorn, chicken, and hot wings. But the fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is quite unique to hear. It\u2019s done very well in the past. We\u2019ve got that at a very keen price point of 29. So we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December for the first time last year, we started Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China, and the response is pretty good. So we\u2019re taking that to another level this year with covering the entire gamut from low-end meals at RMB35 to a bucket for families at RMB98. And with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world. So, December, I think, for the Christmas promotion looks particularly strong, and that\u2019s what gives us confidence in the balance of the quarter. So obviously, we can \u2013 we\u2019ll report Q4 when Q4 has done. But at this time felt the incident we feel is behind us. The Golden Week is going quite well and the calendar looks very strong. Keith Siegner : All right. Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. David, your line is open. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. The third quarter China restaurant margins were very close to peak levels even with well below peak AUVs. With the help of ongoing sales improvement and the VAT, where do you think margins can go over time for restaurants in China? And using your previous comments, just a quick clarification on the cash back to shareholders, it looks like you\u2019ve got almost $1 billion left, and I assume that that will go to the New Yum! and add to that the $4 billion less to get to your $10 billion target, it looks like you might have $5 billion over the next two-plus years. Is that right, and will that likely be share repurchase? Thank you. Greg Creed : Just taking the second part of that question, it\u2019s correct I think we have about $900 million to return to shareholders for the balance of the year in terms of cash buybacks. David Gibbs : And some of that will be completed between now and spin and the balance of it will be after spin as well. Greg Creed : Right. I think our original guidance was, we get this all done by spin. But the spin has actually moved up a couple of months from when we thought it would be done at the end of the year. Then on the second question on margin \u2013 future margin guidance for China, obviously, we\u2019re getting that that benefit as Ted mentioned that we estimate to be, at least, two points, of course, that\u2019s going to help our margins. But at this point in time, we\u2019re not going to provide margin guidance for next year. But I think as the China team becomes a separate public entity they will certainly providing more detail on those kinds of issues. David Palmer : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of\u2026 Ted Stedem : Yes, just to add to that David on the profitability overall for the quarter and even though the sales were not where we wanted them, operating profit grew very well. And our cumulative operating profit in three quarters was about equal to what we did in all of last year. So in some ways, the fourth quarter profit is going to be growth. And that\u2019s a big credit to our teams, where as you know, we own our entire supply chain and control it very carefully. So we have very good control on input, taxes, et cetera, and that\u2019s all helped us to get strong margin profit performance. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird. David, your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. I have a clarification question on the recent sales trends we\u2019ve seen in China. Micky, do you think the issue around the protest is still impacting the sales? I know you mentioned sales are modestly negative quarter to-date. Is that issue still lingering, and if so how are you measuring that and what do you think the underlying trend really is quarter to-date? Micky Pant : Well, we\u2019ve done two rounds of research where we actually measured sentiment and we had percentage of consumers reporting less inclination to go to one of our restaurants on account of the protest specifically, that number came down for us sharply. Now remember, the quarter-to-date includes all of September. And with that month gone behind us, I think, it\u2019s safe to say that the protest impact is now is very small, if not negligible. So I think that we can put behind us now. It always takes a little while to regain momentum once you get going in operations and everything else. So this October holiday is going to be quite crucial and determining that and our intention then is to keep the momentum. David Tarantino : Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. You mentioned, I think David mentioned in his script that there was some investments in driving sales planned in the fourth quarter. I know you mentioned some of these promotions, but can you maybe elaborate on what the investment side of that equation looks like? David Gibbs : Yes, we expect our overall A&P to be at the same level that we had always budgeted. We have made, because we had this margin benefit. We did invest some of it back. Some of it has gone into increasing \u2013 increase advertising spend on Pizza Hut. We think Pizza Hut got a good chance to recover momentum. We got soft laps for the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ve got some very good promotions in November and at Christmas, and we\u2019re putting additional money and advertising promotion behind those. We\u2019ve also got some unique China only deals with international IP on films, movies. And also, we\u2019ve got maybe three of the best celebrities available in China across the two brands, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve made investments. But it\u2019s all within what we\u2019d originally budgeted. So if your question implies that there will be any deterioration and profitability on account of that, that\u2019s not going to happen. David Tarantino : Thank you. David Gibbs : Key leverage will still be sales and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open. Greg Lum : Hi, good morning. This is actually Greg Lum for Karen today. I was just wondering if you could provide a quick update on the pace of remodels in China? And then based on the current units, what is the current average sales lift that you are seeing? David Gibbs : Sure. Micky Pant : October 11, we\u2019ll give a lot more detail. I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, but maybe Ted you can help. We have accelerated the rate of refurbish very quite dramatically, and we\u2019ll give you more numbers on the 11th. And I think what happens with refurbish is that, it\u2019s very difficult to quantify exactly the impact until you the get estate fixed. And when a certain percentage of the estate becomes current, then you get quite a substantial benefit, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting in time to come. We\u2019re very keen to keep the estate current, because China architectural standards, especially in the bigger cities have gone up dramatically over the last several years with a lot of international entries, and we have been left behind a little bit. So that has been corrected quite substantially. Ted Stedem : Sure. On the remodels, we\u2019re planning to do about 780 remodels this year, and this is going to be about a 50% increase versus what we did in 2015. And year-to-date, we\u2019ve completed a little over half. I think, we\u2019d say, we\u2019re getting great feedback from our consumers. We contemporized the experience. We\u2019ve made the restaurants more youthful, more energetic. And overall, I think, it\u2019s a very positive effect on the image of the brands, and we\u2019ll give you more updates at our conference next week. Greg Lum : Thank you, Ted. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. One, maybe David on the New Yum!, I mean, just looking at the operating margins this past quarter for proxy, I mean, they expended a couple of hundred basis point at each brand despite the mixed results and you are running from the low to the high 20% range in each of those brands. I\u2019m just wondering directionally perhaps how you think about the opportunity there with presumably the re-franchising? I mean, it seems like there is modest further re-franchising from here, but where you think those margins or what gating factors are there on that margin? And another question, Greg, just on Taco Bell, I mean a very strong result and it sounds like you attribute most of that to product news and more so on the value front. So with that as a backdrop, I\u2019m just wondering whether Taco Bell still aspires for more of that premium push and why you think the QSR category has been sluggish recently? I think you mentioned the category softness. I\u2019m just wondering what you attribute that to? Thanks. Ted Stedem : Yes, the first question on operating margins, obviously, as we move to an asset-light model, we\u2019re excited about its signification expansion in our operating margins. We\u2019ll give you a lot more color on the exact refranchising plans and how that would play out in terms of operating margin next week. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg for the second question. Greg Creed : I think Taco Bell is doing a lot of things right. It\u2019s not just the core product, it\u2019s not just the great value. Their assets are in great shape. The customer experience they\u2019re delivering is really, I think, as good as you\u2019ll find in the marketplace. They\u2019re obviously trying to make \u2013 this is becoming a incredibly culturally relevant brand, I think being a part of a millennial culture is what\u2019s really driving this performance. So I\u2019m very excited at all the things they\u2019re doing, I think sets us up for a continued long-term growth just across the broad front of all the things you want great brands to be doing. Jeffrey Bernstein : And in terms of the sluggish category, any thoughts on what you can attribute that to or? Greg Creed : Sorry. Look, it\u2019s hard to say that. We\u2019ve been doing a bunch of work just talking to different to millennials, Gen X, Gen Y, Boomers. I think where we\u2019re what five weeks away from a general election, I think there\u2019s just great uncertainty as to what\u2019s going to happen in the U.S., in particular, as a result of the outcome of the election. It goes without saying that people are sort of trying to decide who to choose and what the impact will be on the economy. And I think people maybe just hunkering down a little bit. But that said, that\u2019s why I think I\u2019m even more pleased with the performance of KFC and Taco Bell in the quarter, because despite that uncertainty those two brands, I think, in being incredibly distinctive and disruptive and going back to the quarter, delivering great experiences, making sure the value was right. Those \u2013 that\u2019s how you win even in a sluggish market. And I think there are lessons that we\u2019re also applying around the rest of the world. I mean, KFC outside of the U.S. had a \u2013 had just a gangbuster quarter probably with the exception of Japan, developed markets, developing markets. You can ask me any country, and I\u2019ll show you incredible sales growth. So I think the global growth of the KFC brand and the momentum it has and the strength that we\u2019ve now got in the U.S. sets that up for particular strength. Taco Bell, as I said across all the fact that you want to a brand to be strong at is just paring ahead. And I think once we get through the election and then that uncertainty is removed, hopefully, the market will find some momentum. But I\u2019m really confident that our brands can grow in either strong markets or markets that don\u2019t have the momentum we\u2019d love to have. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Matt, your line is open. Matt McGinley : My question is on the full-year guidance of 15% for operating profit growth. I know that includes the 53rd week, which I think at the beginning of the year you said was around 1.5, China for the full-year, I think, you said would be 20 and you always have that fourth quarter step down just based on seasonality, and I think you said the full-year would be 17. So my question is on the New Yum! Business, which they\u2019ve been running 9, 4 and 4 respectively for the three brands, you are going to have a step-up, part of it\u2019s going to be from the 53rd week, but there\u2019s also something else in there that I think implies you\u2019re going to have a bigger step-up. And I guess, my question is what inflects within the New Yum! outside of the 53rd week to get you to that full-year 15% operating profit guide? David Gibbs : Well, I guess, we\u2019d always anticipated the fourth quarter to be the best quarter of the year in terms of core operating profit growth. And that gets into a lot of features of our business performed last year expenses that we\u2019re lapping and things like that. I can\u2019t give you a precise answer other than to say the guidance was raised, because we do feel confident that the fourth quarter with the momentum that our brands have and the plans that we have in the fourth quarter and how they\u2019re tracking against those plans gives us lots of confidence and our ability to generate more profit than we thought this time last quarter. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Charles : Thank you. Just to clarify, was Taco Bell traffic ex-breakfast positive? And then my question was Taco Bell performed well on a difficult industry backdrop and obviously the competitive promotional environment continues to be pretty fierce. But I was wondering about the decision to launch a $1 all day menu as you guys seem to be seeing success with the $5 box strategy and, Greg, the core value strategy you outlined earlier. Presumably, these $1 menus, obviously $1 offerings have better margin \u2013 excuse me, the obviously, the core value offerings seem to have better margins than the $1 menu deal that you would be launching in the context of an inflationary labor environment? Greg Creed : So I guess my answer is, I think transaction would have been slightly positive. Obviously, we had a significant growth, as we said in breakfast, but I think without breakfast, transactions would have been slightly positive. I think the key to Taco Bell success it\u2019s just not just the one show pony. We didn\u2019t just do dollar menus. We also did Triple Double Crunchwrap in $5 boxes. So I think it\u2019s our ability to have great value and value isn\u2019t just what you pay, it\u2019s what you get. And I think if you look at what\u2019s in the boxes, or if you look at now the Sony promotion we\u2019re doing right now, which from the millennial point of view, it\u2019s an incredibly attractive promotional offer. I know the Sony boxm, the team is very happy with performance of the Sony box as we go into the fourth quarter, which is why we said we have momentum. So I think transactions were probably slightly up, ex-breakfast margins in the quarter, I think, we\u2019re well over 21% close to 22%. I\u2019ve been talking with some Taco Bell franchisees, I can assure you they love those sort of margins. And I think, as I see it with the work that Brian and the team is doing, we\u2019re set up for continued success at Taco Bell going forward. Andrew Charles : Thanks. Keith Siegner : Thanks. And next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is open. Brett Levy : Good morning. Can you dive a little bit deeper into the U.S. competitive landscape? Obviously, we\u2019ve talked about value and premium, but what are your thoughts with respect to traditional and non-traditional competition, especially with all the talk that\u2019s going on about food at home and away from home deflation? Greg Creed : Yes, look, I think we\u2019re all reading the same reports, whether they\u2019re industry reports or the newspaper, or what\u2019s online. There\u2019s no doubt that food from the grocery stores has declined. But not to say therefore some people aren\u2019t choosing to cook more at home. I think the fundamentals of what QSR office, which is always convenience and value will always be there. And as I said, in any market strong markets or sluggish markets, there always be winners and losers. And I think, having the right tactics in order to ensure that you win is, what\u2019s critical. And obviously, in the quarter, two of the brands delivered and we\u2019ve got lessons from that. And I\u2019m very confident that we can continue to apply those lessons to KFC and to Taco Bell and that we can apply those lessons to Pizza Hut. And there will be a lot more on the Pizza Hut story, but we\u2019ll talk about next Tuesday. And I know that Pizza Hut team is looking forward to telling you about their plans to reignite growth in that brand as well. David Gibbs : Thanks. My next weekend is\u2026 Keith Siegner : Next question, please, sorry. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis, your line is open. Dennis Geiger : Hi, thanks for the question. Greg, off the back of what you just said about Pizza Hut and more detail next week, is there anything that you can share on the strategy in the U.S.? Specifically, if you could provide the US company-owned number relative to the system, which I think you provided last quarter as a way to kind of seize some of the traction from the initiatives? And anything you can share on the easy and better initiatives or the local value message would be helpful? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes, sure. Well, I think the good news is next Tuesday Artie will take you through a lot about the whole easy and better strategy for the U.S. And obviously, Milind will talk about what\u2019s happening internationally. What I can tell you is during the quarter, the company same-store sales were 3 points ahead of system and transactions were 6 points ahead of the systems. So again, the company outperformed the system. And obviously, we\u2019re working with the franchisees to bring them along to sort of deliver that improved performance across the entire brand. Keith Siegner : Thanks. We have time for one more question please. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jeremy Scott with CLSA. Jeremy, your line is open. Jeremy Scott : Hey, good morning. Can you update us on the competitive activity in the O2O space in China? I have to assume that after about two years or so promotions and consolidation that within the industry these offers and incentives would start to wind down. So if you could just comment on that? And then secondarily, what percentage of your system sales are now moving through delivery channels? And then what percentage of those delivery sales are moving through the third parties? Micky Pant : Yes. Well, I think the space is still growing. We track \u2013 we repeatedly practice through industry monitors as well as we are looking at it very closely just internally to make sure we don\u2019t miss an opportunity. The gross merchandise volume is still growing. For us, the total delivery volume is approximately 10% of our sales, so circa $600 million, $700 million a year will go through delivery. The percentage that goes through aggregators, I don\u2019t have, it\u2019s not a very large percentage of what we have. Pizza Hut dine-in is significant and will grow through aggregators. But for the rest of it, it\u2019s mainly our own delivery systems. We are listed with the major aggregators. So we are present in all of them. It is true that there has been a lot of fallout, because in profitability of the aggregators reportedly is very negative. So, of course, the big three companies will still continue to support their delivery engines. But the rate of discounting, et cetera, I think has moderated over time. But it\u2019s still is a growth area. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith Siegner for closing remarks. Keith Siegner : All right. great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Once again please remember to mark your calendars for upcoming Analyst Investor event. We look very forward to speaking with you next Tuesday. Thanks. Greg Creed : Thanks for being on the call everybody. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

Corporate will now follow a calendar year beginning in 2017. Further, an 8-K will be filed by the beginning of April with full pro forma results. First-quarter 2017 earnings will be released on Wednesday, May 3 with the conference call following on the same day. The remainder of our 2017 key earnings dates are available on our website. This year, we will be hosting brand days in place of our annual investor and analyst event. The first will be Taco Bell, May 24 and 25 in Irvine, California. Further details will be provided at a later date. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you Keith and good morning, everyone. Given the weather that I see in the Northeast this morning, I am pleased that you could join us today as we share with you a review of our results and discuss the future opportunities for Yum! Brands. 2016 was truly a landmark year. On October 31, we completed the spinoff of the China business. This marked the largest strategic initiative undertaken by Yum! since our spinoff from Pepsi 20 years ago. I'd like to recognize the work, effort, and diligence across the organization that enabled us to complete the spinoff on time and with such success. The spinoff and concurrent return of $6.2 billion to shareholders in 2016 concluded step one in our transformation. We all want to extend a heartfelt congratulations to the Yum! China team on completing their first quarter as an independent public company. Micky, Ted, and the China team did a great job on their call Tuesday evening and we congratulate Joey on her promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. Step two of our transformation centers around executing our multiyear strategy to accelerate growth, reduce volatility and increase capital returns to shareholders. We are taking our franchise ownership to the next level and are on track to increase our franchise mix to at least 98% by the end of 2018. By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million and improve our efficiency by lowering G&A as a percent of system sales to 1.7%. In combination, these efforts will not only enable us to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, but improve absolute cash flow at the same time. I'm really happy to reaffirm the long-term targets we set out at our October investor and analyst conference, and I look forward to sharing highlights with you, as we progress. Simultaneously, we're strengthening the foundation underlying each of our businesses, changing our mentality to align with our growth transformation and taking the necessary bold actions to position Yum! Brands for even stronger same-store sales and net new unit growth. These are the building blocks of shareholder value creation for a world-class franchisor. We're championing the customer experience like never before, and putting a fierce emphasis on building brands. The linchpin in all of this, of course, is our focused strategy. I'm a firm believer in the power of focus and believe that we can deliver long-term, sustainable results by honing in on the key drivers of our business. Our four growth capabilities define every decision and action we undertake and make no mistake, they are driving our business every single day. We will win consistently by concentrating on being the best in the world with distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent. I am energized to lead such a talented team that is spearheading tangible change across our organization. As we outlined at our October investor conference, we're building a stronger growth machine and are well on our way towards our bold goal of 7% annual system sales growth. Now turning to our financial results, across many metrics, Yum! delivered a strong tier 2016. Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% in the year. This exceeded both our October 2016 investor and analyst conference guidance and our long-term target of high single-digit annual growth. Now with this in mind, let's review each division's results. First, KFC, whose consistent global performance is impressive. The division grew total system sales 7% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 3% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. In the quarter, same-store sales grew 3% or 6% on a two-year stack and core operating profit grew 15%, including the 53rd week. Total system sales grew 8% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Continental Europe. In international developed markets, total system sales grew 6% with strength in Canada, Australia and Continental Europe. I'd like to point out that the U.S. continued its positive momentum, recording its 10th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. The team deserves a lot of credit for delivering remarkable fourth-quarter comps of plus 4% or plus 7% on a two-year stack despite difficult industry backdrop. KFC global strategy to return to the fundamentals across the spectrum is paying off. Our strong pride in the core original recipe is at the center of everything we do and this translates to a focus on the basics in terms of recipe, a well-defined brand positioning, globally based on always original and clear value at memorable price points. Innovation closest to the core is resonating with the consumer. Just look at Nashville Hot and the recently launched Georgia Gold. We did not change the form of our product, only the flavor profile and our customers love it. As we look into 2017 and the future of KFC, I am encouraged by the opportunities we see worldwide. The brand is focused on convenience, making it easier to access KFC anyplace and in any way. For example, we are using flexible footprints, which increase the ease of unit development. With smaller asset types, we can build restaurants in places such as transportation hubs and urban centers. And KFC is also making a big push on the digital front in 2017 with self-ordering kiosks and a mobile site. Finally, the brand is expanding delivery around the world. Our product has a very shareable occasion and travels incredibly well, which gives us confidence in the upside of this opportunity. In fact, delivery is the fastest growing channel in the business, and while we offer delivery out of more than 5,000 restaurants today, we plan to expand this even further. Now turning to Pizza Hut, which grew total system sales 2% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 2% net new unit growth, but offset by a 1% contraction in the same-store sales. Pizza Hut is a strong global brand, but the U.S. and international are two distinct stories. We're pleased that our international division is laying the groundwork for prolonged growth, and we're particularly invigorated by the team's ability to drive development. Net new units grew 6% in 2016 and we expect continued growth as the development agreements signed last year take hold. You have already heard from Yum! China about its plans, but here are a few other examples. In 2016, we signed a substantial development agreement for Central and Eastern Europe. Separately, we signed a master franchise agreement in Australia, where we're excited our new partner opportunistically acquired another pizza chain, shortly thereafter will converge into Pizza Hut over time. At the same time, we are implementing our repeatable model to spread best practices around the world. We've developed a strategy where we improve taste, experience and our value proposition all while clarifying our brand message in order to ensure profitable, strong, transaction-driven unit level economics. We are taking our learnings from the success of Thailand where we grew same-store sales at least 20% for three consecutive quarters in 2016 to other markets. Korea, for example, has had several months of improvement. Malaysia is in the early days of success and others are implementing it, as we speak. We believe there is a significant opportunity for Pizza Hut International to accelerate top-line and unit growth, and look forward to delivering results consistent with these strategies. On the other hand, Pizza Hut U.S., which is roughly 10% of total Yum! operating profit, is clearly in turnaround mode. The quarter's results disappointed and are not acceptable. We have undertaken an extensive study of the business utilizing outside experts and found a number of areas where we need to improve in order to take our fair share of growth in this market. These areas include improvements in the digital experience, delivery times, point-of-sale system simplification, and asset optimization, among others. As with all turnarounds, this is a journey we need to undertake hand in hand with our franchise partners and will not be complete in 2017. We will share specifics of the plan in time as we implement them, but let me be clear, we see the market share opportunity in this category. We will execute initiatives across all aspects of the customer experience to capture our fair share and more, and I'm certain we have the ability and the determination to accomplish this. We've confronted challenges in all of our brands in the past and always overcome them. Most recently, we executed a successful turnaround of our U.S. KFC business, so stay tuned as we have more updates while we deliver on our plans. And finally, Taco Bell delivered a solid 2016 with system sales growth of 6%, including the 53rd week, driven by net new unit growth of 3%, and same-store sales growth of 2%. Taco Bell continued to outperform the category in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales of 3% or 7% on a two-year stack. The brand's value-driven, innovation-focused model once again proved its merit and I'm pleased with the team's ability to deliver solid results, despite difficult industry conditions. In the quarter, Taco Bell saw particular success with the $1 all day messaging and the rolled chicken tacos. As we look to 2017, we're energized by Taco Bell's high/low value strategy and its innovative marketing calendar, including the $1 double stack tacos and the highly-anticipated Naked Chicken Chalupa, which is off to a great start. On the international front, Taco Bell continues to build momentum. We opened 53 new restaurants, another record year of development. We saw strong fourth quarter same-store sales performance in Canada, Spain, and the Philippines. The brand launched in Brazil with five new stores in only three months and we're thrilled with the consumer enthusiasm for the Taco Bell in China, which recently opened and is off to a great start. In fact, I'll be visiting this critical market in March and we're already looking for ways to work together with Yum! China to accelerate the growth of Taco Bell going forward. In closing, I'm excited about the future of Yum! and the plans we have to unlock shareholder value. KFC and Taco Bell sustained a category defying momentum from December into the new year, which gives me confidence in our 2017 guidance, which David will outline in a few minutes. Every brand is working to improve the key drivers of our business, same-store sales and net new units. We are more focused than ever on collaboration, brand building, and translating this to profitable results for the long term. The path is never linear, but we're relentlessly pursuing our vision of a world with more Yum!. Now, before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment on behalf of everyone at Yum! to express our sympathy for Joe Buckley's family, friends, and colleagues at Bank of America and in the restaurant community. Joe will be sorely missed. With that, David, over to you. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you Greg and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Greg's sentiments regarding Joe Buckley. Beginning with my days as a division CFO, I got to know many in the analyst community, including Joe. I always admired him and looked forward to our conversations. Not only did he have great industry insights, but he always had a smile and a kind word. All of us at Yum! felt this way and we send our condolences to his friends and family. Today, I'll cover four areas in my following remarks. Our multi-year strategic transformation, our 2016 accomplishments and fourth-quarter operating results, our outlook for 2017 and an update on our refranchising and capital return plan. I'll start by emphasizing what Greg said at the beginning of his remarks. We're on a journey towards becoming one of a kind, global franchisor with a highly attractive and predictable free cash flow growth profile. By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million, improve our efficiency by lowering G&A to 1.7% of system sales and increase free cash flow conversion to 100%. As we shared at our October investor and analyst event, much of the EPS growth through 2019 comes from factors that are in our control; new unit growth, G&A reductions, refranchising efforts, and share buybacks. While our long-term guidance doesn't require our system sales growth to reach 7%, we're laying the groundwork to reach this bold goal with same-store sales and unit growth, only adding to my confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term guidance. Now let's review what Yum! Brands achieved in 2016. First, we completed the spinoff of our China business. We're pleased that Yum! China is set up for success as a powerful, independent growth company, and look forward to maintaining our strong relationships with them as we both work towards our common goals. Second, we completed $6.9 billion of debt financing transactions at very attractive rates. The average rate in our total debt outstanding is approximately 4.75%, with an average maturity of eight years. 90% of our $9.1 billion of total debt outstanding is fixed. We're now managing a capital structure, which is levered in line with our target of five times EBITDA, and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates, duration and flexibility. Third, we returned over $6 billion to shareholders, including share repurchases and dividends, slightly ahead of our original plans. We bought back 58.8 million shares prior to spin at an average price of $83 and an additional 9.1 million shares post spin at an average price of $63. And as many of you have seen, we announced our first quarterly dividend as new Yum! with a target payout ratio of roughly 45% to 50% of net income. Last, but not least, we exceeded our new Yum! core operating profit growth guidance of 10%, as provided at our October investor and analyst conference. Core operating profit grew 13%, including the 53rd week, with a strong fourth quarter of profit growth across all our brands. Note all numbers we reference today assume a license fee from China for the entire year and are based on restated 2015 numbers to make the comparisons apples-to-apples. So 2016, really was an exceptional year. Now let's take a high-level look at our fourth-quarter performance. We're pleased the Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 27% in the quarter, including the 53rd week. This was led by 27% growth at Taco Bell, 21% growth at Pizza Hut, and 15% growth at KFC. We were also pleased to see KFC and Taco Bell's third quarter outperformance of the category continue into the fourth quarter. As Greg already discussed, Pizza Hut International is gaining momentum and we are in the midst of executing a plan to turnaround the Pizza Hut U.S. business. Overall, EPS from continuing operations before special items grew 19%, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from foreign currency changes. Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. We're confident in our three-year plans and there's no change to our long-term guidance. Given an encouraging start to 2017 with continued momentum at Taco Bell and KFC, we see 2017 as a year where our underlying base business grows operating profits at a healthy high single-digit rate, entirely consistent with our three-year plan. Underpinning this high single-digit base operating profit growth, we're forecasting 2% to 3% global system-wide same-store sales growth and 3% global net new unit growth with each division increasing their pace of development compared to 2016. Combined, we expect global system sales growth of at least 5%, excluding the impact of FX. CapEx is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. I want to note that given two discrete items, which I'll outline momentarily, our underlying high-single digit base operating profit growth will likely come in closer to mid-single-digits in 2017 on a reported core operating profit basis. As a reminder, core operating profit growth only excludes FX and special items. First, the 53rd week lap is an approximate 1.5 percentage point drag on operating profit growth, just like it was a tailwind to our 2016 results. Second, we anticipate a mismatch in timing between lost profits from refranchising and the removal of associated G&A, which we expected heading into our transformation. This mismatch is purely timing-related and we estimate a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 percentage points to operating profit growth this year. This is particularly the case in international markets where the benefit of reduced expenses tied to refranchising can trail the actual sale of the restaurants. The magnitude of impact will vary depending on the pacing and sequencing of refranchising by brand and by market, and we'll update you as the year progresses. Again, this is calendar and timing, not base business results, and entirely consistent with our expectations and the plan we laid out in October. Given the potential range of refranchising gains that could occur, we don't believe meaningful GAAP operating profit growth guidance can be provided at this time, as it is difficult to forecast when specific refranchising transactions might occur due to market and other conditions. We continue to estimate that by completion of the strategic transformation, the overall impact of refranchising and G&A efficiencies on operating profit will be roughly neutral. And while there will likely be interim noise to operating profit owing to timing factors, operating margins, capital returns to shareholders, and free cash flow conversion all benefit immediately. Switching to capital returns, over the next three years, we are committed to returning an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We'll achieve this through a combination of refranchising proceeds, free cash flow generation, and maintaining our five times leverage. All in, we are targeting over $13.5 billion of capital return during our transformation, which spans from the fourth quarter of 2015, where we announced our intention to separate into two companies, through 2019 year-end. Now, with regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 98% franchised by the end of 2018. As of the end of 2016, we were 93% franchised. During 2016, we refranchised 427 restaurants, excluding China. In the fourth quarter, specifically, we refranchised 232 stores, including 120 KFCs, 83 Pizza Huts, and 29 Taco Bells. We won't provide interim targets as we work towards reaching our new franchise mix of at least 98%. I remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver on our stated target by 2018 year-end. Now, I'd like to talk about our capital structure. As part of our strategic transformation, we increased our leverage to about five times EBITDA last year. Should market conditions and/or government policies potentially change, we'll optimize and refine our positioning to ensure we're making the best decisions for our business and stakeholders. But at this time, we're happy with our capital structure and remain committed to maintaining this leverage profile. So to wrap things up, we are pleased with our accomplishments in 2016 and with the progress we've made to date on implementing our strategic transformation. Fourth-quarter operating profit growth was solid and ahead of expectations while the new year has gotten off to a good start for both Taco Bell and KFC. I'm very confident in the strength of our business model, and am certain we're taking the appropriate actions to ensure it optimizes shareholder value. We believe the disciplined decisions we're making today, coupled with the multiple actions taken in 2016, set us up for strength over the near and long term. And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open. Alexander J. Mergard - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, this is Alex on for John. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your fiscal 2019 EPS goal, and given significant FX headwinds and kind of the turnaround at Pizza Hut, is there any ability for you to flex a little bit more on G&A, perhaps below the 1.7% goal? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: As far as the 2019 target for EPS, obviously, there are some FX headwinds to that, that are setting us back, but our interest rate has come in a little bit better than we expected, so there'll be pluses and minuses as we go along the journey. And as far as our pressure on G&A, I'm really pleased that the organization has embraced our effort to get more efficient and we're certainly looking for G&A efficiencies continuously as we go forward on this journey, but at this time, our long-term guidance remains the same. Alexander J. Mergard - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Just a follow-up on your comment on EPS growth first. If we look at your three-year target, and if we go out to that 3.75%, that's a lot of EPS growth relative to the comments you made on 2017. How do you think about 2018 and 2019 just conceptually in terms of growth versus 2017? And about unit growth specifically, you talked about a modest acceleration in 2017 on unit growth. How are you thinking about that and what are you doing to stimulate unit growth further? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Obviously, our bold goal, David, is 7% system sales growth and as David outlined, we believe we can get to 2% to 3% same-store sales growth next year and 3% development. I think what's very clear is that we are much more focused on these two. So, as I work with the leaders in the organization, I would say we've raised the awareness on the importance of net new unit growth, not just in the U.S., but outside. In that context, obviously, we had a very strong year at Taco Bell. Obviously, at KFC in the U.S., we've been a net closer. I believe that by the time we get to the end of 2019, we will be a net builder of new units at KFC, so I think that will be a turnaround. We have signed significant development agreements with Pizza Hut International with a number of franchisees around the world. These are in the order of magnitude of 200 to 300 restaurants over like five years. And I think that on the KFC front, our ability to continue to penetrate in emerging markets remains. So I feel very good about our ability to continually grow our net new unit growth, and I think there's an equal focus on same-store sales growth, getting back to really understanding consumer insights, really getting to what makes the consumer different, and really understanding that what we're delivering is a food experience, not just food. And I think all of that will help us enormously. And so, I feel confident that I think we probably grew system sales around 4% last year. We are tithing at least 5% this year and I think we're definitely on our way to delivering close to the bold goal of 7% by the end of 2019. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Brian, your line is open. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Thanks very much. Kind of piggybacking on these questions around 2019 EPS, when you think about that plan to get there, you mentioned that you don't need 7% system wide sales growth to get there, even though that's one of your goals. So maybe you could talk about what is the system sales growth required given what you know today about all the financial controllables that you have much more certainty about. That's the first question. The second question to Greg. I was just wondering if you can take a step back and maybe talk from a high level what you really think the biggest changes taking place within the Company are as you see it as you transform pretty rapidly here from an operating company to more of a franchise company. I mean I think we see all the external, but financial benefits obviously, but maybe you can touch on some of the other points and maybe why that is giving you the confidence in the acceleration in systemwide sales growth. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes, as far as the components of our journey to the 2019 EPS guidance, as we've said before, we're not going to get into specific details around sales guidance, for example, other than to just say that they're reasonable assumptions consistent with historical and our modest expectations for it going forward. I'll just remind everybody that share repurchases, things that are very much in our control, make up the vast majority of this journey, which is why we have confidence in being able to hit the targets. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes, and to answer the second question. I think there's really three things, Brian. I think the first one is we are much more focused as an organization. We are absolutely focused on driving same-store sales, net new unit and, obviously, shareholder returns. I think there's four areas that we are more focused in building distinct and relevant brands, obviously, enhancing our franchise capability, this bold asset development and unrivaled culture and talent. And internally, even as we did the 2017 AOP, it was very clear across all the divisions that they are more focused on these four things, which we believe will ultimately lead to stronger system sales growth. I think the second thing is, we're running the organizations really through what I call a global leadership team. So, it's not just the Yum! executive team, but we meet monthly as a global leadership team, which is obviously the division CEOs and Presidents. And I think the last meeting, which we had two weeks ago, they remain incredibly confident and optimistic about both 2017, as well as hitting all the three-year transformation plans. And then the last one is, we're going to have our first global leadership conference in five years in about a month. This will be bringing the top 200 leaders of the organization together. And essentially, the core of this meeting is about how do we go from good to great? How do we go from growing 5% system sales and get to 7%? And my objective is to use those 200 leaders to essentially be co-authors of this growth because we are going to have to do things differently. We are going to have to be bolder and I want them to co-author that sort of how. I know they are excited about it and I believe that we will leave with everyone having absolutely clear clarity on what we are doing on the focus that we are changing, and I think, hopefully bolder and more courageous decisions that will get us from sort of 4% to 5% system sales growth to the 7% number, which our bold goal. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara, your line is open. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Pizza Hut, if I could, because, obviously, I think that's the one where you see the most opportunities to improve. But I guess you said, Pizza Hut is really a tale of two markets, but if I look even across globally, it is the softest business. So, my questions are what are the opportunities here? I mean are there specific markets that you could point to that really set a path and are very strong and where you could share best practices? And if you can't reaccelerate Pizza Hut, can you still deliver against your targets? Is there a strategy to refranchise that to 100%? Can you help sort of quantify the opportunities and challenges for that? Thank you. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure, Sara. So let me just say, I think we did deliver 6% net new unit growth in Pizza Hut International last year and I know the team because of the development agreements we've already signed, very, very confident that we continue to grow net new units in the Pizza Hut world. There are some very good examples, as you mentioned, about what we are calling the repeatable model. So in Thailand, we've turned that business around. I think we've delivered at least 18% sales growth for three quarters in a row. We've obviously captured what we've done there, and as I alluded in my remarks, taking that to Korea and Malaysia. I'm excited about the master franchise agreement that we've done in Australia. The results in Australia have improved markedly. I happened to meet with the master franchisee when I was there in December. I'm very impressed and I think that you will see both stronger same-store sales growth, as well as, as I said in my remarks, the opportunistic ability to acquire another pizza company and transform those assets into Pizza Hut. So on the international side, I feel very good that we have captured the repeatable model, the things that work, and that we have an accelerating net new unit model in place. In the U.S., I think it's very clear. In fact, the way I look at it, I go back to what is the underpinning of why Taco Bell had a pretty successful 10-year run and what is it that helped us turn around the U.S. KFC business? I think it's really two things. It's the partnership and relationship we have with the franchisees and that then leading to an aligned long-term strategy. And so, I think if you \u2013 if I look at Taco Bell, I think our relationship with our franchisees is world-class and that enables us not to be in a week-to-week, month-to-month planning cycle, but to be really looking at the long-term and have great sort of trajection. I think, as I said on the KFC U.S. turnaround, I think Jason Marker, and the team, they changed the relationship with the franchisees, and on the basis of that change in relationship, we've now got a much more long-term sort of strategic alignment. On the Pizza Hut side, I think the good news is I know that both the franchisees and us want to replicate the results of both Taco Bell and KFC. I think both sides recognize that we need to improve the relationship and out of that relationship will become hopefully a more long-term aligned strategy. So, while there are many things to do at Pizza Hut, as we have talked about, there's assets, there's technology, there's operating systems, there's communication. I think fundamentally, when we get ourselves into an aligned long-term strategy that executes the plan, we know we've got a plan, then I believe we'll start to see an improvement in Pizza Hut. So I remain positive that we can do this. We know what's got to get done and I do believe our franchise partners at Pizza Hut want to be successful just as much as we do. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: And on the refranchising question, of the 427 units that we sold in 2016, 195 of those were U.S. Pizza Hut. So we have reduced our exposure to the U.S. Pizza Hut business a little bit. And certainly, as we go forward selling stores in Pizza Hut is part of our strategy along with the other brands. But I won't provide any more specifics on the go-forward plan, but we'll update you as we move forward on that. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. Greg, I wanted to ask you where you think delivery fits into the strategic priorities of the company right now. It's a global phenomenon across your brands and across other brands. Can you maybe sketch out how you think about it and the prioritization, how you think about it by brand and maybe where you are on a delivery percentage of sales or however you look at it by each brand and if there's countries where you are getting best learnings? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes, well, obviously, the Pizza Hut business is a delivery business and I think in the U.S., well, through delivery and carry out, more than 90% of the sales come from that now. So the other thing I'm really excited about is Roger's commitment to take KFC and make it more of a global delivery brand. As I said in the prepared remarks, we are already in 5,000 stores doing delivery. Obviously, we have over 20,000 KFCs. The great thing about KFC is it is perfectly set up to be delivered. There is nothing better than a bucket of Original Recipe chicken in terms of a transportation vehicle, product that holds its heat, delivers well. So, in that sense, I do believe, and I know Roger believes that accelerating delivery is a key part of it. And on Taco Bell, obviously, Brian has started to roll out Taco Bell delivery. This product isn't as well set up to be delivered as the other two brands. But what is interesting is that when people want this product, they'll have it delivered. I think we're already in about 400 stores in the U.S. It's not a huge part of the business at the moment for Taco Bell. I know that Brian and the team are committed to accelerating that. Where we do have delivery, particularly around college towns, it can actually be, I think, about 4% or 5% of sales, but still a long way to go. So, to answer your question, we're focused on it. We really have to turn Pizza Hut into a delivery brand. We're still probably well known as a dine-in brand, but the delivery brand is what we've got to change the consumer's perception. KFC, we're committed to growing delivery and we have a great product to deliver. And on Taco Bell, our customers want it; we're just going to work at how we get it to them. So, the answer is we're very focused on that, and that will be one of the drivers of growth. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: The only thing I would add is that Taco Bell is actually in over 900 stores with delivery now. And when you think about the Pizza Hut business, one of the challenges we have in the U.S. is more than half the stores are \u2013 have dining rooms attached to them and aren't really ideally set up for delivery. So that is \u2013 part of the journey at Pizza Hut is getting into more delivery-friendly assets over time. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And David, if I could just quickly follow up on G&A. I know there's going to be timing issues around refranchising in international, but you must have used the G&A number in your guidance for 2017 in the high-single digit or mid-single digit excluding these things. Can you give us some sense of where you think you are at the end of the year in G&A for 2017? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Here's what I'll say on the G&A front. If you look at what we've released in 2016, it looks like G&A went up about $60 million. But the reality is, if you back out special, it went down about $50 million. And that's before the effect of inflation. So, we had \u2013 we made some considerable progress on G&A in 2016. In 2017, we've got a different mix of refranchising and G&A cuts that collectively is going to provide this 1 to 2 point headwind. But we're certainly on track with the plans that we had to get to the 2019 targets, and we're going to make meaningful progress on G&A in 2017, similar to the progress that we made in 2016. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Gregory, your line is open. Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Just one quick clarification. On tax rate, I think the last update you guys had given was like a 26%, 27% tax rate for the new structure, but we are a little bit below that. Is that still the right number as we look out over the next couple years, or should we think about maybe a lower number? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: No, we believe that's the right number. Obviously, there's uncertainty on that as we're seeing potential changes in policy, but that is our current guidance. Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then just thinking about technology for the three brands, can you give an update on where you stand around common POS, digital ordering, potentially loyalty? Just sort of an update on the technology front for the different brands. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, on Pizza Hut, hopefully by the end of the year we'll be at a single POS system in the U.S., which will help enormously. Internationally, we're looking at getting out of multiple POS systems down maybe one or two, so that will help dramatically. Taco Bell is almost at a single POS and back-of-house system, which obviously sets them up for eCommerce, digital, social. And KFC is obviously also making progress to get to a more aligned one system. That will help us do things like loyalty, which obviously are critical and important in the marketplace. It sets us up to obviously drive the social agenda, and I think all of that will lead to improved growth to the business going forward. Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is that more of a end of 2017 and then we start thinking about some of these initiatives kicking in in 2018 around loyalty and digital ordering as you think about sort of the outlook on timing? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I mean I think, well, obviously, Pizza Hut's got a very big digital ordering business today, but I think the opportunity for us to do loyalty and things like that will obviously happen once we get to this single POS system. Taco Bell already has mobile apps you can obviously order through. I think that business isn't large yet, but what it does do is actually make the brand a relevant brand. So, it's one of those things where we may not be getting a lot of business from -eCommerce on Taco Bell, it does actually reinforce that this is a millennial-centric brand. And then on KFC, yes, I think it's not going to happen any time soon, but we definitely know we need to be in the loyalty business. And so, whether it's late this year, next year, that's probably more the timing that things will occur. Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. I had one question and then one just reporting clarification. From a question standpoint, following up on the G&A discussion from earlier with the plans to reduce kind of to that 1.7% system sales, just wondering, as we think about the operating margins, kind of below that line, we've seen hundreds of basis points jump at each brand. Whether or not the brand is challenged or not, we've seen big jumps, which is obviously driven by the refranchising, but I am just wondering in terms of your insights, long-term goal by brand maybe, or maybe just at what point we reach a certain level where you say, you know what, it's hard to see that operating margin expand much beyond that. Just trying to see the pacing and sequencing of what appear to be very big jumps in the operating margin for each brand. And then just from a reporting standpoint, just to make sure that we're all on the same page, I mean it looks like for the fourth quarter of 2016, you adjusted to reflect the pro forma, assuming Yum! China was a franchise model for the period, but we should do the same presumably for the prior three quarters of 2016? I mean I think you had an 8-K out there that gave the 3Q 2016 year-to-date, but just want to make sure I didn't miss anything in terms of the first three quarters separately, so quarter one, two, and three by segment restated as if China was a franchisee for the full year. Thanks. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay, Jeff, this is Keith. First, on the margin question, good question. And, yes, this is all consistent with the plan. Post the October investor and analyst event, we put a slide up that actually showed pro forma for the whole transformation to at least 98%. What our restaurant level and EBITDA margins and EBIT margins would look like on a baseline of 2015. So, if you look at that, you can actually see pretty explicitly where we think those margins can get to within a vacuum. On the other front, yes, as I said in my introductory comments, we're going to get you pro forma results for the new fiscal year and for China, and we're shooting for early April. So, that will be full quarterly just like \u2013 look, I've been in your shoes and I know what you're looking for and what will be most useful. It is coming. We're shooting for early April. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I get it. I was under the impression from the press release that the adjustment you were giving by early April was just the realignment of the months versus kind of the periods you were using. I just want to make sure we are also talking about quarterly 2016, the first three quarters individually in terms of each quarter restated with China as a franchisee with the royalty payment coming in by segment. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, that's early April? Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Restated for everything. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So at this point, we should be taking the year-to-date we have for the third quarter and doing our best to just kind of cut it up to come up with the first three quarters of 2016 and applying it by segment? Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David, your line is open. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. My question is on the comps outlook for this year, 2% to 3% globally. That would be better than what you've been running in recent years, and in recent quarters. So just wondering what your degree of confidence in that outlook is as you sit here today and whether it requires some improvement at Pizza Hut or if you're assuming improvement in the other divisions. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, David. It obviously is ahead of our run rate. As I think I said earlier, the organization is much more focused on two things, driving same-store sales and delivering net new units. So, I think just the amount of time we're spending on what do we need to do in order to deliver that growth, as we alluded to, obviously, both KFC and Taco Bell, took that sort of Q4 momentum into Q1. We've got the launch of Georgia Gold, you've got the launch of Naked Chicken Chalupa, and obviously, we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut. So, with the plans that we put together for the AOP, I feel really good about the plans across the brands, internationally, and in the U.S. It's nice to go into the quarter with some momentum. And I think this focus is really starting to pay off. And I'll be even more excited when we come out of the global management meeting and I've got the top 200 leaders to really help us think about what else could we do from a bold and courageous point of view in order to deliver even more same-store sales growth and even more net new unit growth. I'm really looking forward to that meeting because there's nothing better than being asked to co-author your own future. So, I feel good about that. I feel good about the plans that the divisions presented in 2017, and now we've got to go and execute, which is what we've traditionally been very good at. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And Greg, thank you for that comment. Just to be clear, does the guidance this year or reaching the guidance this year require better performance out of Pizza Hut? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, I think, look, our performance will differ, obviously, across the three brands. So, in averaging 2% to 3%, I have expectations that maybe one brand will do better and one will do a little less and one will do about that number. So, I'm not expecting every brand to deliver that. I think the brands that have got momentum, we can build on that. And the brand that doesn't have momentum, we've got to do a lot of work. I sat down with the Pizza Hut U.S. team yesterday. We were reviewing calendar changes for this year, which obviously, they're working with the franchise community. So, no one is sort of sitting still either. If we are having success, we're trying to build on it. If we're not having success, we are acting quickly in order to change the trend. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla, your line is open. Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. I'm wondering if you could just give us the baseline number for the restricted group EBITDA. I know the financials you typically put on the website, but they're not up yet. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Carla, we don't have that number with us right now. Give me a call afterwards and we can discuss. Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then one other question. Have you seen any impact on sales internationally as when we see news from Trump that's more domestic-focused or I guess that's causing any rift with international countries? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think the easiest answer is no. I'm not seeing any impact anywhere. There's obviously a lot of discussion and speculation, but I'm not seeing any impact on our business in any country so far. Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Hargreaves with Stifel. David, your line is open. David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks. Yes, just to echo that last comment, if you guys could put restricted group EBITDA in the press release going forward since bondholders don't really \u2013 we've got a subordinated claim on Taco Bell performance. It would help a lot. It's hard to back into. Looking at the deltas in the cash from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, it was a big change and we will back into it in time, but I was just wondering if you could go over the major changes. It looks like you went from about $2.9 billion to $700 million. Could you talk about the big pieces there and then your comfort level with that cash balance? Thanks. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: David, this is Keith. On November 3, we filed an 8-K showing a pro forma end of 3Q balance sheet and cash flow statement for Yum! excluding China. What you'll see is a lot of the cash you just referenced in the $2.99 billion related to China. So, we show you actually what it was, excluding China, as of the end of 3Q. Then, if you do the walk from that number to what we show at the end of 4Q, largely that is one quarter of dividend and the share repurchases that were accomplished through the quarter, as we outlined in our press release. Give me a call afterwards and we can clarify, but that should be all the pieces you need to get through the walk. David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But the $700 million is pretty much what you'd expect to have going forward, more or less? Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: That's what we have now. Long term, in terms of cash needs, it's a little different now, given the moving pieces related to refranchising. We still have some company-operated stores. We do not need $700 million, as of now, and we'd like to knock that down over time. Historically, we've been in the $600 million to $700 million range, including China. So, it's less than that now. We'll update you as we get closer to run rate at the end of the transformation, but definitely less than the $700 million we have now. David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Lastly, your 6.25% notes go current in March, so I'm just wondering if you're comfortable having those on the balance sheet till maturity or if you might deal with them proactively? Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: As we said, we're monitoring all market and macro conditions constantly, trying to make the best decision and get to the optimal mix of interest rate, duration and flexibility. As we said, we're comfortable with this \u2013 with our capital structure right now. If anything changes, we'll communicate that in due course. David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : Gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, guys, so much for taking me at the end. Thanks and for the third question for JPMorgan. The question is on Pizza Hut. In your press release, 47% of Pizza Hut sales are in the U.S. David, you made a really interesting comment that half of the units in the U.S. are dine-in assets and not really set up for delivery. So you kind of have a big chunky part of your business that's not really optimized for where the consumer is and probably where the consumer is going either. So can we talk about how to isolate that red roof asset, that dine-in asset that really does kind of complicate and make the difficulty of turning around the Pizza Hut brand very different than other platforms that exist that are delivery and carry out only? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, the good news, John, is that our Delco model, our small box model, is a really good economic model. The cash paybacks from building Delcos is three to four years, on average. So, we have a way to get out of those red-roof restaurants that are holding us back. And by the way, not all of them are sub-optimized for delivery. Some of them were built more recently. Some of our dine-in stores aren't even red-roofs; they were built with a newer model. So there's a mix of assets there. But we do have an economic way to get into a better asset and, Artie Starrs, the President of the Pizza Hut U.S. business is working with the franchisees on a plan to make that happen. And unlike a lot of transformations where you can introduce a new product overnight and it's a quick fix, this one takes a little bit of time. We also have a fast-casual model, which we've talked about at previous investor meetings, which really plays into the current trend in the pizza category. We are seeing a lot of growth in fast casual. We've had a lot of success with that, albeit with a small number of units. And the franchisees and the Pizza Hut management team are excited about it and using that as another option to get into an asset that's better positioned for delivery, but also can add incremental sales through lunch day parts in this fast-casual model. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A couple of years ago, gosh, maybe it was five years ago, maybe more, you kind of drove a pretty significant contraction of KFC in the U.S. and at the back end of that contraction, you contributed some capital to KFC franchisees as well. I think it was related to ovens and maybe some other things. Do you think the Pizza Hut brand is kind of in that position where you make it a better brand, a smaller brand and perhaps you actually do step up and contribute either some OpEx or CapEx to the U.S. franchisee? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think right now we are, obviously, having a lot of discussions with the U.S. franchisees, which Artie is leading. And I think until there's an outcome, I think, as I said earlier, I think the great thing is that the U.S. Pizza Hut franchisees, as much as we do, want to obviously turn the performance around and be more like KFC and Taco Bell in the U.S. They understand that it's going to require a partnership. They understand it's going to require long-term strategic alignment. And I think how that plays out in terms of what both sides do in order to build that relationship and get ourselves strategically aligned, that is sort of, I guess, work in progress. But I am very confident that both sides want to obviously get to a better place and get this brand back into growth. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thanks again, guys. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Creed for closing remarks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: So, thanks, everybody, for being on the call. I guess for me 2016 was a landmark year. We successfully spun off Yum! China, we launched this multi-year transformation plan, and we returned $6.2 billion to shareholders. I'm very pleased with the results and a solid end to what, I think, was an extraordinary year. Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% for the year, obviously exceeding our guidance. I remain very confident in our three-year plan. So, there's no change to our long-term guidance and I'm encouraged by the early progress we're doing to unlock growth through this sort of focused four growth drivers. We're off to a running start. I think we can accelerate growth, reduce volatility, and increase capital return to shareholders. So, I guess in summary, I'm very excited about the future of Yum! And I think we represent an extremely compelling growth story and one that investors, I hope, will buy into. So, thanks for being on the call. Thanks for coming out in the horrible weather and we look forward to speaking to you all very soon. Thanks, again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning, my name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands' First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Keith Siegner, Vice President, Investor Relations, Corporate Strategy and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; and David Gibbs, our President and CFO. Following remarks from Greg and David, we will open the call to questions. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investor section of the Yum! Brands website, www.Yum.com, to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today's call. System sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. Our 2016 results have been restated to adjust for two items. First, as we've previously disclosed, we changed our fiscal year to better align our global reporting calendar. Second, restated results reflect the impact of new accounting standards for pension cost recognition, which we adopted in the first quarter of 2017. An 8-K was filed on April 13, 2017 with restated results. We're broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. We would like to make you aware of the following changes and upcoming Yum! investor events. First, disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be filed simultaneously with the filing of our first quarter 10-Q. Second, second quarter earnings will be released on August 3, 2017, with a conference call on the same day. The remainder of our 2017 key earnings dates are available on our website. Third, this year, we will be hosting Brand Days in place of our annual investor and analyst event. The first will be Taco Bell, May 24 and 25, in Irvine, California. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone, Yum! Brands delivered : first quarter core operating profit growth of 9%; system sales growth of 5% in constant currencies; and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 17%. We are maintaining our full-year guidance of mid-single-digit core operating profit growth, which assumes high single digit underlying base operating profit growth, offset by 1.5 percentage point 53rd week headwind and another 1 to 2 percentage points headwind from the net timing impact of refranchising and associated G&A reductions. With regards to our transformation, I'm pleased to report that we remain on track with our refranchising and cost saving initiatives. These efforts are elevating our organization into one that is more focused, more franchised, more efficient, and ultimately delivers more growth. This is why all of us at Yum! are realigning our efforts toward our four growth drivers : distinct relevant brands; unmatched franchise operating capability; bold restaurant development; and unrivaled culture and talent. Today, I'll give examples of two of these growth drivers, unrivaled culture and talent and distinctive relevant brands. I'll then hand the call over to David Gibbs to provide more details on the quarter as well as an update on our two other growth drivers, unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development. Then, we'll open the call up to questions. To begin, I truly can't emphasize enough how much of a competitive advantage our culture is to Yum!. At our Global Leaders Summit in March, we brought together our top 200 leaders in the organization to coauthor how we will think, act, and lead differently to accelerate growth. A transformation mindset has taken hold throughout the organization, a culture that fuels results. The energy and excitement behind our transformation is tangible. We've already seen many new and powerful ideas arise. And collaboration across brands has never been stronger, with an amplified effort on repeatable models. I'm confident our efforts to unlock the power of Yum! will benefit all stakeholders, from franchisees to shareholders to employees. Now, I'd like to review Q1 results, beginning with KFC, which is our largest division, representing about 50% of our operating profit with nearly 21,000 restaurants in 128 countries. The division has consistently delivered top and bottom-line growth at an impressive rate. In the first quarter, total system sales grew 5%, driven by 4% net new unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and New Zealand and Latin America all grew same-store sales 6% or more, which was partially offset by France and the Middle East. All-in, solid sales in larger markets I just mentioned and firm G&A control across the division helped offset the operating profit dilution from refranchising. And core operating profits grew 13% for the quarter. At KFC U.S., same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter, all of which was transaction growth, as Georgia Gold, Nashville Hot, consistent value and distinctive relevant marketing all benefited the quarter. This quarter marked 11 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth, a strong result by any measure. I'd like to spend a couple more minutes on this business, not only because of its continued turnaround, but as an example of the types of bold transformational actions we are taking here at Yum! with lessons we can apply to Pizza Hut, as I'll discuss later. The first step in the KFC U.S. turnaround was reaching a clear alignment with franchisees in early 2015 about the strategy and entering into an Acceleration Agreement, which we've discussed with you before. Second, was implementing the Re-Colonelization effort, operational excellence is at the core of success for any brand and it was for KFC's turnaround, as well, with ingredients and procedures held to a very high standard and with upgrades to equipment. Third, creative marketing around clear value constructs and innovation helped to make KFC a distinctive and relevant brand again. Now, franchisees are investing in assets, adding new sales layers, and demand from new franchisees has spiked. This turnaround has been years in the making and required a lot of hard work, but restaurants are a momentum business, and I'm confident that we can carry the momentum forward. On that note, it's those years of hard work that enabled us to introduce our global fan favorite, the Zinger spicy chicken sandwich in the U.S. last week. The Zinger has long been one of my single favorite items across the global Yum! portfolio. Unlike our competitors' products, it's hand-breaded in store for a crunchier, juicier, and more flavorful sandwich. Roughly 40% of the U.S. chicken category sales come from sandwiches. And we realize just how big an opportunity this is for KFC. With clear system alignment, excellent operations, proper sandwich equipment, and a distinctive and relative marketing, the time is right to launch this standout portable product. Kudos to Kevin Hochman and the team, and our newest Colonel, Rob Lowe, for some breakthrough work. While it may take some time to fully establish this new sales layer, we are extremely excited about its potential over the long term. Switching to KFC International, I want to highlight an example of the power of Yum! in KFC's global delivery initiative, which we're aggressively pursuing as a strategic growth opportunity. We currently deliver out of almost 6,000 stores and plan to expand this rapidly over the next few years for many reasons. Not only do consumers want it, but KFC's product is ideal for delivery, as it holds temperature and quality remarkably well. Also, the vast majority of sales are incremental, since it captures a different consumer occasion. Yum! China is world class in developing a combined delivery and digital strategy and will host a Delivery Summit for the global KFC business in China to share learnings and adopt best practices, as we convert this into a repeatable model for all markets and an incremental multi-billion dollar sales layer. Turning now to Pizza Hut, which represents about 20% of our operating profit with over 16,000 global restaurants, had flat first quarter system sales, as same-store sales declined 3% and net new units grew 2%. As you've heard from us before, we have two distinct businesses with Pizza Hut, International and the U.S. Our International business grew system sales by 6%, as same-store sales grew 1% and net new units grew 6% in the first quarter. Implementation of our repeatable model for value, which originated in Thailand, is now seeing some success in additional markets, including Malaysia and Singapore, with positive early results in the Philippines. Broadly speaking, we are rolling out distinctive and disruptive value, coupled with the best-tasting food and consistent operations to sustainably and profitably grow top-line sales across all our markets. On the development front, we saw an acceleration of opens versus prior year, driven by a Development Agreement and a large number of conversions of Eagle Boys locations in Australia by our new franchise partner. Our U.S. results, which currently represent approximately 10% of our operating profit, were disappointing. We were lapping a plus 5% from last year's $5 Flavor Menu, which made for a tough compare. But prior laps are never an excuse, and the continuation of the soft results are clearly a priority we are addressing with urgency. As such, I'm very pleased to announce that in the past few days we secured an agreement with our franchisees to accelerate a bold transformation of the Pizza Hut U.S. business. This agreement will improve brand marketing alignment, accelerate enhancements to operations and technology, and include a permanent commitment to incremental advertising. This is a win-win agreement that importantly includes explicit alignment on aggressive investment in a digital delivery-centric strategy, and in short, will make it easier for our customers to get a better pizza. David is going to go into more detail about this significant milestone for the brand in a few minutes, but I would like to point out that this is another great example of the power of Yum!. We were able to leverage important learnings from the transformation work at KFC U.S. over the past few years to enable the system to make critical step-chain investments and to reset the business. It is working at KFC, and we believe this breakthrough can unlock renewed growth at Pizza Hut in the U.S. as well. I'd like to thank the Pizza Hut franchisees for supporting this bold vision for the brand, as well as the entire Pizza Hut U.S. team, led by Artie Starrs, for their monumental efforts that led to this agreement. As with all turnarounds, this is a journey that will happen hand-in-hand with our franchise partners, and it will not be complete in 2017, but I do believe you will see the results pay off in 2018 and beyond, so stay tuned. Finally, Taco Bell started the year with very impressive results and is well on pace for its sixth consecutive year of same-store sales growth. System sales grew 12%, as same-store sales grew 8% and net new units grew 3%. Same-store sales growth was driven by 5% transaction growth at Taco Bell, outpacing the industry by 7 points on sales and about 6 percentage points on transactions. 35 net new unit openings set a first quarter record and core operating profit grew 19%. These are remarkable results that showcase how a truly distinctive, relevant brand, world-class operations, consistent innovation, and a creative approach to value can resonate with customers. To this point, our three key products in the first quarter reflected these themes and were received with tremendous enthusiasm by the consumer. First, we launched the $1 Double Stacked Tacos, which provided us with early momentum in the quarter. We then sold over 25 million Naked Chicken Chalupas, which illustrates the enthusiasm for our crispy chicken offerings. And finally, we brought back the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which was even more successful than its initial launch in 2016. Our high-low value strategy is working, achieving both price, value, and abundant value. Going forward, you can expect to see continued focus on innovation and value with our $1.49 Loaded Taco Beef Burrito and more Naked products in the second quarter. On the Taco Bell International front, I am pleased with the momentum building globally and with both growing enthusiasm for the brand and improving economics. We continue unlocking the business model by driving cost out of the supply chain and building scale with new and existing franchisees. This year, we expect to open restaurants in five new countries as we expand the cult of Taco Bell. We continue to sign Development Agreements and now have commitments for nearly 400 new restaurants under these agreements, including 100 from Yum! China, where things are off to a very encouraging start. Interest has remained strong from high quality existing and potential new franchisees across the globe. So, in summary, we are accelerating our growth as we engage long-term partners aligned with our vision, values, and passion for Taco Bell. In conclusion, we're moving forward with clear intentionality towards building a growth-oriented organization which delivers more for our shareholders. I'm very pleased with the progress made to-date, and look forward to further updating you as we continue our transformation journey. And now, our President and CFO, David Gibbs. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover four areas in my following remarks : our first quarter operating results; our transformation commitments, specifically how we are driving growth through our focus on unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development; our Pizza Hut U.S. Transformation Agreement; and our outlook for 2017. We are pleased with our first quarter results, where core operating profit increased 9%. These results were led by particular strength at Taco Bell, with better than expected sales and margins and solid double-digit core operating profit growth in our KFC Division. First quarter results were a strong testament to the diversity and resiliency of the Yum! Portfolio, as core operating profits grew in line with our long-term target, despite headwinds in Pizza Hut U.S. sales. EPS, before special items, grew 17%, including a 1 point negative impact from foreign currency. EPS benefited from a low tax rate associated with the new standard for equity compensation accounting, which we adopted in the first quarter. Please note that the first quarter tax rate includes an oversized impact related specifically to payouts to recently-retired employees. The new accounting standard will make it harder to predict our tax rate, given the uncertainty around timing of equity compensation payouts; however, we do expect our full year ex-special tax rate to be closer to our rate of recent years. We are on track to achieve our 2019 targets of : reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales; increasing free cash flow conversion to 100%; and increasing our franchise mix to at least 98%. The more predictable factors helping us to reach our targets, refranchising efforts, net units, G&A reductions, and share buybacks, are all well underway and our early success is encouraging. In the first quarter of 2017, we refranchised 121 stores, including 31 KFCs, 36 Pizza Huts, and 54 Taco Bells, bringing our global franchise mix to 94%. Simply put, refranchising these stores allows us to meet three of our stated goals : decreasing our ownership mix; reducing field-level G&A and returning cash to shareholders. While we won't provide interim targets as we work towards reaching our new franchise mix of at least 98%, I do want to share that there has been robust demand for all three brands in the U.S. and abroad. Next, I'd like to briefly touch on how we are executing against two of our four growth drivers : bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. First, as we have discussed in the past, we are aggressively leveraging our renewed focus on bold restaurant development by attaching Development Agreements to our refranchising deals. Since we own the market-mapping capability for each brand and geography, we know how many stores to include in our agreements. Deals in the first quarter included meaningful Development Agreements, creating a strong pipeline of net new unit development. And with healthy demand from existing and new franchisees for our brands around the world, we expect this pipeline to grow. This quarter was a good example of how our transformation mindset can benefit results. We opened 141 net new units in the first quarter, which is typically the seasonally-weakest quarter of the year. Actually, 141 net new opens is 113 higher than first quarter 2016 and each of our three brands saw improvement. KFC contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year improvement, owing to strong brand momentum and economics. Pizza Hut's master franchise partner in Australia converted Eagle Boys to Pizza Huts, and Taco Bell set a record for first quarter openings. Second, even as we're reducing our company-operated store holdings, I want to be clear that operations excellence is as important, if not more important, than ever. And this is a large part of what our unmatched franchise operating capability growth driver refers to. I'd like to highlight some of the significant operational achievements we've made across the portfolio as examples of our commitment to this strategic priority. At Taco Bell, customer satisfaction hit an all-time high during the Naked Chicken Chalupa launch and continues to hold strong. Pizza Hut International's overall satisfaction scores in the first quarter increased 6 percentage points versus the prior year. This was highlighted by a 10 percentage point increase in Korea, with significantly improving speed and taste scores. The global KFC business achieved a 7% improvement in taste satisfaction over the past 12 months, while 14% fewer guests experienced a problem in 2016 than 2015. Now, I'd like to update you on our capital structure and share buybacks. As you may have seen, we successfully repriced our $2 billion term loan B in March. This reduced the associated interest rate by 75 basis points, which, after amortization of related fees and expenses, will reduce our ongoing reported annualized interest expense by about $12 million. For 2017, the net interest savings will be approximately $3 million, due to the partial year benefit of the lower rate and incremental fees and debt issuance costs, $6 million of which we recognized in the first quarter. We remain committed to maintaining approximately 5 times leverage as market conditions permit, and we are always working to optimize the capital structure, as evidenced here. As for share buybacks, we repurchased 6.8 million shares for $442 million or, on average, about $65 per share in the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we had just under $1.5 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. As we laid out at our analyst meeting, our plan is to return between $6.5 billion and $7 billion to shareholders across 2017 through 2019. Through a combination of free cash flow generation, maintaining our leverage, and cash from refranchising, we will continue to return capital to shareholders to deliver on our commitment. Before we discuss the outlook, I'd like to provide some financial highlights of the agreement we reached with our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees. Yum! will invest approximately $130 million to upgrade restaurant equipment to improve operations, accelerate improvements in restaurant technology, enhance digital and eCommerce capabilities, and boost advertising dollars. Further, the Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees overwhelmingly voted in support of this agreement. And while we aren't going to get into specifics for competitive reasons, the agreement includes a permanent system commitment to incremental advertising and digital initiative contributions, alignment on marketing strategy, and much more. From a timing perspective, we expect to invest nearly all of the $130 million split between 2017 and 2018. Similar to our KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement, due to the unique long-term brand-building nature of these investments, certain of these investments will be classified as special items. Of the expenses that will be treated as ex-special and recognized through our income statement, the only significant item we want to highlight relates to media spend, which we estimate will be approximately $25 million in 2017 and $12.5 million in 2018. Although this is a relatively modest investment in the scheme of Yum!, it is obviously quite significant to Pizza Hut U.S. and we are confident it will unlock significant value in years to come. Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 outlook, which, as Greg mentioned, is unchanged. Please note this is off of our quarterly 2016 income statement filed April 13, which adjusts for the China spin-off, our quarterly calendar change, and the change to pension expense classification which we adopted this quarter. To be clear, the ex-special operating profit base for 2016 is $1.647 billion. We forecast 2017 core operating profit should grow mid-single digits off this base, as the 53rd week lap and timing mismatches on refranchising and G&A savings impact what we believe will be a high single-digit-base underlying growth rate. And to be clear, the incremental cost associated with the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement will not alter our full-year guidance, given our strong start to the year. So, to wrap things up, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we continue to make on implementing our strategic transformation. First quarter operating profit growth was a strong and encouraging start to the year, reinforcing our confidence in the strength of our business model. We are taking the right steps to optimize shareholder value, and our disciplined decisions will set us up for strength in the near and long term. And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Hi, John. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, can you hear me okay? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Hi, John, how are you? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Good morning. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good. I'm fine, thank you. First, can you just comment, David and Greg, you commented about your new Development Agreements with franchisees and that's key as you refranchise and accelerate growth. If you think about your refranchising goals over the next couple of years, how much incremental development, if you were to successfully attach those agreements to all of them, how much of that would incrementally expand unit growth versus the 3% we saw this quarter? Would it get you to 5%, for example, or is that just part of the solution to getting to that 7% system goal and some component of that's unit growth? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think, as you described, John, it's really a big part of the solution to getting to incremental development. As we've talked about before, we're not going to throw out new targets for development, but the Development Agreements that we're signing from refranchising this time around with our refranchising are really quite incremental versus the previous efforts of refranchising, where we didn't undertake these kinds of Development Agreements. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then as a follow-up, just on the Pizza Hut agreement, can you, first of all, just make clear what it is going toward? For example, are you funding some asset relocations in the United States? How much of that is a component versus the technology investment? If you could maybe provide a little clarity. I just want to make sure I understand. This is going to be reflected all in CapEx in 2017 and 2018 or some of it comes through the P&L or if there is a breakdown, can you break that down? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, look, I'm going to let David give you some more details. Let me just give you the context of why we've made this decision on Pizza Hut and why we have signed up for the Acceleration Agreement, because I think having this context is important for everybody. If I step back two or three years, I think we've made a number of, what I call, focused bold decisions. Early 2015, along with the KFC franchisees, we reached the Acceleration Agreement in which we said we would invest $180 million through 2018. I think that's demonstrated clearly to be a wise investment. We've had 11 quarters of consecutive same-store sales growth, margins have doubled. We then separated China, as we all know. We've created these two powerful independent-focused growth companies, I think another wise decision. Around the transformation of Yum! we've set these four growth drivers, we believe, will obviously enhance our growth going forward. And now, we're focusing on another bold action, which is the Transformation Agreement with the Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees. As David said, it's a $130 million investment. From a Yum! point of view, it's modest. For a Pizza Hut point of view, yes, it's significant. And, well, I'll let David explain the details, I'm very confident that, like the other three bold actions, it will unlock significant value and long-term growth for years to come. It's the right thing to do for the Pizza Hut brand. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, and on the financial side, as I mentioned, we're doing a little bit of priming the pump on the incremental media. And we'll be investing $25 million in incremental media from Yum! in 2017 and then another $12.5 million in 2018. There's an ongoing permanent commitment to incremental media from the franchisees that goes on after that. So, every other part of the investment would really be, at this point, classified as special. So, I think for your modeling purposes, you'll see that $25 million and $12 million (sic) [$12.5 million] (29:02) hit through our income statement. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. I have a follow-up on Pizza Hut. At Pizza Hut in the U.S., there's a big picture issue of kind of having these restaurants in the old format, which sounds like part of this plan is to fix some of that. But what are the near-term fixes or solutions that you can address to get in place so that you can revert the comps back to a more positive state over the course of this year? I know we're kind of looking for a home run solution over time, but what are the, I guess, singles and doubles that you can hit over the course of 2017? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, I think what we've got to do is make sure the brand has what I call a delivery digital-centric focus. Obviously, there will continue to be active upgrades. It was interesting. Dave and I were out and touring a number of markets the last couple of weeks looking at the Zinger, looking at some asset actions that we've taken at Pizza Hut, and it was very clear. We were in one place and we've shut down an old Red Roof about half a mile down the road from what is now a fast-casual Delco end cap and I think sales \u2013 I may be wrong, have gone something like $14,000 to $29,000, or something like that. So, I think the assets will change. I think making sure that when we advertise a price point, we've got that consistently on air across the country, having the franchisees align behind that. In the past, we've not had necessarily great commitment, so I think part of it is making sure that when we play a value play, that every customer across the whole country gets the benefit of that. I think those are just some of the advantages that you'll see. We don't want to get into too much of the messaging that's going to occur, because obviously, this is a very cutthroat and competitive category. And I really don't want to get into the messages we're going to put out there. I just want to say that I feel very good about the messages we've got coming. I think they will resonate with customers. They will reinforce a delivery, sort of digital-centric nature, and the customers will see it as a more consistent expression across the country. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: On the asset front, you asked about the assets. We have, as we've mentioned it before, we've started ramping up the pace of remodeling over a year ago as part of another agreement with our franchisees. That agreement will be modified but continue over the next several years and you'll continue to see us accelerate the pace of fixing our stores. There will be incentives for what Greg was referring to, which is the fast-casual delco model, which we're quite excited about, given the sales bump we get from that versus other asset actions. So, I think, as Greg said, there's a lot of competitive information here that we can't reveal, but there is a plan along every critical front in the battle in the pizza category, whether it be operations, technology, or assets or advertising. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis P. Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Greg, you've talked in the past about how an increased focus on sales can have a real notable impact on results as you complete the refranchising, as you don't have to focus on costs within the four walls as much. Granted, we're not quite there yet on the refranchising, but is the organization already preparing for that greater top-line focus? And how important of a factor do you think it was in what you saw at Taco Bell and KFC this quarter and in recent quarters? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, Dennis. As I said in my prepared remarks, in March, we had a Global Leadership Summit. We took the top 200 leaders from around the world. And I think to keep it simple, we discussed the sort of the what and the why. So, we were very clear about the what, which is we're going to be more focused, more franchised, more efficient, and that we were going to accelerate growth by thinking differently, acting differently, and leading differently. David also gave a great example of why we need to do that from a financial point of view. And I came away incredibly excited that the top 200 leaders in the organization are rallying around the fact that we can get more growth out of this business. And so, it was great to obviously see the Taco Bell numbers are simply stunning. I mean, 8% same-store sales growth, 5% coming from transactions. Even the U.S. KFC business, which was up 2%, but it was 2% transaction growth. And I like sales that come predominantly from transaction growth rather than from pricing. And so, I'm very encouraged by the early start. We have a long way to go, but I do believe that we can consistently grow system sales through a combination of focus around same-store sales and focus around net new units. Dennis P. Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys, had two questions on Taco Bell. The comps are, obviously, stellar this quarter, but wanted to ask about the 80 bps of restaurant margin expansion. It just didn't seem to fully reflect the strong comps. And I know you guys did some value promotions, which were more margin-dilutive, but I would have figured that would have been offset by some of the premium innovation you did around Naked Chicken and the Triple Double. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, there was some cost of sales and labor inflation in the numbers, but offset by better sales. So, I think the good news is we did get margin expansion. Last year, cost of sales at Taco Bell ran negative. They'll probably run slightly positive, around 2%, this year. Now that's coming off, I think, minus about mid-single digits last year. So, there was some inflation in labor. There was some inflation in cost of sales, but the good news was more than offset by the strength in the top-line. And, as I said, continuing to bring innovation to the marketplace, continue to be strong on value, as David said, improving operations. Again, we have been out visiting restaurants and the Taco Bells we visited, I think, were all A's. I mean, we just saw great execution. These were blind visits. No one was expecting us. Mike Grams is doing a great job improving the operating performance there, as well. So, it's world-class advertising, breakthrough innovation, great value, great operations, all of that offsetting what was some underlying labor and cost of goods inflation in the quarter. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: And my follow-up question was just on the fluidity of the marketing calendar. Obviously, you guys have done a nice job of balancing premium, like Naked Chicken with some value offers. Should we expect that to continue or do you remain fluid, just given the operating environment that you can lean more into one factor or the other, depending on the environment and competitive actions? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I mean, the great thing is Taco Bell's got a calendar for the next couple of years, so as things happen in the marketplace \u2013 I mean, let's not kid ourselves. You'll see more \"naked\" products. We'd be crazy not to. But you'll always see Taco Bell doing price value. You'll see them doing breakfast. We've got good transaction growth out of breakfast again. Two year comps, I think, were like 12% on transaction growth at breakfast. So, they're doing everything right. And they have a pipeline that if anything happened, they could react to flexibly, but right now, they're executing their strategy and they're doing an incredible job executing it really well. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, thanks. I think you guys put up 9% core EBIT growth in the quarter and you're guiding \u2013 I think the equivalent for the year is mid-single digits on that number. I know you're lapping the 53rd week in 4Q, but is there any other reason why the business will slow a bit from here? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, one of the other headwinds that we've highlighted is just the timing mismatch between when we're cutting G&A and getting savings versus the loss of operating profit from refranchising. I think on the last call, I highlighted that that worked in our favor last year. This quarter, those two things were about neutral. So, you see us performing at about our base underlying rate, since we don't have a 53rd week this quarter and we don't have that issue. But, as the year progresses, that will be the headwind that we described entering the year. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, got it. And then, just a follow-up on Pizza Hut, I guess looking at the comp trends there, obviously quite a bit different from the two big competitors in the U.S. As you guys dig into those comps and look at your dine-in business versus the kind of core delivery business, is that at least a lot closer to where competitors are, just on the delivery side or are you really sort of similar on both sides of the business, because I know that dine-in has been a big overhang on that story? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, we don't want to get into the specifics, but our delivery performance is better than our dine-in performance, obviously, but I think the key thing is we have a long way to go. There's a lot of difference between where we are and where we need to be. And I'm really excited that this Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement will help us get there. It was the catalyst for change at KFC. I mean, if I step back \u2013 and I think most of you, when I took over this job, thought we'd take the under on a KFC U.S. turnaround. Hopefully, we've proven that we turned that around. And I'm equally confident that with this Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement in place, we can do the same thing for Pizza Hut as we've done for KFC. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, great. I'd like to stay on Pizza Hut, if I may. I think you ended 2016 with around 7,600 units. And that's versus Domino's at around 5,400 or so. So just in terms of looking at the number of units that you have, what should it be, I mean, if you were to kind of redraw the entire map of the United States and you wanted to have delivery and carry-out focused assets and maximize return at those assets, as part of the Pizza Hut restructuring or significant reduction in that unit count to get to kind of redraw the United States as it stands today? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, John, this is David. Just one point on the unit count for clarity; some of the 7,600 units that we have are licensed units versus the 5,400 that Domino's owns. (39:34) John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Yes, and that's probably not totally fair of me to include that, but I don't have that number in front of me. What is that? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Our traditional unit count is more in the 6,300 to 6,400 unit range, but your question about the future asset base of the brand is a good one. I think as we pointed out in last investor discussions, new unit development for Pizza Hut still generates good returns. It's one of our better returning programs that we have because of the small box cost. We're excited about some of the new vehicles we've developed with the fast-casual Delco. And we certainly don't think that Pizza Hut should be shrinking in the United States. We think it can get back to being a growth concept. And we've market mapped out further opportunities to grow our brand in the United States. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, very interesting. And by not shrinking, could there just be the replacement of one legacy Red Roof that's closed, but just replaced by a Delco nearby? I mean, is that part of the overall strategy, if you don't want to actually lose some presentation in the market? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. I think that the big part of the strategy is relocating out of many of those Red Roofs, which not only are the assets not in great shape, but oftentimes, they're in the wrong part of the trade area. Greg referenced that on our trip a couple of weeks ago, we visited one of these stores where the trade area had clearly moved away from our Red Roof, where we were doing half the volume that we eventually ended up doing just by moving a half mile down the road to where more of the activity is. Now, it's not to say that there also won't, over the short-term, be a little bit of churn in the asset base. And you'll see some closures and some openings, so I can't predict the timing of the net new units, probably, over the next year or so. But I can say that the Pizza Hut team and we feel confident that there's growth opportunities for the Pizza Hut brand in the U.S., both in growing the top-line of our existing units, relocating them to more powerful assets, and penetrating new trade areas. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think there's areas where we're not very well penetrated. The Northeast is not a highly-penetrated Pizza Hut market. I think talking to new franchisees signing development agreements in those parts of the country, I think will be a positive to the brand. And as the brand builds its top-line momentum, which we believe we will deliver, I think that will only make people even more encouraged. The good thing is we're not short of people who want to sign on to be Pizza Hut franchisees. The good news is that we've got new franchisees who believe in the story that we're selling, who know more of the details that we can't share, are signing up. And I think that's encouraging and an encouraging sign for us, as well. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And, if I may, you quantified your investment over 2017 and 2018 for the Pizza Hut brand in the U.S., the $130 million. Could you put some context around what the incremental investment is from the franchise community? Is it a similar number? Is it many multiples of that number? Just so we get a sense of how much money is being put across the entire brand, not just from your wallet in 2017 and 2018. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, we're not going to share specifics on that, but what I can say is they'll be investing in incremental media. They'll be investing along with us in incremental technology investments. So, this is not as if it's a one-sided investment. That's why we're all, obviously, so excited about the agreement. We all know that the partnership between the brand and the franchisees has to be right to get a business to grow. That's what we have at KFC U.S. And I think this is good evidence that the Pizza Hut franchisees and the Pizza Hut brand leadership are working in concert to bring the brand forward. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Yet another Pizza Hut question for the day, just looking at the reported company store margins, are those reflective of what the system as a whole is seeing or would there be a reason that there is a mix difference between your owned units and franchisees? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think given that Pizza Hut has light company ownership, the margins can be a little misleading. The margins in the U.S. are actually better than the margins shown there. So, the margins are somewhat pulled down by international markets with new equity stores and preopening expenses and things like that. And obviously, off of a very light number, I wouldn't read too much in it. Obviously, margins are down in the U.S. business because of the decline in sales, that's certain. But, yeah, I think the overall Pizza Hut business still has, for our franchise partners and for us, has solid margins, which we certainly believe we can grow. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then on the development side of things, when you're working with franchisees on attaching new unit development to refranchising and what not, what sort of return hurdles do you think they're looking for in the U.S. to be incentivized to build? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think it really varies by franchisee in concept, but certainly the development trade areas that we've identified as part of these agreements are ones that we think meet the hurdle requirements. And for our brands, that probably ranges from cash paybacks from three to eight years, something like that. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, good morning, guys. Are you guys still confident in your journey to achieve the $3.75 of EPS by 2019? I didn't hear that in your prepared remarks. And if you are, do you still think you need an average of 5% system-wide sales growth to get there, or does it need to be more towards the 7% that you're targeting? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think we are confident in our journey towards $3.75 that you mentioned. And I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that all of our transformation initiatives are on track, with encouraging results. We've never actually thrown out a specific sales number that underlies the $3.75, other than saying that it's more like our historical rate of growth. So, I think we're excited by some of the things we're seeing at Taco Bell and the Transformation Agreement and the ability over the next few years for our sales to accelerate for all of the reasons we've talked about. But as I often point out, a lot of the stuff in getting to the $3.75 is completely under our control, share buybacks, refranchisings... Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: G&A. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: G&A cuts. All of those initiatives we feel really good about. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And Taco Bell doesn't seem to be getting too much attention today. I mean, 8% comps. When you look at that quarter, how much of that 5% traffic do you think was driven by kind of hot LTO's or how much do you think was more kind of sustained demand growth that the Taco Bell brand is swallowing? If you can maybe just give a little more color on that. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: They just had a great quarter. January was good. February was good. March was good. This wasn't like Naked Chicken sort of saved the quarter, and what you could save plus-8%. It was a strong across the board. We have high-low going with the $1 Double Stacked Tacos, and then the Triple Double Crunchwrap. You've got innovation in Naked Chicken Chalupa, improving operations, I think world-class marketing. I do believe that the team had turned this into a cult brand. And it's not hard to turn a $10 billion mass brand into a cult brand, but I believe they've done it. So, they had just a incredibly strong quarter, every day, every week, every month. And that's what gives us encouragement that they're doing everything right to continue to grow this business for the long long-term. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: And just the last question I have is the KFC turnaround, from the outside looking in, it felt like the advertising changes did a lot to kind of pump up the brand a lot more than it was prior. Do you have the same advertising agencies that work on the KFC brand that work on the Pizza Hut brand? Are those kind of crossed or do you have separate advertising agencies? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: No, each of the brands has a separate agency. I do agree with you that I think the Colonel campaign was a core part of why we've had a lot of success in the U.S., but, at the same time, product availability, improving operations, there's a lot of things that go into place. Definitely the Colonel campaign has worked, but to answer your question specifically, each agency in the U.S. uses a different agency. Each brand uses a different agency. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. On your efforts to accelerate system unit growth, can you provide more color on the international markets where you've seen that early traction, as well as some of the strategies that are driving that developmental acceleration? Again, just trying to get a better understanding of some of the early successes you've had and the drivers of that early success. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Jeff, was this regarding Pizza Hut? I just missed the first part of your question. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Really, across all brands, it's development in terms of just accelerating development internationally, where you've gained traction, and it doesn't have to be about Pizza Hut. I'd love it if it was Pizza Hut, but across either Pizza Hut or KFC. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think we're seeing, across the board, good net new unit growth on both KFC and on Pizza Hut. On the Pizza Hut side, we measure 13 distinct markets. I think 6 are developing and 7 have developed. And of those, 12 of the 13 had system sales growth in the quarter, the only exception being the U.S. So, I do believe we're seeing strong net new unit growth. Internationally, we delivered 6% net new unit growth in the quarter, which was a strong number, and I think KFC also delivered 4% net new unit growth. So, it's quite strong. I think, as David said, what we love is we're keeping control of the asset-mapping process. We're not giving that to the franchisees. So we're out there, we have mapped the world. We know where there's opportunities. And I think, as David said, we know that net new units is something we can control as towards our growth targets. And because the business is much more focused, as I said earlier, we're focused on four things, distinct relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold asset development, and culture and talent. And I think because the organization is more focused, you are seeing us make progress on a broader scale than we had probably in the past. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Let me just ask it one more way, so any new strategies or learnings coming out of that global leadership conference in terms of how to accelerate development with your partners? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Look, yeah, I think a big part of this is changing our mindset on development and really starting to think about every market, emerging and developed, as a great opportunity for us, because we've seen even in developed markets that our brands can get to much greater penetration. I mean, I mentioned in my prepared remarks on Pizza Hut, our master franchisee down in Australia just took, I think, close to 50 Eagle Boys restaurants and converted them to Pizza Huts. That's great growth in the developed market. At the same time, the Pizza Hut team is out striking a deal in Ethiopia to expand into a new country. So, you're seeing that across the board. And the Global Leadership Summit that Greg talked about was a great opportunity to really galvanize the team on this deal-making and growth mindset. And you should continue to see things like Eagle Boys and Ethiopia and new market entry and new deals come across the wire as we start to ramp up the pace of development. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I mean, we have more Development Agreements for Taco Bell internationally than we have Taco Bells on the ground internationally. We've never been in that situation. We don't have 400 Taco Bells on the ground, but we have 400 Development Agreements, 100 with China. So, I'm with David. I think it's about being focused. We are really focused on distinct relevant brands. Why? Because that drives same-store sales. Unmatched franchise operating capability. Why? That drives same-store sales. Bold asset development. Why? Because that drives net new units. Focusing on those three things will drive system sales. And I think everyone came away from the global summit \u2013 the word is focused. That's what I'm going to stick with, and I honestly believe that this focus is going to pay off for us, for our shareholders, for our franchisees, and employees. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Helpful. Thank you. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I have two questions, one on KFC and then a follow-up on Pizza Hut. So on KFC, I know you had strong transaction growth in the U.S. and ahead of the industry, but globally, if I look at your comps of 2%, they were perhaps a little lower than what maybe your large QSR competitor is doing. So just trying to understand whether that should accelerate; you mentioned delivery, if that's the real driver going forward or if there are other places where maybe you can get to something closer to like a 3% comp, which I think would be kind of at the high end of your 2% to 3% for this year expectation. And then I wanted to ask about Pizza Hut and value. And, in particular, you mentioned messaging better around price point. And I'm trying to understand if that's what you did last year so successfully. So, you're lapping the 5% comp last year with the $5 Cravings menu. Is that what drove it? And if so, isn't that a lever that you can pull pretty quickly while you're undertaking all these longer-term digital initiatives? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure, okay, so to take the KFC one first. I think, as I said in the call, in places like Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, we had more than 6% same-store sales growth. Now, as we said, it was offset by businesses in France and the Middle East. I can assure you my discussions with Roger Eaton are all about how do we use repeatable model to drive underlying same-store sales growth. We talked about the delivery summit that we're going to hold in China. That was really a collaboration between Roger and Micky about Roger saying he does believe that there is more growth upside from delivery. We've got a test going in the UK right now on delivery where in, I think, about 89 stores are testing delivery, are seeing some early positive results to that test. So, I think using the repeatable model, leveraging the power of Yum! by, in this case, taking a delivery summit with the China team and then leveraging off what some of the strong markets, consistently strong markets, I mean, Russia, Australia, Central and Eastern Europe, they've consistently delivered way above 3% same-store sales growth. So, taking those learnings, converting into repeatable models; I can assure you Roger is very focused on all of those things. So, I feel good that we can take that number from 2%-plus you said closer to 3%, which would be a nice thing. On the Pizza Hut side, yeah, I think the value discussion was less about the value price point. It was about everyone sort of, I guess, living up to the value price point in the marketplace. And we've had some price points on television that not everybody when the customer goes to order online has been able to take the benefit. And part of what this agreement is about is getting ourselves aligned that everyone honors the price point that's on television or on digital or social. So, that will be a change. I don't want to get again into the actual details of the specifics, but I do like the fact that we'll have more of the system aligned behind what the message is that we're delivering in any particular time. Hopefully, that will happen in the short-term, but, as we said, we've got a lot to do on Pizza Hut. This agreement is really just a catalyst to get it all going. And, as we said, we'll hopefully see improvements later this year and obviously into next year. So, a lot of work to do, but I think we're doing all of the right things and the KFC agreement is the reason to believe. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Operator, given that we're closing in on the hour, we'll take one more question, please. Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Just a handful of clarification questions on the guidance for this year, so, David, I guess, first, what are you thinking, as you sit here today, about the FX impact on the year? Just so we can get an idea of what the reported operating income might look like, including the FX headwind. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, going into the year, I think our expectations was around $25 million or so. First quarter came in a little bit lighter than that run rate, and forward rates would indicate something along those lines. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Around the $25 million or lighter than the $25 million? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, like I said, we were a little bit lighter in the first quarter, but I don't think we're that precise on predicting FX, but $25 million is probably a good number to use. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, I don't think you confirmed your comps guidance for the year, but can you please confirm that it is still 2% to 3% is what you're thinking globally? And then, if that's the case, I guess, how are you thinking about the composition of that across the segments? Are you thinking \u2013 you obviously delivered that in the first quarter, but with a wide range of outcomes, with Taco Bell very strong and Pizza Hut weak. Is that kind of how we should expect to see it for the rest of the year or how are you thinking that will play out? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: There are not going to be any change to our guidance for the year, as far as individual brands and breaking it down. We're not going to provide that level of detail, but certainly you can see from the results from the first quarter and extrapolate from there. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess maybe I'll ask it differently then. I guess how would you characterize the degree of difficulty in hitting that 2% comp guidance if Taco Bell comes back to earth, so to speak? Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: David, this is Keith. I think the point here is we continue to be comfortable, at this point in the year, with a full-year global same-store sales growth rate at the 2% to 3%. You can see there's different ways we can get there. This quarter was a good example. And we remain comfortable with that range of guidance for the full year. at this time. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, David. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay, so I want to thank everyone for being on the call. As I said, I think we've had a strong start to the year. And I'm going to leave you all with my bet for the 143rd running of the Kentucky Derby. It's Irish War Cry. So, if you back it and win, I'm a genius. If you back it and lose, I don't want to hear about it. Thanks for being on the call. A solid start to the year; we believe we're going to have a good year. We're very excited about the Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement. And I think if we can continue to have the Taco Bell brand perform, the KFC brand perform and then we see the upside of the Pizza Hut Acceleration Agreement, I think the long term looks bright. I'm still very encouraged that the transformation of Yum! is well underway, and we will deliver on everything that we've promised. So, thanks for being on the call, appreciate it. Speak to you all soon. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased our momentum continued through yet another quarter, driven by our continued focus on our four key growth drivers. For the second quarter Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 19% and EPS excluding Special Items of $0.68, representing 21% growth over prior year. System sales grew 6% comprised of 2% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit development. The underlying base rate of growth in our business both in terms of sales trends and profit contribution continues to track in line with our plans and longer term goals. As such, we are maintaining our 2017 full-year guidance. Before I review our key growth drivers, I want to note that our core operating profit growth for the second quarter in our KFC Division benefited from several items outside of our normal run rate, which David will discuss in more detail next. Now to our four key growth drivers, which are at the forefront of every decision at Yum! I will talk to you about unrivaled culture and talent and our distinctive relevant brand. Then David will discuss unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development. First, unrivaled culture and talent, Yum!'s greatest asset for driving results. This year, I'm continuing my commitment to championing our culture and talent not only with our own employees but also throughout the franchise system. I strongly believe that leading and investing in our culture is the best way to fuel better business result and I'm excited to see our franchisees embracing these ideas and learning to grow our iconic brand. I can tell you that our people and our franchisees are energized, our transformation agenda is taking hold, and our culture is stronger than ever. Next, let's talk about how this culture is fueling results in our three distinctive relevant brands, starting with KFC, which is truly a global powerhouse. The brand continues to be Yum!'s most consistent, largest and fastest growing concept with a presence across 129 countries, providing the scale and diversification for a powerful business model. Representing approximately 50% of Yum!'s operating profit, KFC has nearly 21,000 units across the globe. During the second quarter, system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new development of 4%. We are proud to highlight that in 18 of our 20 KFC business units across both emerging and developed countries, KFC reported positive same-store system sales this quarter. In the U.S. the second quarter represented KFC's 12th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at a healthy 2%, or 4% on a two-year stack. The $5 Individual Fill Up and $20 Family Fill Up are at price points that resonate with the consumers and leverage the core menu of finger lickin' good chicken and sides. The team has truly embraced the idea of moving from food as fuel to food as an experience. Just look at the Colonel drive-thru robot, the online retail store and the proof that KFC is literally out of this world. Who else has sent a sandwich into space? As further proof KFC is back atop the cultural conversation, the online retail store, KFC Ltd., was mentioned in media spanning from the Huffington Post to Golf Digest. At the end of launch day, 18 of 29 products had sold out. The standout item was a $20,000 400-year-old meteorite in the shape of a Zinger chicken sandwich, selling within 24 hours with several other interested buyers as the sale was pending. These are truly remarkable events and something no one would have believed possible three years ago. Our KFC international markets, representing nearly 90% of KFC's profits, also performed well, in particular, our Turkey and Australia markets. In fact, our Australia market delivered 7% same-store sales growth, driven by the launch of frozen beverages and a strong value, such as the $2.50 chips and gravy and 24 nuggets for $10. Our Turkey market delivered same-store sales growth of 23%, driven by balancing the promotional mix between high-end bucket promotions and low-end offerings along with LTOs, which attracted new customers and grew transaction. The market is also seeing growth in their delivery business, which grew nearly 35% over the prior year and now represents approximately 30% of sales. Delivery remains a key growth driver for KFC with $1 billion of sales for the brand as of today and the opportunity to significantly increase this, as additional units and markets begin to offer delivery. Our largest franchisee, Yum China, acquired a majority stake in an online aggregator platform complementing their already robust delivery business and is an example of one of our markets with a longstanding history of delivery. In addition, we have new markets testing with both online aggregators and in-house delivery all over the world. In fact, across the entire Yum! system nearly 20,000 of our restaurants offer delivery which is almost half of our total restaurant. Delivery offers consumers a new occasion at typically higher check averages and by leveraging the power of Yum! to create repeatable models amongst the markets, this makes delivery a platform with huge growth potential. Next, to Pizza Hut, which as we have discussed is a tale of two businesses. First, the U.S. business, which represents approximately 10% of Yum!'s operating profit signed the Transformation Agreement in May, demonstrating unity amongst the system and our commitment to a digital delivery centric model. As a reminder, in return for additional media spend and funding from Yum!'s, the franchisees have committed to honor all-advertised national price points through 2019 and to permanently increase their ongoing contribution to national advertising and digital fees. An additional benefit of the increased advertising is that the funds will be used towards national advertising, allowing the brand to increase its share of voice as it works to build awareness of its efforts around digital and delivery. The brand remains on track to effectively be on one point-of-sale system by the end of the year which will allow Pizza Hut to drive efficiency in its ability to improve its operations around delivery and speed-to-market on digital implementation. As an example, this week, Pizza Hut announced the launch of their first ever U.S. loyalty program, Hut Rewards. This program is the only national pizza loyalty program that rewards online guests with points for every dollar spent on food. And as further proof that the brand is working to elevate their delivery-centric strategy, they recently announced the hiring of 14,000 drivers by year-end 2017. While we do not expect the Transformation Agreement to yield results overnight, we do expect to see improvement over time. In summary, I'm confident these bold steps will pay big dividends for the Pizza Hut brand over the long-term. Internationally, Pizza Hut system sales increased 7% with 1% same-store sales growth and 5% net new development. We recently met with 10 of our top global Pizza Hut franchise organizations at our Partner's Council to gain delivery and digital-centric alignment to accelerate growth for the business. This group of influential individuals represents some of our largest international markets and over one-third of our total net new units currently committed under development agreements over the next three years. I am encouraged by the excitement these growth-minded leaders have for Pizza Hut, carrying an enthusiasm for the brand we haven't seen in a long time. In addition to this, our UK business recently rolled out Pizza Hut Digital Ventures, an in-house model for digital technology that allows for consumer-led and fast-paced decisions. Through continued testing and real-time iterating, Pizza Hut Digital Ventures is transforming the Pizza Hut UK website into an easier, faster and better experience for our customers. Thanks to this agile capability and the improved site functionality, we are seeing increased conversion rates, which drive digital sales growth. Finally, the repeatable model for value and taste we have previously discussed is lapping its successful rollout and the sales turnaround we saw in key countries like Malaysia and Korea continued in Q2. All in, the international team is hard at work and we are excited about these results and the long-term growth prospects for Pizza Hut. Finally, Taco Bell, which represents approximately 30% of Yum!'s operating profit, posted another strong quarter of same-store sales growth coming in at 4% with 1% of that coming from transaction growth. We remain confident in delivering another strong year of results by committing to the strategy, encompassing value and innovation with Mexican-inspired product such as the $1.49 Loaded Taco Burrito you saw this quarter. As I alluded to during the prior quarter, we introduced an additional Naked product with the Naked Chicken Chips, a creative twist allowing us to expand on our chicken platform. I know the Taco Bell team enjoyed meeting everyone and highlighting their growth story at the Analyst Day in May and I hope you appreciated hearing their story and got a good taste of their world-class products and innovation. As further evidence that Taco Bell continues to be a distinctive and relevant brand, news from Taco Bell saying, \"I do,\" to weddings at the Las Vegas store appeared in top tier national food and lifestyle outlets. Since the initial wedding announcement in February, coverage of this campaign has created 1.7 billion impressions for the brand. Our customers now have a new and unique way to show their love for each other and this iconic brand. Additionally, last week, Taco Bell announced a partnership with Lyft to launch Taco Mode. For the first time, Lyft has created an integration within their app that enables consumers to ride through a Taco Bell on the way to their final destination. The ride is designed to be as much an experience as the end benefit of capping a night with Taco Bell cravings. This partnership highlights the forward thinking at Taco Bell to provide access to our customers in new ways enabled by technology. Weddings and Taco Mode are just a few examples of the cultivation of the brand into consumers' lifestyles. Internationally, we also continue to accelerate our presence of Taco Bell. During the quarter, Taco Bell opened 15 international units in 7 countries. In particular, in our four key growth markets of Brazil, India, China and Canada, the team opened 6 units bringing our total unit count in those countries to 54. We are very excited to have opened our first standalone unit in Canada in nearly 20 years. This restaurant is hugely popular on social media with 98% positive sentiment and plans to start serving beer soon. In India, the team has defined a category of one positioning by offering a differentiated customer experience through elevated assets, table service and unique product offerings like hard shakes that have unlocked opportunities for accelerated expansion of this brand in this huge potential market. In summary, aligning Yum! by brands several years ago highlighted the potential for Taco Bell internationally. And as you can see, the team is working diligently to bring the cult of Taco Bell to everyone across the globe. In conclusion, Yum!'s three distinctive relevant brands delivered another successful quarter. We are on track to further unlock the potential of Yum! through our bold transformation initiatives and look forward to updating you on our journey. And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and CFO, David Gibbs. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results and full year outlook. I'll then provide an update on our transformation initiative and two of our key growth drivers : bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. I'll close with more detail on recent capital markets transaction. Yum! delivered another successful quarter with 19% core operating profit growth and 21% EPS growth excluding Special Items, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. As Greg mentioned, our core operating profit growth for the second quarter included the benefit of approximately $9 million within our KFC Division as a result of several items outside of our normal run rate. Some of these items include higher renewal and transfer fees as well as lower closure and impairment fees. We do not expect these items to recur in the future. As we expected, there will be noise on a quarterly basis as we continue to execute our transformation. This is why we continue to believe the best way to evaluate Yum! is to focus on 2019, our first clean year post-transformation and our target for $3.75 or more in EPS in 2019. I am pleased we remain on track with this target as well as our other aspects of our transformation strategy including our goals of at least 98% franchise ownership, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales and achieving run rate CapEx of $100 million in 2019. We are confident this transformation will allow Yum! Brands to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, ultimately delivering more growth to you, our shareholders. With respect to our guidance, the first half of the year saw a limited impact from net re-franchising dilution. However, for the full year, we now anticipate the net impact from re-franchising dilution to be towards the high end of the 1 percentage point to 2 percentage point range we previously discussed. Combined with the lap of 2016's 53rd week, these two items are the drivers of the difference between our underlying base operating profit growth trend of high-single digits and 2017 guidance of mid-single digit core operating profit growth. As Greg said, the underlying base rate of growth in our business both in terms of sales trends and profit contribution are tracking in line with our plans and longer-term goals. As such, we remain on track to deliver at least 5% system sales growth this year versus our 2016 system sales growth of 4% excluding the 53rd-week impact. The 2017 system sales growth guidance includes 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points of same-store sales growth and approximately 3% net new unit development. Specific to the fourth quarter, we would note that in aggregate, we anticipate the net impact of refranchising dilution and the impact from lapping the 53rd week to be approximately a 10 percentage point to 12 percentage point headwind before any underlying core operating profit growth. Regarding the Pizza Hut U.S. Transformation Agreement this quarter, Yum! incurred $12 million of costs primarily related to digital investments which were recorded as a Special Item. As a reminder, $37.5 million of incremental media spend related to the Transformation Agreement will be reflected in our core operating profit. $25 million of this will be expensed in the third and fourth quarters this year and has already been incorporated into our full-year guidance. The remaining $12.5 million is expected to be expensed in 2018. Next, our transformation initiatives, including reduced G&A, refranchising, capital returns, and increased leverage are all on target for completion. G&A excluding Special Items as a percent of system sales was 2.0% this quarter. And we remain comfortable with our target of 1.7% by 2019. With regards to refranchising, during the quarter we sold 244 units, including 40 KFCs, 163 Pizza Huts, and 41 Taco Bells, finishing the quarter at 94% franchised on our way to becoming at least 98% franchised by year-end 2018 with the majority of the refranchising expected to be completed in 2017. Gross refranchising proceeds totaled $136 million this quarter and $320 million year-to-date. As part of our refranchising commitment, we continue to expect $2 billion in post-tax proceeds. As I mentioned on our last call, we continue to aggressively leverage our renewed focus on bold restaurant development by attaching development agreements to our refranchising deals. This will enable us to elevate Yum!'s historical new unit development run rate to one that will help us achieve our goal of 7% system sales growth over the long term. To highlight our bold restaurant development, we opened 487 gross new units and 174 net new units this quarter for net new unit growth of 3%. I'm especially proud of our Taco Bell Brazil market, where they opened 15 Taco Bells in nine months. Demonstrating the flexibility of the asset types, one of the Brazil units is 38 square meters or about 400 square feet and is on track to generate average annual unit volume over $1 million. Entering new markets presents its own challenges. However, the Brazil market has embraced this challenge with success by thinking creatively about solutions to supply chain and unit economic obstacle. Frankly, this may be the most successful early entrance of a new brand into a new market that I've seen during my career here at Yum!, reflective of our new mindset to unlock growth. As another example of bold restaurant development, our KFC U.S. business continues to update their assets to the American Showman design imaged through their remodels and new restaurants. The remodel is affordable with an average sales increase of mid to high-single digits. And both the design and results to-date have been well received by our franchisees, customers and teams. To-date, KFC U.S. has over 500 American Showman restaurants, representing over 10% of their assets. And we are excited about the potential overall market impact. Unmatched franchise operating capability has always been of utmost importance. And I'm excited to see the progress we are making. For example, at Taco Bell an operational speed initiative improved drive-thru wait times by 10 seconds in the quarter. In addition, Pizza Hut UAE made significant improvement in their online overall satisfaction scores, which are now approximately 25 percentage points higher than the 2016 scores. This is driven by speed initiatives, promised time improvements and a restaurant engagement strategy focused on bettering the underperforming restaurant. We discussed Pizza Hut Korea on our last earnings call. And I'm pleased the market is continuing to see improvements in their overall satisfaction scores, driven by improving speed and taste scores. At the Pizza Hut Partners Council that Greg and I attended, one of the partners in attendance was our new franchisee in Japan, who is working with his management team and employees to implement growth strategies, improve the value of Pizza Hut and bring capital and a commitment to growing the brand. Additionally, we met the new Taco Bell franchisee in Brazil this quarter, who has opened the 15 restaurants in nine months, which I previously mentioned. This franchisee is an example of how to develop the brand in the right way, investing in people and world-class assets to bring the cult of Taco Bell to an entirely new population. In total, Taco Bell added 12 new franchisees over the last 12 months. Six of these are domestic with the brand strength in the U.S. allowing us to be highly selective when adding new franchisees, ensuring they have extensive operations experience, a deep understanding of their markets and the desire for meaningful development. We are also pleased to continue returning capital to our shareholders, including repurchasing 5.6 million shares this quarter at an average price of $68 for a total of $384 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for $105 million, bringing our total capital return to $489 million this quarter and over $1 billion year-to-date. As a reminder, we plan to return between $6.5 billion and $7 billion from 2017 to 2019. I'm also excited to share some good news regarding the financial markets' continued support of our business transformation and capital market strategy. First, in June we re-priced our term loan A and revolving credit facility, reducing the interest rate by 75 basis points to adjusted LIBOR of plus 1.5% and extending the maturity to 2022. This will reduce our annual cash interest by approximately $6 million with approximately a $1 million benefit in 2017, net of fees and other expenses. Second, consistent with our stated intention to maintain a targeted leverage ratio of about 5 times and in anticipation of a $325 million bond maturity due in March 2018, we executed a $750 million 10-year bond offering with a coupon rate of 4.75%. The deal was multiple times oversubscribed and was one of the lowest rates in high yield in any sector in the last four years. Our total debt outstanding is now $9.8 billion. Our current average interest rate is now 4.5%, and the average maturity is seven years. Additionally, approximately 90% of our total debt is at fixed rate. In conclusion, we have built upon our first quarter results with a successful second quarter. We are pleased to be on track with our 2017 guidance and our Strategic Transformation Initiative. Our four key growth drivers : distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent allow us to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient. In the end, this will deliver strong, steady growth and we look forward to updating you along the way. And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open. Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Lots of exciting developments at Pizza Hut, clearly, lots of good color there. But as far as key priorities go, maybe you could just talk a little bit more about the technology, the operations, and the asset pieces, what you kind of see as the easiest to address, where the biggest opportunities lie. And then just building on that, on the asset piece specifically, any additional color you can provide on the Pizza Hut Delco units? I think it's probably about 20 that you've got open at this point only. But anything more on the economics, the feedback, et cetera? Thank you. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, I'll start with the piece on the assets. I think you're referring to the Fast Casual Delco model that we've been rolling out over the last few years... with pretty good success. Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: The good news is that we have offered an incentive for our franchisees to accelerate the Fast Casual Delco model and we've seen a number of franchisees sign up. In fact, we were hit with 100 submissions to participate in expanding the test. So I think the Fast Casual Delco initiative is off to a good start. That's not just an initiative, by the way, that we're doing in the United States, that is also a big part of our international growth strategy. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. We actually shared that with the International Partners Council when we were with them in London probably three weeks ago, and I think there was true excitement about Fast Casual Delco as a global opportunity for Pizza Hut. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. And then on the other items that you asked about, Dennis, like technology, assets, operations, obviously all very critical, all part of the overall Transformation Agreement with the U.S. franchisees. As one piece of evidence of the progress we're making on technology, you heard Greg reference the loyalty program that we just launched. You can expect to see those kinds of improvements to our technology platforms coming out but obviously we are not going to share much in advance of revealing them to the consumers. And then on the operations front, I know the team \u2013 you've also seen our messaging start to reference hot and fresh, and the way that we're going to make sure that our consumers get the absolute best product. We know we have the best product in the category when we deliver it hot and fresh. We're doubling down and making sure that we have the capability with drivers and equipment to make that happen on a consistent basis. Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. My first question just has to do with your system sales goal of 7%. You got close to or closer to it this quarter. And if you look at just the sum of comps and units, it's actually 5%, maybe that's rounding. But is there a new store productivity story here either in the new stores you're opening by brand around the world or market mixes that may actually help you get to the system sales goal even if the sum total of the two growth numbers that we add up typically don't add up to 7%? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: It's a good question, John. I wouldn't read too much into it. For example, the same-store sales growth for the quarter of 2% was a very strong 2%. So there is some rounding that's happening there and a little bit of mix issues, a little bit of timing of when new units open. So when you put it all together, yes, it rounded up, and we like that but there's a number of different miscellaneous factors that contributed to it. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think there's also, as we have been \u2013 David and I've been around, and I've been in Brazil, UK, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong in the last quarter. I think it's a couple of things. One is the small box concept is definitely taking \u2013 getting traction, and that small box is allowing us to penetrate places like in Africa, into places we would not have been able to traditionally penetrate with our existing sort of asset base. And then, I think, Cantina \u2013 I was up in Chicago the other day, one of our franchisees in Chicago. He has one opened in Wicker Park and he showed me where he's going to open another four or five. There's no trade-off with any of our existing Taco Bell stuff. So I think the whole opportunity for us to get into small box Cantinas, urbanizes the brand will help us drive net new units. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Could I just follow up with a question on Pizza Hut loyalty program? What is \u2013 do you have loyalty anywhere else in the world? Is there a model you're following or is this the first one? And are there models out there that do transaction driving loyalty and others that do ticket driving loyalty? What kind of program is this? Does it require the app to use? Or can anyone use it? How widespread do you think the use is and how do you think it impacts sales ticket versus transactions, for example? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Just on the prevalence of programs in our system, yes, we do have loyalty programs and we have some in parts of Asia that are executed quite well and a big part of driving the business. So we've certainly gone to school on our \u2013 within our own system on leveraging learnings. We actually engaged an outside party also to help us understand the loyalty landscape. In a lot of cases, being the last to the party on loyalty in the pizza category is a good thing because we get to offer the best program and learn from the experiences of others. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. I have a question on the franchise revenue versus the franchise expense. As we would expect, as you sell off the restaurants, your franchise revenue is going up. But when we exclude the Pizza Hut transformation expense, it looks like the franchise expenses are actually dropping. Was that $9 million favorability reference in KFC in that line item there or are you just finding more favorability in franchise expense in addition to the ongoing G&A reductions? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think that there's mostly some timing issues that would contribute to that. The $9 million that \u2013 we called out the $9 million on the KFC line just because KFC had a very strong quarter this year and I wanted to make sure everybody understood that a small portion of it was more one-time related to U.S. fees that we collected earlier than normal that contributed to an outsized quarter when it came to U.S. fee \u2013 U.S. KFC franchisee fee income. That was close to $6 million. But I wouldn't read too much into the second part of your question. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And on the CapEx for the year, you're running well below the $300 million to $350 million that you had discussed earlier in the year and you're obviously doing more refranchising in the back half. Is this kind of the run rate we should expect for the rest of the year? Do you have a, I guess, corporate capital plan that will require you to have a step up in CapEx in the back half? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I don't think we're going to \u2013 we're not revising our guidance on CapEx spending. Obviously, we're laser-focused on getting the overall rate down to $100 million by 2019. In terms of how the spending is going this year, it's sort of in line with the targeted number. Maybe there's a little upside there, but I wouldn't read too much into that either. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Greg. As part of the 7% system-wide sales growth longer term, there's meant to be a step up in unit development, which I think is 4% to 5% longer term. So could you put the current 3% into the context of that 4% to 5%? Do you see a step up by brand in 2018 or 2019 in terms of new units? Or, I guess, just as important for other size? Or do you think we're going to see a particular slowing in... (33:27 \u2013 33:31) Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sorry, your questions \u2013 you're breaking up. We cannot get the question. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. I don't know if we lost him or not, but John, just to address the point you made on unit development, we haven't released any specific targets for unit development. So you referenced 4% to 5%. Certainly, we'd like to get to levels like that but we've been focused on the overall mission of getting to 7% in system sales growth over the long term. A big part of that will be increasing our development because we know when we plant that development pipeline over the long term we can count on it to deliver that growth every single year. Yeah, so and you should be looking for us to continue to be ramping up development in the years to come, but we haven't released any future guidance on that. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And my apologies for the transcript. I think I just assumed 2% to 3% comp and the rest from unit development. But can I ask if the connection is better right now? Do you see step-ups in 2018 or 2019 either in terms of new unit openings or in closures? And if you could just give us a little more color or confidence that even if we think about 2018, you could get better net results than 2017? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. I think one of the features of the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement is actually a limitation on the U.S. stores, making it harder to close stores in the U.S. So we should get a benefit from that in 2018 if you're thinking about broader issues that may be working in our favor. But beyond that, I think we've said this on many calls, we got our management team together in the spring. The mission in this company has been to hammer home this focus on development. Bold restaurant development is one of our four key growth drivers. And I think we've seen a mindset shift all around the country, all around the world, that is really contributing to much more focus on development than we've ever had. Greg mentioned different formats. There's just a lot of good stuff going on in development. Now it takes time to plant a development pipeline and get it to grow, but we do expect to see an increase in development in 2018. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, if you think about it, we've been closing KFC U.S. stores for a number of years, for quite a number of years. Hopefully, with the now 12th consecutive quarter of performance at KFC, there will be some change there as well. I think, as David said, the development agreements sort of go with refranchising. So as the refranchising occurs, the development agreements kick in. And then obviously these new units, small box new formats Cantinas, the 38-square-meter we saw in Brazil, I think all of these provide us opportunities to penetrate and continue to grow our net new unit. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. I've got one more on the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement in the U.S. Can you guys provide at least some base level numbers for where the concept is right now in terms of things like delivery as a percent of sales mix or digital orders as a percent of sales mix? Just give us some context as to where you're beginning this journey. And it will make it easier for us to track the progress moving forward. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: We won't provide very specific numbers. But our digital mix is around 50%. Even though we have more than half of our stores in the U.S., our dine-in stores, our business is very heavily reliant on carryout and delivery. I don't know. Maybe 10% to 15% of sales are dine-in, and the rest of the sales, just in broad terms, are split between carryout and delivery. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Just to follow up on John's question on unit development, maybe just a qualitative answer on this would be helpful. You mentioned Brazil, you mentioned the stabilization of Pizza Hut U.S., but if you were to think about your global business and looking at your pipelines of franchisees and licensees, where do you anticipate the biggest wins from a development standpoint as you look out one and two years? And then also on delivery, globally you mentioned that that's going to be an important sales layer. I know you've talked about that in the past. How significant can that be? And when do you see wins from that accelerating? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, I think there's obvious markets like China where we'll continue to see a lot of new unit growth. I think as we said, Taco Bell focusing on four big markets, China, India, Brazil, and Canada. As we said, we've opened our first freestanding drive-thru in Canada, the second one is under construction. In that one market, we think we can open six or seven. We've got U.S. franchisees for Taco Bell now sort of doing development in Canada. They're now doing development in Korea. So I think that where we've seen growth, which will be Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, we've got a lot of these locked into long-term development agreements. As David and I said, we were with the Pizza Hut franchisees last week. Have a new franchisee for Pizza Hut in Japan. Very impressed that he has got a real growth mindset, and I think we can accelerate opportunities in Japan as well. So I see it on that side. On delivery, as we said in the prepared remarks, about 20,000 restaurants currently deliver. Obviously mostly Pizza Huts, but a large number of KFCs and obviously Taco Bells as well. I do think that delivery is going to grow. We like the benefits of delivery, higher check, incrementality, new users, new occasions. And I think what we're doing right now is testing in a number of places just user aggregators, doing it ourselves. But I think we all see really a lot of potential growth there. Encouraged by some of the tests that are going on, like a UK test for KFC, where we're actually doing a test with both aggregators and by ourselves. We're seeing good incrementality, good check growth. So I think even the KFC team believes that adding another $1 billion in sales in the next few years is not without its possibility. And then, Taco Bell, obviously, where we are doing delivery with DoorDash, I think it's now in a 1000 restaurants and it can get bigger as well. So I think our brands are well established with 20,000 restaurants doing it. We have the expertise of Pizza Hut to help us. I think brands like KFC are ideally set up to be delivered with large buckets, $5 boxes, $10 chicken shares and $20 buckets. It's almost like the Colonel 60 years ago realized one day we'd be delivering this stuff. So I think we're in a really good place to take advantage of it. We do think there's growth there for us, and to some extent we're actually \u2013 KFC China is hosting a delivery summit this month where everyone from around the world will be going to a delivery summit in China so we can learn best practice from them, but also share best practice that we are doing from around the world. So we are all in on delivery. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: And one other point on development, which I think Greg alluded to earlier but just to expand on. The KFC U.S. business for many years was a net closure of stores, north of 100 closures every year. The KFC U.S. team, given the strength in the underlying business now feels really confident that they can get themselves to be a net opener of stores and that could get to north of 100 openings per year. So you think about a 200-unit swing alone just in KFC U.S., that'll obviously take time to implement. That obviously would be one of the contributors to the increase in development. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right, thanks. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have just a couple of follow-up questions, if I may. The first is on again Pizza Hut, and I think, Greg, you said it wouldn't be kind of an immediate turnaround. Results won't show up overnight. But I think in the past we've seen that Pizza Hut can do things to drive sales in the short term in a pretty meaningful way, in particular around value messaging. So maybe you could just share a little bit about what you're doing in 3Q in terms of marketing and price points. And a related question is what are you seeing in the demand environment in the U.S. and the competitive environment? I think we've heard a lot about heavy discounting by hamburger restaurants in particular. I was wondering if you're seeing that have an impact on any of your brands, KFC and Taco Bell still comping well, but maybe a little slower sequentially. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, I don't want to get into Q3 in the pizza category, given the competitive nature of it. I think what I can say is we've said it's a slow build. The incremental media didn't happen in the first half, it will happen in the second half. Obviously, we've just rolled out loyalty. So I think you will hopefully see a slow build, and we see the results obviously paying off in 2018 and beyond on Pizza Hut. From a demand environment point of view, I think the great thing about our category is or the great thing about food is you've got to eat it and I think there will be winners and losers. I think the people that have the most distinct and relevant brands, the people that do the best job of executing operations, the people that open new units and the people who are driven by culture and talent and that's why they're the four things we are focused on because we believe by focusing on those four things we can be successful in both the U.S. and on the global scale. So that's, I think, sort of the way I see the market at the moment. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, no increased intensity around discounting or value? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: No. I think, I mean, value is always going to be important. So I don't see any renewed focus. I mean, if you think about it, the question is \u2013 I think we've got very good everyday value. At KFC, we have $5, $10, and $20, and that really does resonate. I think $7.99 at Pizza Hut, I think the $1 and the $5 boxes at Taco Bell. So what I like about the way we're set up is that we've got everyday great value. What we don't have to do is to get into this deep discounting and sort of cutting the price on core products which you never want to get into because one day you got to raise those prices. So I really like the way the three brands have constructed their value equation in the marketplace. I think you see that it's working on the whole. And what I appreciate is the franchisees' commitments to staying on those price points so that our customers know day in and day out they can always get not just the best tasting food but the best value in the marketplace. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. You're seeing more Pizza Hut questions. Sort of going back to the initial reacceleration in comps in Taco Bell that has been really built for many years. That was kind of kicked off with the Doritos Locos pretty singularly iconic viral product. Do you think there's a similar opportunity at Pizza Hut to really kickstart things with the product or are you more focused on sort of fundamental building blocks around technology, digital, asset base, et cetera? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think the answer to that it's like the answer is and. We've got to make it easier and better. We do believe we have the better pizza; we've got to continue to make sure that we deliver a better pizza in the marketplace. But better is also making sure that our piping hot pizza gets delivered to you on time and therefore obviously tastes better. So I think the answer is, just like everything in life, we have to be easy and we have to be better. So we're working on the easy components whether that's all the technology, the digital play whether that's loyalty, and at the same time, we're obviously continuing to work on making sure we have the best pizza in the marketplace. And I think a combination of both of those will see us sort of build the Pizza Hut brand back into the brand we want it to be. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk about the 2019 target of at least $3.75 in EPS. I think the $3.75 is an attractive target on its own but the question I have is what's the key in your internal model to unlocking that wording of \"at least\" within that stated target? Is the achievement of your goal to get to 7% systemwide sales growth help you unlock that word \"at least\"? Or is there something else that we should be focusing on? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: No. I mean, as we've said in past calls, we built the model on reasonable assumptions. We don't have to be heroes to get to that number. So the kinds of things that would contribute to outperformance would be an acceleration of system sales growth, a turnaround in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We're not counting on any of those things to get there. So the \"at least\" is only there to indicate that we certainly have room to go beyond that if we see an acceleration in development, system sales growth beyond historical rates, Pizza Hut U.S. getting back to growth. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just the follow-up question I have is on Taco Bell. It's a great comp for the quarter relative to the industry or any metric, really. The question I have is what were the biggest differences that you saw in the business and the growth of the business this quarter when analyzing the sales versus the 8% comp you achieved last quarter? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I mean, the way I look at Taco Bell is, we are just really enthusiastic about the long-term fundamentals of the business, whether it's the consumer metrics, the ops metrics, the financial metrics. Obviously, the brand has delivered consistent, healthy same-store sales growth over the long-term. And I think the icing on the cake, Dave and I happened to spend two days with the FRANMAC group, which is the franchise leadership group for Taco Bell in June, and I think to say they were happy with where the brand is, happy with where the brand is going and happy with the Taco Bell leadership team would be an understatement. So I just feel good about where the brand is going. What happens then quarter by quarter, I think, you will see us continue to deliver. The long-term fundamentals for this business are in great shape. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks, guys. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Operator, we'll take one more question, please? Operator : Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Going back to your Investor Day, you guys set out plans to refranchise about 2,000 stores for at least $2 billion in proceeds. So it's about $1 million per store. Obviously with the 244 franchises in 2Q, you've looked at a gain on the sale, but the implied proceeds per store of $560,000 were a little lighter than the implied targets. Is the way to think about this is that it was driven, the lower proceeds per store, driven by an outsized amount of Pizza Huts that were franchised during the quarter? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. Pizza Huts obviously, with smaller investments in the smaller box units typically garner less proceeds, lower volumes versus, for example, our Taco Bells, which is our highest volume concept that we are selling stores of any scale on. So very much you will see that number move around from quarter to quarter, depending on the mix of the units. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay. Go ahead. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you. (49:22) Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay. So thank you all for being on the call. As we said, we believe we had another successful quarter, 6% system growth, 21% EPS growth, 19% core operating profit growth, and we look forward to updating you as we work the brands as we go through the rest of the year. So thanks for being on the call. Appreciate it. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

System sales grew 6% driven by 3% same store sales growth and 3% net unit growth.  We're reiterating our guidance of 207 and remain firmly on track with achieving our 2019 transformation goals. Today I want to first talk you about our recent anniversary celebrations, then I will discuss two of our four key growth drivers, which influenced our daily decision making including unrivalled culture and talent and distinctive relevant easy brands. And then David will follow up with both restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability.  Now to begin our recent anniversary celebrations. Two days ago, we celebrated our anniversary since the spinoff of Yum China as independent company and David and will fortunate to up to be in the China last week to celebrate and talk about our future together. We're proud of the Yum China success and impressed by their ability to make Yum, Yum's brand distinctive relevant and easy. Our collaboration with Yum China is strong as ever and we\u2019re confident in the power of our brands by working together. In connection with the spinoff we announced our multiyear strategic transformational initiatives to become more focused, more franchise and more efficient so we can deliver more growth to our shareholders. We're making significant strides towards completion of these initiatives and look forward to updating you today and as we progress on this journey. Another reason anniversary occurred last month when we celebrated our 20th anniversary as an independent company, since the October 1997 spinoff from PepsiCo Yum brands has more than doubled its system sales, growing operating profit more than six times over and developed into a global power house, selling from 30% of restaurant outside the U.S. to nearly 60% of restaurants outside the U.S. A $10,000 investment in Yum brands in 1997 at the time of spin-off from PepsiCo would be worth $170,000 today, a phenomenal return.  A lot of change has occurred in 20 years and really even in the last year but the one constant has been our unrivalled culture and talents. When David Novak began leaving this company, he truly believe that culture mattered and it could be a distinct competitive advantage. And I'm proud to say to our people first culture has never been stronger and is a competitive advantage for Yum.  As I traveled to some of the 137 countries where Yum is represented, I'm able to witness the first hand the caliber of our people around the world. I take a lot of pride in knowing that our people first culture drives the passion for our brands that each of our employees and partners display. As they are truly engaged in delivering their unit piece of Yum. As we celebrate these first and 28th anniversary, I'm committed to ensuring that our under rival culture and talent remains an advantage for Yum today and I the future. Now to our three distinctive, relevant and easy brands. First KFC representing nearly 50% of the operating profit. During the quarter system sales grew 7% with 4% same store sales growth and 4% net unit growth. At our recent analyst day, we highlighted the brand, strong track record of success and the significant room for growth in both developed and emerging markets. We also highlighted delivery as a future, driver of future results we're we expected double delivery sales to at least 2 billion by 2020. KFC product is ideal for delivery and market share an enthusiasm for executing it. That\u2019s why our KFC teams attended the delivery summit where Yum! China shared key learnings from their extensive delivery network including best practices to ensure this becomes a successful repeatable model for KFC around the globe.  The need to ease is making delivery the largest growth drivers for KFC and the team came home with several actions items to not only accelerate the growth of the delivery business at KFC but to make sure the experience is best-in-class. As another example of best practice sharing, approximately 300 KFC individuals from around the world including franchises, came together to share ideas on value, delivery and innovation at our annual marketing planning meeting this quarter.  That the teams came hungry to learn from their counterparts across the globe as the types of 12 food innovations and left the meeting confident that KFC has a very strong global pipeline of innovation routed in insights and culture. Taking place for over a decade now this is the original repeatable model.  As I mentioned earlier the entire global leadership team and I've been as weak in China where we all came away impress with the China team's ability to make our brands distinctive relevant and easy. And KFC China is executing on digital, social and delivery.  We even had KFC delivered to us on the train by placing our orders via mobile, with the team member delivering it to us at the next stop when we arrived. It really doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. Yum! China has truly traded in all access brand. In vision to China, another market demonstrating their power distinctive relevant and easy brands is Latin America, our year-to-date same-store sales growth has grown 5% and third quarter same-store sales growth 4%.  Using our always original brands positioning, the team has grown the call with buckets and box meals as well as driven innovations through the launch of flavored chicken on the bone and our marriage of chicken and pizza into the Chikzaa.  Thailand has turned around their business this quarter with 4% same-store sales growth by adding more value to the calendar and communicating in a way that really connects with consumers. As an example, the chicken and share for TBH99 or approximately $3 offers value in the snacking category and is positioned as TBH20 or $0.60 per person. KFC is truly a global powerhouse brand with China, Latin America and Thailand being the three examples of our markets demonstrating success with our always original brand positioning, value and delivery.  Next the Pizza Hut, currently representing 20% of Yum!'s annual operating profit split nearly even between the U.S. and international. During the quarter Pizza Hut U.S. system sales declined 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 2% net unit decline. At our recent Analyst Day, we demonstrated the changes underway as a result of the transformation agreement signed in the U.S. at beginning of May. Mainly a hot, fast and reliable Pizza Hut experience. Most importantly, the transformation agreement represents clear alignment amongst the system for a digital delivery centric way forward.  We are making our investment in hot in a 360-degree way. When you see our ads on TV they highlight our commitment to delivering our Pizza 15 degrees hotter. When the pizza arrived at your house it's wrap in a new delivery [couch] with three layers of thermal installation. When you bite into the pizza it will be crispier as a result of our new proprietary sheet included inside every box. Each of these changes are designed to deliver on our commitment to hot. These changes were rolled out to all Pizza Huts across the U.S. just after the end of the third quarter and will be part of your next Pizza Hut experience.  To deliver on our fast and reliable commitment, Pizza Hut announced the addition of 14,000 new delivery drivers by the end of the year and has executed other operational enhancements design to make the delivery system more efficient. Additionally, the Hut Rewards Loyalty Program was launched in August, we're encouraged by initial trends and are confident our investment in loyalty will pay off in the long run.  As we said before we do not expect the transformation agreement to yield results over night but we do expect to see improvement over time. I'm confident that the changes made with the transformation agreement will allows us to execute on our commitment to a hot, fast and reliable Pizza Hut experience over the long-term. Internationally Pizza Hut system sales grew 7% with same store sales worth of 2% and net unit growth of 6%. At the analyst day we highlighted the growth potential of this business through unit growth and repeatable models including technology ventures.  India was a standout market for Pizza Hut with its fifth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth. They have implemented the repeatable model for perfect pan pizza execution, the market also has renewed its focus on team member training, ensuring team member have the tools necessary to deliver an exceptional customer experience. As a result of these changes, customer satisfaction scores have improved over 9 percentage points versus the prior year. The team now has signed development agreements with our franchisees in India and I recently met with these franchisees and can feel there is enthusiasm for the brand. They are great examples of franchises to exhibit the three C's, capable, capitalized, committed; committed both to our brand and to our culture.  With the perfect pan pizza team members are ready for action and the right partners in place, India is poised to accelerate its growth and we look forward to seeing the continued success in this market.  Finally, Taco Bell, which represents approximately 30% of Yum!'s operating profit, by keeping to the core of Mexican inspired product with value and innovation Taco Bell delivered another solid quarter. This quarter system sales grew 6% with same store sales growth of 3% and net unit growth by 3%. During the quarter busy potato read out combined the powers of crispy potato bytes, season baked, cheddar cheese, nacho cheese sauce and a kick of creamy chipotle sauce all for just $1. This showcases Taco Bell's ability to deliver innovative products at an attractive value to the consumer. And the Double Chalupa, which included a double amount of seasoned beef, built on familiar cravable [ph] product while still delivering strong value in a $5 box.  Now proven they are more than just food is fuel, the colder Taco Bell delivered on food as an experience by launching their own line of clothing and partnership with Forever 21, including crop sweat shirts, shirts, body suits and jackets.  Taco Bell's first ever retail collaboration is inspired the iconic graphics that each brand is known for with a mix of vibrant prints. We understand the importance of reaching the consumer beyond the food and top of our given their fans another reason to celebrate.  Internationally Taco Bell opens 15 new stores this quarter, Brazil continue to strong develop and has now open 17 stores over the past 12 months. I've mentioned before continue to unlock the business model by driving cost out of the supply chain and building scale with new and existing franchises.  And India the great example of this, where we're now locally sourcing corn and equipments which significantly improved their margin. India and Brazil our two Taco Bell's four key growth market along with China and Canada. We continue to be excited about the potential for this brand internationally and changes to the supply chain such as those made in India will make the brand sustainable internationally over that long-term.  In summary the focus on our four key growth drivers has delivered out strong third quarter results, building off a solid first half for the year, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and are confident in reiterating our 2017 guidance and transformation targets.  And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and CFO, David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results and full year outlook an update on our transformation initiative and how we are bringing two of our four key growth drivers to life, our bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. Yum! delivered another successful quarter with 11% core operating profit growth and 22% EPS growth excluding Special Items. During the quarter, the was minimal impact to operating profit from the timing difference between refranchises and the associated G&A savings referred to you as the net impact from refranchising dilution. Additionally, during the quarter, we spent approximately $10 million on incremental advertising at Pizza Hut as part of the transformation agreement. This was included in Pizza Hut operating profit.  We are reiterating our 2017 full-year guidance of mid-single digit core operating profit growth. As a reminder this was derived from underlying based operating profit growth of high-single digits adjusted for the 53rd week and the net impact from refranchising dilution.  We cautioned that the timing of the refranchising impact would be hard to predict. While we had limited net impact from refranchising dilution in the first quarters of the year, we expect this to be a significant headwind in the fourth quarter which is consistent with the 10 to 12 percentage points headwinds discussed during our second quarter earnings call. In addition, we expect 15 million of incremental Pizza Hut media investment in the fourth quarter or an additional 3 percentage points of headwind.  Now with regards to our transformation initiative, we remain on track to deliver all aspects of our multiyear strategy of being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to deliver more growth. First more focus. This quarter was our second consecutive quarter of delivering 6% system sales growth, on our way to a bold goal of 7% system sales growth.  Second, more franchise. This quarter we refranchised 209 units including 72 KFCs, 46 Pizza Huts and 91 Taco Bells, increasing to 95% franchise ownership. We continue to expect the majority of the refranchising to be completed in 2017 with the remainder to reach at least 98% franchise and less than 1,000 company owned restaurants to be complete by year-end 2018. Third more efficient. We continue to make progress towards our G&A goal of 1.7% of system sales excluding special items. Year-to-date CapEx is 228 million. We now anticipate approximately 300 million to 350 million in CapEx this year slightly lower just from our previous guidance of 350 million to 400 million.  This will reduce in tandem with company ownership to approximately 100 million in ordinary cost of business CapEx by 2019. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter we repurchased over 19 million shares at an average price of $69. Our fully diluted share count as of quarter end was approximately 349 million. Combined with our quarterly dividends we have returned over 1.6 billion in 2017. We remain committed to returning between 6.5 and 7 billion to shareholders from 2017 to 2019. All of this is enabling us to deliver more growth and we remain on track to deliver at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019. Moving now to old restaurant developments, one of our four key growth drivers. During the quarter we opened 641 growth new units and 362 net new units to year-over-year net unit growth of 3%.  Although we've not disclosed the breakdown of our long-term 7% system sales growth target between same stores sales growth and net growth, the key to achieving this over the long-term is to ensure a strong development pipeline is in place with growth minded franchises.  We're attaching development agreement through our refranchising deals which are way for young to accelerate unit development across all three brands. We're confident in the unit growth potential for each of our brands with continue growth at KFC and Pizza Hut in both developed and emerging markets and international development for Taco Bell really just beginning. The growth minded franchisees behind our bold restaurant developments brings me to our fourth growth driver unmatched franchise operating capability. We talk about the three Cs required for our franchisees, capable, capitalized and committed.  As an example of finding the right franchise partners demonstrating the three Cs, this quarter we consolidated our highly fragmented franchisee base for Pizza Hut in South Korea under one master franchisee. The consolidation of this market should allow us to streamline operations, enhance our growth prospects and accelerate development in a key market for Pizza Hut. At KFC we recently celebrated founder's week, engaging all employees with Colonel Sanders and his passion for food. To honor the original celebrity chef, we celebrate the chef in each of our stores who hand bread, fresh chicken daily with recognition and by going back to the basics on operations, recertifying our chefs on making our world-famous products to ensure our food is served with the irresistible taste we all know and love.  And at Taco Bell, Greg previously mentioned the supply chain initiatives in India positively impacting restaurant margins. It is operational enhancement such as these, which improve our unit level economics, strengthen our franchise partner's health and have us enthusiastic about unlocking the potential of Taco Bell globally.  In conclusion we're pleased with our third quarter results, which build on a strong forecast and reinforce our confidence in the underlying strength of our business. Our strategic transformational initiatives and focus on four key growth drivers are setting us up to deliver more growth to our shareholders and we look forward to updating you as we progress on this journey. And with that the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Two questions first, you talked about accelerating towards your refranchising goal bit more rapidly from here, I think getting a lot done by the end of this year and that contributes to some near-term earnings headwinds which you clearly alluded for 4Q and I know you're not giving '18 guidance yet, so we be assuming our models that this refranchising dynamic also remains alluded factor in the first half of '18 and then starts to reverse to accretion in the later part of '18 and into '19, any color you can give us has 4Q will be helpful. Greg Creed : Yes Brian, I think that\u2019s a good way to look at it, obviously we have a lot more refranchising to do and that will be more dilutive and that\u2019s why we highlighted the issues related to that in the fourth quarter and that will continue into the first half of the year. Brian Bittner : Okay, and second question just on Pizza Hut U.S. Is there anything you can talk to regarding the early progress there we heard a competitor yesterday putting a lot of point on inner felt for a weak start to the fourth quarter so there is a lot of confusion swirling around regarding pizza in general and I know it's really early in your turnaround efforts but any light you can shed on how that's going? David Gibbs : I think to sort of answer two parts of the question. Look we also love live sports whether it's baseball, college football, NFL. We are not seeing any impact from any of that on our business and continue to obviously promote not just pizza but all of our brands on live sports. And then on Pizza Hut as I said, this is really us putting the foundations in place, the foundations are not always sexy but I think delivering hot reliable pizza is important and I do believe the team is making progress on all the areas in the foundation that will enable us to build longer term a strong Pizza Hut position. Greg Creed : And I don\u2019t think that and there have been no real impacts to our business from any of the issues although I would point out as Pizza Hut is the official sponsor of the NCA and so we're happy about that partnership. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : First, just on your system sales growth goals of 7% and two of your brands one of them are KFC you very close it Taco Bell of obviously Pizza it's lagging that 7%. So first can you get to the 7% without Pizza Hut getting 7% itself and when you think about Pizza Hut can you get to 7% at Pizza Hut if that is a goal without the U.S. without accelerating. Can you maybe just what are the dynamics on the brands and maybe just dealing in Pizza Hut? Greg Creed : Well, I think you just saw John we\u2019re making good progress obviously we're making good progress in KFC in developing and emerging markets as you saw [Indiscernible] is also is making great progress. We are also making progress at Pizza Hut on the international side of Pizza Hut we obviously had a good quarter I think system sales were down was 7% and obviously we are going to have to make quarter-over-quarter progress but as we said don\u2019t expect any heroics, but we do believe we can if I getting the foundations in place and doing the right things continue to progress our Pizza Hut U.S. performance. So, I just feel good about the performance we are making the steady progress we are making we are making the brands more distinctive and more relevant and easier and I think all of that is going to help us get to the long-term goal. David Gibbs : Yes, I think one of the ways to look at it as we have over 250 combinations of brands and countries so some of those brands in countries are going to be growing north of 10% and other will be growing less than 7%. Do we need Pizza Hut to get to 7% to get the entire systems to 7% no. As you can see as we've said KFCs has been performing at 7% and actually KFC U.S. is closing store more stores and they are opening right now we know that's going to reverse. So, we've got upside at all three brands and I know we are going to get there in different ways in different countries but in aggregate we've got our eyes focused on the price of 7%. John Glass : And if I can just follow-up, can you or maybe you did disclose some in the release and I missed it what the refranchising dilution is expected to be in the fourth quarter just as the lot of moving pieces in that quarter. Can you isolate the refranchising piece so we can get a better sense of how we think about the first half of '18? Greg Creed : I think we've categorized that as 10 to 12 percentage points of headwinds through a combination of refranchising dilution and the impact from the 53rd week, you can do the math on it but basically we will get into more details on that in the fourth quarter and the other challenge that we have with all of this refranchising is the timing is never really certain, these are deals that we're working on without side parties and they will close when they close, we don\u2019t want to close them before they should close or any later then they should close. It was very hard to predict exactly what that will be in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason West : Just wondered if you can talk a bit about the competitive environment in the U.S., I guess thinking mostly Taco Bell, another good quarter there, you guys are holding up margins pretty good and we're seeing a lot of these companies in the space having invested in margin and seeing some labor pressure, just wanted to feel for, if you think you can grow margins in Taco Bell from here or should we look for investment to try to keep the sales where they are. David Gibbs : Its defiantly a competitive market place, I think we all know that, which I think is even more encouraging with the results we delivered, Taco Bell had a solid quarter as you say plus 3% same stores sales growth, I think what Taco Bell is able to is to balance, being the value leader with an underlying economic model that delivers good industry leading margins. I think that team knows exactly how to ensure the we continue to grow same store sales while obviously protecting the sort of 20% plus margins, I got confidence though base value and innovation we will now continue to do that in the fourth quarter and going forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : You mentioned confidence against the 2019 earnings goals, I think there was some curiosity now, ahead of 2019 its more on, those sustaining elements of the revenue growth which of course are the unit growth and delivery. Is there anything at this point, I know it's early, I know you probably have future analyst day's ahead, you want to talk about this more but updates about particularly the U.S. when it comes to delivery and international when it comes to unit growth and the confidence you have in traction and in any numbers or, that will be helpful. Thank you. David Gibbs : Well on the unit front, I guess I point if you look at the number this quarter, we're close to 100 hundred units ahead of our net new unit development phase from last year, that\u2019s a pretty encouraging sign and effective if you look at gross units over 200 units ahead of the pace that we had.  So, I think we feel like, just as we hit plans and the ramp up in unit development is happening slowly but surely and confident particularly internationally in having a lot more upside there and the U.S. off course a big opportunity on unit growth is reversing Pizza Hut U.S. and [AST] the U.S. to being net growing rather than decliners which is well on its way. Greg Creed : I think that question on delivery, which is sort of easy part of distinct, relevant and easy, I mean the good news is we got a thousand Taco Bells delivering now obviously the KFC team as we said went off to the delivery summit with China so they picked up a lot of ideas on how to execute delivery, we go almost I think 20,000 brands with Yum! currently delivering, we got a lot of in house knowledge obviously with the pizza brand and obviously with KFC and places like the Middle East delivery. And obviously we're doing some testing work with aggregators. So, I think we're doing all the things that you would expect us to do when order to unleash the growth potential of delivery going forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gregory Frankfort with Bank of America. Gregory Frankfort : Maybe following up can you talked about how you think delivery played out in the U.S. in terms of getting the check size up and maybe how you think the bundled value meals fit into that kind of longer term to drive check size? Greg Creed : Sure. I think Greg the good news is the delivery that we are doing there are two things that are obviously, check does grow. Secondly that also a lot of it is new occasions. So, I think what we are excited about delivery actually gives us greater access to newer occasions and high checks. So, both of those will obviously help to drive system sales. I think right now into early days but what we are seeing is part of a check growth and a new occasion opportunity both of those obviously positive for our growth potential. Gregory Frankfort : And maybe one follow-up just on the international business it feels like across a bunch of different brands you've seen better numbers for the last couple of quarters from some of the international divisions any thoughts on the international consumer in and particularly out of Europe? Greg Creed : When you are in that 137 countries there is a lot of international consumers. Look, I think our business in Central and Eastern Europe is strong our KFC business in the UK is strong look I think where we built distinct relevant and easy brands which is really the cornerstone of driving our system sales growth and where we've got great franchise partners who are executing a great customer experience I think that's why we are continuing to see the success and the growth that we are around the world. So, look there will always be markets when you know as many of that have good macros and bad macros our job is to build distinct relevant and easy brands supported by unmatched franchise operating capability. David Gibbs : I think we've talked about this in past occasions but couple of years ago we made a change to organize globally around brands and that change principally benefitted the international [indiscernible] because we've already have been organized that way in the U.S. so I think part of this success we are seeing in building distinctive relevant brands is really what we keep talking about just more focused on the brands and sales dedicated 100% teams to the brands internationally working even closer with our franchise partners. Operator : And your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : The question is on KFC obviously a good quarter both from same-store sales and a unit development perspective. But you are considering that is your biggest division and it's kind of instill the drivers of the overall Yum! Engine. I just wanted to get a sense of what can accelerate from here at KFC in order to allowing the corporation to achieving 7% system wide sales growth.  4% global comps I think it's in the above average number for the division is obviously something that you'd be proud of at any point and accelerating unit development beyond the 4% level that you are currently achieving on a unit base of 21,000 is obviously just a tough order just by the law of large numbers. So, I just want to get your sense of which are those -- what can accelerate from here at KFC or is this just a type of division that even if you are achieving 7% system wide sales growth as we think about in the next 3 to 5 years would just in of itself be a great level? Greg Creed : Well I think the good news -- I've talk about same store sales growth I think the good thing is that Roger Eaton, is doing a great job of getting everyone focused back on the call. So, if you think about the innovation that we've been doing it's all been innovation around core chicken on the bone. So, flavors delivered by chicken on the bone value, you have got everyone running $5 boxes, $10 share and $20 family meals, I think that\u2019s helping delivering, obviously, we do believe that the KFC brand, I joke internally that the Colonel we're going to deliver and that\u2019s why he made the bucket 60 years ago, because there is better delivery vehicle then a bucket of chicken. So, I think that for all of those reasons, focus on the core, flavor around the core, pride in the core and then obviously great execution plus then delivery, I think will gives us with the confidence that even through this is a big brand and yes it has a lot of big number that this brand can continue deliver like it's been delivering for the past few quarters and I remain firmly confident that this brand will continue to deliver. John Ivankoe : So that 4% type of comp level, is something you think that this execution, delivery sounds like it's an achievable number over the long-term, what about on the restaurant side, I mean does it make sense means would you want the 21,000-unit brand to accelerate beyond 4% system wide unit growth year-on-year. Greg Creed : Obviously, we talked but that\u2019s we're not provide brand by brand guidance on development but your question is well placed John, of course we like to see all of our brands pick up the pace of development, KFC is building a lot of units but it also describes the service and so many markets the world, I know the KFC team is continually looking for ways to accelerate development and you\u2019re seeing some of that happening this year. John Ivankoe : And something that a lot of companies kind of experience both in a good way and a bad way as, 1000 or 2000 units globally in a year can be too much, there is two things, one is franchise capability and demand and secondly as the level that you think is right for the brand to grow in terms of units, and so I'm just trying to get a sense of what that maximum limit is, or perhaps the really is that one that as there is market to market build up that it continues to make sense to accelerate that development. Greg Creed : I think two things, John I think as David said, in the large part of the world, we got less than one unit for million population, a large part of the world, you would argue we would be under penetrated compared to sort of develop market economics. The second thing is, I think as we gone through this transformation, as we refranchise the business, we build in as we said stronger franchises, so about our existing franchise base, we\u2019re very happy with and the new franchises with development agreement attached to all of this, which traditionally we haven't done but as well as with the capability and the commitment and the capacity to actually do this development. So, I think for those reasons, we feel good about the KFC branding out to deliver both same store sales growth and net new unit growth, this year, next year the year after and the year after that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matthew McGinley with Evercore ISI. Matthew McGinley : I guess I have a follow up on that unit development question, it's very obviously very encouraging to see that pick up in the unit growth but as you look at the present unit growth that you had over the past, through this quarter or past quarter do you know how much of that is normal development growth pipeline versus the contractual commitments you're receiving from refranchising or the contractual commitment that you get from when a franchisee turns over and curious of the, uptake that we're seeing now is could accelerate because we're not actually getting those refranchising type commitments and the numbers yet. Greg Creed : I think it's fair to say that some of the refranchising commitments have started to impact the pace of development but remember with the time frames around development and when we just really restarted this batch of refranchising little bit over a year ago a lot of these deals were in the pipeline before the refranchising began so it's starting to have an impact and then we hope that it will continue to avenue impact of even greater magnitude as we go forward. Matthew McGinley : And on a G&A decline by 300 million as it relates to the refranchising you've said that extensive would be done with that refranchising by year-end. What causes a lag between refranchising and G&A reductions as your asset based trends. I mean you has the due to store related G&A I mean you have the headquarters G&A kind of curious of how the perhaps the headquarters G&A would lag or lead that refranchising that would drop those G&A dollars? Greg Creed : I guess also to clarify we've said the majority of the refranchising would be done by year-end but we certainly will have some refranchising that will still be in 2018. And then as far as what might be a lagging item on the G&A versus the refranchising of stores just to give you like an obvious one in some international markets if we're selling the entire market we might have office lease obligations, we might have to do a lot of things with employees to continue during the transition period to a franchise owner organization all of that would be lagging the actual transfer to restaurants at a restaurants level profitability that we would going to with the franchises. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Can you provide any more detail on what you are seeing from those refranchise initiatives in place at Pizza Hut in the U.S. at this early stage anything on loyalty the new thermal power, it's the new app or the marketing spend maybe if it's just customers satisfaction metrics maybe what the franchises are seeing any of the incremental detail would be great? Thanks. Greg Creed : I think it's just a nice positive build I think the good news is when QSR magazine came out and rated [indiscernible] genius category I think we were only second behind Starbucks in a sort of group with Dominos, so we feel really good that our asset is being recognized at least within the industry.  So, no, I think we are making progress, its early days. I know the advertising for hot pouches has just started as we said you will get to a crispier, hotter, when they next experience Pizza Hut. So, I think we are doing all the right things. Our loyalty is now underway making progress on that, we are happy with that progress. So, I think we are just starting to do all the right foundational blocking and tackling things and I'm pleased with the progress that we are making on all of those fronts. Dennis Geiger : If I can get more in with the roughly 600 restaurants refranchised year-to-date till the end of the quarter anything more you say about those transactions I guess and just specifically any commentary on the development agreements coming out of those I'm sure there is only so much you can say but as far as number of years just to think about anywhere that kind of contractualize that? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes, I think first of all we are pleased with the prices we are getting for refranchising as I've mentioned on previous calls. There is the strong market for the stores that we are refranchising and lots of capital out there available for these kinds of deals and similarly with that capital availability we've got franchises willing to sign up for development commitments we've got generally very good unit level economics in most of the countries we operate in, so yes, I think it's been a very positive story in terms of the reception to the refranchising program. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Co. Andrew Charles : Greg where the quick service industry increasing focus more recently on the $1 to $3 price points, it seems likely to intensify early next year, looking to talk about differentiate on value, given the brand with the only national QSR with the $1 menu over the less five years and then I have a follow up. Greg Creed : I think as I said earlier the great thing is we can grow $1 all day, all night, all week, all month, all quarter and still have great margins. We got a really good underlying economic model at Taco Bell, we will never give up that leadership of value in the QSR category, I can assure you that, I know Brian and team are very focused, they what\u2019s going on the market place, but I think we're very confident, we execute our plans given the context of what's occurring that we can still be very competitive in that price range. Andrew Charles : Thanks, and then David what lead to minimal profit dilution from a franchising in 3Q while you guys were ahead of schedule in the franchising activity and further what expense should we expect the franchising dilution to be most evident in 4Q and early 2018. David Gibbs : The minimal profit dilution in the first part of the year, obviously some of this depends on what kind of stores you're selling, if you're selling to stores with lower margin and you're collecting royalty in some cases, you can see a positive impact from the refranchising. In terms of where these things are going to show up in our P&L obviously you will see our margins going down brand by brand, you will see G&A going down and then franchise and license expense going up, particularly when we refranchise stores that we end up holding on to real estate or remaining on lease obligations, we have to recognize the brands and depreciation to the franchise and license expense line. Operator : Okay your final question is coming from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Senatore : I have a quick follow up on pizza and then I wanted to ask about Latin America, the first on pizza, I was just, I know you, if I didn\u2019t see any real impact from NFL viewership, but it does seem like the category aggregate has slowed so, Greg has mentioned the idea of delivering being part of easy and I'm wondering if it\u2019s the fact that so many other restaurants are pursuing this kind of easy component through delivery, is that having any impact and then like I said I have a second question about Latin America, please. Greg Creed : I think a lot of people are trying to get into the easy delivery business but I think we got a track record of doing it for so many years, we obviously have a system that knows how to deliver, I think what we\u2019ve done is we doubled down we hired 14,000, we'll be hiring 14,000 more drivers as we said to deliver. We have the team operationally focused on making sure that we improve of speed of service, we make the pizzas hot, you can now track it, you got a loyalty program. So even though I think, obviously competition is heating up in this area, I also think we're raising our performance and I think that will keep, continue to keep in competitive in this market place. Sara Senatore : Okay thank you and then just on the Latin America business, you talked about it very positively and I think from those the time that I been following you and it going to be in the shadow of emerging Asia and particular. Are you seeing sort of a quantitative or qualitative difference in performance there and does that change potentially? How you think about the balance of your global growth going forward? Greg Creed : As we think we said, what I love is we've got this content of repeatable model and it's very clear that when we execute all best practice to repeatable model, it has impact, so the Latin America KFC performance I spoke about was really about implementing the repeatable model, maybe so we had value and then innovation around chicken flavored chicken on the bone. We\u2019ve also got as we talked about the talk about our Brazilian business now we got 17 restaurants which we've opened in 12 months so that was a market that we were in for that brand in the past so, look I think we just feel confident that by executing the repeatable model and growing our presence with a brand like Taco Bell, we can get more growth out Latin America. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Greg Creed : Okay. So, I'd like to thank everyone for being on the call today. I think we delivered another strong quarter, we are firmly on track to achieve our 2019 transformation goals. I do believe we are focused on the right key growth drivers and now for all of office about execute, execute, execute. So, thank you for being with us. Thank you for supporting us, we look forward to speaking you in the future. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you, Keith good morning everyone. The fourth quarter was a solid earning to the first full year of our transformation journey. For the full year, Yum! delivered 5% system sales growth, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. This is comprised of 2% same store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. We've reached a significant milestone in 2017 as we closed the year with over 45,000 global restaurants in our 139 countries and territories. We are excited about the long-term growth potential of Yum! brands and are on track with our strategic transformation initiatives.  Today, I will talk you about two of our four growth capabilities. Distinctive relevant and easy brands and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will follow up with this second too. While at the restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability, he will also discuss our 2017 results, 2018 guidance and progress towards our transformation initiatives.  I'll begin with our distinctive relevant and easy brands. There is no better way to make a brand easy than having it deliver right to your door. And I'm very excited to announce a new U.S. partnership with Grubhub. As the nation's leading online and mobile food ordering company, Grubhub offers delivery in over 1300 U.S. cities. This partnership will rapidly expand KFC and Taco Bell's ability to offer the online ordering by pickup and delivery to our customers in all existing U.S. Grubhub markets with many more to come. Making it easy to access all of our brands is important and the partnership with Grubhub is a key component of making our brands distinctive, relevant and easy. Now on to the brands. Starting with KFC, where system sales grew 6% excluding the 53rd week, with 3% same store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth in the fourth quarter. Internationally, we had several standout markets and I'd like to highlight two, Russia and Brazil. In our Russia market, system sales grew 26% in the quarter with 9% same store sales growth and 18% net new unit growth. The market strong growth has been supported by their marketing focus on value and core. Unit development is also strong with 2017 being the fourth year in a row that the Russia market opened at least 1000 new stores. This success is driven by the utilization of technology-based development strategies, controlled growth through development agreements and new access formats.  In Brazil, same store sales increased 21% for the quarter and 18% for the year, with significant media coverage, value offerings and an operational focus on win on types objectives the market delivered strong results. Brazil also focused on reducing costs and enhancing the supply chain distribution to ensure value products are financially feasible.  Now to the US where we saw increased pressure from competitors on chicken innovation and value in the fourth quarter, with same store sales declining 1% but still finishing the year with our fourth consecutive year of same store sales and traffic growth. While disappointed in our results for the quarter, we are bullish on 2018 with marketing trends around both value and innovation.  We started the year with our valued coronel [ph] and now have our first female coronel [indiscernible] showcasing innovation with our new smoking mountain barbeque flavor. This builds off the other familiar flavor that you\u2019ve already seen such as National Hot and Georgia Gold and gives an exciting and operationally easy way to bring new flavors to existing products.  Additionally, we continue remodeling our asset base with plans to remodel another 600 stores in 2018 resulting in nearly 40% of the asset base being at current image by year end. We are excited about our plan for 2018 and confident that this will be our fifth consecutive year of positive signs for sales growth. Next the Pizza Hut, in the US, same stores sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter demonstrating the strength of our Longlines systems through the transformation agreement and building momentum in the business. Pizza Hut remains committed to ensuring every customer has a hot, fast and reliable experience. The hot experience begins with 145,000 new thermal pouches which deliver your pizza 15\u2070 hotter. The fast experience is enhanced through the 14,000 delivery drivers hired in 2017.  The delivery times are improving and we remain committed to being the employer of choice for delivery drivers. In addition, there are now over 24,000 new car toppers on the road. But the reliable experience is enhanced with key digital features implemented during the fourth quarter through our mobile and online platforms which significantly enhance the user experience.  We are encouraged by initial trends in the hot rewards royalty programs launched in August and are confident our investment in loyalty will pay off in the long run. There is another example of Pizza innovation, we recently announced a partnership with Toyota to bring Pizza Hut to your doors with the driverless vehicle, showcasing innovation and forward thinking at both companies. We are excited about the future for Pizza Hut US and confident our investment in hot, fast and reliable experience will drive positive results. Internationally, we are pleased with the 6% net new unit growth during 2017, opening nearly 500 net new restaurants in the year with strong growth in Asia including Indonesia and India.  Fast casual Pizza is one of the fastest growing segments and we continue to align our delivery centric asset strategy to meet this global trend. The repeatable model for value continues to show success in several of our international markets including Korea, China and the Philippines and we continue to make great strides with our digital and technology ventures to make it easier to get a better pizza in our international markets.  Finally, at Taco Bells, system sales grew 3% excluding the 53rd week with 2% same stores sales growth and 4% net new unit growth in the quarter. A key differentiator for Taco Bell is the ability to innovate and elevate. In the quarter, we showcased the abundant indulgence of our $1 value menu we launched the Blueminatti ad campaign to strategically elevate Taco Bell as a not so secret society where anyone with a buck can unlock 20 satisfying and innovative menu items.  And to highlight our unique ability to drive buzz around new products, we originally launched a movie trailer Web of Fries to introduce you to our new nacho products which were added to the $1 value menu. Served with a dippable side of warm nacho cheese, the bold Mexican [indiscernible] fries are the perfect example of Taco Bell's belief, you shouldn't apologize the value, let's celebrate it.  As further commitment to becoming an easy brand, Taco Bell recently announced all access and initially focused on technology design to make Taco Bell easier for our consumers to access. This includes installing self-servicing kiosks in all of our restaurants by the end of 2019. Delivery initiatives such our newly announced partnership with Grubhub, group vacation offerings and order ahead for scheduled pickup either in store or curve side. We understand the importance of technology and know there is great potential when we make it easy to order Taco Bell.  Taco Bell development remains robust. 2017 was a record setting year for both domestic and international restaurant openings. Internationally we entered 5 new countries and reached a significant milestone with our 400 international Taco Bell restaurants. We continue to see great success in several markets. In Canada, same store sales growth is strong with 11% growth in 2017 making it fourth consecutive years of at least high single digit same store sales growth.  Building on our domestic repeatable model, India introduced new innovation with the successful launch of the naked chicken Taco.  In Brazil we opened 20 units in 15 months. And additionally, we signed development agreements in both Brazil and Spain to open more than 200 restaurants over 10 years in each country. The international growth at Taco Bell is just beginning and has great potential over the long term.  Now moving on to unrivaled culture and talent. I'd like to highlight the recent talent additions we have made specifically to drive distinctive relevant and easy brands. Julie [indiscernible] joins us as Taco Bell U.S. President and is responsible for driving innovation, new store development and a frictionless customer experience through digital and technology initiatives. [indiscernible] joins us as KFC U.S. Chief Marketing Officer responsible for developing and executing innovative marketing strategies as well as the brand's digital initiatives. And additionally [indiscernible] U.S. Chief Brand Officer and is responsible for building the brand with today's consumer overseeing marketing and food innovation teams. We are able to attract these great talents and so many others because of our global iconic brands, growth agenda and world-class culture. I firmly believe our culture is a competitive advantage and we are excited to welcome these leaders to Yum! and are confident they will help drive results throughout our organization.  In summary, the fourth quarter was a strong flow to the year and a hugely forward towards achieving our transformation objectives. The focus on our four key growth capabilities is the strong catalyst behind our successful results.  And now it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. Today I will discuss our 2017 results. 2018 guidance, progress towards our transformation initiatives and two of our forward growth capabilities, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability.  First our 2017 results. I am especially pleased to report, we met or exceeded each component of our guidance. We delivered full year core operating profit growth of 7% despite headwinds from refranchising dilution, lapping a 53rd week and incremental media spend associated with Pizza Hut transformation agreement. Same store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 3% delivered system sales growth of 5% excluding the 53rd week all within guidance.  Before I talk about 2018, I do want to discuss our effective tax rate excluding special items for the fourth quarter and full year. Both rates were lower than anticipated due to the timing of planned repatriation of earnings and the impact of tax reform. The majority of our expected repatriation was backend loaded for the year largely reflecting the timing of international refranchising transactions.  Given that most of our foreign industries have November 30th year end for US tax purposes, any earnings repatriated subsequent to this date will require to be tagged as part of the one-time toll charge included in US tax reform. Our ex-special rates for the fourth quarter and full year were lower than anticipated because they did not include tax on those earnings repatriated after November 30th. Instead that tax was included in the toll charge that is part of our onetime special items charged for US tax reform of $434 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter.  Now looking at 2018, we do not expect any change to the underlying base operating profit growth of high single digits. However, there are several items which will affect our core operating profit growth in 2018.  First, and similar to 2017 we expect operating profit dilution as a result of the timing difference between refranchising restaurants and the associated G&A savings which is consistent with our transformation plans. This is expected to negatively impact operating profit by approximately six to seven percentage points.  Second is the revenue recognition accounting change which is required to be implemented beginning January 1st 2018. It's important to note that this does not reflect any change in our business model, the strength of our brands or our cash flows. It is solely a gap required change adjusting the timing of recognition of upfront fees received from franchisees and incentive payments made to franchisees.  The most significant driver of the change is requiring upfront fees received from franchisees to be amortized over the life of the franchise agreement. Previously upfront fees will recognize in full win received. As a result, and because this is a prospective application, we expect approximately two to three percentage points of negative impact to our operating profit. All in we are forecasting 2018 core operating profits to be about flat. Again, I want to reiterate we continue to expect underlying base operating profit growth to be strong and up high single digits. However, 2018 will be affected by these onetime items I discussed. Next, we expect same store sales growth of 2 to 3% and net new unit growth of 3 to 4% for the system sales growth of 5 to 6% in constant currency. This builds upon our systems sales growth of 4% during 2016, 5% in 2017 and is a step towards achieving our long-term bold goal of 7%.  We anticipate CapEx will be between 200 and $250 million. Note this is a step down from our 2017 CapEx of 318 million and is tracking towards our run rate CapEx of 100 million beginning in 2019. All details of our 2018 guidance can be found on the investor section of our website. Finally, as a result of tax reform we anticipate an ongoing effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 22% compared to our historical rate of mid to upper 20s. While we are able to take advantage of the lower US tax rate, our benefit is somewhat muted by the cap on interest deductibility. The move to a territorial tax system is a positive for us given the high percentage of our taxable income that is earned outside the U.S. but this is largely offset by the impacts of a new tax on global intangible low tax income. Please note that we expect our 2018 tax rate to be slightly below the anticipated range I just provided. This is due to delayed applicability of the new tax on global intangible low tax income as well as a higher amount of interest deductibility in 2018 primarily given refranchising gains which will drive higher U.S. pretax earnings.  Turning now to our transformation initiatives designed to make Yum! brands more focused, more franchise and more efficient to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, the focus on our four key growth capabilities has helped us accelerate net new unit growth and drive sustained positive same store sales growth. This focus is a big reason why we had increased confidence in achieving our long term bold goal of 7% system sales growth. Second, on our journey to becoming more franchised, we sold 896 equity units during the fourth quarter for pretax proceeds of over $1 billion, ending the year at 97% franchise. We remain confident in our ability to reach at least 98% franchise by the end of 2018 and exceed $2 billion in after tax proceeds from our refranchising efforts.  Third, as a more efficient company, we ended the year with G&A excluding special items representing 2% of system sales, on our way to our goal of 1.7%. And as previously mentioned, we continue to expect run-rate CapEx beginning in 2019 of $100 million.  Each of these initiatives are designed to deliver more growth to our shareholders. During 2017, we've repurchased 26.6 million shares for $1.9 billion at an average price of $72.  Additionally, we paid $460 million in dividends for a total capital return of $2.3 billion in 2017. Further we were pleased to announce a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend for 2018 increasing from $0.30 a share to $0.36 a share. We value returning capital to our shareholders and we remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion from 2017 to 2019 through both share repurchases and dividends. After evaluating the impacts of tax reform, revenue recognition and our strategic partnership with Grubhub, we continue to expect that we will deliver at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019. Now, before moving on to our growth drivers, I want to provide you with some details of the investments with Grubhub. Yum! is acquiring $200 million in primary common stock, an investment expected to provide Grubhub with additional liquidity to in part accelerate expansion of its industry leading U.S. delivery network, drive more orders to Yum! restaurants and further enhance the ordering the fulfillment experience for diners, restaurants and drivers. We are excited for this unique partnership which includes having a seat on the Grubhub board of directors and aligns with Yum! long term strategies to make our three brands easier for customers to access.  Next to our growth drivers. We've talked about our four key growth capabilities, fueling our decisions and results and Greg talked to you about two of them. Now I want to provide you with an update on the remaining two. Bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. First, bold restaurant development, during 2017 we opened over 2600 growth units. If you think about it, this means across the globe we open over seven YUM brands restaurants every single day with one new restaurant approximately every three hours. On a net unit basis during 2017, we opened over 1400 restaurants. This is more than 200 additional net new units than last year and nearly 2600 total net new units over the last two years combined. We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that make this happen and commit to continuing this growth.  Next, to unmatched franchise operating capability. At KFC US, the team utilizes a voice of the customer program to measure operational results and better understand guest needs and feedback. The metrics are standardized among participating competitors and since launch in 2014 KFC US has moved from near the bottom to above average on key metrics including overall satisfaction, taste, perception of speed, friendliness and value.  With each of these metrics improving at least 10 percentage points. With the significant improvement can be attributed to the integrated back of house pack lines from the 2015 acceleration agreement with franchisees focus on value with the $5 fill up, $10 chicken share and $20 fill up and technology improvements to aid operations in labor deployment.  Regarding our - metrics at Taco Bell, both customer satisfaction and speed scores improved during our highest growing day part after 5 PM with customer satisfaction scores achieving a record high and up two percentage points over prior year.  Pizza Hut international continues to leverage technology to deliver superior customer experience and is testing GPS tracking of delivery drivers to enhance the customer experience. In markets with GPS tracking, customer satisfaction scores are over 10 percentage points higher. We understand the importance of an exceptional experience at our restaurants and are pleased with these operational improvements.  To summarize, 2017 was the first full year of our transformation journey and we are pleased with the progress made towards our goal while also achieving each components of our guidance for the year. We remain confident in our future and look forward to updating you throughout 2018 as we become a more focused, more franchised and more efficient company delivering more growth to our shareholders.  Now the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from David Palmer, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi thanks this is Eric on for Dave Palmer. Just wanted to touch on development for a second. I think you mentioned 3 or 4%-unit growth is your expectation this year which is an increase from I think 3% in 2017. Do you feel like you have the building blocks in place to accelerate development across your three brands? Maybe if you could touch on any commitments that you\u2019re excited about and then as a follow up to that, how much is the development commitments from refranchising contribute to unit growth this quarter? And how much you expect it to contribute in 2018? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes, well obviously we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making on development as I mentioned the 2600 growth new units is really a record for the last decade or so and in the quarter itself we opened up a net of 732 units compared to the 661 we opened last quarter of 2016. So that\u2019s a quarterly increase of 71 units.  So, you can see we're making progress on the full year numbers, the quarterly numbers. There is momentum behind development. As far as how the refranchising plays into this, we've talked repeatedly about the fact that we're getting development commitments in the refranchising deals, but up until this last quarter, we hadn\u2019t done the majority of our franchising with close to 900 units being refranchised in the fourth quarter. Those all came along with the lot of significant development commitment. So, we're starting to see the benefits of the development commitments creeping in to the numbers that we're reporting, but I still think there is a lot more to come from those development commitments. And because we're typically made over a multiyear period, so we think this sets us up with momentum on the development front for several years to come. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. John Ivankoe : Hi thank you very much. I have a couple of questions I think to relatively small on the Grubhub partnership if I may. And I'll just coming do only one Q3 if you can address small one. Firstly, what percentage of KFC or Taco Bell would currently have Grubhub delivery coverage, in another word how much of the systems could be covered as Grub stands today. Secondly, do you have a plan to point of sale implementation with the Grubhub platform and the point of sales at KFC and Taco Bell?  And then the third point are these starts on the board that certainly very interesting for a lot of different reasons to be on Grubhub. Do you think that there might be a longer-term opportunity to either outsource or perhaps augment your current inhouse delivery to more of an outsourced model with Grub? So, if you don't mind just those three points on the Grubhub partnership. Greg Creed : Let me take the first couple. As you know, in the U.S. we've got a couple of discounts with KFC. So right now, I think by the end of the year, we'll have -- Grubhub will cover probably about 80% of all of the restaurants that could deliver. From a KFC perspective, we're not delivering at the moment, we're just in a couple of test markets with KFC delivery. So, we have a lot of work obviously as we believe those test, expand those test, and start delivering.  I think we've said in the past that we've got close to 1500 Taco Bells already delivering, but this will expand obviously the capability for Taco Bell. So, what we're excited about is both KFC and Taco Bell is really as an opportunity to expand the presence that we've got in the number of stores that we can obviously bring closer to our customer. On the POS system, obviously we're aligning the [indiscernible] systems, that work is obviously underway. It will be critical as a part of making it seems for our customer whether they order of our apps website or the Grubhub apps and website all that work is ongoing.  And I think on the last question was just, already joined the board and what the possibilities are for the Pizza Hut brand as a result of that. And I think that's one where the ongoing conversations about how both Grubhub and Pizza Hub can leverage as a partnership if there are ways to do so. But right now, this is mostly about the Taco Bell KFC relationship with Grubhub. And I would also point out that this isn't just about delivery, it's about the ability to order online to Grubhub and pickup products at our restaurants. And Grubhub and Taco Bell and KFC are working diligently to integrate the POS as you mentioned to make the ordering process very quick to get the orders into the restaurants and to the consumers. And we have certain coverage ratios and targets in our agreements that when we hit them, we\u2019ll really unleash the power of the partnership. John Ivankoe : And is there a timeline for that technological marriage if you will, I think it's just been more difficult for a lot of brands over the past couple of years. I mean do you have, feel like you have an edge on that? David Gibbs : Yeah, certainly that\u2019s a big part of this agreement is having an integrated POS system and yes there all sorts of internal timelines and schedules to get all of this work done. And I think we\u2019ll reveal details as we go on the journey with Grubhub but for today this is all about the announcement and the intention of having this be a really unique partnership with the Board CET investment and what we think is a great partner for us on the technology front. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open. Brian Bittner : Thanks, good morning. I have two questions in like John I\u2019m just going to ask both of them at the same time and then listen to your answers. First, you know you talked about refranchising dilution being in 6 to 7% headwind to operating profits in \u201918 and these falls of headwind from \u201917 and you would said at the beginning of this process that refranchising net of G&A reductions will be neutral in totality. So, is this still your thinking and does that mean that 2019 naturally is a year where all this dilution reverses to accretion? That\u2019s just the first question. The second question is just simple one, on the comp guidance for 2018 how does Taco Bell fit into that comp guidance for overall Yum! just given we see it as difficult comparisons and its operating in a pretty intense US environment. Thanks guys. David Gibbs : Okay on the refranchising question, obviously there is a lot of different factors in how refranchising plays out in or P&L. For example, we\u2019ve gotten ahead of ourselves in terms of selling Pizza Hut which are tend to be lower volume stores and have less dilution and therefore we\u2019ve got a lot more G&A in Pizza Hut as a proportion of their targeted cost.  So now we have higher volume stores to sell Taco Bell and KFC to finish off the refranchising process in 2018 and I think the comment that will this flip to being -- is this still a net new neutral exercise between the G&A and refranchising absolutely. We\u2019ve done all the math on that and they all balance out, but we\u2019ve probably got a little bit more benefits from the organic G&A cuts up until this point. Now there was 900 stores we sold in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll obviously have an impact on our operating profit in 2018.  So, taking all those factors into account, yes, it's still a net neutral math exercise between the refranchising dilution and the G&A savings and as you said 2019 will start to see more benefits of it versus the headwinds that\u2019s presenting for us in 2018. On the comp guidance, as you know we have provided the global comp guidance but we\u2019re not going to break out it by brand but just wanted Taco Bell sales to be there. Greg Creed : Yes, I would just say that I think Taco Bell has been competitive in the competitive market and as we saw with the Blueminatti $1which we just started the year with and as you\u2019ve all seen we have launched nacho fries at a $1. So obviously it\u2019s a competitive marketplace but what I like about the Taco Bell team is they are obviously quick to response to changes in the marketplace and I feel good about what we\u2019ve got on our calendar for 2018. David Gibbs : I just want to go back and clarify one earlier comment, there was a question about coverage with Grubhub, obviously there is two ways Grubhub will be covering our restaurants. One will be through click and collect in the pickup process and we expect that we can get very good coverage on that very quickly once we turn all the systems on. And then there is a different measure for delivery coverage. We have specific measures by brand. We'll share more of that overtime, but I think the 80% is more -- that Greg quoted was more of a general number. But I think we'll give you more specifics on that as we get into the relationships with Grubhub. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. Sara Senatore : Yeah, hi. Thank you. So just a couple of questions please. First is on the tax benefits and all the moving pieces there. You've retained the total amount of expected return to shareholders. And I was just trying to understand if there is any extent to which you're reinvesting some of that tax or benefit or it was sort of contemplated in the initial guidance?  And then I do have a question also just about the Grubhub partnership. We hear from other companies that franchises need to see a certain level of incrementality for these partnerships to work. Is that something that you've worked through from your perspective? It's just interesting for me to see company like Yum! has so much experience with inhouse delivery from Pizza Hut partner in sort of an outsourcing way. So just trying to understand the economics for you in the franchises. Greg Creed : Thanks, Sara. On the tax savings, and the returning to shareholders. As you know, we're in the process of transforming Yum! into a free cash flow machine. So, we don't have any needs on cash that we haven\u2019t been able to meet with our own cash generated. So consistent with the transformation the plan is to return the incremental cash from tax reform to shareholders. On the Grubhub deal, and the franchise economics, we did a thorough process in terms of understanding the economic to franchises, understanding the different options for us. And it was a really important part of this process for us to make sure that we ensured our franchises have good economics. We leveraged our scale and our marketing cloud and what we can bring to our partners. And we think we have a deal, we're not going to go into the commercial terms, and we think we have the deal set up that our franchises will absolutely embrace and it will drive incremental profitability and sales for them. David Gibbs : Yeah, I think in the test markets, we I think have got a couple of test markets going in the moment. Indianapolis, Louisville, [indiscernible] and to an extent I think to Orlando. But I was talking to the restaurant general manager in the test and the good news is that they do believe they are seeing incremental occasions and they do believe they're seeing much higher check. So, I think what delivery promises in these very early test markets, the guys and girls are actually running this on a daily basis are seeing that benefit, we're encouraged by that and we're encouraged by expanding those tests. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Stifel. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you, good morning. I just have a couple of questions. So, first Greg, are you concerned that Grubb having a stronger competitive position with your investment allows more non-Yum! chains to start using delivery which would add delivery competitors for Pizza Hut? Greg Creed : I think that certainly the investment that we\u2019re making at Grub Hub we believe allows them to expand their coverage and obviously expanding their coverage gives more access as David has pointed out to both pick-up and delivery which obviously benefits us. We spend a lot of time obviously on this partnership and I think you know as we said you know we love the management team, we love their business model. We see this as an opportunity for both companies and we\u2019re excited about you know the opportunity for us to use Grub Hub to get our brands easier access to our customers. David Gibbs : And obviously our brands are benefitting Pizza Hut included are benefitting from the consumers embracing delivery, we\u2019re seeing the Pizza Hut delivery business climb as a percentage of the Pizza Hut business. So, we\u2019re excited about delivering for our Taco Bell and KFC brands and very confident in the model that we have with Pizza Hut with today being one that can benefit from this change in consumer's taste. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you and then David how many -- I may have missed this, but how many development commitments came with the stores that were refranchised during the fourth quarter? David Gibbs : That\u2019s not a number that we\u2019re going to start to get into reveal other than to say it varies by deal, some deals where we have lot of development opportunities, obviously we attach a lot more commitments to it, other deals where they\u2019re in mature market and fully penetrated you can imagine we put less in. And our experience with the development commitments is that you don\u2019t get a 100% follow through on every single one of them. So, I don\u2019t want to start releasing numbers and then having to revise them constantly. But it\u2019s a sizeable amount, these isn\u2019t just a few commitments, these are very significant commitments to building stores typically over the next three to five years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line if Geoffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. Parekh Patel : Hi, this is Parekh Patel on for Jeff. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of questions have been asked about, corporate tax reforms but if I could just shift to the standpoint of the consumer, wondering if you guys had done any research or analysis in the past in instances where consumers saw a significant increase to disposable income, be it from past tax rate benefits or maybe the lower gas prices we saw a couple of years ago or maybe, just any color you might have would be helpful? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes, we haven\u2019t done any specific research around the tax reform but I think as you said in the past with lower gas prices the people have more disposable income in their pockets. They tend to spend it, so I think anything that ends up with people having more money in their pockets is a good thing. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jason West : Okay, sorry. Yeah, just going back to the guidance, it sounds like excluding the revenue rec changes that are 2 to 3% increase in EBIT embedded which is a little lower than the guide for \u201917. Just want to clarify I mean is that primarily because like you said that the brands that are being refranchised or is there anything else kind of changing in your view in terms of the \u201918 growth rate in the business. Greg Creed : Well I\u2019ll walk you through the guidance again on operating profit. The refranchising headwinds are about six to seven points, revenue recognition is hitting us for 2 to 3 points, so that together those things are 8 to 10 points of headwinds. We actually get a little bit of a benefit from lapping the Pizza Hut and KFC transformation agreements year-over-year '17 to '18. So, you can see how that 8 to 10 effectively ends up being high-single digits with what we've been very consistent on for the transformed Yum1 growth model. Jason West : Okay. So that refranchising headwind would have been a little less maybe in '17 than 6 to 7 is that fair? Greg Creed : Exactly, that's fair. Exactly. Jason West : Okay. and then the last thing. Greg Creed : Just to clarify, we outlined the headwinds from refranchising dilution in our 2017 guidance. And we've talked about that as in terms of percentage points, and that was 1 to 2 points of headwinds. So that should give you the walk. 1 to 2 in '17 versus the 6 to 7 in '18. Jason West : Okay that make sense. And then just for our knowledge, can you explain again the tax issue with the intangibles that you mentioned and how that sort of holds back you're the downside I guess on your tax rate. And is that a cash issue or is that really a non-cash type item? Greg Creed : It is a cash issue. And obviously it's a part of the tax cut that's fairly complex. And some people have talked about a little bit. but essentially, it's designed for income that you have offshore that is not coming from tangible assets, it's coming from intangible assets. And it's an offset to the benefits we get from the territorial tax system. We're obviously digging into all of this trying to better understand and as I mentioned it will have delayed applicability to us because a lot of our international entity tax years. so, we'll have more to share on that as we go forward. David Gibbs : Alright. Thank you very much everyone for joining us, and with that I'll turn it back over to Greg. Greg Creed : Yeah thanks Dave. So, thank you all for joining us on the call today, I appreciate it. I think in summary, I'd say that Q4 was a solid finish of the strong year. We've made great progress on our transformation. I think the keys of the underlying growth remains strong in the business. We're obviously very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub. And that's all to ensure that we are distinct, relevant and easy. Thanks for joining us everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Brands delivered first quarter system sales growth of 4% in constant currency, including 1% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth for the first quarter was flat, and we are maintaining all aspects of our full year 2018 guidance. As a reminder, our full year core operating profit guidance of approximately flat includes 6 to 7 percentage points of headwind from the timing impact of refranchising and associated G&A savings, along with 2 to 3 percentage points of headwind from the revenue recognition accounting standard. Regarding our transformation initiatives, this quarter marks the start of the second full year of our transformation journey. And I am pleased to report we remain on track with our efforts to ensure Yum! is a more focused, more franchised and more efficient company. We've discussed that part of this transformation journey is to accelerate growth by focusing on four key drivers : distinctive, relevant and easy brands; unmatched franchise operating capability; bold restaurant developments; and unrivaled culture and talent. I'll talk to you about distinctive, relevant and easy brand and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will follow up with unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development. I'll begin with some examples of how our brands are becoming more distinctive, relevant and easy. At KFC, system sales grew 6% with same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 4%. Internationally, same-store sales grew 2%. The executive leadership team and I recently traveled to Russia and Turkey. And I was impressed with the strong leadership and powerful in-store culture in both countries. Turkey, with first quarter same-store sales growth of 10% and a two year stack of 27%, has embraced the idea of building sales overnight and brand over time by going back to the basics and executing them well. Our local franchisees have invested in their team members, ensuring they are properly trained and designed the menu to drive velocity around core menu items. Turkey also has had some great new unit growth, opening 23 gross units over the last 12 months. In India, first quarter same-store sales growth grew 10%, marking their eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. India's success is supported by their focus on three key occasions : snacking; weekend groups; and delivery. In addition, by using both digital and TV to advertise value, the market has grown transactions. And like Turkey, India has also growth their assets base, opening 50 gross new units over the last 12 months. These two markets are examples of why we continue to believe KFC has significant runway for growth. In the U.S., with flat same-store sales growth in the first quarter, our first female Colonel, Reba McEntire, introduced consumers to Smoky Mountain Barbecue, an innovative flavor profile added to our extra crispy chicken. The innovation has continued into the second quarter with the launch of our new sandwich platform, the Crispy Colonel, which gives customers the option of enjoying a classic version of the sandwich or adding our delicious flavor profiles including Nashville Hot, Georgia Gold and Smoky Mountain Barbecue to the Extra Crispy fillet. We are excited about these new and innovative offerings and believe they are what we need to successfully sustain our long-term momentum and drive this business forward. Before I wrap-up KFC, I want to address our UK business, which suffered a setback this quarter as a result of disruptions in supply when we changed distribution partners. Despite the challenges, the team worked with our new partners, leveraged our culture and rose to the occasion, truly all hands on deck, working around the clock and countless hours to correct the issue, even responding with clever advertising in the brand's unique voice. I would like to take a second to say thank you to our franchisees and our local team, as our progress to-date could not have been accomplished without their collaborative spirit and hard work. Encouragingly, the customers are responding to our efforts in a very positive manner. As of today, all 871 restaurants are open for their normal hours. Approximately one-third of the restaurants are up and running with the former supplier and the remaining two-thirds of the restaurants are successfully receiving product from the new supplier. As we recover from the incident, clearly, we are applying our lessons learned to ensure this does not happen anywhere else in the world. Now to Pizza Hut, in the U.S., system sales grew 2%, with same-store sales growth of 4%. While net new units declined 2% compared to prior year, encouragingly, unit development was flat sequentially. Consistent with what I've said before, the turnaround of the brand in the U.S. will be a gradual build. However, we continue to see positive momentum as a result of the Transformation Agreement and focus on being hot, fast and reliable. Our investment in digital, operations, advertising and delivery drivers, is paying off with improvements in internal operating metrics, including online conversion and delivery times. In February, we announced we are now the official sponsor of the NFL and we are proud of the way the team has kicked off this partnership at last week's draft. In tandem with being the official sponsor of the NCAA, Pizza Hut now owns the full weekend from Thursday to Monday, providing us even more opportunity to put the fan at the center of everything we are doing. At Pizza Hut International, system sales grew 2% as a result of continued strong net new unit growth of 5%. Our solid unit growth has resulted from the benefit of the division realignment we undertook several years ago, resulting in dedicated brand leadership teams as well as new partners who possess our three Cs of a healthy franchisee, being capable, capitalized and committed. For these reasons, we remain confident unit growth will sustain a healthy rate. That said, Pizza Hut is a global iconic brand, and the recent same-store sales results are simply not acceptable. While we are seeing pockets of strength, such as seven consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth in India, we understand we have a lot of work to do to turn sales around. Specifically, we are taking the following three steps in each of our markets. First is ensuring we have strong operations and digital execution in place to deliver on speed, taste and ease. Second is making sure we are offering compelling value. And third is consistent communication of our For The Love of Pizza brand positioning. We are diligently working to implement these steps at each of our international markets and will update you as we progress. Now to Taco Bell, where system sales grew 4%, with 1% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. In the U.S., we successfully lapped an 8% same-store sales growth in the first quarter of last year, due in large part to the very successful launch of Nacho Fries. Everything about this product was innovative, from the Web of Fries faux movie trailer to the Mexican seasoning and Nacho Cheese sauce. Even better, customers could enjoy our praiseworthy Nacho Fries for only $1. Selling more than 53 million orders in the first five weeks, Fries were part of one of every four customer's orders. And as a result of this success, we extended their limited-time offering into April. Following Fries in the second quarter is the $1 Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos, featuring our seasoned beef alongside melted cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack cheese, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla or over crispy nachos. These products are another example of delivering value without compromise, a delicious offering for only $1. Internationally, we are seeing great momentum and are on plan to set a record for the number of net new unit openings. I recently visited my hometown of Brisbane, also home to the first Taco Bell in Australia, and I'm excited to see the restaurant is off to a flying start. The franchisee is very encouraged by this success and is planning to aggressively expand in the country, making Australia a market to watch for future growth. In addition, we continue to see success in our other priority markets through rapid expansion in Brazil, innovative menu items in Canada and the launch of U.S. innovations in India. And we are wrapping up our first international owners forum in the UK, bringing together global Taco Bell leadership and franchisees to share best practices from across the world, leveraging our scale. I'm excited for the potential of this brand internationally and know we are taking the right steps to move the brand forward. Lastly, as part of making our brands distinctive, relevant and easy, I'd like to provide you with an update on our partnership with Grubhub. We remain very enthusiastic about our opportunity with Grubhub. And I'm even more pleased that our franchisees are fully supportive and excited about their potential with delivery through Grubhub. One of the unique aspects of the agreement is to have the POS at all KFC and Taco Bell restaurants fully integrated with Grubhub, which will significantly aid the accuracy of the order and the speed of delivery. As our teams work to complete this integration, we are testing with Grubhub in a few select KFC and Taco Bell markets and are encouraged by initial results. We look forward to updating you more as the integration is completed and Grubhub is available nationwide. Now, moving on to unrivaled culture and talent, I strongly believe that our unrivaled culture and talent fuels our results, that our employees must reflect the global marketplace where we operate. That's why we've made a commitment to advance more women into leadership and achieve greater gender parity in senior leadership globally by 2030. This new commitment aligns with the Paradigm for Parity coalition, a movement of Fortune 500 CEOs, senior business leaders and academics who are committed to achieving a new norm in corporate leadership, one in which women and men have equal power, status and opportunity. It also builds upon Yum! Brands becoming one of more than 100 companies in 10 sectors named to the inaugural 2018 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, where Yum! was recognized and measured for gender equality across internal company statistics, employee policies, external community support and engagement, and gender-conscious product offerings. I'm very proud of our initiatives around a diverse and inclusive work environment and know this enhances Yum! as a great place to work. In summary, the second full year of our transformation journey is well underway. And I'm pleased with our progress towards delivering A World with More Yum! I remain confident in our four growth drivers as we lay the foundation for long-term growth that results in increased returns for our shareholders. And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss : our first quarter results; progress towards our transformation initiatives; and two of our four growth capabilities, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capabilities. To begin, our first quarter results, consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth was flat as a result of headwinds related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings and the revenue recognition accounting standard. As Greg mentioned, we remain confident in achieving all aspects of our full year 2018 guidance. This includes approximately flat core operating profit growth, which incorporates headwinds of 6 to 7 percentage points related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings, and 2 to 3 percentage points related to the revenue recognition accounting standard. To clarify, the level of unit openings is typically higher in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we anticipate the impact of the revenue recognition accounting standard to be more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. First quarter EPS, excluding Special Items, was $0.90, an increase of $0.25. Included in this is $0.16 related to our recently-closed investment in Grubhub. Accounting rules require that we begin reflecting the change in fair value of this investment beginning in the quarter of the deal announcement. And, as a result, we booked $66 million of pre-tax investment income in the first quarter. Note that our commitment to at least $3.75 in 2019 EPS was made prior to the Grubhub investment and our target will continue to exclude any impact to EPS as a result of our quarterly mark-to-market adjustments. Also impacting our first quarter EPS was our effective tax rate excluding Special Items of 14%. This was lower than our expected rate for the full year due to the timing of stock option exercises. First quarter same-store sales growth of 1% at Yum! and 2% at KFC were impacted by the supply interruptions in our KFC UK business. Adjusting for the impact of this, we estimate Yum!'s same-store sales growth would have been 2% and KFC's same-store sales growth would have been 3%. Additionally, we estimate an approximately 3% impact to Yum!'s core operating profit and an approximately 5% impact to KFC's core operating profit in the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, our local management team and franchisees collaborated and worked tirelessly to get us back on track. And our customers are responding positively as the business continues to recover. The impact of full-year same-store sales growth is estimated to be 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for Yum! The impact to full-year core operating profit growth is estimated to be 2% for KFC and 1% for Yum! While this is a significant event for our UK market and we are collaborating with our franchise partners to ensure they are set up for success, the limited impact to Yum! demonstrates the power of the franchise model diversified across brands and geographies. As such, we are maintaining our full year guidance, despite the UK supply disruption. Now, turning to our transformation initiatives, where we remain on track to deliver the key components of our strategy of : at least 98% franchise mix; approximately $100 million in run rate CapEx in 2019; reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales; and 2019 EPS of at least $3.75. On our journey to achieving at least 98% franchise mix by the end of this year, we refranchised 144 units during the first quarter, including 52 KFC, 43 Pizza Hut and 49 Taco Bell restaurants for current franchise mix of 97% and pre-tax proceeds of $205 million. As part of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $528 million at an average price of $81. Further, we paid $120 million in dividends at $0.36 per share. Total capital returned was $647 million during the first quarter and nearly $3 billion since the beginning of 2017. We remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion from 2017 to 2019. I'm also excited to share some good news regarding the financial markets' continued support of our business transformations and capital market strategies. In April, we successfully re-priced our $1.97 billion Term Loan B, which reduces the interest rate by 25 basis points to LIBOR plus 1.75% and is expected to reduce annual cash interest by approximately $5 million. I'm pleased with the enhancements we are making to our capital structure to further support our target of 5 times EBITDA leverage. Next, I'd like to discuss two of our four key growth drivers. First, bold restaurant development; at KFC in the U.S., we have remodeled nearly 1,000 restaurants over the last two years, or approximately 25% of the asset base, and remain on pace to make the new American Showman the most prevalent image for KFC in the U.S. by the end of the year. At Pizza Hut International, we achieved strong net new unit growth of 5%, as Greg previously mentioned. At Pizza Hut U.S., we had flat unit development during the quarter, as we improve on our last three years of unit decline. Taco Bell continues to grow their units through new asset formats, including the urban walk-in asset and the cantina subset of this, which serves alcohol. The most recent opening in Brooklyn represents our 24th urban walk-in asset and we are excited to see franchisees investing in this asset format. Internationally, Taco Bell opened 11 units this quarter in markets such as Latin America, Japan and the UK. All-in, during the first quarter, we opened 500 gross units and 239 net new units, representing a step-up in development from our recent historical rates in the first quarter. We are on track for 2018 to be the third consecutive year with a significant ramp-up in the pace of development. We have a growth mindset and are confident there is significant white space for each of our brands through new asset formats in the U.S. and untapped geographies internationally, which will drive net new unit growth over the long-term. Our next growth driver is unmatched franchise operating capability. Greg and I recently attended the KFC U.S. Franchise Convention and could feel the sense of pride these franchisees have for their restaurants. They are the ones making the culture come alive in their restaurants. And it is this culture which translates into a positive customer experience and fuels our results. In our Pizza Hut U.S. business, nearly 2,000 stores have changed hands in the last 18 months. This means over one-third of the U.S. traditional restaurants are under new leadership, possessing the three Cs of being a Yum! Franchisee: capable, capitalized and committed. We are confident that, in conjunction with our existing franchisees, we have leaders that are capable of running great restaurants, capitalized to ensure the brand grows, and committed to the brand's strategic objectives. Last quarter, I highlighted the operational improvements at Taco Bell during our highest growing daypart, after 5 :00 p.m. And I'm pleased that customer satisfaction scores further improved over the last quarter, while maintaining speed during the launch of Nacho Fries. To continue the momentum through summer, Taco Bell has developed a unique after dark program focused on fostering a culture of speed while maximizing satisfaction and delivering world-class service, targeting dinner and late-night peaks. In conclusion, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the progress we continue to make on implementing our strategic transformation. First quarter underlying base operating profit was solid and core operating profit adjusted for the timing mismatch between refranchising and associated G&A savings and the revenue recognition accounting standard, was as expected. I'm confident we are taking the right steps to optimize shareholder value and our disciplined decisions will set us up for strength in the near and long-term. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : . Your first question comes from Matt McGinley of Evercore SI (sic) [ISI]. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Thank you. My first question is on the core operating profit. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Matt, we're just trying to get the volume up a little bit. Hang on. Okay, try again. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Okay my question \u2013 can you hear me now? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Okay, great. So my question on the core operating profit is for the year, you expected that to be flat overall. You were flat in the first quarter, despite what you called out as a 3 point headwind from the UK. And I would think that as the year progresses, that you would get more of that G&A reduction in the back half. Other than that revenue recognition change that you'll have, that will probably more negatively impact you in the fourth quarter, what gets worse from a run rate perspective as the year progresses? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: This is David. Let me give you a little sense for how the cadence of operating profit will work during the year, as we get to that flat guidance for the full year. The second quarter will probably be our weakest quarter of the year, as we expect to report negative core operating profit. I would point out that we're lapping in the second quarter $9 million worth of one-time benefits at KFC, which we called out during last year's second quarter call. So those one-timers are part of the lap and, obviously, present some headwind. We also have the refranchising impact and the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement spend contributing to that being a tougher quarter lap. And we expect the quarters to get better as the year goes on. When we get to the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping actually the Pizza Hut transformation spend of $15 million in the fourth quarter of last year, so that presents a tailwind for us in terms of reported operating profit growth. And we're also lapping, you guys will remember from fourth quarter last year, that we refranchised close to 900 units. So that will be taking a toll on us before we get to the fourth quarter, but once we get to lapping it, we will, obviously, won't have as much of a headwind from that. And then to your point about G&A, it's not as if the G&A reductions build so that they're much bigger in any one quarter. We think that they will occur mostly pro rata during the course of the year, but the G&A obviously is a little bit of a tailwind to the year, but unfortunately more than offset by the impact from refranchising. So that's basically how you build the year to flat. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Thanks for that. And then on the KFC system sales in the UK, and I think I understand the issues that you had there, but are you fully moved past those issues or is there some residual issues you have from a customer standpoint that when you have those closures or the inability to supply product, that the customers don't come back immediately? Just kind of curious if you're fully moved on from those issues or if this is still a sort of a residual impact into the second quarter. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: No. Obviously, the challenges are to make sure we have full supply in the restaurants and that we ensure that we can get supply there on a timely basis. We're mostly past that and mostly back up and running. But out of an abundance of caution, we're waiting until we're 100% confident before we turn the media back on. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's a key point. Yes, we ran, I thought, a rather clever ad when we were in the middle of the crisis but, obviously, we stopped advertising while we didn't have supply. So I think we're excited to get all 871 restaurants back and we'll be excited to turn on the marketing machine. I think we'll get a very good response from the customer, who realizes this was a distribution issue. And I think we're going to get a lot of support when we turn the marketing machine back on. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. So the marketing should turn on later in the month. Obviously, the impact of the event was being felt in the first quarter, which we've reported on. And we will see some continued impact into the second quarter as well, also contributing to the second quarter being the worst quarter of the year, most likely. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. On the Pizza Hut International comp decline, first, how much of that was simply due to the China results, which we saw last night, or is it a broader issue, or maybe you could just talk about the markets where you're seeing that and what the specific issues are? And is this a dine-in versus delivery? Is there any kind of way to look at it on those two dimensions strength versus weakness? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: On the actual numbers, I think if you back out China, it's closer to flat for International, but I'll let Greg comment on it. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. I think if you look at the numbers and you broke out dine-in versus delivery, the delivery numbers are stronger, obviously, than the dine-in numbers. And, John, it's like everything. When we get value right, when we get product right and we get it hot and fast, we do very well. So I think, as I alluded to in my presentation, we've got three specific actions we're taking. We're going to take those with the markets that need to and, obviously, we're confident that that will improve our performance in same-store sales growth in Pizza Hut International. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just on the UK, is there some sort of recovery that's available to you? Did you put that into your forecast or would that be upside if there was insurance recovery or some other benefit that you might get from this from the distributor or some other source, insurance company, for example? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Obviously, yes. The parties that were responsible, we've been in discussions with them. And we've reached a settlement. We can't really go into any details on that, but that is baked into our numbers. And that's why, as Greg mentioned in his speech, we think we've helped the franchisees get through this to the point where we can get the business back on track very quickly and get everybody back to a healthy situation. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Morning. Thanks for the question. Could you provide a bit more detail on what you're seeing from all the recently-launched initiatives in place at Pizza Hut in the U.S.? I know early stages, but just thinking about loyalty, the thermal pouch, new app, increased marketing spend, Greg, I know you talked about improvements in internal metrics and, obviously, very solid one year trends, but anything else on customer satisfaction metrics, what the franchisees are telling you just as we think about assessing the continued pace of the turnaround? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure, Dennis. I think, as you said, obviously, loyalty numbers are growing. We just added more cheese to the pizza, so we're improving the product. Our conversion numbers definitely improved in the quarter. Our speed improved during the quarter. So I think all the things that we're doing, hiring delivery drivers, the hot pouches. So the food is hotter. It's getting there faster. Conversion is stronger. So that's what we're seeing across all of our metrics. And what's interesting is, as David alluded to, that 2,000 restaurants have changed hands. What we're seeing with some of these new franchisees is some of our new franchisees are actually delivering the best operating metrics. So we're encouraged that as these new franchisees come on board, embrace the strategy and the tactics that Artie's putting in place, that we're actually seeing these new franchisees jump to the top of the operating metric performance. Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris O'Cull of Stifel. Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I know you mentioned that KFC and Taco Bell's point-of-sale system will be fully integrated with Grub's. Does this mean the company will have access to the customer data from the Grub orders? And will this integration allow you guys to communicate back to the Grub customers with ordering updates, incentive offers, rewards et cetera? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Obviously, as part of the deal with Grub, we have access to the data. I mean the sense of data is keen about our customers, so we'll have access to -- the Taco Bell customers will have access to the Taco Bell and the KFC will have access to KFC. So I think, obviously, having access to that data is critical. The teams are focused now on integration. And then, I think what you'll see \u2013 and the third thing, and David alluded to it is, both David and I were at both the KFC and Taco Bell franchise conventions in Q1, which Grubhub presented at both of those conventions. And the response was very positive to the presentations and I think very positive to the long-term relationship we're going to have with Grubhub. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. When your global franchise ownership mix reaches that 98% or so roughly, I guess, over the next coming quarters, where do you expect that consolidated restaurant level margin run rate to settle versus where it is today? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. I think on margin, we've been very consistent in saying that the margin can be misleading now, because we own so few company stores. We're at 97% today, so 98% is not that far away. I think we're at 1,345 company units on our journey to get below 1,000. So, for example, Pizza Hut margin is only represented by 100 stores. We've got over 16,000 stores in the Pizza Hut system; 100 stores don't represent margin at all. And we're very committed to having this model where we own stores to learn, so we'll do testing in those company stores that may depress margins, and that doesn't bother us at all. We may own stores in a few markets where we're trying to make market entry. And we want to show our franchise partners that we'll put our capital out in front and invest in those stores to spur development by then. So I wouldn't give a forecast of where our company margins are going to be, nor would I get too focused on them as they become such a small subset of the overall system. They really don't represent the performance of the business. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And you just touched on it, but of those few hundred-plus units left to refranchise, any color as to where we should expect that refranchising to take place across the divisions? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, obviously, with Pizza Hut down to 100, there's not a lot more left to refranchise there, so, yeah, I can tell you it would be the remaining Taco Bell and KFC brands. But, as you can imagine, we also don't reveal the plans for where we're going to refranchise. Deals fall apart. Deals come together. We want to give ourselves all the flexibility to get to the number the right way. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. I think, as David said, we remain really confident that we will get to the 98% and own less than 1,000 restaurants by the end of this year. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Great, thank you. You guys are obviously seeing some correlation across disparate Pizza Hut International markets, at least that's what it sounds like in your prepared remarks and also what we can see in some of the tables in your press release. So, I guess, is there anything that's changing in early 2018? And I know you did make the point that delivery is outperforming dine-in, but hopefully we can go a little bit deeper into that. Firstly, were there any lessons learned from the U.S., especially with dine-in and delivery being two different models that have now converged together, that we can apply to the various international markets? And secondly, if you can remind us what percent of stores internationally currently offer delivery? And can that percent materially tick-up as a way to offset the weaker dine-in sales? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay. Well, I'll address the first one, which is what we are learning from the U.S. that we can take internationally. Great value, clearly, I think for all brands and most markets, value remains an imperative and we're obviously focused on that. So great value, great product, in the U.S., we've just announced we're putting more cheese on our products that not only makes it taste better, it also delivers the product hotter because, obviously, more cheese keeps the heat, plus the new pouches. And then I think making sure that we're hot and on time. So I think it's really about just executing the fundamentals and making sure that each of the markets has great value, has a great product and is executing hot and fast. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. As far as the percentage of stores offering delivery, internationally, it's 60%. And just as more color on Pizza Hut, internationally, the Pizza Hut dine-in stores are actually mostly in generally pretty good shape. And we have a lot of markets where the dine-in business is healthy, in contrast to the U. S. So it's not a perfect analogy between what's going on in the U.S. And Pizza Hut, more than our other brands, really does tend to be unique market-to-market, where it's been built up as a delivery brand in one market, a dine-in brand in another, a higher-end dine-in brand in some markets, a more family dining in another. So it's a little bit more complex in terms of how we take learnings from one market to another. However, we think there's a lot of learnings on the digital side. Pizza Hut, with, obviously, many billions of dollars of digital sales in the U.S., is working closely with our international team to take those learnings and make sure we have the best digital experience around the world, as another example of where we're sharing know-how. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And that follow up, I mean, can that 60% be materially higher in terms of stores that offer delivery? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. In fact, as we move forward with Pizza Hut internationally, the Pizza Hut team has done a really nice job of developing what they call their fast casual Delco model or Super Delco. It goes by a number of different names, which has a dine-in component, but also is set up to do delivery the right way. A big part of this is just getting all of our assets to have a back-of-house that has delivery capability. That's a challenge we still face in the U.S. and that we continue to face internationally. And we know that the more we can lean in on delivery, the better set up for long-term success, the better delivery is doing today, as Greg mentioned. So a big part of this strategy is delivery and digital-centric internationally. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Just a question on the Taco Bell margins, and I know the company stores are not a big piece of the base right now, but a little bit softer this quarter. How much of that was due to the Nacho Fries? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure. As you mentioned, we had great margins at Taco Bell but softer on a comparison basis. The launch of Fries was definitely a factor in that. I think the team did the right thing and made sure we staffed up as we launched the product and learned about how we can best operationalize it. And so, that was a big factor in some of the margin impact. We also had a little impact from refranchising. And then I would remind you that all quarter long, we were on air with dollar value. So we had a number of things pressuring margin a little bit, but still all-in-all in the context of our margins and our long-term guidance, good margins. Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, got it. Thanks. And then, Greg, just how do you think digital ordering plays out over the long-term from a consumer perspective? As a consumer, am I going to have three or four brand apps on my phone? Am I going to have one order aggregation app? I'm just curious what you think the consumer-facing side or mobile device side of the equation will be in a couple years? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think, first of all, there will be more, obviously, mobile ordering. What's interesting, I was actually at somewhere the other day and I have this bad habit now of looking at people's front page of their phones. And I saw the Pizza Hut app on a lot of phones, right? So I think having got in early with Pizza Hut, I think you'll find the same with Taco Bell and I think we'll also do the same as we get through Grubhub and do business that way. So I do think orders on mobile will grow. I do think people will have potentially more than one or two apps. They're not going to put every brand that's out there. And I think that's just another reason to make your brand relevant, distinctive, and easy, because I think the brands that offer relevance to the customer, are distinctive in the customers' mind and make it easy to order, easy to pay, easy to get, will be the ones that will either see their app as front page apps. Operator : Your next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on Taco Bell and then a question about Grub, please. So, on Taco Bell, you mentioned how successful Nacho Fries were. And I think we had read that stronger even than Doritos Locos, perhaps, at the launch. So, I guess I was a bit surprised comps weren't a bit stronger. Granted, you're lapping an 8% compare, but could you talk about maybe was it just check compression from the dollar menu and the value push or to what extent was that just a function of a difficult comparison versus a daypart or a menu segment maybe not working as well? And then, I do have another question, please. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure. Well I think the good news is 25% incidence, a quarter of the orders going out with Fries was great. Obviously, 8% was a tough number to lap, given what's going on in the marketplace. We were happy that we lapped with a plus 1%. Obviously, $1 Fries, part of it is the fact that they're $1, which also helped the business and helped drive incidence. And I think what we like, what we saw was a lot of it was incremental. So I think that, obviously, probably helped check. It did help check in the quarter. I think the good news is that we're not a one-trick pony when it comes to value. We've got now the Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos in Q2, so we've got a lot of I think \u2013 I'm not sure tricks is the right word. We've got a lot of really smart plays around value. And I believe that we will continue to do very well in this very tough marketplace with a brand like Taco Bell. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then, just the follow-up was on Grubhub. Can you just talk a little bit about the decision to make an investment versus just doing these things through some kind of partnership? Because I know we heard last night from Yum China that they are actually trying to shift more of their ordering to their own platform and a little bit away from aggregators. So I'm just trying to contextualize that in terms of global trends and, again, a decision to sort of tie a partnership closer than just having some sort of contractual agreement. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, obviously, with the pickup in business going to aggregators, this is an opportunity in the industry for us. And we just thought, given our scale and all the knowledge we have about delivery through the Pizza Hut brand, that we had a lot to offer to an aggregator partner. And that's why we wanted to \u2013 but, at the same time, we also wanted to have a front seat with what we think is the best run aggregator and understand their business model and how we could best utilize it and partner together to grow both of our businesses. So the investment was part and parcel to getting a board seat at Grubhub and we thought it was the right thing to do. Obviously, we're pleased the stock has responded positively and that our investment is up. But it really was more about getting a seat on the board of directors and having a different kind of partnership, other than just commercial terms. We want this to be a partnership where we share more knowledge between the two companies at a deeper level. We're actually planning on going up to visit with them with our senior team in a couple of months, things you wouldn't do if you just had commercial terms between two entities. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I also think that our investment enables Grubhub to expand to gain national distribution quicker. So I think they spoke about they are actually getting into penetrating more markets more quickly. So we like the fact that our money could be directed to helping them do that, because, obviously, the broader the presence of Grubhub, the better it is for us once we get the integration complete. So I think it's a really good partnership. I think it was a great investment. I think it's great to have the board seat. And I think you will see great things come from this, once we get the integration complete, we put the marketing effort behind it and Grubhub expands their national distribution. I think this is all upside for both parties. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen & Company. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. On the upcoming Taco Bell after dark initiative, how does this tie in to the Grubhub partnership, which presumably should benefit you most at late night? And will the after dark initiative be customer-facing with opportunities to layer in Grubhub marketing to the initiative as you go through the summer? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, I think there is two things going on. First of all, one is operationally what David was talking about was I think applying the focus that we apply to other dayparts to obviously dinner and late night. We do believe there's a huge amount of upside. I think for competitive reasons, we don't want to give too much away on what we're doing after dark from a consumer-facing perspective. That would be not in our best interest, so I'll refrain from that. But I just want to let you know that we are going to \u2013 or the operators will put additional focus on our customer service, our speed of service, our accuracy and all of those key operating metrics for both dinner and late night as we go through the summer. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Next question, please. This will be our last question. Operator : Your final question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. My question's on the unit development, which seems to be picking up momentum. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on your thoughts on how you get to that level of unit growth that's needed to deliver your goal of 7% system sales growth? And in particular, whether your confidence in getting there has changed following a lot of these refranchising transactions you've completed. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes. I think our confidence is increasing in unit development as we start to put some results up on the board. We mentioned that we had 239 net new units open in the first quarter of 2018. That compares to about 100 less last year so that's 100 unit pickup, about half coming from China, which reported yesterday. And some of you may have noted they took their unit guidance up. They also commented on the great cash paybacks they're getting on KFC and Pizza Hut. So that's all very positive when one of our largest developers is taking their guidance up. We're seeing the actual numbers increase. And then to your point about the refranchising, as I think we've mentioned in some other calls, we've used the refranchising as an opportunity to make sure we pick well-capitalized franchisees that are committed to growth and then have development agreements typically as part of those refranchising deals. So our pipeline, as we get more and more of the refranchising done, our pipeline for new unit development is building up with these Development Agreements being put in place. So, yeah, we're really excited. We had a step-up in development in 2017, which you guys would have noted, a couple hundred units versus 2016. We're looking to do the same thing in 2018. And we're certainly not stopping there. We think this is an important part of the journey to get to 7% is getting a more reliable contribution from development at a higher number than we have in the past. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And, David, if I could just follow up on that, do you think with these refranchising transactions that take a little bit of time for that pipeline to build, I would assume, and do you think we'll see a bigger inflection in 2019 and 2020 than what we've seen last year and this year or is it more going to be a kind of a gradual ramp up? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Maybe as we get to the end of the year, we might start talking about guidance for future years. Certainly it's our hope that we keep ramping up development, but one thing to note is that as we've done the refranchising in the markets where we have equity stores, we've continued to build up our own equity pipeline and then we hand that pipeline to the franchisees. So we didn't want to have the situation where somebody would buy a market and there would be no development at that point in time. So we've tried to avoid any lulls in development caused by the hand-off of units. But certainly very optimistic about development. It's an area that we're leaning in hard and really proud of the work that the teams in the field are doing to build a stronger and stronger pipeline. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay. So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. I guess just a few thoughts in closing. I think a solid start to the year, after adjusting for the impact of KFC UK. It's clear we need to stay focused on making the brands more relevant, distinct and easy to drive even stronger same-store sales performance. And as suggested, we're obviously pleased with the strongest net new unit openings in Q1 in recent history. Thanks, again, and we look forward to speaking to you in August.

Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Athania, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Mr. Keith Siegner, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Strategy and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Athania. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are : Greg Creed, our CEO; David Gibbs, our President and CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from Greg and David, we'll open the call to questions. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands' website, www.yum.com, to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that maybe used on today's call. Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today's call. First, system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and Special Items. Third, the revenue recognition accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1. As a reminder, this is a GAAP required change adjusting the timing of recognition of upfront fees received from and incentive payments made to franchisees, the effects of which have no impact on cash. In addition, it requires the gross-up of revenues and offsetting expenses of advertising funds we consolidate within our income statement. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. Please note also, analysts, limit yourself to one question and one question only. Thank you. We'd like to make you aware of the following changes in upcoming Yum! investor events. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the second quarter Form 10-Q filing. Third quarter earnings will be released on October 31, 2018, with the conference call on the same day. The remainder of our 2018 key earnings dates are available on our website. Finally, save the date for the Yum! Brands Investor and Analyst Day to be held on Wednesday, December 5, 2018. We will provide greater details as we get closer to the date. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. System sales growth for the second quarter was 4%, with 1% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. As we discussed on our earnings call last quarter, four items were expected to weigh on our second quarter core operating profit results. These included the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising, the revenue recognition accounting standard change, the KFC distributor disruption in the UK and the lap of some one-time benefits at KFC. As a result, and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, core operating profit declined 6%. We are reiterating our 2018 full year guidance. However, given the strong unit development in the first half of the year, we expect net new unit growth to be at the high-end of our guidance of 3% to 4% and same-store sales growth, given the softer first half of the year, to be at the lower end of our guidance of 2% to 3%. It's also important to note that, excluding the KFC distributors' disruption in the UK, first half same-store sales growth would have been 2%, within the range of our full year guidance. As a reminder, our full year core operating profit guidance of approximately flat includes anticipated headwinds of 6 to 7 percentage points related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings, along with 2 to 3 percentage points related to revenue recognition accounting standard. Looking at the second half of the year, we're confident in our plans and are performing on track with those plans thus far through the third quarter. We are now a year and a half into our transformation and are continuing to execute on the key items designed to deliver accelerated growth. The foundation of this is our four key growth drivers, which David and I will talk to you about today. I'll provide an update on two of these drivers, our distinctive, relevant and easy brands and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will discuss the next two, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability, along with the details of our second quarter results. I'll start with our three distinctive, relevant and easy brands. Beginning with KFC Global, system sales grew 6% with same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 5%. We continued to see strength in Australia, Russia & Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, including Turkey and North Africa and our India markets. The success in these markets was primarily a result of balancing the core, value, innovation, and also ensuring the operational basics are executed well. In particular, I want to highlight our KFC Australia market. Year-after-year, this market continues to deliver, posting 4% same-store sales growth year-to-date for a two-year stack of 11%, of which approximately 75% is transaction growth. They have wrapped the KFC brand within the lovable, larrikin Australian culture, distinguishing KFC and helping drive the consistently strong same-store sales growth. I'm proud of the fact that transactions have been driven by their focus on core products. We just celebrated 50 years in this market and I look forward to many more years of continued growth. Just last week, the KFC team from across the globe held their Annual Marketing Planning Meeting with record breaking attendance. The event focused on sharing know-how and facilitating collaboration by connecting our teams with each other. Themes centered around building sales overnight and brand over time with the objective of making KFC more distinctive, relevant and easy. The market teams bring so much passion for the brand and I love this way of bringing best practices to life around the globe. Shifting to the U.S., I'm proud that the innovation team has delivered with the Crispy Colonel Sandwich. Operational enhancements ensure the sandwich is delivered hot and fresh to each customer with options for a classic sandwich or one of the delicious flavor profiles of Nashville Hot, Georgia Gold or Smoky Mountain BBQ. As a bonus, we introduced a new pickle flavor, which could be added to any Extra Crispy product, including the Crispy Colonel Sandwich. This was a very limited-time offering, as each store was only shipped one case of the new cult favorite. Without any traditional commercials, Pickle Chicken spread by word of mouth and generated significant buzz for the brand. Before moving onto Pizza Hut, I want to provide an update on the KFC UK business, which suffered a setback as a result of disruptions in supply, when we changed distribution partners in the first quarter. As expected, all stores were fully up and running by mid-May. We've turned the national advertising back on and are seeing good customer response. I'm very thankful to and proud of the team who have worked tirelessly since the disruption began. It is because of their hard work, collaborative spirit and dedication that customers in the UK are now able to enjoy the KFC they love and missed. Now to Pizza Hut. In the U.S., system sales declined 1% with flat same-store sales and net new unit decline of 2%. During the second quarter, we launched an innovative product with our Double Cheesy Crust Pan Pizza that customers enjoy and mix well in our menu offerings. However, this campaign shifted marketing away from the value offering, which we believe weighed on same-store sales growth in the quarter. We know consistent value is of the utmost importance and at the core of our brands, and so we've adjusted our marketing for the balance of the year to remind customers we're a brand offering everyday compelling value. Regarding our Transformation Agreement investments, we continued to gain traction with our commitment to Hot, Fast and Reliable experience. Our investments in digital, delivery, operations, and loyalty are generating improvements in internal metrics. In fact, our delivery times have improved by three minutes versus prior delivery times to the Transformation Agreement. Customer satisfaction scores have also significantly increased as was recently reported by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Pizza Hut customer satisfaction score increased 5%, the largest gain in the category making Pizza Hut tied for fourth amongst limited service restaurants. Lastly, we recently announced a new partnership with advertising agency, GSD&M and could not be more excited about the creative opportunities that await this powerful brand and look forward to an exciting activation of our football partnerships including our new NFL agreement and the extension of our NCAA agreement. We still believe that Pizza Hut U.S. turnaround will be a slow build, but we're encouraged by the foundation that's being put in place and continue to make significant strides to improve the brand's position. Internationally, system sales grew 1% with same-store sales decline of 2% and net new unit growth of 6%. The strong net new unit growth represents an acceleration over last year, as our Delcos continue to generate healthy unit level economics, keeping franchisees excited and motivated to continue building the footprint of our brand. Additionally, we were very excited to announce our landmark international growth alliance with Telepizza back in May. This alliance will double Pizza Hut's footprint in the regions covered, place Pizza Hut in the number one position in the category across Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of unit count and confirm Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. Please note completion of the alliance is subject to certain conditions including regulatory approvals. Upon approval and deal closure, Telepizza units will be included in our unit count. Outside of unit development, we have significant work to do around same-store sales growth. Many markets are experiencing similar issues to those faced in the U.S. and we are taking the learnings from the U.S. market and applying them internationally. In particular, I want to elaborate on the three key steps I outlined last quarter, which are designed to reignite same-store sales growth. First is ensuring we have strong operations and digital execution in place to deliver on being the easiest, fastest, tastiest pizza. Secondly, is making sure we have compelling value in each of our markets with examples such as the 69 pesos Pan Pizza in Mexico, \u00a35 Favorites value in the UK and medium two-topping online deal in Canada. Third, is a consistent communication about For The Love of Pizza brand positioning. Overall, we are utilizing the repeatable model to roll out these three key initiatives across each of our international markets and we'll continue to update you as we progress. Now to Taco Bell, where system sales grew 5% with same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 3%. The quarter began with our $1 Nacho Fries followed by the $1 Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos. Also available in the $5 Box, the Triple Melt Burrito and Nachos featured a delicious blend of melted cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack cheeses. We also brought back the Naked Chicken Chalupa, an innovative take on the taco shell made of fried chicken now in both a wild and mild flavor. And as we move into the third quarter, Nacho Fries are back for a sequel. The PR buzz around the follow-up faux movie trailer Web of Fries II : Franchise Wars. The record breaking launch in the first quarter had customers asking for more and we're happy to bring them back. Taco Bell's ability to innovate and elevate around both their marketing and products highlights the fact the brand proudly stands in a Category of One. Internationally, this is only the beginning for Taco Bell and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. I'd like to highlight two examples of this exciting international growth. First being our Canadian business which continued to build on its four consecutive years of at least high single digit same-store sales growth with 11% same-store sales growth year-to-date. This was supported by the introduction of the Bacon Ranch Naked Chicken Chalupa, making use of the repeatable model from the U.S. India has leveraged weekday value as well as innovation to deliver 14% same-store sales growth year-to-date. As an example of their innovation, they introduced the Crispy Potaco, a taco with a shell made from hash browns. Finally, we're building momentum with delivery, which is now available in over 40% of our international stores. I'm proud of the work Taco Bell International is doing to lay the groundwork for exponential growth and will continue to update on their progress. Now, moving onto Unrivaled Culture and Talent, the executive leadership team and I just completed a trip to Africa, an exciting and growing market for Pizza Hut and one of our larger and most dominant KFC markets. The trip reminded me just how contagious our culture is and how it can be leveraged to fuel results. Pizza Hut entered sub-Saharan Africa just four years ago and now has nearly 100 restaurants across 12 countries, a remarkable rate of growth, and with the goal of being in 25 countries with 250 restaurants by 2020. Through the second quarter of this year alone, we've already entered two new markets : Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. The team has leveraged the experience of the KFC Africa team growing at a very fast clip and flipping to cash flow positive this year. The team is building the cultural foundation necessary for explosive growth and we believe there's an opportunity for thousands of additional units in Africa. I also want to highlight the huge heart our KFC Africa team has. As part of our trip, we visited the Giyani Preschool (14:55) where our Add Hope program provides nutritious meals for preschoolers. I was proud to learn that only the South African Government provides more meals to children in South Africa than a KFC does. I'm energized by the enthusiasm and passion both teams have for each of our brands. Their culture is reflective of the country's culture and values and I'm confident it will continue to drive fast paced growth at Pizza Hut and long term sustainable results at KFC. Thanks to the team for hosting us and I look forward to celebrating your continued growth. Finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment seriously. We've recently released our 2017 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report called our Recipe for Good that outlines our public commitments over the last two years concerning food, planet and people. I'm proud of how our brands are simplifying ingredients, providing more balanced options, making strides in our sustaining sourcing and usage practices in our restaurants, giving back in our communities and unlocking potential for all types of people as I've already discussed. Our Recipe for Good will unite our employees, franchisees and suppliers on the priorities that matter and will keep us focused on socially responsible growth, managing risks and serving more goodness to our customers, shareholders, communities and the planet. In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we're doing around the world, focusing on our four key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum! We remain confident in our full year 2018 guidance as we lay the foundation to our transformation strategy designed to maximize shareholder value. And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives, and two of our four growth capabilities : Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. Let's start with our second quarter results. We continued to execute against our transformation strategy, while as we explained in our first quarter earnings call, the following four items weighed on our second quarter core operating profit results : the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising; the revenue recognition accounting standard change; the KFC distributor disruption in the UK; and the lap of some one-time benefits at KFC. As a result, and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, core operating profit declined 6%. We are reiterating our full year 2018 guidance and remain committed to delivering at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019. As a reminder, our full year 2018 guidance of approximately flat core operating profit growth incorporates headwinds of 6 percentage points to 7 percentage points related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings, and 2 to 3 percentage points related to the revenue recognition accounting standard. Given the strong unit development in the first half of the year, we expect net new unit growth to be at the high-end of our guidance of 3% to 4% and same-store sales growth, given the softer first half of the year, to be at the low end of our guidance of 2% to 3%. We are confident in our plans for the second half of the year and are seeing good progress against these plans thus far in the third quarter. Before moving onto our transformation initiatives, I'll discuss the impact of the distribution disruptions in our KFC UK business. We estimate second quarter same-store sales growth of 1% at Yum! and 2% at KFC would have been 2% at Yum! and 3% at KFC after adjusting for the impact. We continue to expect the impact on full year same-store sales growth to be 25 basis points for Yum! and 50 basis points for KFC. Regarding core operating profit growth, we estimate declines of 6% at both Yum! and KFC would have been declines of 5% at Yum! and 3% at KFC after adjusting for the impact. We continue to expect the impact on full year core operating profit growth to be a 2% impact on KFC and 1% impact on Yum! All of our stores in the UK opened for business offering their full menus beginning mid-May with advertising beginning at the end of May. Please keep in mind that the KFC UK business reports on a period basis, with their second quarter ending on June 11. Consequently, the second quarter saw limited benefit as a result of the return to advertising at the end of May. We do not expect this issue to have further impact on our results going forward. Now turning to our transformation initiatives, to be more focused, more franchised, and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused allows us to devote our attention to our four key growth drivers in order to elevate system sales growth to our bold goal of 7%. We're confident the focus on these four items is the catalyst for sustainably growing our system sales over the long-term. Second, we continue to make progress towards becoming more franchised, selling 51 restaurants this quarter. We are 97% franchised and are on track to be 98% franchised by year end. Third, we are becoming a more efficient company by reducing our CapEx and G&A spend. We are on track with 2018 CapEx guidance of $200 million to $250 million and 2019 run rate CapEx of $100 million. In addition, we expect to deliver on our G&A savings resulting in G&A representing 1.7% of system sales in 2019. Each of these initiatives are designed to maximize growth for our shareholders. We are maintaining our 2019 EPS target of at least $3.75. We also remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion to our shareholders between 2017 and 2019. During the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 8 million shares for a total of $643 million and paid $116 million in dividends. Since the beginning of 2017, we have returned over $3.7 billion to our shareholders. Now, let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with bold restaurant development. As Greg mentioned, we recently announced an alliance with Telepizza, which involves Telepizza opening at least 1,300 new stores over the next 10 years and at least 2,550 stores total over 20 years. While this deal is expected to be EBITDA neutral in the short-term, we believe this strategic alliance will be accretive over the long-term. It will provide us with a foothold in key European markets, something which would have taken decades to achieve on our own as well as consolidate a majority of our Latin American markets under one master franchisee. In addition to immediately expanding our restaurant base, this agreement should accelerate our unit growth and allow us to leverage Telepizza's incredible depth and capability in delivery operations and supply chain management. Please note completion of the alliance is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. Upon approval and deal closure, Telepizza's units covered by this agreement will be included in our unit count. We are excited about the potential the alliance with Telepizza brings to the Pizza Hut brand. Importantly, net new unit development remains a strength of Pizza Hut International, with 6% net new unit growth over prior year. In contrast to the current asset base, which has a heavy reliance on dine-in, we expect at least 90% of our net new unit openings this year to be the Delco Model, which generally bodes healthy paybacks and strong unit level economics. With the focus on the three key areas Greg mentioned, operations, value, and communication, and a shift in our asset base, I am confident Pizza Hut is laying the foundation for long-term success. At Taco Bell, we opened another nine international units this quarter, including a new market entry in Peru. We also continue to see growth in our domestic urban walk-in and Cantina restaurants, opening three new units in New York, part of the 34 gross new U.S. units Taco Bell opened this quarter. As for KFC, they again proved they are a global powerhouse, opening nearly 200 net new units this quarter. Through the first half of 2018, KFC has opened over 100 additional net new units than the first half of 2017. There remains significant whitespace for the brand and we are excited to grow our presence across the globe. In aggregate, accelerating unit growth across our three brands is a driving factor supporting our long term bold goal of 7% system sales. We remain committed to this goal and are confident there is significant potential to have continued global unit growth for each of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. Now onto our fourth growth driver, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First, as Greg mentioned, the American Customer Satisfaction Index report noted Pizza Hut U.S. as having the highest percentage increase in customer satisfaction scores amongst all restaurant companies. This is firsthand evidence the customer is noticing our investment in and commitment to a Hot, Fast and Reliable experience at Pizza Hut U.S. Second, at Taco Bell, to continue our momentum and focus on speed, we launched a unique after-dark program, aimed at driving performance improvement after dark our fastest growing day-part. As a result of the launch, Taco Bell has seen a 1 percentage point improvement in customer satisfaction both before 5 :00 P.M. and after 5 :00 P.M. and an improvement in overall system speed performance after 5 :00 P.M. by two seconds. Some franchise organizations have improved their speed by as much as 30 seconds resulting in over 1% increase in transaction growth. Third, both KFC and Pizza Hut held their international franchise conventions this quarter and both events had a strong emphasis on building long-term operating capability. For KFC, with over 1000 attendees from across the globe, the convention reinforced the Always Original brand positioning to bring clarity and consistency around building a relevant and distinctive brand. But the convention also had a big focus on building an easy brand specifically targeting delivery, digital technology, and leveraging data. The franchisees share a passion for the brand and we're working together to ensure our efforts around easy apply not only to our customers but also to our team members and restaurant operators. We will keep you updated as we continue to innovate around our digital platform. At Pizza Hut International franchise convention, the focus was around the unfinished agenda on same-store sales growth. We shared the recipe for growth with our franchisees, which Greg outlined for you today, including strong operations and digital execution, value and consistent communication, along with showcasing our fast casual Delco. Finally, we were excited to announce a few new master franchise agreements last quarter. Sforza Holding is now our master franchisee for all three of our brands in Brazil. Sforza has proven they're one of our 3C franchisees, already bringing capital, capability, and commitment to the Taco Bell brand by being the first franchisee who has had a Taco Bell development record with the opening of 15 new restaurants in the first year. The master franchise agreement for each brand includes significant development agreements and we are excited to see our brands grow in Brazil under Sforza's control. Sforza is one of the first two master franchise agreements for Taco Bell. Taco Bell has also signed a master franchise agreement with Casual Brands Group in Spain. Casual Brands Group currently owns and operates 40 Taco Bell restaurants throughout Spain and won the prestigious Taco Bell International Franchisee of the Year award. Collectively, Sforza and Casual Brands Group are committed to opening more than 400 Taco Bell restaurants over the next decade. In Russia, Pizza Hut has partnered with AmRest as their master franchisee to accelerate growth. AmRest has proven to be a valued partner with both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands already. And we look forward to the opportunities they will bring to Pizza Hut Russia. Each of the franchisees mentioned signing our master franchise agreements are valuable partners who represent our 3C requirement of being capitalized, capable and committed. After attending the KFC and Pizza Hut International franchise conventions I'm reminded just how strong our franchise base is at all three of our brands. As a highly franchised company, the relationships and alignment we have with our franchisees is paramount. Through these partnerships we are confident we will continue delivering a world with more Yum! To wrap-up, our second quarter core operating profit results were as we expected. We remain confident in delivering on our transformation initiatives. And while there may be noise between quarters, we are pleased with the progress to-date. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. My one question is going to be on the unit growth, I know you just came into that (29:21) 4% rate now. And if you sustain this 4% unit growth, is the composition of the growth that we're seeing across the brand now how you would expect it to continue with KFC now growing above 4%, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell both performing kind of slightly below 4%? And if you were to somehow accelerate growth from here from this 4%, what of the three brands would drive that in your view? Thanks. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Hi. Yeah, great question Brian. I am really excited about what's going on in development. Just to put some numbers around it. Year-to-date we've opened 482 net new units versus 317 at this point last year. So we're up 165 units. As for the composition and what that might look like going forward, obviously, KFC and the level that they are performing on and the growth number of units that they're opening is fairly significant. But they still have enormous runway to keep going and take their numbers up. But Taco Bell and Pizza Hut starting from lower numbers I think can have even more room to improve their percentages in their growth rates. The Pizza Hut model with the Delcos, as we said, we're getting 90% of our growth through Delcos. It's a really efficient way to build new units with great returns for franchisees in most cases. So we see ramping that up fairly significantly and you're seeing that right now around the world. And then Taco Bell as we've said many, many times is really just scratching the surface internationally. So my guess is as we go forward you'll see the composition change a little bit with Pizza Hut and Taco Bell becoming a bigger and bigger part of unit growth and KFC taking their already very impressive numbers up further as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on that move towards 4% unit growth. A question on delivery. With your investment in Grubhub, you're in a great position to see what's going on in U.S. delivery these days, obviously you have a big play there in Pizza and it looks like the big three pizza players in aggregate are weaker than they were in the past. Do you attribute this to non-pizza delivery hurting Pizza? And could you talk about your lift today, how delivery is going with KFC and Taco Bell and what you think that might be as you look ahead with Grubhub? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think we're in obviously the early days of testing with Grubhub. I think that's \u2013 I think the key thing is that we've got the systems integrated. So we're in the very early days. We are seeing what you'd expect us to see, which is incremental transactions we're seeing higher check. We've not unleashed the marketing muscle behind it, so we think there's a lot more transaction growth to get. But the transactions appear to be incremental at a much higher check. So I think in that sense we feel good about delivery. And obviously, I think that we'll obviously work with Grubhub in order to grow this opportunity. Nothing better than a new occasion and a higher check that's all good for us and we'll obviously continue to support that and make that a big deal going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. On the Pizza Hut business globally and you talked about some operational tweaks you need to make, some marketing. But there's also a fair proportion of stores that currently don't offer delivery. So is there some sort of unlock that you can achieve early on in terms of getting some of those dine in stores to deliver? Is that a key piece to driving incremental same-store sales? And I did want you maybe just to address the prior question about delivery maybe impacting particularly some of your global Pizza Hut markets (33:19) in some markets that deliver x pizza or aside from pizzas impacting the delivery business in certain markets? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I mean on the question of the dine-in stores at Pizza Hut and their ability to deliver, we actually do have some dine-in stores that deliver out of the dine-in stores, we call them restaurant-based delivery. And with aggregators it does make it easier to add dine-in stores to the delivery world and have the aggregators deliver from our dine-in stores. I think Yum! China has taken advantage of that opportunity. So for us, the dine-in asset base though is very different around the world for Pizza Hut. In some cases, it's nearly white tablecloth. In other cases, it might resemble more of a fast casual kind of asset and you have to take into account on the delivery side is the back of the restaurant actually set up to deliver? In some cases it is, in some cases it isn't. In some cases, the menu is something that could be delivered, in other cases it's more of a dine-in menu. So we are \u2013 where there are opportunities we are taking advantage of the ability to add delivery to our dine-in assets. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, the vast majority of the stores we're building, the Telepizza stores that we are adding, they are all delivery capable stores. So you'll see our asset base become more and more delivery capable over time. As far as the trends on delivery... Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think if you look at our international pizza business, there's a distinct difference between our performance in dine-in and our performance in off-premise. And so we feel good about our off-premise performance in our international Pizza Hut business. It's got some very good numbers and, as I said, there's quite a difference between that and our dine-in. We've still got some strong dine-in markets, Hong Kong, Indonesia that are performing well. But, clearly, as David said, we're building the future which is Delcos and we're still seeing good growth in international in our off-premise business. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, both U.S. and internationally, our delivery business is in growth mode. Our delivery carryout business is in growth mode. So back to the earlier question of, are we seeing other people getting into delivery impacting us, it would be hard for us to say that since we feel pretty good about our Pizza Hut delivery carryout business today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Hi. I was hoping to get an update on delivery specifically at KFC and Taco Bell in the U.S., how many units have been fully integrated into the GRUB platform from a delivery perspective on the front-end, but how much of that work is already been done on the backend as well, (36:02) a possibility to talk about your comps in the U.S. specifically, which might be the future indicator of Taco Bell and KFC stores that have received delivery, how much of an incremental boost to the business that's been? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think as we've said a couple of times, we're pleased with the initial results that we're seeing by adding delivery into Taco Bell and KFC. Remember, Taco Bell already had a decent sized pool of stores that they experimented with delivery with another aggregator partner. Behind the scenes, we're doing all the work to integrate the systems with Grubhub, so that we can make this the fastest most seamless process for consumers and for our store employees. And we feel good about how that work is going. We're not throwing out numbers and targets and when certain number of units are going to be opened because there are several milestones we have to get through as we go on this journey. In fact, we're still trying to finalize the specific terms of the agreements that our franchisees will sign with GRUB. And then until things like that happen, we don't have complete visibility to a timeline around certain units and when they'll all be on. But as far as initial results, I think we're pleased with how things have gone. Operator : Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, another question on the delivery front, where you have been testing delivery, do you have any early data you can share in terms of delivery times that you're accomplishing or achieving? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yes. I mean, look, I think the key is as we've been trying to say, this is very early. We're in test. We haven't unleashed the marketing muscle of each of the brands in order to drive it. So I think we're seeing times that we're really happy with. So we've obviously got a very big Pizza Hut delivery business. We know what the expectations of the customers are. So I think we feel good about the delivery times that we're delivering to the customers. The transactions per restaurant are still small, but I believe that with all the work we've got from our Pizza Hut knowledge on how to deliver, that we are meeting the customer's expectations. So I feel good about that. The tests are very early, small number of stores. And I think as David said correctly, getting both KFC and Taco Bell integrated in the POS system, we don't want to be going to a tablet to order, to place an order because then you get speed issues. You get accuracy issues. We know all of that. So we would rather get the integration done right, test the integration, then unleash the marketing dollars and then drive the incrementality that we know we'll get. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: And in a good way I guess, we're fairly sophisticated when it comes to the subject of delivery. We know delivery well from our Pizza Hut business. So getting Taco Bell and KFC in, we have very high standards for where we want to ultimately get to. And while, as Greg said, we're pleased with where we're at right now in the journey, we know what ultimately the kinds of times and accuracy that you need to deliver in delivery. We're not there yet, but we're on that path to getting there with GRUB right now. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. My question is on the interplay of comp and unit growth. If over the long run, your units gravitate more towards that 4% unit growth range, why wouldn't your comp naturally gravitate more towards that 2% over the long run? Given you have 45,000 units around the world and growing at that higher rate just adds that many more units, you're going to have more cannibalization. It probably is a distraction to execution. I'm just kind of curious why the long run wouldn't look like your guidance for this year. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Look, I think that being at the low end of 2% to 3% is not where I want us to be. I think we have every capability to be closer to the high end of the range. And it's probably not a surprise to anybody that based on our first half performance even accounting for the KFC performance in the UK, we have strengthened the back half calendars on all the brands. We happen to have a thing called, as David said, the marketing planning meeting last week for KFC. I sat through every one of those brand presentations. I've seen the calendar adjustments. I think that there is still opportunity for us to grow closer to the 3% than the 2% we are delivering. And I can assure you we're very focused on, obviously, continuing to grow the net new units that David spoke about, and which we're obviously happy about. But I do believe we can still accelerate our growth closer to 3% than to 2%. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, on the specific question, it was a fair question though, as we expand will we end up with more and more cannibalization impacting same store sales growth? Actually if you think about where we're growing, mostly very much wide open spaces. We talked in our opening comments about how Pizza Hut's just entering Sub-Saharan Africa, there is new countries to enter, there's hundreds of units to build. I mean in many ways the units that you build start to produce more marketing dollars, which help you grow your topline more. Certainly at some point you'll get to saturation and you will deal with more of the impact issues that are little bit more common in the U.S. We have a very big presence in emerging markets where the markets are growing, where our unit counts are growing along with the population and with the purchasing power of the population and we really don't see a lot of concern about cannibalization from the development folks and where we're building stores. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Andrew Charles - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Thanks. Dave you called out core operating profit growth in 2Q is expected to be the softest for the year, but you showed pretty good traction on G&A savings which at 1.8% of system sales in the quarter is brushing up against that 1.7% target as well as franchise and property expenses. Does the full year guidance for flat core operating profit embed accelerated levels of savings in these two line items as we look out to the back half of the year? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I wouldn't necessarily say accelerated, obviously, as we're getting towards the end of the refranchising and most of the \u2013 we have two kinds of G&A cuts, obviously, the organic cuts that were independent of refranchising and those related to our refranchising. The vast majority of the organic cuts were made early in this journey and then we're coming to the end of the G&A reduction coming from the refranchising. We do have some annualization of G&A savings, but you're absolutely right to point out, look, we're almost at the 1.7% target. You look at the first half number and sort of double that. You get a sense for where we can get to, where we want to go, we want to get to fairly comfortably as we keep growing the top line. So, yeah, we're in good shape on G&A and that's why we reiterated all the elements of the transformation in our commitment. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. My question is on Pizza Hut, I guess, specifically on the U.S., just seems like the comps maybe aren't yet seeing the acceleration you had anticipated. So I'm wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about the challenges, I think you mentioned most recently the move away from value, may be with a more of a noticeable headwind or maybe you can share any metrics related to the loyalty program and membership, and how your $130 million contribution would \u2013 where it would see the greatest benefit? Just trying to see if there any laterals to the \u2013 maybe the relative weakness we're seeing in China or whether it's just more U.S. specific? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure. I think there's no doubt that all three brands have to be on value, that's like given. And obviously getting back on value is critically important. I think the exciting opportunity for Pizza Hut in U.S. is to activate our NFL partnership. And obviously as we said, we renewed our NCAA partnership, and the way we look at it will be sort of owning football Thursday through Mondays. And I think there's nothing that brings America together more than football and pizza. So I think all \u2013 as we said, all the internal metrics which we talked about are improving; three minute speed if a speed improvement, obviously customer satisfaction improving. And I'm looking forward to us activating this partnership as football season gets underway. And obviously, hopefully using that to drive our brand to be more relevant, to be more distinct and then obviously the functional foundational stuff is helping us make this more easy. So, I think we're doing all the right things. We've got to deliver the results, it's sort of show-me time, but we feel good about what we've got for the back half of the year on Pizza Hut in the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the competitive environment you're seeing in the U.S. And I guess through that value lens specifically, and sort of what impact that it's having on the brands? Just following up on your commentary Greg, just Pizza Hut and the pivot towards value in the back half, just curious how easy it is to differentiate within the category on value, and if the combination of all the enhancements you're making to the brand right now can sort of enhance those benefits from pizza value. And then just on Taco Bell, just a bit more about how all the innovative and differentiated value items that you had in the quarter, how they performed relative to your expectations and how you see the back half shaping up given the calendar if this value cycle continues? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure. Well, yeah, you're right. I mean value has become an important part of the industry. It's become an important part of every brand's positioning. As we talked about last week at the MPMs, I think there's also two ways to how you can communicate value : one is to apologize and one is to celebrate. I believe that we should be celebrating the fact that we can offer great value to our customers. Each of the three brands has a very clear value roadmap. I'll use U.S. dollars to talk because it will be easier, but if you are thinking about KFC, they have got $5, $10, $20. And then some of the markets where we're seeing really good performance they've got disruptive value as well. Taco Bell has got $1, $5 boxes. To your point, they're all performing very well in line with our expectations. To given an example, the fries, nacho fries which we launched essentially a la carte in the third quarter, we've been able to put them in the $5 box. I think that will enhance the appeal of the $5 box by putting one of the most popular new products we've launched. And then on Pizza Hut, it's about consistently staying on every day value and making sure that we deliver great tasting pizzas at a great price. So I think every day value will be important and I think the occasional hit of disruptive value will be important, because we've seen that where we deliver consistent every day value, it doesn't matter what the brand or what the country with the occasional disruptive value, that's the places we are winning and delivering the best same store sales growth. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Just a quick I guess two parter : one, not to belabor this, but on the value piece are you getting any pushback from franchisees just because that's been such a characteristic of the market for so long, I'm surprised that you would have pulled back on that kind of marketing last quarter, so I wasn't sure if it was driven by franchisees? And then I guess if you could just quickly comment. You mentioned disruption in the UK really to KFC but I guess you didn't allude to China. Had you expected some deceleration there because of the fact that you were able to get to the comp even with that I think was impressive, but I'm just trying to understand going forward with such a big market are you confident in the ability to offset with strength elsewhere? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Sure. Well, I think franchise economics are critical right? I like to say if you have great economics for the franchisee and great enthusiasm from the customer you've got a winning combination. So we're obviously very conscious of franchise economics. I think a good example would be Taco Bell took a la carte fries from $1 to $1.29 but they put them in the $5 box and we're going to sell a lot more $5 boxes. And so I think each of the brands has done a very good job of being conscious of the unit level economic impact. The other great thing is these businesses run off in a momentum and volume, and our ability with these disruptive value offers which are essentially protein only offers, example, in Australia which as I said earlier two year stack of 11, of which 7 or 8 is transaction growth. They run nine pizzas for $9.95 on a Tuesday because of the \u2013 and it's only chicken. So obviously all the sides are bought at full margin. So there's a lot of smart thinking that's gone into all of this. And obviously we've got our franchisees on board. We've got them supporting this, but we're very conscious of their economics. And I think you also saw in the quarter results that our Taco Bell margins improved despite the fact that we obviously were doubling down on $1 and $5 offering. So I think we've got a very good way of working with our franchise partners delivering great unit level economics for them and great customer enthusiasm. On your question on China, I think the way I want to think about it is that, obviously they talked last night, we listened to their call about their new unit growth which we're excited about, them continuing to grow new units and the returns that they're getting on those units, so I think it's two units on KFC and three to four on Pizza Hut, so that's exciting. And the other great thing is the KFC China team and the Pizza Hut team were at the MPMs last week. So they sat in for a whole week as every country shared what they're doing to drive same store sales growth. So the China team got to see what the Australia team is doing, and all those sort of things, and I think that's the beauty of a global business like Yum! which is we can share, we can cross collaborate. So I'm excited that they'll be able to take those learnings, go back, adjust their calendars just like we have adjusted the calendars in the rest of the business. And obviously hopefully deliver stronger same store sales growth in the back half of the year. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay, so let me just say, first of all, I want to thank everyone for taking their time to be on our call today. Like any business there are things that you're proud of and happy about, but there's always this unfinished business as we all know. I'm really proud of the entire organization's efforts and results on our transformation to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient. These were really bold goals and it's clear that we're going to achieve them. I'm also particularly proud of how we've step changed our new unit development, which we talked about today across the globe and across the three brands, and we've moved from consistently delivering 3% to now 4% net new unit growth. And I think David and I believe we have the opportunity to eventually even do better than that. So where do we have unfinished business? Same store sales growth obviously. If I take out the impact of the KFC distributor issue, our numbers aren't bad, but I have to be honest to say I'm not content. And I know we can and will do a lot better. The brands have all adjusted their back half calendars which I've seen and I know now we have to deliver, not just talk about it. That's my focus. It's our focus for the second half. So thanks again and I look forward to updating you on our journey to deliver a world with more Yum! Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Brands Investor and Analyst Day will be held on Wednesday, December 5, 2018 and will be available via webcast on our website at www.yum.com. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. System sales growth for the third quarter was 5% with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. This achievement was largely attributable to the tremendous performance at Taco Bell as well as a solid quarter at KFC, delivering 5% and 3% same-store sales growth respectively. As well as strong net new unit growth at each brand. As a result of timing factors, we've outlined all year and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, core operating profit growth was 2%. Now, I'd like to discuss our guidance for full year 2018. Consistent with our communications after our second quarter earnings, we anticipate net new unit growth to be at the high end of the 3% to 4% range and same-store sales growth to be at the low end of the 2% to 3% range included in our original 2018 guidance. We are also reiterating our full year core operating profit growth guidance of approximately flat. However, we have a few items to note in the pieces that comprise core operating profit. We now anticipate our underlying base operating profit growth to be at or slightly below the low end of the previously communicated high single-digit range, owing to the reduced contribution from Pizza Hut, particularly in the international business. Offsetting this, we now anticipate the headwinds relating to the timing mismatch between refranchising and associated G&A savings to be slightly below the low end of the previously communicated six-point to seven-point range. Our estimate of a two percentage point to three percentage point headwind related to the recognition accounting standard is unchanged. Before I begin with our key growth drivers, I want to thank and celebrate Roger Eaton for his many years of service. Roger's imprint on Yum! and the KFC brand over the last 20 years is vast. He joined KFC in 1990 and held roles in operations, development and finance across Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. before finally taking over leadership of the global KFC brand in 2014. Everyone who has met Roger knows that he always brings passion and energy enabling world-class operations to his roles, encouraging markets to adopt and share the best ideas. Roger's focus on ensuring excellence in operations, value and food innovation will leave a lasting impact for which we'll be eternally grateful. With Roger's retirement comes a new opportunity for Tony Lowings who is being promoted to CEO of KFC Global. Tony has a long history of creating value for all of Yum!'s stakeholders having helped build one of our strongest markets, KFC Australia as well as LA&C, another KFC powerhouse. From there, he served as Managing Director, KFC Asia-Pacific, enhancing and expanding this emerging market. And finally, Tony joined KFC Global earlier this year as President and Chief Operating Officer and has provided wise counsel across Yum! through our global leadership team. We're excited for Tony and wish Roger all the very best in his retirement. We are now two years into our three-year transformation and are continuing to execute on the key items designed to accelerate growth. The foundation of this is our four key growth drivers, which David and I will talk to you about today. I'll provide an update on two of these drivers : distinctive, relevant, and easy brands; and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will discuss bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability along with details of our third quarter results. I'll start with our three distinctive, relevant, and easy brands. KFC Global delivered system sales growth of 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. KFC saw widespread growth including particular strength in Africa, Russia, Eastern Europe, Thailand, the Middle East, and India. The success in these markets was primarily a result of executing on value, innovation, delivery, and digital. In particular, I want to highlight KFC India, Thailand, and Australia. India continued to deliver results with ten consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. It has sustained momentum through a focus on value backed by noteworthy promotions. This quarter, India posted 14% same-store sales growth, supporting a year-to-date of 11%. India has opened 34 net new units this year and has rapidly become an example of our distinctive, relevant, and easy growth driver in action. We also want to recognize Thailand. From the first quarter to the third quarter, it has improved its same-store sales growth rate by 13 points, now positive 7%. This impressive turnaround is attributable to two areas : a focus on limited time offerings built around tremendous value; and creating social media for the exciting extreme hot sauce. Like India, Thailand has had similar development success opening 39 net new restaurants through the third quarter. And last, but not least, Australia has now delivered 25 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth. Shifting to the U.S., during the quarter, we had several examples of distinctive marketing and product innovation. First, KFC continued to be bold in their marketing as they introduced two new colonels; they started with Jason Alexander who helped promote $20 Fill Ups in four different and equally delicious options. Next, KFC partnered with the world's strongest man, Haf\u00fe\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson also known as Mountain to celebrate the colossal Double Crispy Colonel sandwich by setting the record for pulling the most number of chicken sandwiches at one time. It was truly a strong effort, pun intended. Now moving to Pizza Hut, as you have probably seen, we had a leadership change at Pizza Hut International. Vipul Chawla will be promoted to President in December. He is a talented leader and a respected global marketer. Vipul currently serves as Managing Director of Pizza Hut Asia-Pacific, our largest Pizza Hut International market with over or nearly 5,000 restaurants across 16 markets. Prior to his current role, he served as General Manager of Pizza Hut Asia. Vipul truly leads with smart heart and courage, while bringing unrelenting focus to product excellence and the customer experience. He has a proven track record of success and I know the entire Pizza Hut International system joins me in welcoming him to this new role. Regarding the quarter, we were pleased to deliver international net new unit growth of 5%. However, we were disappointed in system sales growth of 1% owing to a same-store sales decline of 3%. We recognize that we still have work to do around same-store sales growth. We will continue to focus on operations and digital, value and spreading consistent brand messaging. And under Vipul's leadership, we're excited about the benefits to come from focusing on these essential initiatives. Now Pizza Hut U.S., system sales declined 1% with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. As we have consistently discussed, the Pizza Hut U.S. turnaround will be a slow build and we are encouraged by the foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand's position. In the third quarter, Pizza Hut added emphasis on value : first by a continued and consistent focus on our $7.99 large two-topping pizza; second, it ran a competitive promotion offering an unbeatable value in the large two-topping pizza for just $5.99 carryout only. This value and the operational improvements have made the brand more relevant and easy. However, the messaging has not been distinctive enough to attract new customers, which is a key focus moving forward. As we moved into fourth quarter, we've been thrilled to be the official sponsor of the NFL and about the creative opportunities this provides. Pizza Hut is also retaining a sharp focus on value as we recently kicked off our $5 Lineup featuring flavors like medium one-top pizza, Garlic Knots, wings and our new Cinnabon Mini Rolls, giving customers Pizza Hut pizzas with unrivaled everyday value and add-ons that fans will enjoy. Now Taco Bell where system sales grew 8% with same-store sales growth of 5% and net new unit growth of 3%. With new leadership, comes new ideas and I couldn't be more proud of the Taco Bell U.S. team for improving the way they constructed the calendar in order to generate a more consistent performance and extend momentum. During the quarter, Taco Bell offered customers four unique $5 boxes, alongside innovative products like Steak Nachos, Double Cheesy Gordita Crunch and the fan favorite, Nacho Fries. This record-breaking launch in the first quarter had customers asking for more and we were happy to bring them back. In fact, more than one in four orders contained our beloved Nacho Fries during this promotion. We picked up our movie trailer theme right where we left off with Web of Fries II : Franchise Wars. Taco Bell also connected the Nacho Fries to the 25th anniversary of the cult classic Demolition Man. In case you didn't know, in the movie Demolition Man, the only remaining restaurant is Taco Bell, which the brand celebrated with a truly unique activation at Comic-Con. Lastly, we want to send a big congratulations to the entire Taco Bell system for ranking as America's number one favorite Mexican restaurant in the distinguished Harris Poll. Taco Bell's ability to innovate and elevate around both their marketing and products highlights the fact that the brand proudly stands in a Category of One. Internationally, this is only the beginning for Taco Bell and I'm excited to see the growth the brand grow and expand. We saw momentum and enthusiasm in India, Spain, the Philippines and Canada. Taco Bell India's year-to-date same-store sales growth is 10%, driven by the innovation such as the Naked Chicken Taco and Crispy Potaco. In Spain, one of our more established international markets, year-to-date same-store sales growth of 6% was fueled by value innovation. Guatemala, Taco Bell's largest international market, continues to grow as it recently opened its 57th restaurant. I'm proud of the work Taco Bell International is doing to lay the groundwork for exponential growth to feed people's lives with m\u00e1s. Now to unrivaled culture and talent, part of our transformation is ensuring that we have diverse talent and an inclusive culture to achieve greater gender parity in senior leadership, which we know generates better growth. This commitment aligns with the Paradigm for Parity coalition, to have an organization in which women and men have equal power, status and opportunity. Yum! is intentional about diversity and this is especially evident in the leadership teams of our brands. This past month, Forbes released a series on Pizza Hut's female leaders, which highlighted the careers of five C-suite leaders. While the Forbes' article highlights Pizza Hut, we are proud of the focus on diversity and inclusion at all our brands. Here at Yum!, we are constantly cultivating great talent. It is a true competitive advantage to have a deep bench of this quality. In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we're doing around the world, focusing on our four key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiatives and two of our four growth drivers, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. Let's start with our third quarter results. As expected, Q3 was better than the first half. Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved reaching 2% and 5% respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth ex-FX was 8% at Taco Bell and 7% at KFC, both impressive accomplishments. As a reminder, the following two items weighed on our third quarter core operating profit results : first, the timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising; and second, the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result, and consistent with our expectations, core operating profit increased 2%. I'd like to follow-up on Greg's comments related to our full year 2018 guidance and then 2019 EPS. Consistent with our communications after our second quarter earnings, we expect net new unit growth to be at the high end of the 3% to 4% range and same-store sales growth to be at the low-end of the 2% to 3% range included in our 2018 guidance. We are also reiterating our full year core operating profit growth guidance of approximately flat. Subject to a few adjustments in the components that comprise core operating profit, we now anticipate our underlying base operating profit growth to be at or slightly below the low end of the previously communicated high single-digit range owing to reduced contribution from Pizza Hut, particularly in the international business. Offsetting this, we now anticipate the headwinds related to the timing mismatch between refranchising and the associated G&A savings to be slightly below the low end of the previously communicated six-percentage-point to seven-percentage-point range. Our estimate of a two-percentage-point to three-percentage-point headwind related to the revenue recognition accounting standard is unchanged. Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019, there have been a number of significant variables that have influenced this since we introduced it two years ago. Some of these variables are tax reform, revenue recognition, and our cash investments in Grubhub and the Pizza Hut U.S. Transformation Agreement. In addition, we have had strong performances at both KFC and Taco Bell and clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. That said, we remain on track to deliver this goal and we plan to provide more context around 2019 during our December analyst and investor event and webcast. Lastly, as a reminder, the $3.75 target does not include any benefit from the 53rd week, the impact of changes in FX rates, nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. Now turning to our transformation initiatives, to be more focused, more franchised, and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused means, we are maniacal about our four key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% system sales growth. We're confident the focus on these four capabilities is the catalyst for increasing the growth rate in our system sales over the long-term. And we're already seeing the benefits most notably in net new unit growth, which I'll talk more about shortly. Second, we continue to make progress towards becoming more franchised, selling 134 restaurants this quarter. We are nearly 98% franchised and are on track to have less than 1,000 equity units by the end of the year. Third, we are becoming a more efficient company by reducing our CapEx and G&A spend. We are on track with 2018 CapEx guidance of $200 million to $250 million and 2019 run rate CapEx of $100 million. In addition, we expect to deliver on our G&A savings, resulting in G&A representing 1.7% of system sales in 2019. Each of these initiatives is designed to maximize growth for our shareholders. We also remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion to our shareholders between 2017 and 2019. During the third quarter, we repurchased over 6 million shares for a total of $527 million and paid over $113 million in dividends. Since the beginning of 2017, we have returned over $4.3 billion to our shareholders. Now, let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with bold restaurant development. At KFC, they again proved they are a powerhouse brand, opening nearly 270 net new units across 49 countries this quarter, demonstrating that there continues to be significant enthusiasm for capitalizing on the ample whitespace that exists for expanding this brand. This August, KFC held their inaugural Global Development Summit. With an emphasis on unlocking unit growth through data-driven market plans, franchise partner capabilities, and new asset sizes intended to unlock untapped markets, our franchise partners have many years of profitable expansion ahead. Just as encouraging, this development is occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets. At Pizza Hut, international delivered 5% net new unit growth over the prior year. Franchisees continue to invest in our Delco and fast casual Delco assets owing to healthy unit-level economics and cash paybacks. And these assets will represent over 90% of our net new unit openings in 2018. One particular market that deserves special recognition is Pizza Hut Japan. It has opened 27 net new units so far this year, which is more than we opened in any of the past 15 years and has plans to open a total of approximately 100 units by 2020. Our master franchisee there is a perfect example of a 3C partner : they are committed to providing consistently bold value and successfully expanding with a delivery-based development strategy; they are capable, able to deliver a great customer experience having earned a record in customer satisfaction including a plus nine-percentage-point improvement in Pan Pizza taste; and finally, they have capital both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. I'd like to spend a minute discussing the challenge Pizza Hut faces given its large dine-in sales mix. Specifically, the drag dine-in is having on our reported same-store sales, which masks the relative health of our delivery and carryout business. You're all aware of this headwind in the U.S. where dine-in sales are down to less than 10% of the total, but the same issue applies to our international business where dine-in sales represent approximately 50% of the total. The gap between dine-in sales and sales from delivery and carryout is significant with both the U.S. and international seeing a roughly ten-point differential. Dine-in is waning in relevance in a lot of markets and importantly complicates pricing decisions in our ability to offer disruptive delivery value, especially in international markets with a high percentage of dine-in sales. We have a long way to go given some of the challenges in legacy dine-in markets such as Europe and China. However, the good news is the estate is shifting towards delivery/carryout, given that 90% of net new unit openings and 80% of all replacement units are delivery/carryout-focused. At Taco Bell U.S., we have opened 59 net new units through the third quarter of 2018. We recently opened our 30th domestic Urban Concept which includes walk-ups and Cantinas, and are excited about the opportunity to tap this near-greenfield market. This quarter we celebrated openings in New York, Chicago and Raleigh, and look forward to more high profile openings later this year, including our first company Cantina in Manhattan. So, stay tuned. In becoming more franchised and more focused, our refranchising initiative has fueled bold development with nearly 220 new development commitments in the U.S. through the third quarter since 2016. In international markets, Taco Bell has developed 34 net new units in 2018, with a strong fourth quarter pipeline yet to come. Lastly, as we know, unit-level economics are essential to stimulating development. I had the privilege of attending the Taco Bell Franchise Convention last month and there's a lot of excitement especially for our Urban and Cantina models where early returns have been encouraging and the development pipeline continues to build. In aggregate, accelerating unit growth across our three brands is a driving factor as we strive for a bold aspiration of 7% system sales. Now onto our final growth driver, Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. I'd like to spend a minute highlighting our partnership with Grubhub. At the beginning of the year, we announced our partnership with Grubhub to drive sales to KFC and Taco Bell through online ordering for pickup and delivery. We are pleased to share that 1,200 KFC restaurants now will offer delivery through Grubhub covering 30% of the U.S. system in just seven months. We are seeing above-average customer ratings on the Grubhub KFC experience and expect this to improve once POS integration is complete later this year. As per Taco Bell, in September we launched a fully integrated solution between the Taco Bell POS and Grubhub marketplace, rolling out this integrated delivery solution to over 2,100 stores across the nation covering 30% of the U.S. market. We are adding stores at a rapid rate and expect to make healthy headway through the end of the year. We have seen positive early results along with valuable operations learnings. Franchisees are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and are all in on delivery as a major brand initiative. Wrapping up on Grubhub, while we are in very early stages of our partnership, the check growth and incrementality of sales that we see is encouraging and supporting expansion throughout the franchise systems. To wrap-up, our third quarter operating profit results were as we expected. We remain confident in delivering on our transformation initiatives and while there may be noise between quarters, we are pleased with the progress to-date. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: John, are you there? You might be on mute. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Sorry about that guys. The question was on Pizza Hut. Obviously, looking at the U.S. and the Transformation Agreement that's been put into place there, it does seem like you're identifying that many of your bigger international markets are having the similar type of issues that the U.S. was having a year or so ago in terms of what products are promoted at what price and basically serving the dining store versus the Delco store. So, are we now beginning a position or are you alluding to that maybe some of the international markets need some of the capital and operating costs and attention that the U.S. was really talked about about a year or so ago? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, John, I think one important difference between the U.S. and international is our international dine-in stores are actually in fairly good shape. These are good assets in good locations and in many countries we actually have a very strong dine-in business that we have confidence in for the future. That's quite a contrast to the U.S. where we have a lot of Red Roof restaurants that are in the wrong part of the trade area, haven't been remodeled and clearly need to go away. So there's a lot of capital required to get out of the Red Roof restaurants in the U.S. It's not a similar situation internationally. So no, we don't anticipate any kind of capital investment needs from Yum! going into international dine-in business. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And is there \u2013 I mean, I guess, a similar type of conversion opportunity over time, even if the assets are in good shape that makes them actually easier to convert, to integrate some of the Delco or fast casual type developments within the existing Red Roof type or a full-service type of estate that exists internationally. I mean, are we at the point where not just 90% of new units are Delcos but you need to begin to convert many of those legacy assets over to something that is more flexible for the overall business model? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, that's exactly right. I think I shared 80% of the stores are \u2013 that are being replaced, so when we have a dine-in unit that does need to be replaced it is being replaced with one of the fast casual or Delco assets. We think this transition will occur, it won't happen overnight but it is planned to occur over time. And with half of our sales coming \u2013 roughly half of our sales coming from dine-in today, we think that number will be closer to a quarter of our sales within three to four years, just from the natural shift of, for example, closing on the Telepizza deal, adding all of those delivery sales, building all these net new unit Delcos that are in the pipeline and then all the work that's being done to replace dine-in stores with delivery stores. So we want to give everybody the clear signal that we do have a plan to migrate out of those dine-in stores, but we thought it was important to highlight frankly that the delivery carryout business at Pizza Hut International is actually fairly healthy. That business is doing well, but the results we report don't show the success that we're having in that part of the business. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Thank you. My question is on the core operating profit guide. I know the guidance update today was just based on 2018. As I look at the refranchising and the G&A savings benefit that's more of a timing mismatch that would have worked itself out anyway. Are you concerned that the underlying issues of Pizza Hut International would impair the core operating profit growth over the longer term? Or do you think that those issues are more just isolated to this year? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think the beauty of Yum! obviously is that we do have a diverse portfolio of brands and countries. And yes, the Pizza Hut business is underperforming our expectations when we started this transformation journey. But obviously, we're also seeing great strength at the much bigger parts of our business at Taco Bell and KFC and we did reiterate our guidance for 2019 today. So I think you never get there the way you planned when you start the journey and we'll talk more about this when we get to December Analyst Day. But we feel good about the state of the business. Obviously, the results this quarter and the fact that we are very demonstrably ramping up net new-unit development certainly helps this earnings model of ours. Just as another fact on that front, year-to-date now we have 892 net new units opened for the year compared to 2017. At the same point, we had 677, so we're 215 units ahead of the pace we had last year. Remember last year we were well ahead of the pace from the prior year, so that's all quite positive and typically the fourth quarter of the year is the biggest year on development by far. So a good story on the development front that helps the earnings model. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I'll ask my follow-up first and then I'll ask my question. The follow-up is on Pizza Hut U.S., I know you said the turnarounds are slow build, but I think this is the second quarter where you said maybe the messaging wasn't as effective even though you did pivot to value. So, could you talk about what can be done here? Because as you noted this isn't a dine-in issue since that's such a small piece of the business in the U.S. at this point. So, I guess, what is the strategy from here if really the only issue is messaging? And then I have a second question. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Look if I answer it in its totality, we're now the NFL partner. It's with us and not a competitor. Is that a good thing? Yes it is. We know what the right price points are to be successful in the marketplace. Do we have all of our franchisees on those price points right yet? No, we don't. But are the stores that are on the right price points doing better? Yes, they are. And as we said, I personally feel that we just got to do a better job of communicating this compelling value. We've got a new agency, they're onboard, the team is all over it and I think you will see us going forward with what I'll call sharper and more distinctive advertising and communication around this compelling value that we offer. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, and just one thing to add on that although the dine-in sales in the Pizza Hut U.S. business are only 10% of the business or so, remember about half the assets are dine-in assets. Those assets are very often in the wrong part of the trade area to deliver, they're not set up in the back of house to deliver. So, although the sales mix is now down to a much more manageable level, we still have work to do that should give you confidence over time. Once we move those assets we'll be in a much better shape. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. David just going back to the 2019 comments, do you believe 2019 is a year you can still deliver on the high single-digit operating profit growth? Are you signaling that there are different pieces you get to the EPS number, but maybe not the operating profit number you'd once envisioned? And related to that I think your G&A on a percentage of system sales is at your target rate of 1.7% this quarter, so is this the right sort of baseline to think about G&A and then it grows in line with system sales from here, are there additional opportunities you've identified as you've gone through this year? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Look I think, we'll talk a lot more about 2019 guidance when we get to the December analyst event. But we weren't trying to imply that there was any change to our high single-digit core operating profit growth model in future years with any of the comments today. The business and the models all generally remain intact, but we'll provide a lot more color on that when we get to the December event. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Just a follow-up on Pizza Hut, since KFC and Taco Bell seem to be cranking along here. The U.S. business, you've invested a lot this year and obviously to this point you're going to have the big fall push here with the NFL. But to this point, the momentum has not been as strong. You mention creative, but next year you're going to be lapping some of those investments. Do you feel like that this is in a fragile position where you really got to get brand momentum going here in the near-term to start to lap some of those investments? I mean, how should we think about the state of Pizza Hut U.S. heading into the 2019 in particular? Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Dave, the way I think about it is that the foundations of Pizza Hut U.S. are in a much better place. I think our delivery times, the quality of the food we're delivering, the price points, all of those are fundamentally in a better place. So our foundations are definitely in a better place. Have we made it easier for our customers to access? Yes, we have through both digital, through both our apps, through the pricing. The point I was making and I think it's one that the team is very aware of is that we have to bring that sort of sharpness of what we're now delivering and doing so we attract new customers. I think our current customer base is very happy with the foundational improvements they're seeing in the brand. The opportunity for us is to bring in new customers by communicating and messaging better this compelling new proposition that Pizza Hut U.S. has to offer, which is an operating improvement, an ease improvement, a value improvement. We just got to do a better job of communicating that and I'm confident that once we do do that and when customers have a new Pizza Hut experience they'll be very happy with the experience that they have. And on that basis, I feel good about the momentum that the (37:06) as David said earlier, our performance in delivery and carryout is better than our overall performance. So have we got work to do? Yes. The foundation is in place? Yes. Can we do a better job of communicating? Yes. And we know what the task is and when you know what the task is, you go chase it and you deliver it. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: On the question of lapping, all of the transformation initiatives were really designed to help the business for the long-term. There really isn't a lapping issue. We invested in media. You'd think that could be a lapping issue, but that was done so that then the franchisees ongoing contribution in media would jump up. So we will have that additional media in future years, so there's \u2013 it's not like that creates a lap issue and then the other investments in things like pouches, and different standards for the brands, launching the loyalty program, we should continue to reap the benefit of those investments over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning and thanks for the question. David just wondering, if you could talk a bit more about the accelerated unit growth potential for the business going forward. Maybe following another strong quarter at KFC, maybe specifically about your confidence in the accelerated growth there, generally which reasons you see that coming from. And just how you're thinking about the U.S. getting back to positive based on the strong returns that the franchisees are seeing? Thanks. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, look again, we'll go into a lot of the future guidance and we'll actually have the leaders from each of the brands talk about their development plans when we get to the December analyst event. I think I want to celebrate the fact that we've made meaningful progress to-date during this transformation as we've been doing all these things like cutting G&A and getting the business more focused. We're starting to see the benefit from development. It's showing up in the numbers, which is why I'm trying to highlight that every quarter. Do we think \u2013 and are we pushing to take the numbers higher from here? Yes. Do we think there are opportunities in almost every market whether they be the mature markets in the U.S. or the international markets? Yes. KFC U.S. is very focused on getting to be a positive net new unit grower. And just as a preview, I think we can get them there next year. So, yeah, that is something that's really quite additive to the model, when you think about how many units they've been closing over time. But yes, we're excited about unit growth. We'll never stop pushing for more, because when the returns are healthy, you should be capitalizing that and building more and the franchisees love it. It's a way for them to grow their business. But we'll give you even more color on that when we get to December. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just a question broadly on the franchisee health and profitability, I'm not sure whether you can slice it U.S. versus international, but however you look at it. I mean in the past you used to use restaurant margin as a proxy for the franchisees' health and profit, but obviously that margin is no longer representative as the base is so small. So, just wondering if you can offer any directional thoughts on the franchisee health at each brand, maybe how you're suggesting they best manage through the labor cost headwinds they're presumably all facing, and whether or not any of them have concerns about access to capital with rising interest rates? Thank you. David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, that's true Jeff that now we \u2013 you really can't judge the margins that we report and use that as a proxy for the franchise unit economics since we're down to some small numbers with a lot of noise in them. I guess, a general comment on franchisee health is when you operate in as many different combinations of brands and countries as we do there are always pockets of issues. We got 2,000 franchisees. There is always going to be some that are having challenges that we're working with, but the vast majority of our franchise system around the world is quite healthy. The areas where we would have more issues that you would expect would be in businesses where we're trying to transform the business a little bit like Pizza Hut U.S. We're trying to make sure we have the healthiest system of franchisees that we can. Some of the stuff we did in the Transformation Agreement was designed to give us some strength to manage out our underperforming franchisees. And you may see some change in the franchise system there. But in general, I think our franchise health around the world is quite good, and the unit returns that we're reporting are strong. You heard Yum! China yesterday on their earnings call talk about two-year cash paybacks on brand new KFC, so that kind of thing at least to help new franchisees. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. My question is on Taco Bell, which did have impressive performance in Q3. And I just wanted to see if you would elaborate on the drivers of that and whether the reintroduction of Nacho Fries had a big impact on that or whether you think there's something more structural or sustainable that you have that's driving that trend? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Yeah, I think Taco Bell is just doing everything really well. Obviously to report 5% system sales growth, the calendar was incredibly strong. The team adjusted the calendar, which I was really proud of. The fact that they weren't happy with how they got out of the gate, so they adjusted the calendar. I think the product innovation continues to be world class. I still believe that there's no better product innovation that comes out \u2013 that doesn't come out from Taco Bell. The restaurants are being incredibly well-run. The value price points are spot on. The communication is distinctive and cut through. And to the delivered system sales growth of 8%, that is really at the top end, definitely the top end of what happened in the Mexican category and I would argue at the top end of what's happened in QSR. And then, I guess, to top it all off, the prestigious Harris Poll to make Taco Bell the number one Mexican brand in the country was I think just the icing on the cake. So I think this brand is set up for continued success. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a follow-up to a prior question and then a second. David just going back to your Pizza Hut comment, is there a compelling financial argument that could be made for the company to increase its support to accelerate the Pizza Hut conversions? David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.: I think we've done a lot to support the franchisees as we move out of the dine-in asset base into the delivery base. By compelling arguments, there are some incentives that we've done to do that, that we haven't talked about a lot on these calls. So I think we've looked at those things and we've worked with the franchise community to help support them in that regard. Remember that, building a new delivery carryout unit is a very good economic proposition in general. It's a low-cost investment and it generates a three, four year cash payback in general. So the economics are there to make it happen, but when you're dealing with over 3,000 dine-in restaurants it's just going to take some time. Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Thanks, operator. We'll take one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just two questions, one on KFC and one on Pizza Hut. On KFC same-store sales accelerated there particularly on a two-year basis, so super strong performance there. I know we had Yum! China's comps last night, but what's driving the improvement elsewhere at KFC? Is the momentum of delivery growth in some of these markets really gaining momentum? Or anything else you can point out there. And just on Pizza Hut, the $5 lineup you announced, is this a sustainable value offering, are franchisees able to operate at this price point? Thanks. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Well, yeah, I think as I said the KFC performance and the acceleration is down to a number of things : great value, delivery, digital, very good execution and as we said in the commentary, it's widespread. We've had really good across-the-board performance in the quarter from KFC. So what I liked about it was geographically this was a really strong across-the-board sort of quarter. So I think they're doing all the things right. Value is great, delivery, digital and really good execution focusing on the core, and they're doing that across a broad range of markets and we're seeing the benefit. And then on your question on the $5 lineup, yes, it is sustainable. It's been designed to be sustainable. And even the things that, I'm not going to talk about that are coming out, that will go on the menu in the future are also designed to sustain the $5 price point. So I feel very good. We've got the right price points, we communicated in a compelling way and we will see an improvement in Pizza Hut U.S. Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.: Okay. So first of all, I just want to thank everyone for being on the call today. We remain confident that we are going to deliver on our transformation to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, all of which will deliver more growth. Q3 was a strong quarter. We obviously have work to do on the top line at Pizza Hut International, but I am happy with their new-unit development. However, it is great that two of our brands which represent over 80% of our operating profits are delivering on all four of our key growth drivers. The high single-digit system sales growth at both Taco Bell and KFC was impressive I think by any standard. And we look forward to discussing this more in December and thank you for being on the call with us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you, Keith. And good morning, everyone. It's been a little over two years since we announced a substantial transformation of Yum! Brands and I couldn't be more proud of what we've been able to accomplish since then. Focus on our four growth drivers, increased collaboration and a new mindset are clearly fueling improved results. In aggregate, for the year, Yum! delivered system sales growth of 5%, with 2% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth excluding Telepizza units. Additionally, 2018 was a year of significant milestones in bold restaurant development. We now have over 48,000 restaurants in approximately 270 brand country combinations.  Together, with our world-class franchisees, we opened on average 8 gross restaurants per day. Or in other words, one restaurant every three hours. As for the fourth quarter, I'm thrilled to share details of such a strong finish to a solid year. Items to note include a tremendous quarter at Taco Bell where same-store sales grew 6%, another impressive quarter at KFC where same-store sales grew 3% and a continued slow and steady improvement at Pizza Hut US with 1% same-store sales growth. Now, into the final year of our transformation, we continue to focus on our four key drivers to accelerate growth. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of these four key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our distinctly relevant and easy brands, as well as unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will discuss bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. He will also discuss our 2018 results, 2019 guidance and progress towards our transformation commitments. I\u2019ll begin with our three distinctive, relevant and easy brands. In the fourth quarter, KFC division delivered system sales growth of 7%, with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 5%. For the year, systems sales grew 6%, with 2% same-store sales growth and 5% net new unit growth. The unit growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations, delivering a record 1,134 net new units this year. This achievement in unit growth was broad-based with particular strength in China, Russia, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. KFC also saw widespread contribution to its 3% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with notable strength in markets like Africa, China and Iberia. Africa continued to deliver results with 7% same-store sales growth in the quarter. This sustained momentum is the result of intense focus on value, backed by the introduction of the Zinger, an international fan favorite, and premium innovation like new Dunked Burger. In addition, China reported 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter. This stemmed from transactional-driving promotions like the Christmas Bucket and Crazy Thursday deals. And last, but not least, our Iberia market delivered 6% same-store sales growth in 2018. Campaigns based on consumer proximity, using delivery aggregators and that centered on the Mega Box Five Products for Five Euros drove the growth. Importantly, each of these markets grew same-store sales growth, while accelerating net new unit development. Iberia, for example, opened 35 net new units, a 26% increase in units year-over-year. Now, to the US where we finished 2018 with our fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We started off the year with introduction by continuing our Taste of the South series with Smoky Mountain BBQ. We then followed this up with the debut of our Crispy Colonel Sandwich in April. In the fourth quarter, the team built on these platforms and debuted distinctive marketing and product innovation. The  First, Southern-inspired Hot Honey Chicken was offered in a tenders basked or sandwich style. Second, and most notably, Chicken and Waffles featuring Mrs. Butterworth's syrup was a huge hit. KFC\u2019s bold and cheeky marketing uniquely accentuated the delicious pairing to help KFC US deliver its strongest month of same-store sales growth for the year. With continued focus on value and innovation, we\u2019re excited for what 2019 had in store for this always original brand. Moving on to our Pizza Hut division, which celebrated its 60th birthday in 2018 by reaching a milestone of over 18,000 restaurants worldwide. This was in part due to our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza. David will give you more details on the alliance in a few minutes. I want to note that we closed the transaction in December. And while there is no significant P&L impact on the quarter, certain Telepizza units were included in the Pizza Hut division restaurant count. In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut division yielded system sales growth of 2%, with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 10% for the quarter or 2% excluding Telepizza units. For the year, system sales grew 1%, with flat same-store sales growth and 10% net new unit growth or 2% excluding Telepizza units. If you joined us during our investor and analyst day, we mentioned being proud of the foundational improvements we have made, but dissatisfied with the current system sales growth of our Pizza Hut division. For both the US and international business, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. International Pizza Hut systems sales grew 3% in the quarter due to a 5% net new unit growth, excluding Telepizza. We were pleased to see profits and same-store sales growth progress in the fourth ,quarter including in Mexico and Brazil. But, overall same-store sales were flat as dine-in sales continue to weigh on overall results. As we mentioned during the third quarter earnings call and in New York at our investor day, the gap between dine-in general sales and off-premise is significant, with both the US and international seeing a roughly 10 point differential. About 40% of our units outside of the US are dine-in restaurants, with predominantly dine-in sales and about half of these units are in China. We are leveraging best practices from our strongest international markets to provide targeted, alternative asset solutions. In 2018, we found success in our off-premise focused asset options, including Delcos, fast casual Delcos and express units. Combined, these modern off-premise focused restaurants represented 90% of total net new units in 2018, with particular success in India, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. The addition of nearly 1,300 Telepizza units will accelerate the transformation of our estate to a more off-premise focused asset base. In the US, systems sales increased 1% in the quarter, with 1% same-store sales growth and a net new unit decline of 1%. We\u2019re encouraged by the operational foundation that's been put in place and continue to make strides to improve the brand\u2019s position. Over the year, we acquired QuickOrder, our third-party online service provider. Running our own e-commerce platform will enable us to more quickly provide breakthrough products and convenience services to our customers that will allow for better franchise economics over the long-term. In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut US continued its emphasis on value. The $5 lineup which features favorites like medium one top pizza, garlic knots, wings, and our new cinnamon mini rolls, helped improve traffic and provide the pipeline for future product innovation. Our partnership with the NFL has brought attention to these value concepts and improved the distinctiveness of our messaging. Pizza and sports go hand-in-hand and our partnerships with the players and teams should continue to bring the marketing to life. Now, on to Taco Bell, where 2018 marked our seventh consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, once again outpacing the industry, a remarkable feat. Fourth-quarter system sales grew an impressive 9% with system sales growth of 6% and net new unit growth of 3%, a testament to the strength of their leadership team and partnership with their franchisees. During the quarter, we doubled down on value in the US, with double versions of customer favorites including the Triple Double Crunchwrap and Double Chalupa. Then fan favorite Rolled Chicken Tacos finished the quarter of strong. Taco Bell supported the quarter's value and innovation with distinctive brand moments as well, including celebrating our sixth annual Friendsgiving, with an exclusive dinner at our innovation center and launching the Taco Bell Taco Shop, our online retail channel that features some fantastic holiday themed swag that sold out in days. Both of these events generated top-tier media buzz. As we entered 2019, Taco Bell remains focused on being a category of one for everyone. In addition to a relentless commitment to value and innovation for which Taco Bell is known, in 2019, Taco Bell aims to make it even easier to assess for access with our customers. In fact, this morning, on the first anniversary of our strategic partnership with Grubhub, Taco Bell officially announced the national launch of Taco Bell delivery in over 4,000 restaurants across the US. Fans looking to enjoy their favorite menu items at home can jump on to TacoBell.com or go directly to grubhub.com or the Grubhub app to place their order. This launch is an important milestone on our journey to make the Taco Bell brand easier to access, and I want to thank the Taco Bell system and the Grubhub team for making this a reality. For Taco Bell International, there was a lot to be excited about as well. We took National Taco Day to more than 25 markets to generate awareness and drive sales. We leveraged US product innovation, like the Naked Chicken Taco in India and Korea and Naked Chicken Chips in the UK. We have solid local innovation like the Crispy Potaco in India and we even have delivery available in 15 markets and our testing kiosks in several countries. Unit growth is gaining momentum, with continued profitable growth in India, Spain and new markets like Peru. In the UK, development was also strong, including our first three stores in London where we announced our reentry into the market in a way only Taco Bell can with the help of Big Ben\u2019s chimes. In 2018, our franchisees committed to over 1,100 international units under development agreements, augmenting our strong pipeline for future growth. This is only the beginning for Taco Bell International and I'm excited to see the brand grow and expand. Now, on to our unrivaled culture and talent. As you all recently saw, the Board of Directors and I unanimously decided to promote David Gibbs to president and chief operating officer. David is a longtime Yum! veteran and he\u2019s been instrumental in shaping our global strategy, accelerating the pace of global new unit development, executing our transformation and laying a strong foundation for future growth. In his new role, he now has direct oversight of each of the brands with the brand leaders reporting to him. I couldn't be more pleased for David take on this role and I look forward to his continued contribution and leadership. David and I, along with the Board of Directors, have taken a fresh look at our structure and long-term bench as we continue to focus on accelerating our growth. Coming out of that review, we feel great about the level of talent we have throughout the global organization and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally. This includes the recent promotions of Tony Lowings as CEO of KFC and Vipul Chawla as president of Pizza Hut International. Additionally, we made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive advantage for Yum! by investing in select new world-class talent. First, and as we've already announced, we\u2019ll be hiring a CFO as David assumes his new duties. David will maintain his CEO responsibilities until a new CFO is in place. Second, with technology increasingly at the forefront of our strategic planning efforts and given its importance to all four of our growth drivers, we\u2019ll also be hiring a new senior leader reporting to me who is focused on global, digital and technology strategy. This new role will lead to a coordinated cross brand global effort to better leverage technology, to drive sales and better economics for our franchisees. And finally, over the coming quarters, we\u2019ll also be looking to opportunistically bolster our brand leadership teams. In conclusion, I'm proud of the work we are doing around the world, with world-class leaders focusing on our for key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum!. We remain confident as we lay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter results, progress towards our transformation initiative and two of our four growth drivers \u2013 old restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. First, our 2018 results. I'm thrilled that we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, particularly reaching the high end of the original range for net new unit growth, which I\u2019ll talk about more in a few minutes. Our consolidated same-store and system sales growth rates improved throughout the year, ultimately achieving 2% and 5% respectively. In fact, I'd like to note that system sales growth ex-FX was 6% at KFC and 6% at Taco Bell, both impressive accomplishments. As a reminder, two items weighed on our core operating profit results. The timing mismatch between G&A savings and refranchising and the revenue recognition accounting standard change. As a result, and in line with our expectations, core operating profit growth for the full year was flat. As we anticipated, the second half of the year was better than the first. Fourth quarter system sales growth of 6%, same-store sales growth of 3% and core operating profit growth of 5%. Each a peak quarterly result for the year. Taco Bell was a major contributor to the quarterly improvement, with a 9% system sales increase driven by an impressive 6% same-store sales growth. Not to be left out, KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution, ended the year on a high note with 3% same-store sales growth and 5% net unit growth, driving 7% system sales growth in the quarter. Before moving on, just a quick update on the impact of our Grubhub investment on EPS. Net for the full year, the mark-to-market of our Grubhub stock had a positive $0.03 impact. In the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market had a negative $0.41 impact. We\u2019re very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub in the US and the national launch of delivery today with Taco Bell and later this year with KFC. We will continue to update you on the mark-to-market adjustments each quarter. Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our guidance for full-year 2019. Consistent with our communications during our investor and analyst day in December, we anticipate net new unit growth of approximately 4% and same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. Our full-year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high single digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of three factors. First, the rolloff of special media spending in 2018 due to the Pizza Hut transformation agreement. Second, rolloff of the KFC US acceleration agreement expenses. And third, the expected recovery of the KFC UK business. There is no change to our guidance from estimated run rate net capital expenditures of $100 million and G&A of 1.7% of system sales in 2019. Regarding our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, since we issued this guidance in 2016, we have seen continued strong performance at both KFC and Taco Bell, though clearly weaker than originally anticipated performance at Pizza Hut. Thus we remain on track to deliver this goal, owing to the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As a reminder, the $3.75 does not include any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items we might incur nor any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. That said, I\u2019d like to provide a little more color on two of these items. At this time, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019, and on top of the $3.75% guidance, to be approximately $0.06. We also estimate the impact of FX rate movements to be a $0.04 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts, which will undoubtedly vary over time. We plan to update you on our FX estimates quarterly. Now, turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, being more focused means we are maniacal about our four key growth drivers as they are the key to achieving our bold aspiration of 7% systems sales growth. Second, we are pleased to report we have reached our goal of becoming at least 98% franchised, with 856 company units as of the end of 2018. Putting this effort into context, from fourth quarter 2016 through 2018, we transferred over 2,300 units in exchange for $2.8 billion in pretax proceeds with over 160 individual deals to 3C franchisee partners who are excited about our future. These partners are committed to providing consistently bold value and our brand strategies, are capable, able to deliver great customer experience and operational standards and, finally, have capital both to grow new units and modernize existing assets. Third, we remain on track with our commitment to being more efficient, reducing G&A to 1.7% of systems sales in 2019 and run rate net CapEx of $100 million as I mentioned earlier. As for our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the three-year period, 2017 through 2019, we remain firmly on track. During 2018, we repurchased 28 million shares for $2.4 billion at an average price less than $85. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.2 billion through the first two years of this program. Additionally, we are pleased to have recently announced our quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 for 2019, representing a 17% increase. While on the subject of capital, we\u2019re very encouraged by the debt market support for our business model and capital structure. Despite broader market volatility during Q4, we successfully issued $1.45 billion in notes through our Taco Bell whole business securitization. As you know, the securitization market is just one of the multiple markets we access. The transaction was well received and over 2.5 times oversubscribed. It was upsized and reflects some of the tightest spreads ever obtained through a whole business securitization. Proceeds were used to refinance existing securitization debt and fund a portion of our capital return.  Now, let\u2019s discuss our growth drivers, beginning with unmatched franchise operating capability. At the KFC division, overall customer satisfaction scores increased by 3% during 2018. We have continued to invest in our franchise know-how by rolling our operations college across the globe to build capability. The taste of our food is a key differentiator for KFC. Therefore, we are increasing our focus on the role of the cook and enhancing standards around the core. And lastly, we are continuing to make it easier for our customers to enjoy original recipe through the continued rollout of click and collect kiosks and delivery. Our goal is to have 5,000 restaurants with kiosks and over 70% of our restaurants offering delivery by 2020. Just as promising, these enhancements are occurring at the same time our franchisees upgrade and modernize existing assets. At Pizza Hut US, the team and franchise partners have made improvements in three key areas of the customer experience. First, by delivering a hot fast and reliable pizza. We have improved our average delivery time by three minutes and increased customer satisfaction scores. Second, since the kickoff of Hut Rewards and updates to our mobile app in late 2017, we have been squarely in the digital game. We have over 12 million active users in the loyalty program and hope to be adding more as our off-line channel gains momentum. It\u2019s an impressive achievement, considering we rolled out the program in the second half of 2017. Pizza Hut also announced during the fourth quarter that, for the first time ever, Hut Rewards members can earn points for in-store purchases. The brand truly doubled down last year with 2 points awarded for every dollar spent. At Taco Bell, Julie Masino is doing a fantastic job leading the US division and working with our franchise partners. Their focus on excellent execution is generating operating profit growth, while offering customers faster service and a better experience. In fact, the speed of service has improved three seconds at lunch and two seconds at dinner, Q4 year-over-year. Unlocking transactions and sales growth during peak service hours, which helped drive over 4 million additional transactions during the quarter. Their results show that our franchisees have really embraced our initiative of easy and we're excited for what 2019 holds for this cult favorite. Next, let\u2019s talk about bold restaurant development. During 2018, we opened 3,021 gross restaurants and 1,758 on a net basis, excluding Telepizza, which I will talk about next. This is truly a step change in pace, representing an approximately 50% increase in net new unit growth from 2016. This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset, which you've consistently heard us discuss, can generate improved results. There is no single driver of the increase, but rather a holistic approach toward unlocking profitable franchisee-led development, supported by improved unit level economics. We\u2019re very proud of the teams and franchisees that are making this happen and believe that, by leveraging our scale and expanding our capabilities, we can continue to improve franchisee unit economics, which we all know drives unit growth long-term. Before we move on to unmatched franchise operating capability, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. This landmark deal places Pizza Hut in the number one position within the category across Latin America and Iberia in terms of unit count, confirming Pizza Hut's position as the world's largest pizza restaurant company. As the deal closed in December, it had no significant impact on our P&L in the fourth quarter. 1,282 Telepizza units are now included in our new master franchise agreement with Telepizza and are included in our overall unit count and have begun paying a fee to Pizza Hut. Of these stores, we anticipate between 100 and 150 may close due to overlap. Finally, there is an ancillary agreement for another 126 restaurants that are not included in the master franchise agreement. These non-MFA restaurants will effectively pay a small fee to Pizza Hut, but will not be included in the unit count unless and until they are converted to the Pizza Hut brand.  Post-closing, our estate transformed to nearly 90% off-premise focused assets within the Telepizza regions. We are excited for what this means for development as Telepizza has agreed to add least 2,500 units to the alliance over the next 20 years. To summarize, the transformation we started in 2016 is already making Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. We achieved our goal of 98% of restaurants being owned and operated by franchisees and they're on track to deliver our commitments for the transformation. With three category-leading brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale, expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout 2019. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great, thanks for the question. David, congratulations on your promotion. Just wondering if you could just spend a bit more time talking about the accelerated unit growth potential for the business going forward? Another good quarter and good year of growth. Maybe just a bit more on the confidence going forward, which regions may be, to some extent, if you could talk high-level, that comes from \u2013 is it going to look a lot like it did in 2018? And just whether or not there are any other macro challenges and certain parts of the world had any kind of impact on your expectations? And then, I guess, just the last part of that, obviously, Telepizza just closing now. But just given the experience thus far, just checking in on your appetite to do more acquisition and conversions potentially in the future across brands. Thank you. David Gibbs : Well, thanks, Dennis. Yeah, I think, obviously, development is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the Yum! story. So, let me give you a little more color on it. Our guidance for 2019, as you know, is 4% as that's clearly the most likely outcome that we see. Embedded within that guidance as normal is tailwinds and possible headwinds.  From a tailwind standpoint, and getting at your question about regions of growth, we are really encouraged by the fact that we're seeing widespread development. If you look back at years passed, a lot of our successful years in development, none of which reached the levels we reached this year, were driven by China. But this year, China has played a much smaller role in us achieving what is a record for Yum! on units. That's because, around the world, we are seeing good unit-level economics, which is driving our franchisees to build more stores. We're spending more time supporting them in this effort and making sure that we\u2019re picking the right locations with more sophisticated market planning tools and being as efficient as possible with our capital spend. So, we've got some great tailwinds and as the development program is becoming more widespread and cuts across really just about every market that we operate in. As far as possible headwinds for 2019, we have this transition of the Pizza Hut dine-in estate to more of a delivery-focused estate and, obviously, that involves closing and opening stores. And during that churn, we may see more closures perhaps than we anticipated in the short-term at Pizza Hut. So, that's something as a possible headwind that we'll keep our eyes on. And then, I guess, the other possible headwind, for those of you who listened to the Yum China call, is their guidance for 2019 would imply a deceleration in unit development for them, although their guidance was consistent with their guidance from last year. So, another thing to just keep an eye on is the number of units coming out of Yum China. And then, I think there's a final point on development. Not considered in the guidance, likely not a big issue, is what I talked about with Telepizza. There's a potential for 100 to 150 units \u2013 that's our best guess right now \u2013 to close between Telepizza and Pizza Hut where there is overlap in a particular trade area. Obviously, there's going to be a lot more work that needs to be done to dig into that, identify exactly which stores would stay open and how that all plays out. But at the same time, I also highlighted there's 126 units that are not in our unit count today because they're not in the MFA, but our Telepizza stores that have the potential of being added to our unit count. So, those two things potentially could roughly offset each other. They're not really considered in the guidance. But as we learn more about those stores and the overlaps and the additions, we'll obviously update you on this quarterly call. As far as your final question on the Telepizza transaction and do we have more of those in the hopper, what I would say is we are really pleased with the Telepizza acquisition. The management of the Telepizza business is first class. We love having them now as our master franchisee in the Yum! world and we think that is a template for more deals that we can do. And we know that all of our brands are out there looking for deals like that. So, a lot of people that want to join the Yum! system and we hope to take advantage of that, be selective in adding the right people, but certainly something that we hope to have more news for down the road. I would just end on the development front by saying there's strong momentum in the business. Our tools for development are getting more and more sophisticated as we can parse data to figure out to where to put stores to be the most profitable, and it's widespread momentum. And as you've seen so far, the surprises tend to be on the upside. So, we're excited about development going into 2019. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit more about the strength in the Taco Bell business? The QSR industry trends just were not that strong in the third and fourth quarter, but Taco Bell is clearly a standout. Is your breakfast business performing exceptionally well? Is that where you're taking share? Or if you could just maybe describe again in more detail the pockets of strength in the Taco Bell business as you see it? Greg Creed : Yes. Sure, Brian. I think to reflect on what David said, this is the seventh year of positive same-store sales growth for Taco Bell. So, the success of Taco Bell has been in place for a long time. Obviously, we had an acceleration in the back half of the year. We had 6% same-store sales growth for the back half and, obviously, a 9% system sales growth is a great number to finish the year on. There's no silver bullet. That team, led by Julie Masino, is just doing a great job across the board. We are known as the value leader. We are known as the innovation leader. As David said, we're running great operations. The assets are in great shape. The franchisees like their restaurant-level margins. And so, I think when you add all that up, you just get a performance \u2013 a consistent performance for the seven years that Taco Bell has delivered and we believe will continue to deliver. So, the brand is in great shape. Even the delivery advertising which will launch today, I had a chance \u2013 we were at a Taco Bell a couple of weeks ago. I've seen all the marketing around the advertising supporting the Grubhub launch. It's as good as any work I've ever seen come out of Taco Bell. So, if we can accelerate our growth in delivery, I think that's all positive. So, they're just doing everything right led by a great executive team and a great president. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Chris O'Cull: Yes, thank you. My question relates to the Grub partnership. Greg, are there any differences in the consumer experience between Taco Bell because of their partnership with Grubhub compared to maybe other fast food chains that have relationships that aren't as close to their third-party provider? And then, also just wondering why KFC has been a little slower to rollout delivery than Taco Bell and whether you believe it can be as impactful to KFC as Taco Bell? Greg Creed : It\u2019s like everything. You have to put the foundations in place before you let the, I guess, the horses loose. In this case, getting POS integration in place is really important. And so, obviously, we've spent a lot of time with Taco Bell and Grubhub getting the POS integration done. That's now complete and that's, obviously, why we're launching it. Working on the KFC team to make sure that integrated first. We don't want to go out and blow out without the integration because we know, with great integration, it improves speed of service, it improves order accuracy, it does everything that the customer wants. And so, you can say we've got a little slow. I would say we've gone a little slow early in order to accelerate going forward. So, I'm very excited about the launch day for Taco Bell. I'm very excited that more KFC restaurants will come onboard before the end of 2019. And all indications are, certainly in the early days, higher check, incremental transactions, all of that bodes well for both brands in the US. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles of Cowen and Company. Andrew Charles : Thank you. And, David, congrats on a well-deserved promotion. I know you've talked about Telepizza's neutral impact expected to 2019 EPS, but can you walk us through the mechanics of this? Presumably the system sales will grow with roughly, as you finalize at 1,100, 1,200 new stores, is the expectation that this will be offset by a pronounced deterioration in the effective Pizza royalty rate or, separately, can we expect elevated franchise and license expenses or elevated G&A to lead to the EPS neutral impact? David Gibbs : The impact on profitability being neutral is really from the fact that we are contributing into this alliance some of our Pizza Hut's franchise stores today and, therefore, we're reducing the royalty we collect from those stores. So, we get less royalty from the stores we're contributing, we get the royalty from the stores that Telepizza is contributing, and effectively, from a rounding standpoint, it's neutral. We do think, long-term, it will be accretive because we think it will accelerate the rate of our growth. And to your question about G&A, obviously, most master franchise agreements, the master franchisor, in this case Telepizza, actually carries the G&A to manage the business. That's why we take a lower royalty. So, we don't expect any increase in our G&A. In fact, it would be the opposite. Our G&A over time will go down covering those areas as Telepizza gets up to speed on the business. Keith Siegner : Thanks. Operator, we have time for one question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Gregory Francfort : Thank you. And just, David, can you talk about \u2013 as you've taken on the new responsibilities \u2013 what your key priorities will be and where you see the biggest opportunities for the business? David Gibbs : Yeah. As I shift to more of this President and Chief Operating Officer role, my priorities are the business priorities. We've transformed this business to being more a franchise business. Obviously, franchise unit economics are at the center of everything we do and I want to make sure that we're transitioning the way we approach the business, and we are seeing evidence of this everywhere we go, so it's not a concern. But I want to make sure we complete this journey to being a world-class franchisor, putting our franchisees, their unit economics, front and center at everything we do. So, I'll be spending a lot of time in the field with our field teams and with our franchise partners as I get up to speed in the new role in 2019 doing just that. I think the business is in great shape, obviously. I don't have an agenda for massive change. We are on the right path. And I think Greg and I and the entire Yum! and brand leadership teams are really excited about putting a bow on a good 2018 and moving into 2019 with some momentum. I'll turn it over to Greg now for just a few closing comments. Greg Creed : Thanks, David. So, first of all, I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. We are proud of what our teams and our franchisees accomplished in 2018. Combined, we opened up more than 300 more organic restaurants in 2018 than we did in 2017. We closed [indiscernible] transformative deals that should drive profitable system sales growth for our franchisees, Grubhub, Telepizza, QuikOrder. We made material progress on all of our 2016 transformation goals, including, as we have said, completing our refranchising program. I'm pleased to add that we closed out 2018 on a high note with Q4 being the best quarter of the year in terms of same-store sales growth, system sales growth, and core operating profit. So, heading into 2019, we remain confident we are going to deliver on becoming a more focused, more franchised, and more efficient, all of which will deliver more growth and further strengthen our powerful and unique business model. Thanks for joining us on the call today. David Gibbs : Thank you, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Second quarter 2019 earnings will be released on August 1, 2019, with the conference call on the same day. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. This quarter marks the start of the third and final year in our transformation of the Yum! Brands. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year, with first quarter system sales growth of 8% including 4% system sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our four growth drivers increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continue to fuel these results. As usual, David and I will walk you through the lens of these four key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our relevant, easy, and distinctive brands or as we say RED for short as well as unrivaled culture and talent. Then, David, will discuss bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. I'll begin with our three RED brands. In the first quarter, KFC division delivered system sales growth of 9%, with same-store sales growth of 5%, and net new unit growth of 6%. This global powerhouse saw widespread strength coupled with standout performances in some of our larger markets, as well as a tailwind from lapping the distribution disruption in the UK last year. Internationally call-outs for the quarter include Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Africa, and China. And you'll notice as I give some details, there are consistent themes value and innovation working well together. Japan and Indonesia led the way each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan's 15% same-store sales growth was driven by the well-received share pack as well as lunch value deals and Hot and Honey Chicken on-the-bone innovation. Indonesia\u2019s 12% same-store sales growth was driven by value and innovation with Big Box value counterbalanced by the Combo Superstar Innovation. Australia' same-store sales grew 6% on the back of the dual layer value combined with core product news. And Africa where 10% same-store sales growth came as a result of strong value promotions such as the streetwise mix coupled with an innovative Zinger chutney sandwich. Importantly these markets maintain momentum in development while generating this strong same-store sales growth. Now the KFC U.S. where same-store sales grew 2%. We started the year off with a continued focus on value by introducing a new Channel for Ala Carte menu items offering our original Famous Bowls for just $3 and two chicken littles for $3. Both offers drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers flexibility to build their own meals. We then followed this up with new options in both the $5 fill-up and $20 family meal offerings. Operational enhancements such as a new menu board design and delivery through Grubhub each positively contributed to first quarter sales.  We now have 2,200 KFCs offering delivery and 3,200 restaurants available for click-and-collect on the Grubhub marketplace. We're excited about the operational ease and the increased check growth for our franchisees and we look forward to the nationwide launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later this year. Lastly, KFC continued its campaign of distinctive and truly breakthrough marketing from the KFC innovations lab. Moving onto our Pizza Hut division. In the U.S. same-store sales were flat and system sales declined 1% due to a net new unit decline of 1% as we continue to transform our asset base from dining to off-premise focused assets. Pizza Hut U.S. continued to provide compelling value to customers by maintaining our $7.99 large two topping Pizza deal and the $5 line-up. The $5 line-up which features favorites like a medium one topping pizza, garlic knots, wings, and cinnabon mini-rolls helped drive traffic and provides a pipeline for future product innovation. In March, we added a new teammate to the line-up with our pepperoni pizza ensuring our best innovation is accessible at a great price. As we've continued to reiterate for both the U.S. and the international businesses, sustainable improvements in sales growth will remain a slow build as we update and reposition the asset base and make the messaging more distinctive. We're encouraged by the steps we've taken to enhance assets, provide value offerings, and improve operations to help our franchisees succeed. With that in mind, we're excited about our partnership with Grubhub and the opportunity to leverage the Grubhub marketplace as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut. We ended the first quarter with over 200 locations on the Grubhub marketplace. While customers are placing the orders on the Grubhub website, Pizza Hut delivery drivers are completing the orders. Now onto Pizza Hut International. System sales grew 13% in the quarter including a benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales were flat. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Hong Kong. As one example, Malaysia delivered a very strong same-store sales growth at 6% with their dominant value offering I buy one get one promotion. In regards to development, we continue to find success in our off-premise focused asset options including Delcos, fast casual Delcos, and express units. As we mentioned during our previous earnings call and at our Investor Day last year, the gap between dining channel sales and off-premise is significant with the U.S. and international seeing roughly seven points and six point differentials between the two channels respectively. In order to enhance the assets we view as the future of the brand, we're leveraging best practices from our strongest markets to provide targeted compelling options in our off-premise focused asset options. Last, but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 3%. Encouragingly the U.S. same-store sales grew a healthy 5%, they talked about international caused the division to round down to 4%. Starting with the U.S., we began the quarter by showcasing $1 and $5 value and finished the quarter with innovation. Taco Bell continued to double down on value in the U.S. with the $1 Grundy burrito and the Double Cheesy Gordita Crunch Box. Our famous Nacho Fries came back for again for a limited time and was so popular that yet again one in four orders contained fries. We then finished the quarter off strong by introducing a new limited time offering steak rattlesnake fries, our signature season fries with marinated steak keep that with a bit of creamy jalape\u00f1o sauce. Of course not surprised the Qu\u00e9date [ph] but they're also awesomely spicy. The official launch of Taco Bell's delivery has been very encouraging. Having launched with marketing support in February franchisees are all in on this major initiative and are very excited about delivery as an opportunity to drive incremental sales and transactions. Given its early days, we aren't going to provide specific data, but I will say that both traffic and check saw benefits from the launch. Customers are also loving a new way to get their favorite Taco Bell products. Feedback has been positive plus the strength of our partnership with Grubhub has allowed for real time feedback and learnings to continue to elevate the customer experience to even higher levels. Delivery is now live in over 4,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available on all tacobell.com and Taco Bell App while we're also expecting this functionality through Grubhub. The Taco Bell International there's a lot to be excited about. We expanded into the first new market of 2019 with the launch of Taco Bell Thailand where we hosted a launch party that generated nearly a half a billion impressions. Borrowing from the U.S., we introduced value boxes around the world which drove growth in the UK, India, and Japan. The UK opened its fifth restaurant in Central London and the \u00a35 Taco Box was a success. India maintained momentum with positive same-store sales driven by their launch of their Big Bell Box. And Taco Bell's dedication to their purpose to feed people's lives with Moss is shining through and we are proud of the team and our franchise partners who work hard to bring this iconic brand to life. Now to unrivaled culture and talent. As you've heard me say before, our two most important assets are our brands and our people. For us unrivaled culture and talent is a true competitive advantage and we'll continue to focus on fuel results and accelerate growth. In the 140 markets where we operate, it's our 2,000 franchisees and their employees who are delivering the customer experience at KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. In fact, recently in Europe, David and I launched our next-generation leadership development course for franchisees and employees called Inspiring Culture to fuel results. This is a program focused on building up our people to lead in a way that makes our three iconic brands relevant, easy, and distinctive from the inside out. Because of the investment we continue to make in unrivaled culture and talent, we're seeing the strong progress and results on the transformation and setting a healthy foundation for sustainable growth. In conclusion, I'm excited about the work we're doing with world class leaders focusing on our four key growth drivers to build a world with more Yum! We remain confident as we relay the foundation of our transformation strategy to maximize shareholder value. And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Today I'll discuss our first quarter results, a remaining transformation initiative and two of our four growth drivers bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. To begin, our first quarter results. Consistent with our expectations, core operating profit growth increased 12%. And as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 4%, and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution with 5% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 9% system sales growth in the quarter. It's great to see KFC offer such a strong start under new CEO, Tony Lowings. They're leaning in on same-store sales growth on top of what is already a development machine. Contribution to the KFC strength this quarter were broad-based. Japan, Indonesia and Africa which together represent 9% of KFC system sales performed particularly well. Easier laps at KFC UK were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another solid quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% same-store sales growth including 5% in the U.S. As a reminder, our first quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC UK business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2 thereby having a full-year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum! Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter, and 2% for the full-year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 5% for the second quarter, and 1% for the full-year. Now I'd like to discuss our guidance. We remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm. As it pertains specifically to 2019; our full-year core operating profit growth guidance of low-double-digits is slightly above our longer-term algorithm for high-single-digit growth in 2020 and beyond. This upside is primarily a result of three factors. First the roll-off of special media spending in 2018 related to the Pizza Hut transformation agreement; second, the roll-off of the KFC U.S. acceleration agreement expenses; and third, the expected recovery of the KFC UK business as we just discussed. I'll now update you on our EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus the adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, any special items, and any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. We estimated the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on top of the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements remains $0.04 headwind to the $3.75. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts which will undoubtedly vary over time. First quarter 2019 special items are $0.01 tailwind and first quarter Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are $0.05 headwind to the $3.75 figure respectively. Taking these items into account as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchise, and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018, and with focus on our four growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.7% of system sales in the first quarter and this remains the appropriate target for 2019. As for CapEx, at our Investor Day we discussed it in three buckets run rate CapEx, targeted new equity units to spur additional growth that we would fund through refranchising of comparable number of units, and potential strategic investments outside of a run rate that would create incremental value for shareholders and franchisees. I'd now like to elaborate on our thinking for 2019 including two positive updates. First, given strong returns on new equity builds, we see attractive opportunities to increase equity unit development to spur additional growth and generate excess returns. Again these incremental units will be funded by a corresponding increase in the number of units refranchised, so our overall equity unit count remains unchanged. Second, we're now even more convinced there are attractive opportunities to lean in on strategic investments to generate faster growth and incremental value particularly as it pertains to technology. Importantly, much of this strategic spend is being or will be reimbursed by our franchise partners for services related to technology. Now of course these initiatives will drive gross CapEx higher near-term and we now estimate our gross CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $225 million inclusive of base CapEx, new equity builds, and strategic investments in tech projects. However on a net basis meaning gross CapEx net of refranchising proceeds, we estimate closer to $125 million or only slightly higher than we've previously discussed. Please note 2019 does include a small incremental benefit from timing as we collect certain trailing proceeds related to our previous refranchising initiatives. One consequence of this outlook is that CapEx may exceed depreciation and amortization over the next few years which could push our free cash flow conversion below 100% depending on the absolute level of spend in a given year. To be clear, we're excited by recent returns on investments beyond our base CapEx and believe that through a measured approach, we can enhance growth and value creation for both our franchise partners and shareholders. As for capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the three-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $106 million at an average price of $94. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.4 billion in over two years of this program. Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with unmatched franchise operating capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. As I recently had the opportunity to attend their 2019 Franchise Owners Forum where franchisees from all over the U.S. share their enthusiasm for the brand. I'm truly impressed by the spirit, the positive spirit, and growth mindset of all these franchise partners. In regards to operating initiatives, their fast and friendly obsession is all about world-class service to our customers not simply speed and efficiency. This is exactly why initiatives like this are so powerful because of efforts like this by our franchise partners, restaurant managers, and employees that customer satisfaction and friendliness increased by two points year-over-year. Lastly during the quarter, each of our service measures improved with the highlight being transaction times dropping nine seconds from the previous year. At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our hot fast and reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we've improved our percentage of orders delivered in under 30 minutes by three percentage points year-over-year. At Pizza Hut International, we're continuing to run workshops on speed and taste with our franchise partners. As a result, overall customer satisfaction scores have improved in these markets which include India, France, Indonesia, and Australia. Each increase their overall customer satisfaction score by 5% or more. KFC continues to drive taste as the key differentiator for the brand with a focus on elevating the role of the cook. This year we are hosting Taste Talks across the globe to ensure finger licking good quality in every bite. We have seen improvements across the board on sharing proven ideas and global best practices such as open kitchen tours and Fast Fridays. Each of these examples show how we are leveraging our scale to adopt and share the best ideas. Next to bold restaurant development. During the quarter, we opened 310 net new units. This represents a step-up in development from our recent historical rates, keeping us on track for 2019 to be the fourth consecutive year of increasing net new unit openings. At KFC, strong development trends continued into 2019 with 265 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, and Latin America, and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth, while at the same time we continue to transform our asset base to the American Showman Image. We closed out the quarter with over 1,500 American Showman restaurants across the country as 65 remodels were completed in the U.S. during the quarter. Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 23 net new units during the quarter. Among those four urban and Cantina asset formats opened including restaurants in New York and San Diego where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash returns and outperforming our closest competitors. Internationally, Taco Bell opened 10 new units in markets such as Japan, Thailand, India and the UK. Lastly, I want to give an update on our international growth alliance with Telepizza. The integration is off to a great start with our transition tasks largely complete. Specifically, we're pleased Telepizza has worked closely on transferring and integrating Pizza Hut franchisees into their systems. Further even during the most intense period for integration, Telepizza reported positive net new unit growth and has begun converting Telepizza units to the Pizza Hut brand. As a reminder, we still anticipate between 100 and 150 units may close over time due to overlap though minimal of these closures have occurred thus far. To summarize, the first quarter was consistent with our expectations which included future [indiscernible] for the first half of the year. We're pleased with the results as they set us up to deliver on our commitments. The three category leading iconic brands that uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants Yum! is well-positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics, while leveraging our massive scale and expanding digital technology. We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. Now the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Hi, thanks very much. David, can you just go back and just clarify the CapEx increases this year and potentially next year and what the difference between gross and net would be, do you expect franchisee to contribute something to that or do you expect to get returns from that capital and technology because you're going to pay an incremental fee. And what is the metric if you could describe a little bit more just what the nature of those capital -- incremental capital investments are? That would be helpful. Thanks. David Gibbs : Sure, John. We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day, when I presented what the $100 million of run rate CapEx and noted that we were contemplating an increase in equity development and also that we were seeing good opportunities to invest further capital to create more shareholder value and improve the strength of our business. That's pretty much how this is playing out. So the original $100 million of run rate capital hasn't really changed. What's changed is our interest in building a little bit more equity units, all of which will be -- the capital for that will all be generated by refranchising a comparable number of units. In fact the math on that is such that and this is why it's such a great shareholder value enhancing move. We get more money when we sell a store than it costs to build a new store. So we might get on average $2.5 million every time we sell a store and it costs more like a $1.5 million or less to build a new store. So we're seeing sort of an arbitrage opportunity there to help spur development in certain parts of the country particularly with Taco Bell where we do own a decent amount of equity stores. Some of the best examples are in your backyard in New York City where I was a couple of weeks ago visiting some of those great new Taco Bell's that have opened those stores are worth substantially more than what we paid to build them. So we're going to build probably more 40 maybe 50 equity stores this year when the original plans were only to build five to 10. So that's driving some of the incremental CapEx. And then on the other side of the equation on strategic investments, we're looking at things like the recent acquisition we announced in the fourth quarter of QuickOrder where we bought the e-commerce provider for Pizza Hut which I can tell you we're just one quarter in but has worked out incredibly well. Just actually this past weekend, left the Pizza Hut franchise convention and I was talking to some of the Pizza Hut franchisees there about us now owning QuickOrder and they are really excited about our ability to create enhancements real time on that platform and just having a lot more control over their tech future. But on the Pizza Hut platform, for example, there is a significant investment made to purchase that in Q4. It has some follow-on CapEx investment this year, we go through some contingency to the purchase price and then there's capitalized G&A that comes along with making investments in tech companies. So some of that is going to start to show up on our CapEx line. The good news is, as you noted, John, is we are recovering a lot of that -- a lot of our investment through service fees that franchisees pay for these to access these platforms. Again our commitment to the franchise community is we're going to give them the best technology at the best price but you'll see us recover the cost of these platforms which is why we say this is great for our franchisees, for our customers, and for our shareholders. So if you break the $225 million gross down the excess above the $100 million run rate that we had quoted before about half of that is due to equity development and half of that is due to technology and strategic investments. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit more about KFC, such an impressive comp, 5% driven by that international strength. Greg, you drove into a couple of drivers in your prepared remarks lapping the UK issues and we also heard from Yum! China this week. But I'm really trying to figure out more about this inflection and why it happened now and how sustainable it is. Are you really seeing the consumer outside the U.S. start to inflect here and is your delivery initiatives you've talked about for a couple of years outside the U.S. really starting to drive some incremental momentum for you now. Just any other color you can add to that KFC momentum? Greg Creed : Yes, sure, Brian. I think it really, fundamentally starts with our focus on what we call RED, Relevant, Easy, and Distinct. As I travel the world and meet with the KFC teams, they are amazingly focused on making sure the KFC brand is more relevant, it's more easy, and more distinct. Now in some markets, we may go as distinctive and not as good as relevant and others we go as relevant and they're not as good as distinct. But I think the fact that we got absolute just laser like focus on making sure that each KFC Brand in each country delivers on RED. I think that's certainly helping. I think secondly, as I did say in the prepared remarks, I think the value like a pound of food for $3 which KFC U.S. run, that that may sound like simple communication. It's both distinctive and it's relevant. So I think that's great, the innovation that's happening. We're seeing a lot of great innovation, flavor innovation on existing forms and new form innovation also occurring. And then, Brian, as you rightly said, we've got delivery in click-and-collect and equally in the U.S. we're excited that later this year we'll obviously do what Taco Bell has just done which is put marketing muscle and effort behind delivery which we think we will accelerate that. So it's -- there's no silver bullet. It is really doing RED incredibly well; value incredibly well; innovation incredibly well; and a growing contribution from delivery. I think all of that is sustainable going forward and that's why we remain very positive about the KFC brand. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Sara Senatore : Great, thank you. I have a question about Pizza Hut and it's sort of a two-part question. One is I know that you're repositioning the State and it sounds like dine-in is still quite a bit softer to go. But I guess I'm -- when I think about the U.S. so much a carry out and delivery business that the implication is that even that business might still be sort of muted in terms of comps. And I guess I'm trying to understand, is there a scenario where you're repositioning the state that's happening at a time when aggregators are taking away some of the growth that the Pizza category has had kind of to itself for so long. And then the related question is what are you seeing in terms of the customers on Grub find you through Grub versus the Pizza Hut App, is it -- I assume a very different customer base as we've heard from other restaurants but given that Pizza Hut is so well known for delivering Pizza, I was just trying to figure out to what extent the Grub orders are incremental? Thanks. Greg Creed : Sure. Well I just say dine-in does lag by that seven points on the sales growth between off-premise and on-premise and so that is obviously a headwind that we continue to have to work with. I do think that the Pizza Hut brand particularly in the U.S. and internationally is doing a much better job at the foundations or the fundamentals. As David pointed out in his prepared remarks, temperatures improving, delivery times are getting lower. I think all of that is working, we're sustaining and we've got franchisee support to sustain obviously great value, so the $5 line-up. Adding Pizzone which is both great innovation and at $5 obviously I think will continue to help and you will see that play out I think later in the year. With regard to your question on aggregators, I think it's -- there's obviously a negative impact but it's hard to measure what the cannibalization effect is of aggregators on Pizza Hut, on the Pizza category. I think what's exciting for us is that we still think there's obviously a huge opportunity for Pizza Hut in the $40 billion Pizza delivery business to do better. But at the same time, the non-Pizza delivery market in the U.S. is worth about $100 billion. It's growing at 15% and now we're going to leverage Taco Bell and KFC to take advantage of that opportunity. So, yes, a little bit of negative impact but I see this whole opportunity of growth and delivery to be an upside for us not a negative. And as we've only got about 200 stores at the moment which are actually going through the Grubhub marketplace, it's not having a massive impact on our business. But I think the point you made is we are excited by the incremental customers we're seeing come through that marketplace. But obviously the vast majority of the business is still coming through Taco -- through our Pizza Hut traditional business. David Gibbs : Yes, I mean and on the Grubhub piece, I think we are encouraged that there are different customers on Grubhub versus many of the customers that use Pizza Hut directly, so we are accessing customers through their platform in many cases where we wouldn't be able to access. That's why we're excited about the test. Back to the other part of your question, Sara, on the dine-in in the State, yes, Pizza Hut in the U.S. is the vast majority of our business comes through the delivery carry out channels but still close to half the assets are dine-in assets and there is still a long process to take those assets often which are in the wrong part of the trade area and reposition them to the right part of the trade area or if they're in the right part of the trade area and oftentimes upgrading the assets to modern standard. So the challenges of the dine-in in the state are very different internationally versus the U.S. In the U.S., we already have 90% of our business is off-premise but the assets are still a problem. Internationally, half of the assets are dine-in and the business has more of a 50/50 split to it so very healthy assets in most cases around the world though. Before we move on to the next question, I just want to correct a comment from the prepared remarks, some of you probably caught, there was a typo. As far as the 2018 impact from the KFC, UK supply disruption to Yum! that impact was 1% on core operating profit in the second quarter, not the 5% that was stated. So I just want make sure we all set the right number there. Keith Siegner : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. At first and there are two I think relatively small questions, in terms of Telepizza, I mean it has been discussed before that this transaction would be net neutral to earnings. It actually does look like it was accretive in the first quarter. So could you make a comment on that? And if there's some type of thought of what Telepizza will mean to operating income growth in fiscal 2019? David Gibbs : We continue to believe that Telepizza will be neutral from an earnings standpoint. What you may be seeing is the increase in franchise revenues relative to expenses, some of that's more related to QuickOrder than it is to Telepizza. But again we think Telepizza from a long-term standpoint, it's a great acquisition for us, we love their management team and their ability to leverage them over our existing markets and we're excited about how the integration is going and what it means for us from a growth potential. But the impact in Q1 was flat. There really was a profit impact from Telepizza. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : Good morning, thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk a bit more about the QSR promotional or the QSR value environment that you're seeing in the U.S. And if that's had any impact on your value strategy for the balance of the year depending on whether you think the industry becomes less promotional or not. It seems like your brands remain as focused on value as ever currently. So do you think there could be greater benefits as that gap appears on value increases? And I guess just kind of related to that maybe if you could quickly comment just on the importance of franchisee buy-in on value that you're seeing which it seems like your system is seeing better buy-in from franchisees here than most? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes, sure. So there are two parts to the question, look obviously the U.S. economy is in pretty good shape. We also, the GDP numbers for Q1 from the government, look I also do think though there is some sort of bifurcation going on in the marketplace which is there are certainly people that are making a lot of money and there are certainly people where value will always remain incredibly important. And so I think that our focus on as we've said earlier building these relevant, easy, and distinct. Part of being relevant is to make sure we've got the right value proposition for every customer we run in the marketplace. So we're going to focus on value. We're going to focus on innovation. We're going to focus on delivery and click-and-collect as we -- as we've talked about. And it really is sort of how that gets to your second question which is the ability for us to sustain value on all three brands is predicated on our ability to get franchisee alignment. And I think what David and I are fundamentally focused on is making sure that at the core, franchise unit level economics are getting better. And as they get better then obviously franchisees will hang-in on value, they will invest in new assets, refurbishing assets, they'll support innovation. And so, yes, I think the economy is in pretty good shape in the U.S. There are people who are benefiting, people who are not benefiting. We're going to stay on value, we're going to stay on innovation, we're going to stay on building these relevant, easy, distinct brands. And I'm really excited that the brands have worked incredibly hard with their franchise partners to ensure that we can sustain this sort of what I call really strong model going forward. Keith Siegner : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Just one clarification, then a question. On the clarification, David can you tell us what tax rate you've embedded in your $3.75 plus target and whether that's changed. And then my real question is on KFC development globally that number was very strong. If I look back at the history, it's usually Q1 tends to be the low point for the year for the number of units opened. So I wanted to ask is this kind of a timing issue where you're starting to smooth out the openings across the year or is this kind of real momentum in the development cycle. And can we expect that kind of step-up to continue as we look at the rest of the year? Thanks. David Gibbs : Sure, David. On the tax rate question, the guidance for 2019 is 20% to 22% and despite the low tax rate in Q1, we still feel like that's the appropriate guidance for the year. If you look back in past years, we do have a little bit of a cadence of having a lower tax rate in Q1 that's driven mostly by share-based compensation that tends to get exercised in the first quarter. Then on the second question on the KFC Global development, I mean we've been consistent in saying our goal is to ramp up the pace of development. We're pleased with the progress we've made. Obviously, Q1 in recent history was a record quarter for us in terms of net new units. And I do think the development momentum is widespread and will continue. We're confident that we can hit new highs this year versus last year. It isn't really sort of a timing issue. There is a good pipeline of deals for this year and for future years. You saw lot of the upside as in most previous quarters driven by Yum! China. And as I've talked about they're happy with the returns they're getting for KFC China so lots of reasons to be optimistic about global development. Keith Siegner : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our final question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull of Stifel. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Could you guys talk about how customers are using the KFC delivery in the 2,200 stores in the U.S.? I mean what day parts are consumers using, is it more large party orders, individual orders, is it over under indexed with bone-in or boneless product. Any insights into how U.S. consumers are using delivery at KFC could be helpful. Greg Creed : Sure, Chris. It tends to be more focused, the dinner it tends to be larger packs. I always jokingly said, I think the Kernel 60 years ago invented the bucket realizing that one day we'd be delivering it because it's the perfect delivery vehicle. So I think what we're seeing is what we expected to see which is sort of a focus on dinner, a focus on big packs bone-in, and obviously it's incremental. And as I said, I think the bucket is a incredible delivery device. It really delivers piping hot, great tasting food. And I think that's also a benefit that the KFC customer is currently seeing which is getting restaurant quality food delivered to your house. So all going well. I'm looking forward to the launch of KFC delivery in the U.S. later in the year which I think will be an exciting time and we think obviously positive things will come out of that as well. Greg Creed : Okay. Just some closing remarks. First of all, I want to thank you, thank everyone for being on the call today. Second, I'm pleased that we're off to a strong start in 2019. In fact when I look at the metrics that best indicate the underlying health of the business, so those without noise some special items or mark-to-market on our Grub, our investment in Grubhub. I think there's a lot to be excited about. We delivered 8% system sales growth, 12% core operating profit growth, and 18% EPS growth. So I'm very confident that our enviable business underpinned by unrivaled culture will deliver lasting growth that maximizes shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. Thanks for being on the call with us today. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Second, Pizza Hut division and worldwide system sales and net new unit growth include the benefit of the increase in units in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our strategic alliance with Telepizza. Same-store sales growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base. Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP required change resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We did not expect to change in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that 2019 results will include a 53rd week. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback.

We'd like to make you aware of the following changes in upcoming Yum! Investor Events. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of the Form 10-Q filing. Third quarter 2019 earnings will be released on October 30, 2019, with the conference call on the same day. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with system sales growth of 10% including 5% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. Focus on our four growth drivers, increased collaboration and our unrivaled culture continues to fuel these results. As usual, David and I will talk you through the lens of our four key growth drivers. I'll provide an update on our relevant, easy, and distinctive brands or RED for short, as well as unrivaled culture and talent. Then, David, will discuss bold restaurant developments, unmatched franchise operating capability and some additional and exciting news on talent.  I'll begin with our three RED brands. I am thrilled to report that KFC delivered its 16th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. Encouragingly, this global powerhouse is seeing broad based strength across the world with standout performances across many of our largest markets which translated into a truly impressive, global system sales growth of 10% with same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 6% each.  Now, many of you have been asking, what\u2019s fueling the recent broad based performance? Well, there are a number of factors including the consumer is healthy, KFC has a robust digital and delivery strategy globally with over 12,000 restaurants delivering on just one metric.  And broadly speaking, at Yum!, I\u2019ll focus on being a world-class franchisor has led us becoming more intentional about fostering collaboration and leveraging the power of Yum!.  A perfect example of this is the KFC Annual Market Planning Meeting, which is one of the first global collaboration meetings we instituted and which continues to gain momentum and impact each year. In fact at our recent 2019 KFC AMPM had a record number of franchisee and team members in attendance. We also attended the Pizza Hut AMPM earlier this week and I was impressed with how Vipul Chawla and teams are so focused on the things that matter most.  But again, AMPM is a just one example of fostering collaboration to drive results today and into the future. Without question, these forms of the collaboration are a unique competitive advantage for all our franchise partners and team members globally.  Now back to KFC\u2019s quarter. Internationally, sales callouts include, Japan, Africa, Iberia, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, China, Latin America and the Caribbean. You\u2019ll notice I included more markets than usual, but again strength was broad based with eight out of thirteen markets reporting at or above 6% same-store sales growth.  And while each market is unique, the recipe for success has a consistent theme. Its disruptive value coupled with amplified innovation, compounded by an effective digital and delivery strategy.  Specifically, Japan and Africa led the way each with double-digit same-store sales growth. Japan\u2019s 18% same-store sales growth was driven by renewed focus on value and the well-received chicken pack and Peri Peri Chicken innovation. Africa\u2019s 10% same-store sales growth was backed by the Wrapstar Lunchbox value promotion and the innovative Crunch Double Down.  Iberia\u2019s 11% same-store sales growth was driven by continued momentum from strong media campaigns and their third-party delivery partners.  Now, to KFC U.S., where same-store sales grew 2% in the quarter. Continued focus on the core menu items balanced with an accelerated pace of promotion. The quarter began with the innovation, first bringing back the very successful Chicken and Waffles and then introducing Cinnabon Biscuits. Value also remained a focus through launching a new channel for A La Carte menu items, a 2 for $6 Mix and Match.  Combined, our new value proposition drove transactions for the quarter and allowed customers\u2019 flexibility to build their own meals. KFC continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click and collect throughout this year and also expects to launch a branded web experience by year end. We now have 2300 KFCs offering delivery and 3500 restaurants available for click and collect.  We are excited about the operational ease and the increased check through our franchisees and we look forward to updating you more throughout the year. Moving on to our Pizza Hut division, in the U.S., system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 2% and flat unit growth. We are happy to report that transactions for the quarter grew 3%, which is the result of continued compelling value, ops execution and our growing loyalty program Hut Rewards.  As you may have seen earlier this week, in partnership with our franchisees, we\u2019ve updated the $5 line-up to the $5 and up line-up where we will continue to offer the same favorites at more flexible price points.  We expect this to be a win for franchisees by addressing local economic factors, particularly in high wage markets, while customers benefit from their balance of compelling every day value and unique only from Pizza Hut innovation.  While we are pleased with the positive transaction growth this quarter, we understand more clearly than ever that same-store sales growth in the U.S. will continue to be choppy without transforming the asset base.  And following the tremendous recent improvements in operations and technology led by Artie Starrs and the Pizza Hut leadership team, we plan to lean into accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. style to a more modern delivery and carryout-focused asset base. This will ultimately position the Pizza Hut brand for many years of faster growth in t he U.S. We are excited about collaborating with franchisees who are capable, well-capitalized, committed to the brand and who have the growth mindset to accelerate the closure of underperforming dining stores and replacement with new delivery of fast casual delivery assets. By the same token, we also know we\u2019ll need to directly address franchisees who are burdened with too much debt, don\u2019t have access to capital or aren\u2019t committed to the long-term. Thus, in a few cases, some of these businesses will need to be restructured in the near-term to address capital structure and leverage issues, particularly, those franchisees with greater dining exposure.  We view this as a positive move for the brand and David will provide more specifics in a few minutes. Before moving on to Pizza Hut International, I want to briefly update you on our excitement regarding our partnership with GrubHub and the opportunity to leverage it as an additional sales channel for Pizza Hut.  As a reminder, while customers are placing their orders on the GrubHub App or website, Pizza Hut drivers are completing the delivery to ensure a hot stuff and reliable experience. We ended the second quarter with over 300 locations on GrubHub and are planning on expanding the tips further in the third quarter.  While it\u2019s still early days, we\u2019ve found that the GrubHub customers are incremental and some customers are therefore trying our favorable products for the first time.  Pizza Hut International system sales grew 15% in the quarter, driven by a 10 point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year, while same-store sales growth was 2%. We were pleased to see same-store sales growth in places like China, Europe, Brazil, Indonesia and Hong Kong.  I recently visited Latin America and got to see some of our newly converted Telepizza units. I am so impressed with the team and how they are executing at a high level to drive tremendous early results. Internationally, the same-store sales gap between the dining channel and off-premise sales was approximately three points this quarter.  Encouragingly, the smaller gap arose from an improvement in our international dining business as our two largest dining markets, China and the UK performed well. Pizza Hut continues to develop tailored actions planned for our largest dining markets, while at the same time transforming the state for a more compelling off-premise focused asset strategy.  Last, but definitely not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 10% with same-store sales growth of 7% and net new unit growth of 3%. Taco Bell has now reported positive same-store sales growth in 17 of the last 18 quarters including 12 consecutively. So kudos to the entire team for such amazing results.  Starting with the U.S., we continue to have a focus on both value and innovation, starting Q2 with the $1 Loaded Nacho Taco, followed by the $5 Grande Nacho Box and the return of Nacho Fries. The Grande Nachos Box was a particular standout as the amount was extremely high a truly abundant value at just $5 with sales mix peaking at 10%.  We also welcome back Nacho Fries for our fourth faux movie trailer breaking weekly sales records twice during the promotion. The buzz worthy moment of the quarter was the announcement of the Bell Hotel in June. Reservations for a Taco Bell-inspired stay in Palm Springs sold out in two minutes.  Our ALL ACCESS strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 4900 restaurants and expects to have the full U.S. rollout completed this year. Delivery is now live in 4500 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and opportunistic market expansion should increase restaurant coverage over time.  The customer experience has been positive with the number one reasons are getting Taco Bell Delivered! being the craving for the food. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority and we are seeing strong results with over 11 million registered users.  Additionally, click and collect functionality is a vital of the nationwide on Tacobell.com and the Taco Bell App. Taco Bell International saw strong sales momentum around the world, driven by the focus on Cult Icons, Value Boxes at power price points and product innovation. Our value boxes introduced earlier this year continued to drive growth in India, the UK and Spain. India\u2019s positive same-store sales growth was driven by the launch of their Big Bell Box and Quesalupa.  We continue to build global brand awareness by successfully incorporating U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. For example, Canada participated in the Steal a Game, Steal a Taco NBA Finals promotion for the first time and saw fantastic results.  Now to unrivaled culture and talent. As you heard let me say before, we have two important assets, our brands, and our people. We feel great about the level of talent we have and have been very fortunate to be able to promote so many top leaders internally.  As we have mentioned on previous calls, we\u2019ve made the decision to even further strengthen our bench and enhance talent as a competitive environment advantage by investing in new world-class talent. I\u2019d like to start with an enthusiastic thank you to David Gibbs for his incredible leadership as President and CFO over the last three years. He was a great partner to me as we spun-off Yum! China and adopted our financial and business strategy to be more focused, more franchise and more efficient, all with accelerated growth.  Since the beginning of the year, he has won three hats heading the Chief Operating Officer to his responsibilities and leading the brands to impressive results while we undertook a search for a new CFO.  And with that, I am excited to have Chris Turner join the Yum! family as Chief Financial Officer. Chris will begin reporting to me after the filing of our 10-Q on August 8 and will assume global responsibility for finance, corporate strategy, supply chain and information technology. From his time at PepsiCo to his years at McKinsey & Company, Chris is a broad-thinking business leader who brings nearly 20 years of strategy, finance and operations experience.  His deep commercial experience in the quick service and retail sectors, a track record of growth leadership and commitment to culture and talent development make him a perfect fit for the CFO role.  He is also deeply knowledgeable about digital and technology solutions shaping the future of retail which will be valuable to Yum! given the role technology will play as we leverage our scale to improve franchise unit economics and accelerate same-store sales growth and net new unit growth. We\u2019ve also finalized our roles for our brand CEOs as David will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.  And finally, we take our role as a global citizen and our impact on society and the environment very seriously. We have recently updated our Recipe for Good, which outlines our public commitments concerning food, planet and people. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress over the past year when it comes to advancing our citizenship and sustainability agenda to drive socially responsible growth and manage risk better. From working to remove antibiotics in our protein supply chain to expanding our depot expansion commitments to progressing our work around diversity inclusion. I truly believe we are leveraging our scale to help address major global issues.  And with that, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Greg and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our second quarter results, our remaining transformation initiatives, bold restaurant development, unmatched franchise operating capability and some exciting news on unrivaled culture and talent.  To begin, our second quarter results, core operating profit growth increased 18%. And as Greg mentioned, we delivered system sales growth of 10%, same-store sales growth of 5%, and net new unit growth of 7%.  A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution with 6% growth in both same-store sales net new unit growth driving 10% system sales growth in the quarter. Contribution to the KFC\u2019s strength were again broad-based. Japan and Africa which together represent 8% of KFC\u2019s system sales performed particularly well while easier laps at KFC UK were also beneficial. And not to be left out, Taco Bell had another tremendous quarter with 10% system sales growth driven by 7% same-store sales growth. Our second quarter results are lapping the distribution disruptions in our KFC UK business in 2018. We estimated that 2018 same-store sales growth at KFC was negatively impacted by 1% in both Q1 and Q2 therefore having a full year negative impact of 50 basis points for KFC and 25 basis points for consolidated Yum! Additionally, we estimated the negative impact on KFC\u2019s 2018 core operating profit growth was 5% for the first quarter \u2013 for the first quarter, 3% for the second quarter, and 2% for the full year. For Yum! core operating profit, the impact was 3% for the first quarter, 1% for the second quarter, and 1% for the full year. Again, now that we have lapped the disruption, there will be no benefit from easier laps going forward.  I\u2019ll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance, all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016.  Second, as a reminder, the $3.75 target excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates, and any special items, or any gains or losses associated with our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 and on the $3.75 guidance to be approximately $0.06.  Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements is now a $0.08 headwind to the $3.75 number. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecasts, which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date 2019 special items are a $0.01 headwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.01 tailwind to the $3.75 figure respectively. Taking these items into account as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.73. Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchise, and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018, and with focus on our four growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I'll update you on our plans to be more efficient. In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the second quarter while 1.7% of system sales remains the appropriate target for full year 2019. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged from last quarter.  Our ex special items affected tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, which is above the 20% to 22% range we gave at our Analyst Day last December, but follows a 12.2% rate in the first quarter. We are not changing our annual tax rate guidance at this time.  But we wanted to mention that it is difficult to forecast this rate with pinpoint accuracy in the near-term, given uncertainty of equity compensation payouts, as well as a continually changing tax landscape across the over 145 countries where our system sales are generated. We will continue to update you as we progress through the back half of the year. As for our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the three-year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track.  During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $196 million at an average price per share of $104. When combined with dividends, we have already returned $5.7 billion to-date.  Now let's discuss our growth drivers, beginning with unmatched franchise operating capability. I'll start with Taco Bell. Its fast and friendly obsession helped our system and speed and break records in sales this quarter.  In fact, in the U.S., 6 million more cars drove through drive-throughs compared to 2Q 2018 and our guests received an experience that was on average seven seconds faster. This attention to improve speed, customer satisfaction and running great restaurants help the Taco Bell system break two weekly sales records just one week apart.  Internationally, it was my pleasure to visit Italy and Romania, where we spent time with our reigning KFC franchisee of the year, Sphera, a fantastic partner to us in both our KFC and Pizza Hut businesses who recently launched Taco Bell in Bucharest with encouraging early results. At Pizza Hut, we continue to execute on our hot, fast and reliable initiatives. In the U.S., we\u2019ve also perfected the original pan pizza, which is now baked in a newly engineered pan. The use of this new pan results in enhanced flavor, texture and improved customer feedback scores for this iconic fan favorite.  Internationally, we are continuing to run workshops on speed to taste with our franchise partners leading to overall customer satisfaction score improvements in markets including Malaysia, Kuwait and UAE. Pizza Hut digital ventures also expanded its Fast Casual Digital Store platform or FCDS to Japan and Mexico in 400 and 250 stores respectively bringing the total store count to over 2500.  Markets with FCDS with similar technology which also include India, France, Turkey and Malaysia have seen increased online transactions as a result. At KFC, Greg and I had the pleasure of attending a Global Operations Meeting in Dallas in June, which had operators from the around the world in attendance along with both KFC and franchisee leaders represented. The key focus was aligning on strategy when it comes to empowering frontline leaders of our business, our restaurant general managers.  Topics were broad and included ideal equipment design and set up as well as technology options to make life easier for our team members. We were impressed and inspired by the passion of our operators have from improving the customer and team member experiences. It was a great example of how collaborations and leads of best-in-class solutions for our businesses across the globe. Next to bold restaurant development. During the quarter, we opened 312 net new units bringing total net new units opened over the last four quarters to 1897 excluding the Telepizza units added in 4Q of last year.  At KFC, strong development trends continued with 232 net new units. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia, Thailand, Latin America, and the Caribbean. In the U.S., we continue to strive for positive net new unit growth while at the same time transforming our asset base to the American Showman image. We closed out the quarter with over 1600 American Showman restaurants across the country as 104 remodels were completed. Taco Bell continued to grow in the U.S. with 18 net new units during the quarter.  Among those, two Urban Cantina restaurants opened in Manhattan where we are seeing strong cash-on-cash return with 46 Urban Cantina restaurants across the Taco Bell system at the end of the quarter, they represent a strong complement to our existing asset portfolio and will remain an important part of future development.  Internationally, Taco Bell opened 13 net new units in 11 countries and signed massive franchise agreements in India and Portugal. In particular, I am very excited to highlight India and our partnership with Burman Hospitality. This is our largest Taco Bell development agreement today with plans for 600 Taco Bell restaurants over the next ten years, which would make Burman Hospitality the largest Taco Bell franchisee globally.  We are confident in a long runway for growth for Taco Bell International and continue to garner interest from 3C partners around the globe.  At Pizza Hut, as Greg mentioned earlier, we are leaning in to accelerate the transition of our Pizza Hut U.S. asset base to truly modern delivery carryout assets. This will ultimately strengthen the Pizza Hut business in the U.S. and set it up for faster long-term growth.  During this transition, we expect a temporary deceleration in the pace of new unit developments for the Pizza Hut division as continued healthy international unit growth will be partially offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units.  As a result, our U.S. door count to drop to as low as 7,000 locations over the next 24 months primarily driven by closures of underperforming dine-in restaurants before rebounding to current levels and above in the future.  Further we believe that Yum! will still deliver 4% annual net new unit growth on average over the next several years. Although as mentioned, it will probably be a little bumpier than our original plan.  Importantly, the short-term financial impact should be minimal as the closures will be our lower volume stores and long-term that should improve our system sales and profitability as the closed units are replaced with higher volume stores. Outside the U.S., Pizza Hut celebrated its 11,000 international restaurant opening alongside its franchise partner Americana, located at the waterfront development of Dubai Creek Harbor, this brand new fast casual delivery store is a great example of a truly modern asset resonating with customers and driving profitable unit development. As for our strategic alliance, - our strategic growth alliance with Telepizza, the integration continues to go very well. Specifically, we are pleased Telepizza again reported positive net new unit growth and conversions of Telepizza units to the Pizza brand. Next, unrivaled culture and talent. The Board of Directors, Greg, and I are excited to have finalized our roles for our brand CEOs. First, Mark King, former President of Adidas Group North America, will join the company as Taco Bell Division Chief Executive Officer reporting to me effective August 5th. Mark brings to Taco Bell and Yum! extensive retail experience and an excellent track record driving growth, innovation, brand relevance and culture. His unique talents of rewriting the rules for brands to win and fiercely competitive markets will be central to Taco Bell's journey to become a $15 billion brand that transcends the quick service restaurant in retail category. We are privileged to be in a position to add Mark\u2019s high caliber talent to the strong and accomplished Taco Bell leadership team we have in place. Under the leadership of Julie Felss Masino, Taco Bell North American President; and Liz Williams, Taco Bell International President, the Taco Bell team has been delivering fantastic results and has reinforced Taco Bell's stronghold as a Category of One Brand in the U.S. and internationally. Both Julie and Liz will report to Mark going forward.  Second, Artie Starrs, President of Pizza Hut U.S. has been promoted to Pizza Hut division Chief Executive Officer. Artie is a talented growth leader who has made bold moves to galvanize Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees around the transformation agreement, strengthened the brand\u2019s digital and e-commerce roadmap, improved operations and the customer strength and articulated clear path forward to drive Pizza Hut\u2019s growth over the long-term. I am confident Artie will help grow and continue to strengthen Pizza Hut\u2019s competitive position globally and partnership with Vipul Chawla, President Pizza Hut International, who is off to a truly fantastic start and now reporting to Artie.  Third, and rounding up the Brand CEOs, I am pleased to report KFC division Chief Executive Officer, Tony Lowings has had an incredible start. Under Tony's leadership, the global KFC\u2019s system has accelerated the envelope where highly accomplished world-class results across the board.  In summary, the first half of 2019 was a strong start to the year. We always expected a stronger first half owing to less challenging laps than the second half with this quarter\u2019s results exceeded our already high expectations. With three category-leading iconic brands, a uniquely diversified global business and over 48,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics by leveraging our mass of scale and expanding digital technology and delivery.  We look forward to updating you throughout the remainder of 2019. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a little bit of a longer-term question on Taco Bell and actually international development of Taco Bell. There is recently a podcast with Liz Williams who was interviewed by Novak and I listened to yours too, Greg.  But those are pretty good interviews and it reminded me that you have one of your better executives working on that and you just mentioned that 600 unit development deal. I am wondering if India was maybe uniquely fertile opportunity and there be that\u2019s more unique or will there be other development deals around the corner. Thanks. Greg Creed : Sure, David. I think, yes, obviously it was a great deal, 600 units in India and the business in India is doing incredibly well. It\u2019s very relevant. We made it easier and it\u2019s very distinct. I am also happy that, in the UK and Spain, we now have over 50 units in each of those. We have opened four units in Australia right now.  Those are off to a really good start and in fact, both our New Zealand franchisee and one of our Australian franchisees has announced that they will be expanding our presence in Australia. So, I do think we are at an inflection point. I think our plan is to open over a 100 units internationally. Taco Bell this year, which will be the first time are over a 100. So we are seeing good progress. I think the brand is very relevant. It\u2019s very distinct and I think it\u2019s connecting with our millennial audience, not just in the U.S. but globally. So, David? David Gibbs : Yes, I think, and one of the keys to India is, we have been in added in India for quite some time and we now have the perfect partner Burman Hospitality and given the fact that we've been building the brand over time and now we have the right party \u2013 partner with that\u2019s ready for growth. That\u2019s going to always be our challenge around the world is establishing the brand and finding the right partners and as you say, Liz is doing a good job of going out and striking those deals with the right people on building the brands. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. A couple of different questions, I think, related, I mean, we\u2019ve talked a lot about global scale and I just wanted to get a sense of how you view your current franchise community and one thing that we have seen is a fairly common theme is consolidating franchisees around the world, allowing franchisees themselves to have scale from every different perspectives. How much more of that do you think should occur within the overall Yum! system? Is there still an opportunity from here to accelerate unit growth?  And I\u2019d like to ask just because that there is an undercurrent that\u2019s discussed about this, is how you are monitoring the leverage that the franchisees are taking giving you confidence that they can continue or maintain their development even when this cycle eventually comes to an end? David Gibbs : It\u2019s a good question, John. As you know, our franchise-base tends to have the larger typical franchisee has about 25 stores which is much bigger than most in the industry. And there are pockets around the world where we would be encouraging consolidation where we do have a more fragmented base in a country.  But in general, we like the model of having bigger, better capitalized, more capable franchisees. We view that as a competitive advantage that we have really professionally-run organizations helping us to build our brands. But I don\u2019t think we have some \u2013 to answer your question, I don\u2019t think we have some big strategy to consolidate. We already have a pretty large number of stores for a franchisee.  And then as far as monitoring leverage obviously, as part of being a world-class franchisor, we are putting the brands in the hands of our franchisees and we need to make sure that they are all in the best financial health and most capable to grow the brands. That\u2019s a big part of what we do working with franchisees to make sure they have the right kind of financial structure to succeed.  And with 2000 franchisees, there will always be situations that we have to attend to. But in general, around the world across the three brands, we feel like our franchisees are generally in good health. Greg Creed : I think they are also very engaged in their business right now. We had record attendance of the franchisees at the recent three brand AMPM. So, that\u2019s really good to see when they coming to want to understand why the brand is performing well.  What we are doing on a global basis, so we can share best practice. So, I am very encouraged by, I guess, their energy and their commitment to growing our three iconic global brands. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Senatore : Hi, thank you very much. I have a question about Pizza Hut and in particular, traffic versus ticket. You mentioned that traffic grew globally and ticket I guess, the implication was a bit negative. I think we saw this in China.  But are you seeing in other markets as well? In other words, maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes to that comp as you think about the shift towards delivery from dine-in and the impact of aggregators whether it\u2019s just competitors or partners. And then just, a housekeeping, you are going to close some stores.  I know said that will have an impact on unit count in U.S., but shouldn\u2019t that be a tailwind for same-store sales if those are some of the weaker performing stores? Thanks. Greg Creed : Sure. Let me just \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about Pizza Hut and all the brands. I think we had a good transaction quarter. Obviously, as you said, Pizza Hut U.S. trends were up 3, international trends were up run, Taco Bell trends were up 3, and our global KFC trends were also up 3. So, it was a strong quarter from a transaction point of view. I do think, at the same time, value, even though the customer is in a healthy position, value remains a priority and making sure that we don't walk away from both everyday and disruptive value. So it's about finding that fine line between everyday and disruptive value, and obviously, driving transactions.  On the aggregator front, I think what we are clearly learning is that, there are people that are loyal to Pizza Hut. There are people that are loyal to GrubHub in our case. The way to grow our business is to increase reach and penetration. And our ability, I think to partner with both GrubHub and as a party to the sort of Pizza Hut brand enabled just to get broader reach and with broader reach and penetration, we're going to get transaction and sales growth.  So, I hope that answers the question. But we are encouraged by our partnership with GrubHub. I think it's incremental. But at the same time, very focused on transaction growth for all three brands. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thanks very much. Just following up on the transformation in the Pizza Hut US business, just first checking my math. I think it looks like you have got about 7,500 units in the US. So, a net closure of, say 500 over. I guess, the question is, what is that right? Two, over what period of time would you contemplate that?  And maybe most importantly, what do you think the company's role in this is, is there going to be direct assistance in the form of maybe taking ownership in some of the stores at some point in time or some other financial assistance or is this all go through the franchise system and you are just an advisor in that process? Greg Creed : Yes, John, again your numbers are roughly right. I think we have as of the end of the quarter 7,449 Pizza Hut assets in the U.S. Just a clarifying comment on that, 6,100 of those are traditional restaurants and about 1,350 are express units.  I know sometimes, as we calculate percentages of dine-in and stuff, you could use either base, but within our traditional base of 6,100 close to half are dine-in, as obviously as part of the 7,449 it's a smaller percentage.  But, as far as the numbers and how the math works, it's hard to estimate how soon the timing of when a store will close and then, when the replaced unit will open. There will be gaps on some of those certainly. Our goal is to try to minimize those gaps.  So, it's a little hard to pinpoint an exact number, but - and that's why we provided the guidance of the store count at any point in time over the next few years could dip down close to that 7,000. But we ultimately \u2013 we know that the economics of building a modern delivery asset work quite well for us and that any \u2013 for the most part, any area, trade area where a store closes, there should be the opportunity to rebuild the store in that area or somewhere nearby. As far as the capital required to do this, we are committed to the asset-light model at the 98% franchise and we think the economics of building a new unit stand on their own and we should have no trouble getting either existing or new franchisees ultimately to rebuild in these trade areas. But, as we get into the specific situations and sort them out, there may be some situations where we deploy a little capital in the short-term to flip a market and get it in the hands of somebody else and take our capital back out. So we'll update you on that part of the journey as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. And congratulations on such a strong momentum. Maybe a follow-up, David, on that last point on Pizza Hut. Will the closings in the U.S. be in fact lower volume units? So, if there is a net reduction in the units, would that have a smaller impact on the system sales, than on the unit count?  And then, I guess secondly, a bigger picture question about KFC's momentum, which appeared very strong globally. So, just wondering how you are thinking about the sustainability of that trend, given all the drivers, you have in place across all those markets. Thanks. David Gibbs : I'll let Greg comment on KFC and then I will talk about Pizza Hut. Greg Creed : Yes, sure, obviously, David, as you saw the momentum was really broad probably the broadest momentum we've had in KFC. I think I give credit to Tony. We had probably been focused on driving what we call, one extra transaction, one extra occasion from a frequency point of view. And what Tony has got the business focused on, as I said earlier is driving reach and penetration, i.e. broadening the user base.  We know exactly what drives both reach and frequency and what I am really excited is that, he and Catherine Tan, the CMO have pivoted the brand to really helping us drive the reach. And so I think that's also the reason why the transaction growth was so strong in the quarter at plus 3 internationally, which is really half of our same-store sales growth.  So - and at the AMPMs last week, which we sat through, I think David and I was so impressed with the consistency of what we saw. People are focusing on a very clear, simple and aligned global brand positioning.  They are executing it and a lot of the tactics that we saw, I think even across markets developing where consistently strong and I think broad based. So, we feel really good about the leadership of the brand, we feel good about the positioning of the brand. And we feel good about this idea, I think of pivoting a little bit from just trying to drive frequency to driving reach and frequency. David Gibbs : And on the Pizza Hut question David, your assumption is correct. The stores that we would be closing would be lower volume units. So we will have less of an impact on system sales. Just as a little bit more detail on that, if you think about it, we have a lot of stores that were built in the right spots 30 or 40 years ago in the trade area.  But that's not the right spot today to have a modern delivery asset and if we can get those stores closed and then put in the right spot in the trade area for delivery, obviously there is going to be upside to sales for those units and better economics for the franchisee, better system sales and a better image to our consumer. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Thanks for the question. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about Taco Bell's strength including anything additional to share on what you are seeing with delivery? And maybe if there's anything to call out on potential share gains kind of in the lower price point ticket items where maybe some other brands seem to be a little bit softer?  And then, just to that point, looking ahead, any way to help kind of frame Taco Bell's back half of the year in light of the strength last year including any high-level thoughts, Greg, maybe on how you feel about the products and the marketing pipeline et cetera? Thank you. Greg Creed : Sure. I think when you deliver a plus seven on 3 trends you are doing everything really well and I think that's very true of Taco Bell obviously delivery is helping the business. Value continued to help the business. The innovation is really spot on. They are doing great cultural icon things like the hotel, which sold out in two minutes.  I probably had more customer complaints about they couldn't get a room at the hotel than I've had on anything in Taco Bell in the last five years. So, I think they are doing very well. The calendar for the balance of the year looks strong. Obviously, we do start to roll out some pretty big numbers. Q3 and Q4 we are rolling out, I think plus 5 and plus 6.  But I hope, I think we feel good about two year trends hopefully can be, I guess, pretty much where we were - and maybe in the first half or just a little bit were softer, but just a little bit - a little bit softer maybe, yeah. But I still feel good that the brand is in a great shape, doing the right things and we feel good about the long, long-term for this brand. David Gibbs : Yes, I mean just to comment on sales. Obviously, we had a very strong first half of the year. But we do expect trends to return to more of our long-term guidance range in Q3 and beyond as laps get tougher. But we are obviously pleased with the progress in the first half of the year. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks and Greg please add me to the customer complaints about not getting hotel reservation. You know, just following up on Dennis\u2019 questions, it's been pretty well publicized there is a partial shortfall in 10-inch tortilla at Taco Bell in the first week or two of July? And so, you alluded to the stunning 7% performance in 1Q. Can you speak to the scope of the shortfall? And importantly the impact this had on July sales? Any residual drag we should think about as we head into August, just from consumer awareness, the replenishment is still potentially taking hold? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes. Sure, well, the supply issue was limited to 10-inch tortillas, so things like quesadillas and burritos. It was, it was also limited regionally. It wasn't across the whole system. It probably impacted us for about nine days and did it have an impact on sales? Yes. Was it material? No. What we clearly \u2013 was it clearly unacceptable to run out of the core menu item?  Yes. Have we taken them out with our supplier? Yes. So, but I think the key takeaway is, it had an impact, but we don't believe it was a material impact. And we, our objective is to make sure we don't obviously run out of core menu items going forward. Andrew Charles : Thank you. Keith Siegner : We have time for one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner : Thanks for sneaking me in. Can you just talk a little bit more about the accelerating unit openings we are seeing at KFC globally? I know China is helping here. But outside of China, it's really strengthening and you are growing that portfolio at a 6% clip now. And with the strength in comps, it's just hard to see KFC slowing its unit openings.  So, is this just a new normal for KFC? Is it going to be a system sales grower that's consistently above your overall kind of at least 7% trend you think about for your portfolio? Anything else you can say about that would be helpful? David Gibbs : Yes, I think we're really pleased, obviously with the progress we've made on ramping up KFC development and as you know, it keeps getting stronger every quarter. It obviously helped China, as you saw just up their guidance for unit development and that China is having a lot of success with KFC. We are not going to really provide guidance by brand, development and obviously some of the tailwinds we have going on at KFC from new unit development will help offset a little bit of the challenges that will have on unit count at Pizza Hut, which is why we think when you net it all out over the long-term, we will be able to continue to grow Yum! that's 4% rate on average.  As the base keeps getting larger, that means that unit counts will keep going up. But KFC is having widespread success. You can see it in the numbers. System sales growth all - and that leads to better unit economics and franchisees are putting their money behind those better unit economics and building more stores. Greg Creed : Okay. Well, thank you everyone for being on the call today. I am thrilled to be able to share such strong Q2 results with you with obviously broad based contributions from each of our iconic brands driving impressive same-store and system sales growth.  And we have long expected and discussed a slower growth second half of 2019 owing to more challenging laps and the loss of some discrete benefits like lapping the UK, KFC UK distribution disruption.  However, I am confident that our enviable business, underpinned by unrivaled culture will deliver lasting growth that maximizes shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. Thanks for being on the call. Appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Keith Siegner, Vice President, Investor Relations, M&A and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin. Keith Siegner : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; David Gibbs, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Chris Turner, our Chief Financial Operating Officer; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from Greg, David and Chris, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today\u2019s call. Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation for today\u2019s call. First, all system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, Pizza Hut Division and Worldwide system sales and net new unit growth include the benefit of the increase in units in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our strategic alliance with Telepizza. Same-store sales growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base. Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1st, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP required change, resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We do not expect a change in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that 2019 results will include a 53rd week. We\u2019re broadcasting this call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. We\u2019d like to make you aware of the following changes in upcoming Yum! investor events. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the Form 10-Q filing. Fourth quarter 2019 earnings will be released on February 6, 2019, with a conference call on the same day. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed. Greg Creed : Thank you, Keith. And good morning, everyone. Following a very strong first half and in line with our expectations, third quarter results were healthy and consistent with our long-term growth model. Yum! delivered third quarter system sales growth of 8%, including 3% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. While we\u2019re pleased with our results, we know there is always work to be done. I\u2019d like to begin today's call with a few opening remarks, before I hand it over to Chris, who will go over our third quarter results and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then David will discuss our four growth drivers, Relevant Easy and Distinctive Brands as we say RED for short; Bold Restaurant Development; Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability; and then some additional news on culture and talent. Now to start at the top, I am confident that the Board and I have identified the best and most capable person to lead the next phase of growth for Yum!. We\u2019re delighted that David will officially take over as CEO in January. David has been a fantastic partner to me throughout our transformation these past few years. We\u2019ve always shared an unwavering belief in people, their development and our culture and we\u2019ll continue to invest in making Yum! the best place to work. I am also immensely proud of the progress we've made by making both the Taco Bell and the KFC brands RED and accelerating the pace of global unit development. But, there is always unfinished business. And for us that unfinished business includes consistently enhancing the customer experience by ensuring that we have the best people technology and assets. And this unfinished business is probably most pronounced at Pizza Hut U.S. I am proud of Artie Starrs and his team as they continue to make significant progress on many aspects of the turnaround of this business, such as enhancing product quality, improving the speed of service, introducing a loyalty program and upgrading our technology over the past few years. And as we announced last quarter, they are leaning in to accelerate the transition of our asset base to one base with modern delivery carryout assets while also moving aggressively to evolve our franchisee base, so that we can deliver a world class experience every time. We know that some of our franchisees economics are pressured, particularly in higher wage markets. At the same time, others are overleveraged and some simply aren\u2019t the right operating partner for us to grow this brand. We know this transition won't be easy, but we are committed to doing the right thing for this iconic brand over the long-term. To be clear, we have many existing Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that have the capital, commitment and capability to bring the brand to life the right way and we will continue to support and partner with them on the brand turnaround. Of course, this transition will undoubtedly lead to some disruption and choppiness in the short term, and I'm confident that Artie and his team are set to tackle this head on. Now you want to leave the business better than you found it, but also with the knowledge it'll be better after you're gone, and that's exactly how I feel today. We\u2019ve accelerated growth while simultaneously executing a major transformation. And now nothing will give me more pleasure than to watch our brands and each of our employee and franchise partners go from strength to strength. When I got the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Yum! starting in 2015, the goal was to lead our culture to fuel results and continue to build brands that people trust and champion, while driving aggressive unit expansion. This has always been and remains a foundational pillar for me. We then built on this foundation with the separation of Yum! China in October 2016, which was a starting point of our three-year transformation. We became maniacal about being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to generate more growth and create a world with more Yum!. We\u2019re confident we are well under way to accomplishing our 2016 transformation goals. We completed our refranchising program and are 98% franchised. We have demonstrated financial discipline by meeting our goal of G&A being 1.7% of system sales and by reducing run rate CapEx. We\u2019re on track to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases between 2017 and 2019, and we've generated over 80% total shareholder return since we announced the transformation. Additionally, we closed creative and transformative deals to drive profitable system sales growth for Yum! and our franchisees for years to come. We\u2019ve achieved healthy same-store sales and our pace of net new unit growth has nearly doubled since we announced our transformation in 2016. Our work is not finished, but I am extremely proud and I believe the Yum! family is equally proud of what we have accomplished, and we\u2019re even more excited about our future growth potential. And with that it gives me great pleasure to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Chris Turner. Chris Turner : Thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results and our remaining transformation initiatives. To begin the results. Core operating profit grew 6% and as Greg mentioned Yum! delivered system sales growth of 8%, same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 7%. A major contributor to this success was KFC, our largest division in units and profit contribution with 3% same-store sales growth and 6% net new unit growth driving 8% system sales growth in the quarter. Similarly, Taco Bell had another great quarter with 7% system sales growth driven by 4% for both same-store sales and net new unit growth. I\u2019ll now update you on our 2019 EPS outlook and the moving pieces that will impact our reported results versus adjusted EPS guidance all of which is outlined in a table within our earnings release. First, there is no change to our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS which we introduced in 2016. Second, as a reminder the $3.75 excludes any benefit from the 53rd week in 2019, the impact of changes in FX rates and any special items or any gains or losses for marking to market our Grubhub investment. We estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to 2019 to be approximately $0.06. Our updated estimate of the impact of FX rate movements is now a $0.12 headwind to the $3.75 figure. This is because rates have moved against us since we provided the original guidance in October of 2016. This estimated headwind is based on applying current forward rates to local currency forecast which will undoubtedly vary over time. Year-to-date 2019 special items are a $0.02 tailwind and year-to-date Grubhub mark-to-market adjustments are a $0.14 headwind to the $3.75 figure, respectively. Taking these items into account as outlined in our earnings release, the GAAP equivalent to our adjusted 2019 EPS guidance of at least $3.75 is at least $3.57. Now turning to our transformation initiatives to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient in order to deliver more growth to our shareholders. With our target franchise mix of at least 98% having been reached in the fourth quarter of 2018 and with focus on our four growth drivers consistently at the heart of everything we do, I\u2019ll update you on our plans to be more efficient. In summary, we remain on track. G&A was 1.6% of system sales in the third quarter. Additionally, our CapEx guidance is unchanged. For reference, details of our guidance are available on our website in the Investors section. Regarding our capital return plans, our goal to return $6.5 billion to $7 billion of capital to shareholders over the three year period 2017 through 2019 remains firmly on track. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $174 million at an average price per share below $115. When combined with dividends, we\u2019ve already returned $6 billion toward our target $6.5 billion to $7 billion. Last but certainly not least, some updates on unrivaled culture and talent. Elevating our customer experience with digital and technology at the forefront is key to growing our brands. To that end, Clay Johnson has joined us as Yum!\u2019s Chief Digital and Technology Officer or CDTO; and Gavin Felder will be promoted to Yum! Chief Strategy Officer, effective December 1st. These newly created leadership positions will report to me and partner with our brands to accelerate global growth through technology and disruptive innovation. Clay has over 20 years industry experience and comes to us from Walmart, where he served as CIO. In his new role as CDTO, Clay will oversee Yum!'s Global Technology Strategy partnering with our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions. He will lead a coordinated cross-brand effort to accelerate Yum!'s digital commerce strategy, data and analytics and emerging technologies to enhance the customer and employee experience. Additionally he will provide strategic oversight to our global technology risk management and IT shared services teams. These critical connections will ensure that our technology implementations are developed with the security of our data and infrastructure as the top priority. As Chief Strategy Officer, Gavin will be responsible for developing Yum! Brands' long-term corporate strategies and partnering closely with the global brand divisions to implement initiatives to unlock new sources of growth and disruptive innovation. He will work closely with Clay to integrate technology-centric solutions across their operations including restaurant technology strategies to elevate the customer and team member experience. Gavin is a successful digital leader and proven growth strategist. He started nearly 12 years ago in Yum! Restaurants International as a Finance Manager before becoming CFO of KFC Africa and later CFO of KFC Global. In his current role, Gavin has overseen strategy, digital and technology, financial planning, supply chain and IT security of our largest global brand. With that I\u2019ll hand it off to our President and Chief Operating Officer, David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you Chris. We\u2019ll conclude our call today with an update on our on our growth drivers; relevant, easy and distinctive brands; bold restaurant development; unmatched franchise operating capability and unrivaled culture and talent. I'll start with our RED brands. KFC delivered its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. This global powerhouse continues to show broad-based strength from standout -- with standout performances across many of our largest markets. This translated into division system sales growth of 8% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new unit growth of 6%. International callouts include India, SOPAC, Latin America and our Russia business unit which includes Central and Eastern Europe. India delivered 7% same-store sales growth driven by distinctive marketing, promotion of the Zinger Burger and consistent value with the ultimate savings bucket. Australia continues to impress with 8% same-store sales growth, their best quarter in recent history. Drivers included the successful Hot Rods promotion and delivery. Russia, Central and Eastern Europe posted a strong 7% same-store sales growth owing to a Bucket for $1 value promotion and the Finger Lickin' Good spin on a Taco -- Locos Tacos. In the U.S. same-store sales declined 1% in the quarter. We had a temporary loss of momentum with the Chitos Sandwich promotion which led to the quarter's decline. However our value promotion of 2 for $6 Mix 'n' Match provided us with a new channel for \u00e0 la carte menu items and the quarter brought us many valuable insights to improve future performance. We made a splash with plant-based fried chicken alternatives with Beyond Nuggets and Beyond Boneless Wings. The results were very positive. We sold out in five hours and generated $2 billion worth of media impressions - two billion media impressions. Then at the end of the quarter, we launch Mac & Cheese Balls, which builds off of flavors you've already seen, but packaged in the unique KFC style. We're bullish on the future and are excited about our plans for the rest of 2019 and beyond. In addition, KFC U.S. continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click-and-collect. We officially launched online ordering at KFC.com on October 13 in conjunction with the introduction of Kentucky Fried Wings and our Rudy-inspired advertising. We now have 2700 KFCs offering delivery in 3700 restaurants available for Click and Collect. We're excited about owning our own digital channel and the operation ease this provides our franchisees, while Grubhub takes care of the delivery. Moving on to Pizza Hut where division system sales grew 7% with flat same-store sales growth and net new unit growth of 9%. Pizza Hut International system sales grew 14% in the quarter, driven by a nine-point benefit from the addition of the Telepizza units in Q4 of last year. While same-store sales growth was 1%. Importantly, we reported positive system sales growth across all international business units during the quarter. In addition, we were encouraged by 3% same-store sales growth in the off-premise segment of our businesses this quarter, lapping similar 3% growth last year or 6% on a two-year basis. The team is focused on the fundamentals of a modern delivery experience is clearly producing results and a good sign for the future of this business, as we migrate more and more to an asset based positioned to win in off-premise. In addition, the system sales growth gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales narrowed from historical levels this quarter to three points, reducing the drag on our performance from dine-in. In the U.S., system sales declined 2% with same-store sales declining 3% and a 1% net new unit decline. Coming off a solid second quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. business decelerated in Q3 as changes to our value offerings helped franchisee margins, but had a negative impact on transactions. In addition, our previously announced plans to accelerate the transition to a modern delivery asset base in the U.S., while restructuring and upgrading our franchisee base also took a toll on performance. While we strongly believe that these are the right strategies to build the business for the longer term, these moves will introduce some uncertainty in the business performance over the short term, as we expect results to continue to be choppy. We caution, we could see a continuation of soft sales and unit contraction throughout 2020 in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. Of course, we know that when we have great franchise operators running first-class assets that are well positioned in trade areas to serve customers, we win in the marketplace and the Pizza Hut U.S. team is working hard to accelerate this transition. We continue to expand our Grubhub partnership test with Pizza Hut, which is now active in over 700 restaurants. Pizza Hut is well positioned to leverage being listed on the Grubhub marketplace, but by fulfilling delivery orders through our own delivery network. This gives us better control of the customer experience. Last, but not least, Taco Bell where system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 4% and net new unit growth of 4%. In the U.S., innovation and value continue to be cornerstones of our success. Promotions included Stake Reaper Ranch Fries and the return of the Triple Double Crunchwrap, both of which mixed above 9%. But the triple Double was a sound out of the quarter available in a $5 box and a la carte. Our All Access strategy to create a frictionless customer experience is sharper than ever. Taco Bell now has kiosks in over 6,100 restaurants and we launched localized AI-driven product recommendations to efficiently give our customers what they want. TS [ph] results are encouraging with consistent check list and utilization. We see particularly consumer appeal in urban markets. In fact, in Manhattan, TS utilization is over 50% of our company cantinas. Digital menu boards are offered in over 1,000 locations with the new simplified menu. Delivery is now live in 4,800 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. Mobile and online ordering continue to be a priority, and we are seeing strong results with over 14 million registered users. Additionally, click-and-collect functionality is available nationwide on tacobell.com and the Taco Bell app. Internationally, we continue to build a category-of-one brand. We had strong sales momentum around the world driven by focus on iconic core products, value boxes at power price points and product innovation. We saw widespread strength in the Philippines, Japan, Canada and Europe. We continue to strengthen global brand awareness by successfully incorporate U.S. programs into globally relevant promotions. The UK ran Steal a Base, Steal a Taco promotion tied to the Major League Baseball London series generating strong media buzz and sales momentum. Next on to Bold Restaurant Development. During the quarter, we opened 389 net new units, bringing total net new units opened over the last four quarters to 1,876. Excluding the Telepizza units added in fourth quarter of last year. At KFC, development continued to be strong in Q3 with 317 net new units across 52 countries. We continue to see momentum in China, Asia, Russia and Thailand. In the U.S. we've seen more positive momentum and closed our Q3 with over 1,800 American Showman restaurants across the country. At Pizza Hut, as we transition the U.S. asset base, we expect the pace of new unit development for the division to decelerate as healthy international unit growth will be offset by a short-term decline in the absolute number of U.S. units. All in the division opened 17 net new units during the quarter. Pizza Hut International opened 76 net new units with noteworthy contributions from Asia, Latin America, and Iberia. Taco Bell delivered 55 net new units during the quarter. In the U.S. we opened four new urban style Cantina restaurants, hitting the 50 restaurant milestone. Recent urban Cantina openings include Chicago, San Jose, Champaign and Fort Lauderdale. Internationally, Thailand launched a third store which is the first outside expat [ph] communities in Bangkok and China and Australia each opened their fifth location. We're continuing to build franchise development capability through events such as the Development Convention in Guatemala, a four-day event covering development principles and best practices to foster 3C Partners around the world. Next Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. First I'd like to highlight a great executive team and myself had with Joey Wat and the Yum! China team earlier this month. We were excited to learn about the work they're doing to lead innovation across many aspects of the business and as always we were incredibly impressed with their operational execution and overall focus on putting the customer first across all our brands. At KFC, we've seen solid improvements across the board sharing improvement ideas and global best practices when it comes to ops-driven sales enablers. This is particularly the case when it comes to speed. Our franchisees in SOPAC created a competitive speed initiative called Best Friday which was then adopted by the U.K. to great success. At Taco Bell, we're proud to announce this was our fastest Q3 in five years, which wouldn't have been possible without the commitment from over -- from our over 7000 general managers and their teams to deliver unrivaled fast and friendly service. Our summers speed challenge was a huge driver of this success. We were 17 seconds faster and saw three million more cars in our drive-through. At Pizza Hut, we have successfully improved our system average delivery speed, which allows us to deliver hotter pizzas faster to our customers' door. While technology in data science have unlocked key insights, the credit goes to our restaurant leaders and drivers who have been implementing these at the store level to provide a Hot Fast and Reliable expense for our delivery customers. Now to Unrivaled Culture and Talent, Yum!'s two biggest assets are our brands and our people. As we build a world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands, our culture continues to be a strength and is a key enabler of our continued success. We recently completed our 2019 employee engagement survey of all corporate above restaurant employees globally and we scored number one on employee engagement among an elite benchmark of over 300 global companies. 95% of the corporate employees surveyed are proud to proud at Yum! and 91% believe our company is a great place to work. What\u2019s even more encouraging is that we have accomplished these results during a time of significant business transformation. I\u2019d like to finish by saying, how excited I am and privileged I am to serve as the next CEO of Yum!. Under Greg's leadership, we have achieved so much already. Of course, there is still more we can achieve in the future. Everywhere we operate, we need to continue elevating and investing in a world-class customer experience with unrivaled talent modern assets and the best operations with disruptive and innovative technology. This effort will only be realized through a strong partnership with our 2000 franchisees who run our restaurants and over 1.5 million restaurant team members who bring our brands to life around the world every day. When we are our best, we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders. Before we take your questions, I want to personally Greg for his tremendous leadership. As we all know, Greg's been making meaningful contributions to Yum! for the past 25 years. He's been fully committed to developing our talent, increasing our collaboration, elevating our brands and growing our business. Yet most importantly, Greg's vision to take Yum! 's unique recognition culture and use it to fuel even better results is what we will all remember. It goes without saying that Greg's big personality and positive energy make him not only a great leader, but also one of the best partners and friends I could have had over the last many years. There is no question that working with Greg day in and day out has helped prepare me for this next role and also given me a ton of laughs along the way. It's hard to believe that this will be Greg's last earnings call. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, we want to sincerely thank him for the impact that he has made to our business. And we wish Greg and his wife Carol, the very best as they move into this new exciting chapter. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thanks. Good morning and congratulations Greg. And thanks for the funny accent along the way. Can we just talk a little bit about the Pizza Hut business and sort of your outlook? One you talked about some disruption that maybe possible during this period of time, can you be specific about that? Is that sort of lower engagement and franchisees starting to be closing stores? Or what is the nature of that? Two, is there an opportunity for the company again to sort of step in either as an intermediary or as provide some temporary support from advertising in some way to smooth this process better, because I think as you look out over 12 months you want to avoid obviously a disruption. And three, I think there was a callout on the profits of the Pizza Hut business U.S. the drag your detraction from past due receivables, how big is that? And is that something we need to be cognizant of as we think about the next year or so? And does it impact the global core operating profit growth? Greg Creed : Well, thanks John. And I too appreciate Greg's accent and we'll all miss it. As far as your three different questions, I'll take the first two and we'll let Chris talk a little bit about the receivables. As far as the disruption, as you can imagine when we\u2019re closing a lot of stores and opening new stores that can be an enormous distraction, particularly if we are taking the lead on transitioning franchisees out of the system and their stores into the hand of new players. Some of that will get to the receivables which Chris will talk about. And also while transactions are taking place, obviously there's a focus issue in terms of where franchisees' focus is. As far as the company stepping in, and playing an active role in some of this, I wouldn't rule that out, but that's certainly not the plan now. The great thing about the Pizza Hut U.S. business is we have plenty of people that want to get into it and are eager to buy stores and invest capital into fixing those stores and relocating them. So we see our role is more of a facilitator than we do as somebody to be buying stores given our asset-light model. But I do think there could be an opportunity at different points in time for us to take control of some stores as they transition to another party if that's a better way to approach it. So I wouldn't rule that out. And then I'll let Chris just talk a little bit about the receivables. Chris Turner : Yes. John on the receivables side, clearly as you're being an outstanding franchise operator is one of our top priorities. And our stores do perform the best when we have committed capable and well capitalized franchisees. As David just mentioned, we are working to evolve that Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee base and you did see noted that the past due receivables balance did have an impact. But to put it in context, as we transition certain Pizza Hut franchisees, we will see an uptick in that bad debt. But again to put it in context, year-to-date we have reported about $200 million in fee income from our U.S. franchise system and over 95% of that we have either collected or anticipate collecting. Obviously we'll try to minimize the choppiness as we go through this process, but we do believe that the work that we're doing will ultimately be the right thing to strengthen the brand and the overall system. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Thanks. And Greg congratulations on your many years of success and best of luck. One question about technology. I guess given Yum!'s been at the forefront of investment in technology and analystics to really enhance operations over the last several years. Just wondering if you could share some thoughts on the latest benefits that you're getting from those investments and partnerships whether it be Grubhub, QuikOrder, Collider and just how those experiences frame how you're thinking about additional investment opportunities or partnerships, particularly now with Clay in place a CDTO. Thanks. David Gibbs : Well, look I would just highlight from a tech standpoint, we're proud of the work that we've done to-date, but there's a lot more to do. I think like a lot of companies, we have a healthy dissatisfaction in terms of our tech agenda and we're going after it much more aggressively. And Chris can talk a little bit about that. As far as what we've done to-date, obviously, the QuikOrder transaction has worked out quite well. By bringing them in-house, we've been able to improve their capabilities and provide better services to our franchisees at lower costs. The deal with Grubhub has given us great commercial terms for our franchisees and that's allowed us to uniformly launch delivery without having to push back that I think others may have seen both in Taco Bell and the KFC system. But I know, with - one of the reasons, I'm very excited about Chris joining the team and Clay Johnson joining the team is these guys bring a lot to the tech discussion as well as Gavin Felder and I know they've got a lot of plans going forward. Chris Turner : Yes. David, first, we do have the teams in place now, both strong technology leadership in each of our brands and geographies. And then the new additions that we mentioned earlier at the center and Clay Johnson supported by Gavin Felder. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we can\u2019t go into a lot of detail on our future strategies. But just to give a little bit of color, I think there are probably three ways that we could advance technology. One would be evaluating and considering potential acquisitions or investments in Technology Company\u2019s to help leverage our scale, bring those technologies to our stores and our franchisees. Second could be commercial arrangements that we make with technology providers that give our franchisees advantaged economics and taking advantage of those technologies. And then third, given the strength of her team, we'll be developing internally proprietary technologies. So those will be the three ways that we can leverage scale in this area. The areas that will be hunting in range across the full technology spectrum, but e-commerce, data and analytics and any innovations that improve the customer experience and the economics in our stores will clearly be at the forefront. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I was hoping we could get maybe an early view on fiscal '20 development, whether we talk in terms of percentage growth by brand or absolute net restaurant growth by brand, I think it's important at this point to kind of think about whether KFC can maintain or even accelerate its pace as the first point. Secondly, you've obviously made some fairly cautious total unit count comments around Pizza Hut, just want to get a little bit more clarification there. And then on Taco Bell, I think the comments were in the press release 67 gross units in 13 countries. It\u2019s hard to drive scale at those kind of numbers internationally, but are we at the point now where Taco Bell can materially accelerate into 2020? And I'd like a follow-up as well. David Gibbs : Yes. I mean as far as our unit count guidance, we don't historically provide guidance by brand. So I'll talk about Yum! in general. We've raised our guidance previously to 4% net unit growth. We still think that's a right number for the long term. As we've highlighted on the last earnings call with leaning in on Pizza Hut that introduced a little bit more uncertainty into the pace of development. But we still think over the next few years, we will average that 4% unit growth number. As far as Taco Bell, that's actually one of the areas that I think we're most excited about what's going on in international. We by choice focused on a few countries to try to get the pace of development really going in those countries. So you highlight that it\u2019s 13 countries, but when you get a franchisees they sign up to build 600 units in India obviously that can make a meaningful step change to the pace of our development at Taco Bell internationally to just take one example. But we will be expanding to additional countries over time. But I think we're really at the point where Taco Bell International development can start to become a more meaningful contributor to us. And then, as far as KFC maintaining their lofty pace of development, we see no reason why that can't continue and the strength of that brand is something that I would just highlight for everybody on this earnings call. It just continues to be widespread strength with clear brand positioning, a team that's really energized about the growth prospects ahead of us and absolutely believe in our ability to continue to grow and develop and accelerate the pace of KFC development. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore. David Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Pizza Hut U.S. Could you speak to that the financial health of the franchisees? There's been reports about NPC being in being in trouble. Their bonds are trading cheap here. Margin pressure seems to be a key seem across the system. But what are your thoughts about what that specifically means not just to unit growth, but just getting things done to getting the value platform you want to place and just to overall how you're going to move forward in 2020 with that brand? Greg Creed : Sure. As far as the pizza business, I wanted to make sure we all recognize that the Pizza Hut International business is performing quite well, starting to really deliver on some of the things that we\u2019ve been looking for out of that business in terms of moving to a modern delivery asset base. We talked about in the script the fact that they are plus 6% on the off-premise sales on a two-year basis plus 3% lapping a 3%. All of that is a really good sign in terms of the strength of the Pizza Hut brand when it's executed by - in the market. The Pizza Hut U.S. business as we've talked about also previously has some unique challenges given the dining state and the conditions of the assets on the locations of those assets. So that's what we're trying to address by moving to a more modern delivery estate and setting the business up for long-term health. Unfortunately a lot of franchisees or some franchisees have some debt that makes it hard to relocate those assets and that's where we're working through with those parties to get the stores in the hands of the right partners that are well capitalized to grow and build the business. It's not the majority of our franchisees. The majority of our franchisees are good partners and doing a nice job. But as you know the QSR category is facing a lot of wage pressures right now and that is pressuring unit level economics and franchisees economics. But as we always remind people, building a new Pizza Hut is a good investment. The unit economics stand on themselves. This is more about working through with select group of franchisees that may have more debt on their business than they should to get those stores capitalize properly and in the right hands of the right partners. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Senatore : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about aggregators. You had said that Pizza Hut is well positioned to benefit all of your brands, I think from the Grub partnership. But I guess could you give a little more color on that and in particular, the extent to which some of - sometimes what we're seeing is when restaurant companies have unlocked different ordering channels, there are back of house challenges and just because the production capacities maybe don't quite keep up with how the orders come in. So, that was the first part of the question. And then the second was just a quick one on KFC and the Beyond Nuggets and the extent to which you view this as sort of sustainable versus a short-term very healthy list, but maybe less of the core part of the menu. Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. I guess on the question of aggregators obviously, we value our partnership with Grubhub and one of the key features of that partnership to your point Sara is that we integrated the technologies, so that the orders get past directly into our POS systems. That wasn't easy. That was part of the reason. There was a delay in launch. But we think, that does give us a true competitive advantage over a lot of other people that are working with aggregators. So we haven't really had issues that you're alluding to in terms of being able to get the orders to the stores accurately and then back out to the customer. As far as KFC and Beyond Nuggets, obviously we're all intrigued by plant-based meat alternatives and the success that we did with Beyond, the success of that test that we did with Beyond obviously is a good sign. We\u2019ve done other test around the world. That\u2019s not the only one that we' done is the one that\u2019s garner the most press in the U.S. So you can expect more to come on that front. You saw just a couple of weeks ago Pizza Hut launched in the U.S. launched their compostable box and did so with the plant-based alternative meat topping. So, we think there is plenty of application for it, but more to come on that over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Gregory Francfort : Hey. Thanks for the question. Greg, congrats on the retirement and David, congratulations on the new role. My question is just on G&A and you're now kind of running at where you kind of expected to get to a few years ago as a percent of system sales on G&A. And how do you expect this evolving over time as some of your bigger peers are making reinvestments in the technology side? And do you think this is a line that you can continue to leverage? Or do you expect it to kind of flat line or maybe go up over time? I guess any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you. David Gibbs : Thanks Gregory. Good question. As we come to the close on the transformation we've provided the 1.7% guidance for the transformation on G&A. You saw that this quarter we were at 1.6% and so we feel comfortable with how we're closing out the transformation from G&A perspective. There\u2019s been reset to a lower base. I think going forward you could expect a more normal run rate trajectory on G&A. Given the lower base, there will be some timing differences that could create some lumpiness there and we will be investing in technology and other areas, but we do expect in general to get leverage on our sales growth over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations Greg and David. David, questions for you. We're completely post transformation now and I know you have strategic growth plans in place over multiple years that you gave say at your Analyst Day last December. But as you take over as CEO, how do you put your stamp on this company over the next many years. Just anything philosophically on how you think about Yum! Brands under your leadership versus under Greg's. For instance, are you open to making any changes in the portfolio through acquisitions or divestitures? Anything or any insight you can give us on how you're thinking moving forward? Thanks. Greg Creed : Yes. Thanks Brian. Look, I think we're really excited that we're coming out of this transformation with a business that is stronger and better positioned to grow. That's to start. And that is very much due to Greg's leadership over the last five years, as I said in my prepared remarks. Now that we\u2019ve got a better machine, we'd like to drive faster and grow faster. And I'll detail a lot of this as we get into 2020, but just to give you a preview. We've talked about this Recipe for Growth and how it's been fueling our growth over the last couple of years. I think there is an opportunity to lean in further within the Recipe for Growth on the customer experience. We are not consistently executing the customer experience around the world to the standards that we have. We have pockets of excellence. We can be more consistent on that. There is obviously an opportunity on technology which Chris talked about. And then there's an opportunity to better leverage our scale. I think now that we are more of a franchisor, less of an equity operator that gives us the ability to turn our focus to leveraging the scale on behalf of the entire system. We organize in a better way to do that. I think you've seen more collaboration around world, again thanks to again thanks to Greg's leadership in dialing up the collaboration. All of that leads to an opportunity on scale. I do think that potentially could be something that would give us a benefit if we did an acquisition. So, we don\u2019t need an acquisition to grow. Our brands today are strong generally around the world with plenty of growth opportunities, but we certainly wouldn't rule out an acquisition. I think the other thing that you'll see us talk about is as we've talked a lot about the Recipe for Growth. At the same time, we've had what we called our Recipe for Good that our businesses are doing all around the world and their communities, around people planet and food. We\u2019ll talk more about that as we get into 2020 and the way we can dial up our communication on that and our efforts in that area. Keith Siegner : Operator, we have time for one more question please. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. My congrats also to Greg for all you've accomplished at Yum! and David on your new role. My question's pretty simple. I guess just as it relates to the 2020 outlook or 2021 outlook, I am just wondering if you're still comfortable with the algorithms that you've laid out for growth in light of all the Pizza Hut challenges you're seeing. And I guess secondarily, I guess how long do you think this Pizza Hut restructuring or transformations going to take to play out? Is it a one or two year plan? Or do you think it's longer than that? Thanks. Greg Creed : As far as our guidance for 2020 and 2021, we'll talk a little bit more about that on the Q4 earnings call. But in general, we've put in place a long-term growth algorithm that we think we can achieve over the next several years and that's what our business is built for. Certainly some challenges in Pizza Hut U.S. We've pressured that model but at the same time upside from Taco Bell, International growth and all of the other success that we're having around the world with KFC gives you confidence that we can overcome pressures to the model. But again we\u2019ll talk more about that in Q4 when we get sort of our updates to the long-term growth model. Our plan is really to just provide you on an annual basis any onetime adjustment for the long-term growth model. For example, this year we had a 53rd week. Next year, we'll be lapping the 53rd year. We'll provide you the guidance for what that means for 2019 -- for 2020. David Gibbs : With that I am going to turn it back to Greg for some closing remarks. Greg Creed : Thank you, David. So in closing, after 25 years with the company, today is my final earnings call. I've been blessed to work with and I've learned such I think much from such amazing individuals including our Board, our team members, our franchisees and our customers. After five years as CEO, I feel really good about what we accomplished and what's next for Yum!. We've transformed the company and I truly believe that Yum! is stronger for all its stakeholders. And now I'm handing the reins to David. David's been an incredible partner and I'm looking forward to watching him lead. Now finally, I want to thank you our investors and the analysts. Through the years, you've challenged us, asked the tough questions, gave your opinions and kept us sharp. You've made me a better leader and kept us sharp. You\u2019ve made me a better leader and Yum! a better company, and for all of that and your kind wishes today, thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Keith Siegner, Vice President, Investor Relations, M&A and Treasurer. Sir, please go ahead. Keith Siegner : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.

We\u2019d like to remind you that the Habit Burger Grill transaction is subject to approval by their stockholders and other customary closing condition. This transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020. As such, please understand that we are limited in what we can discuss on today\u2019s call. Please note the following regarding our basis of presentation. First, all system sales results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Second, Pizza Hut Division and worldwide system sales, include the benefit of the increase in units in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our strategic alliance with Telepizza. Same-store sales and net new unit growth reflects the inclusion of Telepizza in the prior year base. Third, core operating profit growth figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and special items. Fourth, the lease accounting standard was prospectively adopted on January 1, 2019. As a reminder, this is a GAAP-required change resulting in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. No significant impact in our income statement or cash flows as a result of this accounting change. And last, please note that the fourth quarter 2019 results include a 53rd week. However, figure stated on this call will exclude the 53rd week. We\u2019re broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback.

Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of the Form 10-K filing. First quarter 2020 earnings will be released on April 29, 2020, with a conference call on the same day. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was a truly historic year for Yum!. First, we successfully completed our three-year transformation and delivered on our bold commitments. Second, we surpassed two milestones that are a testament to Yum!\u2019s incredible scale, as we eclipsed $50 billion in system sales and mark the opening of our 50,000 restaurant. None of this would have been possible without our unrivaled culture and talent and over 2000 franchisees who run 98% of our restaurants globally and employ more than 1.5 million restaurant team members. Because of our journey to become more focused, franchised and efficient, we\u2019re now in a much stronger position to accelerate growth and improve franchise unit economics over the long-term. Before I begin, I want to share a heartfelt thank you to everyone within the Yum! family who made these results possible. I especially want to thank Greg Creed, who led Yum! as our CEO for five years with his signature blend of smart, heart and courage. I also want to thank Tracy Skeans, who was uniquely essential to this massive transformation. In her dual role as Chief Transformation Officer and Chief People Officer, Tracy helped shape Yum! direction all while working to make our culture more collaborative and inclusive and getting us in the best position to expand our capabilities with new talent and strategic investments. As an example on the talent side, in 2019 we elevated experienced Yum! executive to critical global growth role. Tony Lowings to KFC CEO, Artie Starrs to Pizza Hut CEO, Gavin Felder to Chief Strategy Officer and Nikki Lawson to Taco Bell Chief Brand Officer. We also brought in fresh thinking and capabilities from outside Yum!, with Chris Turner as Yum! CFO, Mark King as Taco Bell CEO, Clay Johnson as Chief Digital and Technology Officer and more recently Shannon Hennessy, as KFC Global CFO. In addition to our talent moves, we made bold strategic investments that leverage our scale. For example, our U.S. partnership with Grubhub, Pizza Hut\u2019s acquisition of QuikOrder and our growth Alliance with Telepizza. And as we started 2020, we built on this momentum by announcing our plans to acquire the Habit Burger Grill, a fast casual trend forward concept with tremendous growth potential. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve done during this time of transformation and couldn\u2019t be more excited about where we go from here. Now I\u2019d like to share with you a few thoughts on our future direction. One, it\u2019s clear that how we get results in today\u2019s world matters more to our customers, employees and investors than ever before. So you\u2019ll hear us sharing more about our Recipe for Good that outlines our sustainability commitments on our food, planet and people. As such, the guiding purpose for Yum! Brands will be the unlock potential for both growth and good. We\u2019ll remain committed to the four growth drivers and plan to deepen our execution with new strategies and tactics within each one. Two, to grow, we must deliver a consistently positive customer experience wherever we operate. Only the best brands in QSR will thrive and be relevant for the next-generation of consumers. As CEO, I\u2019m committed to elevating the experience for each of our 40 million customers every day and achieving the kind of unit economics only made possible through exceptional talent, industry-leading operations, innovative technology and modern assets. Three, with more restaurants than any other company, we must leverage our scale and technology to create sustainable competitive advantages and growth for our franchisees. You\u2019ve already seen us take steps in this direction. As previously announced, Clay and Gavin are leading a cross-brand effort that embraces disruptive innovation, harmonized platform, advanced data analytics and emerging technologies to transform the customer and employee experience. We\u2019ll also continue to consider acquisitions and strategic partnerships that allow us to unlock value and expand our capability. Four, because our unrivaled culture and talent is a huge competitive advantage, we\u2019re going to continue investing in developing the best leaders and restaurant general managers around the world. We will dial up our effort on diversity and inclusion with a focus on gender parity and underrepresented minorities. In summary, our brands will focus on unlocking our potential with better experiences for our customer and employees, which will ultimately lead to better franchise unit economics and better growth. I\u2019ll now share our overall view of our results for Yum! and a RED brand update. Then Chris will share the details of our fourth quarter and 2019 results, 2020 guidance as well as an update on Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Franchise Operating Capability. Let\u2019s talk about 2019 results. Overall, Yum! delivered a strong year with system sales growth of 8%, with 3% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. Starting with same store sales growth, Taco Bell and KFC were standouts this year with 5% and 4% respectively. For Bold Restaurant Development, 2019 was a record breaking year and I\u2019d like to recognize the efforts of all involved and put it into context. As I previously mentioned, our global system surpassed 50,000 restaurants in 2019. We accomplish this by opening a record 2040 net new units, which represents a 70% increase versus 2016 when we began our transformation. We opened on average nine gross restaurants per day in 2019 and now have an unmatched 287 brand country combinations. I believe our enhanced focused on Bold Restaurant Development resulting from our transformation enabled us to accelerate unit growth and achieve this milestone. Now for our three R.E.D. brands. KFC division finished the year strong. In the fourth quarter, they delivered system sales growth of 8% with 3% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. For the year system sales grew 9% with 4% same-store sales growth and 7% net new unit growth. KFC International\u2019s results are truly remarkable with strong performances across the board. India had another exceptional quarter with 12% same-store sales growth ending the year with 10% same-store sales growth. Their momentum is attributable to always on marketing around value, innovation and expanding their digital channel. Our Middle East business unit was another top performer in Q4 with 11% same-store sales growth. In the U.S. same-store sales growth grew 1% in Q4, KFC U.S. continues to partner with Grubhub to add locations for delivery and click-and-collect. We now have over 2,800 locations offering delivery and 3,800 restaurants available for click-and-collect. In conjunction with the launch of KFC.com in October, we\u2019re excited about the operational ease this provides to our team members and customers. Moving onto the Pizza Hut division. Fourth quarter system sales growth was flat excluding the benefit of Telepizza with a same-store sales decline of 2% and 1% net new unit growth. For the year system sales grew 2%, excluding the benefit of Telepizza with flat same-store sales and 1% net new unit growth. Pizza Hut U.S., which represents 8% of Yum!\u2019s operating profit excluding corporate and unallocated items reported system sales and same-store sales declines of 4% with a 2% net new unit decline in the fourth quarter. Pizza Hut U.S. continues to be a business in transition. And for the last three years, we\u2019ve made improvements in food quality, speed of service, our loyalty program and upgrading our technology for online ordering and delivery. However, significant opportunity remains in three years. First, more consistent execution in our customer experience across delivery and carry out. Second, ensuring we have value promotions that truly resonate with consumers and that are consistent with the long-term profitable unit economic model. Third, in remodeling and relocating asset base. We are urgently taking steps to change the trend and are working internally with our franchisees to place the brand on firmer footing to grow. To start, we\u2019ve injected new leadership and talent. We\u2019ve added KFC U.S. President, Kevin Hochman to the Pizza Hut U.S. team as Interim President. We\u2019ve also leveraged Yum!\u2019s deep global talent pool to add a new Chief Brand Officer and Chief Marketing Officer. Kevin\u2019s turnaround experience in both CPG and KFC U.S. and he\u2019s proven ability to improve distinctiveness of brands and accelerate innovation, make him ideally suited for this opportunity. Kevin and team are working closely in partnership with our U.S. franchisees, many of whom have the capital capability and commitment to continue driving this turnaround. To be clear, as we work with our franchisees through the turnaround, we have a few guiding principles. First, we are a growth company and expect that all of our brands can and should grow. Second, we remain committed to an asset light model and disciplined spending. Third, we know the formula for success. In markets where we deliver a great customer experience with the best tasting pizza, unbeatable value, distinctive food innovation, a best-in-class digital experience and modern assets, we grow sales consistently. At Pizza Hut International system sales grew 13%, including a 9 point benefit from Telepizza with flat same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth in the quarter. The same-store sales gap between the dine-in channel and off-premise sales was approximately 3% this quarter, meaning our off-premise performance remained healthy at a positive 2% same-store sales growth. Europe was the main driver of the quarter\u2019s performance, delivering 3% aggregate same-store sales growth led by strength in the UK delivery business. During the year, the UK, Brazil, Germany, Australia and Spain were the primary contributors to positive same-store sales growth and showed significant improvement in value, the introduction of aggregators and product innovation. Turning to Taco Bell. 2019 marked our eighth consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth, a testament to the power of the brand and excellent customer experience is delivered by our world-class franchisee. Fourth quarter system sales grew 7% with 4% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. Taco Bell is the great example of what it means to be a R.E.D. brand. The all new Toasted Cheddar Chalupa was introduced in the fourth quarter delivering the innovation that Taco Bell is known for and generating solid sales mix of 10%. We also brought back the very successful $5 nachos box and ended the year with the perennial fan favorites, the Xbox gaming promo box and Rolled Chicken Tacos. 2019 marked the completion of the nationwide kiosk rollout to nearly 6,500 restaurants. Kiosks deliver a modern and easy interface that allows our customers to explore the menu and customize their favorite items. We continue to see meaningful check lift and growing utilization from Kiosk to Grubhub delivery in over 5,100 restaurants to e-commerce nationwide. Taco Bell continues to leverage technology to become easier and more relevant that ultimately drive sale. Internationally, we continue to have strong sales momentum for the year with highlights including India, Canada, Japan, and Europe. We made strides in all in our All Access initiatives this quarter including piloting loyalty in the UK, adding kiosk in four markets including the UK, Spain, Australia, New Zealand. Before I turn it over to Chris, I did want to note that our thoughts are with everyone affected by the coronavirus situation. We\u2019re obviously following this closely and I\u2019ve been in regular contact with Joey Wat, the CEO of Yum China. I know she and her entire team are doing everything they can to work with local health officials and the government to help ensure that they protect their employees as well as their customers.  The Yum Foundation is matching their relief efforts with donations that will provide support, medical supplies and masks to the affected areas in China and assist frontline healthcare workers involved in fighting the epidemic in Wuhan. While Yum! business model is highly diversified such that the impact on our financial performance won\u2019t be as significant as what many companies will experience. This will certainly be a headwind for 2020. At the end of the day, this is a business built on people and the health and safety of those people will always be our top priority. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to our CFO, Chris Turner. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our fourth quarter and 2019 results, 2020 guidance and our remaining growth drivers. During the fourth quarter, we delivered system sales growth of 7%, same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 4%. As expected, growth in the second half of the year was lighter than the first. But it was still consistent with our long term growth model. Standouts for the quarter included KFC, with 3% same-store sales growth and a remarkable 7% net new unit growth. And Taco Bell also had another great quarter with 4% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. This performance translated into core operating profit growth of 9% for the quarter. Next, I\u2019m excited to say that we achieved or exceeded each component of our 2019 guidance. First, and as David mentioned, our consolidated system sales growth was 8%, with 3% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. KFC and Taco Bell both met or exceeded our long term of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth, bringing the aggregate Yum! Figure to the high end of our 2% to 3% range. We also had our second consecutive record breaking year for development with 2,040 net new units. Second, we met our full year core operating profit growth guidance of low double digits. Core operating profit growth for the year was 11%. Third, net CapEx for the year was $86 million, which was slightly below our guidance for 2019 owing to generally tight controls over all buckets of spend. Four, we met our target G&A at 1.7% of system sales in 2019. After running below our guidance through the first three quarters in the fourth quarter aggregate G&A was above that three quarter run rate, primarily owing to a few factors. Our strategic investment spend was heavily back-end weighted, commensurate with timing of our new talent appointments. Additionally, we had some discrete spend including strategic projects, the largest of which was related to global tax reforms that was concentrated in the fourth quarter. Boiling it down to exclude the 53rd week and discrete non-recurring items, the 2019 base you should use to model 2020 G&A off of is about $900 million. Lastly, EPS, we met our goal to deliver at least $3.75 in 2019 adjusted EPS, which we introduced in 2016. While our GAAP diluted EPS was $4.14, the apples-to-apples comparison to the $3.75 figure was $3.80. Please see our earnings release for reconciliation of our GAAP reported results to the adjusted EPS figure. Next guidance, our long term growth model remains unchanged. We continue to believe that 2% to 3% same-store sales growth should compliment 4% net unit growth for mid-to-high single-digit system sales growth, add-in leverage and we believe long term core operating profit growth should be high single-digit. However, as it pertains to 2020, first that the lap of the 53rd week represents a $24 million headwind or just over 1%. Additionally, there are a few matters adding uncertainty to the outlook for the full year. Most importantly, the impact of the coronavirus in China, and the potential for it\u2019s impact surrounding areas in Asia and other parts of the world. In addition, there is potential for choppiness in near term results at Pizza Hut U.S., primarily related to our largest franchisee. Given the fluid nature of these issues, specific forecasts for impacts are challenging at the moment. However, we believe it prudent to plan our business to account for these risks. As such, we are currently basing our 2020 plan on the assumption that we will likely be below our long term algorithm on a 52-week equivalent basis. We\u2019ll update you as the year progresses and we have more information. A few other items : first, we estimate CapEx net of refranchising proceeds in the $125 million to $150 million range in 2020. Second, we believe five times net leverage remains an appropriate and balanced target. Third, in relation to dividends, our long term target payout ratio remains 45% to 50% of annual net income excluding special items and Grubhub mark-to-market. In fact, we are pleased to have recently increased our quarterly cash dividend 12% to $0.47 per share. Going forward, we plan to return the excess cash remaining after CapEx, dividends and select shareholder accretive investments through share repurchases. One last note with regard to our guidance. For the last few years, our reported effective tax rate has benefited from deductions associated with stock-based compensation exercises. While the timing of the exercises as well as the exact amount of benefits are very difficult to forecast, we believe, it is prudent to assume less benefit going forward. Partly because of deductibility changes in light of U.S. tax reform. Thus, we are now forecasting our effective tax rate to be within a range of 21% to 23% versus the 20% to 22% range we forecasted previously. In January, we announced our agreement to acquire the Habit Burger Grill for $14 per share in cash or a total of approximately $375 million. As Keith mentioned, the transaction is subject to approval. As it relates to the impact in 2020, we estimate minimal impact to non-GAAP earnings per share before special items with accretion beginning in 2021 and increasing thereafter. Now let\u2019s discuss our remaining growth drivers. I\u2019ll begin with Bold Restaurant Development. This is perhaps the clearest example of how focus and a new mindset and generate improved results. During 2019, we opened 3,332 gross new restaurants and 2,040 restaurants on a net new basis. This is truly a step change in pace. KFC finished 2019 with 669 net new units in Q4 or 1,483 net unit for the year, which represent 349 more than 2018. This outstanding performance was led by China, our Russia business unit, Asia, Latin America, and Thailand among others. In the U.S., we closed out Q4 2019 with over 2,200 American Showman restaurants across the country representing over 54% of the U.S. system. At Pizza Hut, the division opened 188 net new units during the quarter and 266 for the year, as headwinds related to the transition in the U.S. asset base, partially offset international growth. Taco Bell delivered 172 net new units during the quarter. In the U.S., we opened our 60th Urban-style Cantina restaurant. Internationally, 71 net new units were opened in the fourth quarter, including the entry of two new markets, Portugal and New Zealand. Internationally, we saw impressive growth in India, Spain, the UK and Thailand. The pace of global development continues to accelerate with 291 net new units opened this year, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Next unmatched franchisee operating capability, across each of our brands, we are working to enhance the customer experience with ever changing technology. We have to adapt with consumers to deliver a consistent interaction and positive response each time a person interacts with our brands. With that, we know how important it is to hear our customers and learn what we can do better operationally. At KFC, we\u2019ve piloted customer feedback and survey models that are also integrated with our delivery aggregators in our Africa, Middle East and Australia and New Zealand business units. At Pizza Hut international, we\u2019ve focused on enabling both better customer experience and ease of operations to drive efficiency by rolling out driver tracking and operations management systems in six markets comprising over 600 restaurants. This will provide our franchisees with order sequencing intelligence, enabling them to more efficiently allocate resources. At Taco Bell, our focus on speed and operations continue to yield results. Q4 ended with 20 seconds faster service year-over-year. This translated to 9 million more cars through the drive-thru in 2019. Great service is also a key to the customer experience and I\u2019m pleased to report that while getting faster all operations metrics improved across the board. To summarize, the transformation made Yum! a stronger company, franchisor and investment. With iconic category-leading brand and a uniquely diversified global business of over 50,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and drive healthy franchise unit economic by leveraging our massive scale expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you throughout 2020. Now the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning and congrats on a good 2019. My question is about the U.S. Pizza Hut business. And first, could you just maybe clarify your comments about the choppiness that you expect in 2020 related to your largest franchisee? Perhaps what are the range of outcomes there that you\u2019re considering at this point? And then secondly, my main question involves around whether you\u2019re contemplating an injection of capital into the business, whether to support the existing franchise base in some way, like you did with the transformation agreement? Thanks. Chris Turner : So thanks for the questions, David. Obviously, on Pizza Hut U.S., as we mentioned, we are focused on driving the turnaround in that business. As David mentioned, we\u2019re excited about the new leadership that we have in place there and their focus on the fundamental improvements to business on both the way that we translate the brand to consumers and on the asset base. But obviously, there\u2019s a lot of work to be done there. You asked specifically about our largest franchisee. We typically do not go into detail on specific franchisee situations. But as we\u2019ve discussed before on the asset side of the equation of Pizza Hut U.S., we are \u2013 the majority of our franchisees are really good partners, they are well capitalized, committed and capable and continue to drive the business in the right direction. We do have a handful of situations where we are working with the franchisees to get them into a better place. Obviously, each of those processes take time and do create some choppiness as a result. As an example, we do have one market in the U.S. where we had a franchisee whose assets simply weren\u2019t up to our standard. We\u2019ve worked with them to exit them from the system, and we\u2019re well down a path to getting a new franchise operator into place. And so hopefully, that gives you a general feel for the situation and why there may be some choppiness as we work toward a better asset base. David Gibbs : Yes. I guess \u2013 and what I would add, David, I know there\u2019s concern about injecting capital. I understand your question. In the past, we have done two transformation agreements, one with KFC U.S., one with Pizza Hut U.S. Those were done at a point in time in exchange for certain rights that we gained. For Pizza Hut U.S., we got more marketing contributions and other rights related to operational standards. As Chris mentioned, that helps us, in some cases, actually shut down the market and get the hands \u2013 the market in the hands of a better operator for that market. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re committed to an asset-light model. If we do something with capital, whether it be going out to buy The Habit Burger Grill or some kind of an agreement with franchisees, that\u2019s done because there are some benefits to Yum!, but we are really committed to the asset-light model. Keith Siegner : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. I did want to just ask a follow-up on Pizza Hut if I could. What was the bad debt expense in the fourth quarter? And how do you \u2013 what have you baked into your model? Or how should we think about what that debt may represent as a pressure on earnings in 2020? And can you also talk about Kevin\u2019s early moves at Pizza Hut? What has he done? I understand maybe there\u2019s some change in pricing or franchisees\u2019 ability to change pricing. What are the things that early on he\u2019s really focused on specifically \u2013 I know driving sales generally, but specifically to help the brand? Chris Turner : Thanks. I\u2019ll take your first question, and then I\u2019ll let David follow on with some remarks. So on the bad debt expense, if we step back and think about in the context of Yum! globally, we collect north of $4 billion in royalties and other fees from over 2,000 franchisees around the globe. So you\u2019re always going to have some situations that we are working through. There was an uptick in bad debt expense at Pizza Hut. Just to give you a sense for the numbers for the division, Pizza Hut Division globally. In Q4, bad debt expense related to royalties and digital fees was $8 million for the division, which was up $4 million year-over-year. And for full year 2019, bad debt expense was $22 million, which was up $12 million year-over-year. To help put it into some context though, this was related to just a handful of franchisee situations. And as I mentioned earlier, we are working through those. And the timing of how the steps play out, there may be some bad debt impact as we go through that, but that is part of the choppiness that we\u2019ve described as we work through this. But hopefully, that gives you a sense and helps put it in the context of our global franchisee base and give you some point of reference for the number. David Gibbs : Yes. And then as far as Kevin landing in Pizza Hut, obviously, we\u2019re all excited about having somebody with his talents working on the Pizza Hut brand in the U.S. Kevin, as you know, as the CMO and then the President of KFC U.S. really architected the turnaround of that brand and going back to the things that we know matter in our industry : having brand communications that resonate with consumers, that build the brand in a R.E.D. way; offering the kinds of value that appeal to consumers but that is also profitable for our franchise partners. And he is using that same playbook at Pizza Hut. It\u2019s obviously too soon to start to talk about the specific tactics that he\u2019s going to deploy, but I can say that a lot of franchisees reach out to me and say they\u2019re excited to have Kevin joining. He spent a lot of time in the field with them, getting to know them and understanding their concerns. And I think it\u2019s forming a good partnership with them and going to build on the great work that the Pizza Hut team has done in the last few years in strengthening the brand from a technology standpoint, launching loyalty programs, improving products, operational improvements, all the things that we\u2019ve talked about in previous calls. Keith Siegner : Thanks, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Thanks. Just following another year of strong development growth, wondering if you could talk a bit more about 2020 development, maybe just some of your most updated thoughts on puts and takes relative to that 4% long-term target. I know you called out the uncertainty related to the coronavirus and presumably, what goes on with Pizza Hut in the U.S., but any more thoughts at a high level on those two points? And any other potential puts and takes around the globe that we should be thinking about? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, Dennis. It is really remarkable what the team has been able to do with development as we pulled back from building equity stores and the franchisees have picked up the development responsibility. As I mentioned in my remarks, passing 2,000 net new units this year, over 1,000 in the fourth quarter. These are numbers, I think, we\u2019re all incredibly proud of. And I think what you\u2019re seeing is it\u2019s fairly widespread, right? Taco Bell opened over 100 net new units internationally this year for the first time off of a base of roughly 450. That\u2019s pretty impressive growth, and that\u2019s getting stronger and stronger. And the U.S. for Taco Bell was hitting new numbers. At KFC, very widespread. You\u2019re seeing development, I think, with 99 countries, but we\u2019re building new units last year at a number like \u2013 over 800 gross new units in the fourth quarter alone. And then even Pizza Hut International, about 450 net new units internationally. So the vast majority of our business is healthy when it comes to development and growing, and we expect those trends to continue into 2020. As far as specific things that may offset that, as we\u2019ve talked about, we know we have a lot of Pizza Hut U.S. assets that are below our standards and need to close, and that could, on a short-term basis, have a negative impact on the pace of development. But we still feel very good about this 4% commitment in the long term and being able to grow at that pace. And I can tell you our teams around the world are excited about development. And obviously, we\u2019ll talk about The Habit Burger Grill when we get past transaction closing, but that\u2019s another positive when it comes to development for Yum!. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. The question is on third-party delivery and also just overall order aggregators, what you\u2019re learning in developed markets around the world and at this point seeing kind of how these markets are evolving in developed markets, whether you think these types of businesses continue to be an opportunity to drive Yum!\u2019s various businesses and whether that opportunity also exists in the U.S. with obviously some context around some of Grub\u2019s recent comments. David Gibbs : Look, obviously, delivery is an area of growth in our industry. Just to put it in context, I saw some NPD data recently. 3.4% of restaurant occasions are delivery. So while it\u2019s a growing part of the business, it\u2019s still \u2013 probably the headlines would imply it bigger than it really is. But it is growing, and it is something that our business is benefiting from all around the world. We are forming partnerships with the right aggregator by market that makes sense for Yum!, done on the terms that would make sense for somebody with our scale and our cloud in the marketplace. And you\u2019re seeing it obviously be a little bit of a tailwind for us. I think the other thing I would point out is when it comes to digital, it\u2019s not all delivery. Actually, the data that we\u2019re seeing is the vast majority of digital orders are actually for carryout. So not to be left out, I think our teams are very focused on making sure that the click-and-collect model is working for us as well, not just the delivery model. There are costs to delivery today no matter how you cut it that adds significantly to the per-eater cost. And particularly for our brands, which are very much known for value, that makes the delivery occasion not appeal to our entire customer base. So as we always do, we are always about the customer and giving them what they want. So those customers that want delivery, we\u2019re leaning in there. And for those that are more carryout focused or dine-in focused, we have programs for them, too. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Hi. Thank you. I have a question about China and then just a quick follow-up on Pizza Hut in the U.S. I understand there\u2019s lack of visibility on the outlook in China, but we heard from your China licensee last night who\u2019s just talking about 30% of the stores being closed and the rest comping down 45%. So maybe you can just help put some numbers around implications. Even if it\u2019s just \u2013 if I estimate maybe 1 point of comp globally out of KFC and Pizza Hut, it\u2019s something like $0.07 of EPS to your full year EPS. If you could just help kind of quantify how we think about the implications of 1 point of comp decline or store closures, any kind of numbers. And then just a follow-up on Pizza Hut. You mentioned \u2013 you referred to an acceleration agreement with Pizza Hut. I think the last one kind of closed out at the end of last year, and now a lot of the controls revert back to the franchisees. Are you seeing anything different about how they\u2019re approaching whether it\u2019s advertising or store closures? Just any kind of strategic change now that that transformation agreement has concluded. Chris Turner : So thanks. Good questions. Let me start with China. So on the China situation, I think, most importantly, this focus on the health and safety of customers and team members. That\u2019s the top priority. And we really appreciate how Joey and the Yum China team and the authorities that they\u2019re working with there have that as their focus. So that remains our top priority. As you mentioned, you heard their call last night. For those of you who haven\u2019t seen it, I think it would be really helpful to go review their comments. We thought they did a very nice job of summarizing the situation. One of the key elements, of course, is that it\u2019s a dynamic situation that is a bit hard to predict with a lot of precision right now. Maybe just to give you some numbers and you can kind of work through the math. 1 point of same-store sales growth in China for a full year would translate to 19 basis points of same-store sales growth for Yum! and would also translate to $2.9 million in Yum! operating profit for the year. So hopefully, that gives you a metric that you can use as you work through your estimates. But again, the situation remains dynamic. We\u2019ll continue to stay connected with them. The other place that we\u2019re monitoring closely is the impact outside of China. I can tell you that right now, obviously, as you know, the situation is most active in China. Outside, there really are no store closures that we have as of right now, but we are staying close with those teams and monitoring the impacts. David Gibbs : Yes. And on the question about the Pizza Hut acceleration agreement, I know there was a comment about controls reverting back to franchisees, but the reality is what was in that acceleration agreement made permanent changes to the franchise agreement. So the royalty increase, some part of the marketing contribution increase, some of the operational standards that we now have, those all stayed \u2013 commitment to loyalty and technology all stayed in the agreement. As far as franchisees go, obviously, nobody\u2019s happy seeing same-store sales growth negative, and I think, they\u2019re excited about Kevin joining, as I mentioned earlier. And I\u2019m pleased to say that they\u2019re partnering with Kevin. And I think they\u2019re working constructively together as we continue this turnaround of the Pizza Hut U.S. business, which we mentioned repeatedly is something that we\u2019re not counting on a dramatic change in the business in the short term, but we\u2019re proud of the work we\u2019re doing to build a stronger business in the long term. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. On the Pizza Hut U.S. business, can you give us an update on a broad range or ballpark range of unit closures that you do expect in 2020? And just a follow-up on the Habit Burger acquisition. Very small acquisition in the grand scheme of its impact to Yum! Brands in the near or medium term, and I totally understand the opportunity it provides your franchisees. But can you just talk a little bit more about what caused you to possibly maybe pass on something that would be larger and more impactful to investors? Chris Turner : Yes. So good questions. I\u2019ll take the first one. I think on the Pizza Hut U.S. situation, as we mentioned, given the processes we\u2019ll work through with a handful of franchisees, there will be, as we\u2019ve said, choppiness in the situation as we go forward. I know we had shared a number of 7,000. I wouldn\u2019t get too wrapped up on that number as, from quarter-to-quarter, the choppiness will be a little bit hard to predict. But we do think, in the long term, that there is opportunity for growth in the network, but in the near term, it\u2019s going to continue to be choppy. David Gibbs : Yes. As far as The Habit goes, we\u2019ll \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re limited in what we can say at this point until the deal closes assuming we have shareholder approval. But what we have said publicly, which is what we\u2019re excited about is this is a great risk/reward. And so as you said, Brian, it\u2019s a small investment but we\u2019re buying something that has a lot of growth potential. As you know, we\u2019re all about growth. We\u2019re not interested in buying big businesses that are of the same scale of ours that don\u2019t have a lot of growth. We want to buy something \u2013 we\u2019re looking for the upside that comes with that growth. We think, given our scale and our capabilities, they match up with Habit very well, and we should be able to unlock growth, give our franchisees a great new growth vehicle in the U.S. and given our ability to take things to international markets, take this brand outside the U.S. in a bigger way than they have already. But we\u2019ll talk about this a lot more as we go forward, but I think the summary would be we really like the risk/reward in terms of the size of what we have to pay to get something with the potential that it has. Keith Siegner : Thanks, operator. We have time for one more question. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. What \u2013 if we were to talk about 2020 in terms of your \u2013 versus your algorithm and excluding coronavirus, which is obviously a discrete health crisis this year, and the 53rd week, what sort of year were you thinking about versus that algorithm? And of course, in that is how important something like what you\u2019re going through with Pizza Hut U.S. is to that. And then you touched \u2013 you said some comment about coronavirus Asia ex-China. I\u2019m wondering, are you already seeing an impact in some way in other parts of your Asia business. Thank you. David Gibbs : David, just taking the last part of that first. Yes, we weren\u2019t trying to imply that we\u2019re seeing any impact. We were actually trying to put people at ease that we haven\u2019t seen an impact and we haven\u2019t seen any store close or anything of that sort. But obviously, we\u2019re prudent to be looking at everything related to coronavirus and planning for all different eventualities. As far as the 2020 algorithm goes, I can tell you we entered 2020 with a plan to deliver on our long-term algorithm that we all felt good about despite all of the noise we might have from Pizza Hut U.S. or anything else. I mean when you have 2,000 franchisees and 50,000 restaurants and you are in 287 brand country combinations, not all parts of the business are always humming all the time, and that\u2019s always taken into account as we enter a year. But we felt good about the plan going into the year. Obviously, the coronavirus and the impact it has on China has a significant impact on us and our financial performance this year and ability to hit that algorithm. But other than that, I think we feel good about the business. We obviously have challenges within the Pizza Hut U.S. business related to our large franchisee, which we\u2019ll deal with, we\u2019ll get through and feel good, feel really great actually about the long-term health of the business. David Gibbs : So with that, I\u2019ll just close the call by saying 2019 was truly a milestone year for us. We successfully delivered on all the commitments that we talked about in 2016, which we\u2019re looking past now as we go forward, but really, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team and what we\u2019ve accomplished. We started out that journey in 2016 talking about the fact that, hey, we have a bold goal of getting to 7% system sales, and I know a lot of people didn\u2019t believe that Yum! could do that. Well, we just concluded a year where we delivered 8% system sales. Even if you back out Telepizza, it was 7%. So we hit that bold goal, and we\u2019re incredibly proud of that. We opened over 2,000 restaurants last year, representing 4% growth and crossed the 50,000 unit mark. That\u2019s sooner than we had anticipated back in 2016. So we\u2019re really coming out of this transformation much stronger than we were entering it, and it\u2019s across all aspects of the business. We\u2019ve really strengthened the team given all the people I\u2019ve talked to you about on this call that we\u2019ve added and folks that have been promoted. We\u2019ve certainly improved the culture. We\u2019re operating more collaboratively. And to do that during all the turmoil of the transformation, I think is a truly special accomplishment. I think our strategy is tighter than it\u2019s ever been with our four growth drivers, our Recipe for Growth and our Recipe for Good. And then we\u2019ve got these extra areas of growth like The Habit Burger acquisition, which I\u2019m really looking forward to talking to you about Habit and Russ Bendel, their great leader, and their team when we get on the next earnings call. So in summary, the business model is working. We\u2019re diverse, world\u2019s largest restaurant operator with more units than anybody else, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the future. And with that, I appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. Operator : Thank you. Thank you again for joining today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Second, second quarter earnings will be released on July 30, 2020, with the conference call on the same day. Now, I would like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Keith. And good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented challenges that we are all experiencing and say a heartfelt thank you to our team members and franchisees around the world. It is been amazing to see our entire system band together and take action to confront these challenges with unbelievable speed. And while many of us are working to play our part, the brave healthcare workers on the front lines have the most critical role, and our positive thoughts are with them and everyone affected by COVID-19. Our goal today is to be transparent and give you timely information about the state of our business. I will start with an overall review of first quarter and the current state of the business and use a few examples to illustrate the power of our unrivaled culture and talent and unmatched operating capability. I will also highlight how our brands are adapting the RED framework to be relevant, easy and distinctive in this environment. Then Chris will share more details of our Q1 results and current state. How we are adjusting our business model and supporting franchisees and their healthy liquidity position. For Q1 results, we were encouraged by our momentum early in the quarter driven by the underlying strength of our brand. However, as we signaled in our 8-K on March 24th, the quarter was heavily impacted by COVID-19, which was the primary reason core operating profit declined 6%. Overall Yum! system sales declined 3% as our same-store sales decline of 7% was partially offset by 4% net new unit growth. The impact on our sales in each market is dependent upon the timing, severity and duration of the outbreak as well as each markets reliance on dine-in sale. Importantly, we have seen early signs of recovery in markets that were first impacted by COVID-19 and stabilization in others. As one example, at the time of our 8-K filing, approximately 7000 of our global stores were completely closed, driven largely by government shutdown. As various stores closed and reopened, given changing mandate this figure increased to about 11,000. Since then, stores have been slowly and consistently reopening with approximately 1000 reopens from the trial. Chris will talk more about recent sales trends in a few minutes. Since the onset of this pandemic, the safety and support of our employees, restaurant team members, customers and franchisees has been our top priority. First, we move quickly to reinforce and strengthen our already stringent protocols emphasizing hygiene, cleaning and sanitation. Next, we leverage the best practices of contactless delivery and carry out pioneered by Yum! China, which accelerated our execution of off-premise services. Simultaneously, we move to suspend our dining room operations in many markets. Our brands also continue to expand protective measures for frontline restaurant team members, including protective facial coverings, increased usage of single use disposable gloves, temperature checks, and physical distancing measures where possible. We will continue refining our practices based on consumer feedback and the latest Public Health and Government guide. At our 1,200 Company and restaurants around the world. We are paying scheduled hours to team members who are required to stay at home due to COVID-19. Recognizing the vital role our restaurant general managers continue to play in these 1,200 stores. We have provided $1,000 one time bonuses to our RGM in addition to committing to pay their second quarter bonuses even if their restaurants sales performance would not normally qualify. Also in June, we will pay one-time bonuses to the majority of team members working in our 1,200 Company owned restaurants. Our franchisees are also taking steps to increase supportive restaurant team members during this critical time. Finally, we created a Global Employee Medical Relief Fund to provide financial support for restaurant employees as well as company and franchise owned restaurants were diagnosed with for who are caring for someone diagnosed with COVID-19. I would also like to share some of the steps we are taking to help our franchisees bridge to the other side of this crisis. As 98% franchise system, we are a business comprised of many independent and small businesses and entrepreneurs, and our franchisees are our life blood. Going into this crisis, we reassured our franchisees we will do everything in our power within the constraints we are all facing to help them and their team. We have set up a global franchise health and COVID-19 support team chaired by Chris Turner and our General Counsel, Scott Catlett. To help our franchise partners navigate business continuity in the system with access to all available sources of economic support. Including, but not limited to Yum! provided source. To help our franchise partners, we are providing assistance to those who are in good standing and need more access to capital, including graces periods for certain near-term payments, and deferring certain asset obligations, which Chris will talk more about. Now moving on to our core RED brands. Each brand has listened intently to customer needs and quickly pivoted to adjust in response to the crisis. We have partnered with our entire global franchise system on a shared mission to provide affordable convenient food in a safe low contact environment with drive thru, curbside carryout, contactless delivery and mobile payments. All enabled by our digital and technology capability. In many ways COVID-19 is accelerating trends we were already addressing in our business. Let\u2019s start with KFC division results. This division reported a Q1 system sales declined of 2% as an 8%, same-store sales declined was partially offset by 6% net new unit growth. Given COVID-19 impact details were already provided by the Yum! China on their earnings call. Let\u2019s take a minute to walk through the KFC global business excluding China. Outside of China we had great momentum in the beginning of the quarter with 6% same-store sales growth in January and 4% same-store sales growth in February. In particularly, we want to highlight the UK and the Middle East were having a very strong start to the year. As COVID-19 restrictions, became more prevalent around the world in March. The full quarter ended down 2% for the KFC divisions excluding China. As part of our COVID-19 pivots, contactless services are now available in 90% of KFC markets, and we are doubling down on digital and expanding delivery globally. Digital mix increased through Q1, driven by delivery and click and collect with particular strength in Thailand and Australia. In current trend sustain, KFC globally could end the year with more than a quarter of its sales through digital channels. KFC U.S. is a perfect example of how our off-premise and digital capabilities, along with family friendly affordable meal options are competitive advantages in the current environment. KFC U.S. has made major strides on the staying RED, by offering multiple variations of family style meals that customers can customize. We now have a $30 fill up offer which includes 12 tenders as an add on to the $20 fill up. Truly incredible value with enough food to feed a family for multiple meals in some cases. We have seen a change in how people are accessing buckets of original recipe with digital sales increasing to approximately 10% today. This is up from low-single digits just a month ago. And importantly about 40% of digital sales are going through KFC.com which ones late last year. Moving on to the Pizza division. System sales declined 9% with the same-store sales decline of 11% and flat net new unit growth. Excluding China, Pizza Hut division same-store sales were down 5% in Q1. Globally, Pizza Hut had seen a mass shift in brand messaging, focusing on contactless services, food safety, team members safety and giving back to the community. In partnership with our franchisees, we were able to quickly develop appropriate protocols and training materials to support the rollout of contactless delivery, carry out and curbside pickup now available in over 90 countries. During the first quarter of Pizza Hut U.S., we pivoted towards more targeted and higher margin QSR value constructs and leaned into core products. while offering limited time promotional value on premium products such as our specialty meat lovers pizza and the Big Dipper. We are now starting to see the benefits from the marketing and innovation changes led by Kevin Hoffman, who is serving as Interim Pizza Hut President and the early returns are reasons for increased optimism about the Pizza Hut brand\u2019s ability to succeed in a world where off-premise and contactless are more important than ever. Recent gains in off-premise has helped offset the impact of closing our dining room. And the vast majority of our express units. Express represented 5% of our overall system sales in 2019. At Pizza Hut International, same-store sales declined 4% excluding China. Our heavy delivery and carryout focused markets that have continued to be able to trade without significant restrictions have typically fared well through the crisis thus far. However, many countries across Europe, Latin America and the Middle East have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 related closures and operating restrictions. While, some of the dining declines have been offset by an increase in delivery and carryout demand, such as in the UK, the net impact has been a headwind. Historically, for all of Pizza Hut International off-premise sales have been 50% of sales. And this quarter off-premise sales increased to 70%. To put this into context, our off-premise channel generated a positive 12% same-store sales growth in Q1. In certain Asia markets, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong in particular, we saw off-premise sales growth which more than offset dining declines to deliver positive overall same-store sales during the quarter. Turning to Taco Bell, Q1 system sales grew 4% with 1% same-store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth. Importantly, excluding the last two weeks of the quarter, same-store sales growth in the U.S. was trending toward an impressive 6%. The year started with a value offering at a power price point with the $1 Double Stacked Tacos. This was followed by Buffalo Chicken Fries, a very successful program with total sales makes about 9%. Like all of our brands, Taco Bell responded quickly across all fronts to adapt to COVID-19. Taco Bell advertising is highlighting off-premise options and offering free delivery on orders over $12 through Grubhub. In the U.S. delivery and drive-through sales pre-COVID represented about 75% of sales. Now this is nearly 100% of Taco Bell\u2019s sales with digital representing approximately 10%. We have also maintained our below four minute drive-through times, while simultaneously achieving an all time low in customer dissatisfaction. This is remarkable considering how quickly the landscape has changed. Finally, our Taco Bell restaurants have the option to pause offering breakfast and adjust hours of operations as appropriate to best optimize the business model. Also, during the first quarter, we completed our acquisition of the Habit Burger Grill, we knew all along that Russ Bendel and the whole Habit team were very strong operators and we have already seen this in action. In fact, with just 50 drive-through units, the Habit team adapted quickly to the new environment by rolling out many different order modes for carry out such as park-in order, pop-up drive-through and outdoor self order [TI] (Ph). Additionally, Habit digital marketing shifted to focus on value and family bundles accessible through carryout delivery. Combined, the operational and marketing adjustments have fueled our growth in digital ordering, which is now about 40% of sales, up from 10% versus pre-COVID-19 levels. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about what the future holds for that Habit and believe our acquisition of this trend forward brand will prove to be long-term win. Before I pass it over to Chris, I want to offer a few thoughts on Yum\u2019s position as we contemplate the future and move toward a new normal. As I see it, we have four distinct advantages. First, our unrivaled culture and talent. Our brand builders and operators at Yum! are partnering in a way and at a pace we have never seen before, acting urgently on solutions that address the changing needs of our consumers, employees and franchisees. Second, our iconic brands, each of which have endured many challenges for over half a century. And we will recover from this challenge and become even more relevant easy and distinct as a result. Our brands consistently stand for valuing convenience and normalcy, all of which are highly sought out in these uncertain times and beyond. Third, our business model. Our diversification across 290 plus brands country combinations enables us to withstand sustained adverse. Fourth and finally, our strength in the off-premise segment will position us well for recovery and growth. COVID-19 is a stark reminder of just how globally connected we all are. By working together we can limit the spread of COVID-19 and support our frontlines and communities, while doing our part to offer convenient affordable food in a safe environment. With that, I will hand it over to our CFO, Chris Turner. Chris Turner : Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Today I will discuss our first quarter results. April highlights 2020 guidance and our capital strategy to begin our first quarter results. As David mentioned, in Q1, we reported a system sales decline of 3%, same-store sales decline of 7% and net new unit growth of 4%. On the development front, we opened 515 gross new restaurants or 65 restaurants on a net new basis and added 276 Habit Restaurants for an aggregate increase of [341] (Ph) during the quarter. Core operating profit declined 6%, EPS excluding special items was $0.64, which included a $0.06 headwind owing to the change in fair value of our investments and Grubhub. As we signaled in our recent 8-K, COVID-19 weighed heavily on our Q1 results and is having a much more significant impact on Q2. As COVID and related Government restrictions became more prevalent across the system, especially in Western Europe, and the U.S., our overall same-store sales deteriorated through the month of March before starting to trend better in April. To illustrate these recent trends, I will share our latest rough approximation of recent same-store sales growth. As a reminder, our methodology has always been that temporary closures remain in our base for determining same-store sales growth. In the first week of March, our global same-store sales growth was approximately flat. We then saw a rapid decline in the following week seeing same-store sales drop to approximately negative 10%. The decline continued with Yum\u2019s global same-store sales falling to beyond negative 30% on average, across the second half of March and in April. This includes the impact of approximately 20% of our stores being closed. Pizza Hut global same-store sales in that timeframe were down to between negative 20% and negative 25%, negatively impacted by significant dine-in declines in most parts of the globe and closures in the U.S. express business, but bolstered by strength in carryout and delivery. Taco Bell was a little worse, with declines to almost negative 30% on average over this time period. Finally, KFC same-store sales declines were approximately 35% during that period driven in large part by full closures of more than 20% of KFC restaurants. Since that time period and in recent weeks, we have seen global sales trends improve significantly across all brands in restaurants that are opened and operating. Keep in mind, we still have approximately 10,000 stores closed. So as we look to Q2 same-store sales growth, we know that improvement will mostly depends on the pace of reopening and continuation of the current trends in Asia and the U.S. Given the changed environment and results in our for our business, we have an active programs to assess and refine our plans for non-essential expenses in capital spend. As an example, and for the safety of our team members, we moved clearly and quickly to eliminate most travel and in-person meetings until at least September. We also implemented a hiring freeze. To be clear, we have not made any drastic reductions in corporate headcount as our recently completed strategic transformation appropriately right sized our business. However, we have teams working on identifying longer term opportunities to increase efficiency, and to reallocate resources for the growth opportunities that should best leverage our scale to drive stainable competitive advantages for our franchisees. We will have more to talk about in the future. But these areas could include drive through, curbside carry out, contactless delivery, digital capabilities and other areas relevant in an off-premise low contact environment. We are working with franchisees in impacted markets to help navigate business continuity in the safest manner possible. We are also working with franchisees who are in good standing and need more access to capital to provide assistance, including grace periods for certain near-term payments where necessary. These grace periods provide those franchisees with cash flow constraints and additional 60-days to pay two of their royalty payments and to provide additional breathing room we have also deferred 2020 capital obligations for remodels and new development up to a year in the U.S. and in select international markets. Next, our outlook for the business. There are many factors that give us confidence in the long-term, including the strong 2019 and early 2020 momentum. Each of our brands have a strong track record and culture of pivoting to meet rapidly evolving customer needs. We remain steadfast that Yum! has been and will remain a high growth company generating strong returns for all stakeholders over the long-term. That said, the unprecedented global nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty around the timing and shape of various recoveries make it difficult to say, when we will settle back into this outgrowth and we are withdrawing guidance as a result. Now for our balance sheet and liquidity position. We entered 2020 with a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of over $600 million, which excludes restricted cash and with nothing drawn on our $1 billion revolver. Knowing that we would fund the acquisition of the Habit in March and out of an abundance of caution, we took steps to bolster our cash balance and increase our liquidity position. First, in order to further enhance our liquidity given uncertainties in the macro outlook, we suspended our share repurchase program. We have not repurchased any shares under our $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which was authorized in 2019 and runs through the middle of 2021. Second, we drew down $950 million of our $1 billion revolving credit facility. While a portion of this draw along with cash on hand was used to fund the acquisition of the Habit Burger Grill, the majority of the proceeds were kept in cash. Third, we issued a $600 million five year Yum! Brands Incorporated Holding Company bonds, the coupon of 7.75% is reflective of the market conditions at a time, as well as our preference to preserve a high level of flexibility given the ensure nature of the issuance. In order to preserve future flexibility, the bond contains a call feature, allowing us to call a bond after two years subject to a modest prepayment premium. Also, increasing flexibility was our decision to issue the bond at the holding company level rather than issue from our restricted group subsidiaries, which I will explain in a few moments. Bonds issued at the holding company carry a higher costs but preserve the most flexibility as they are outside of our subsidiaries, which are subject to financial maintenance and debt in current covenants. Please note that we received the cash from this issuance on April 1st, so it is not reflected in our Q1 balance sheet. This debt issuance is especially notable, because it reopened a high yield market that has gone nearly a month without an issuance. This signals the strength of Yum! Brands credit in the minds of investors and lenders. We are very encouraged by the fact that we were able to raise capital in such a difficult environment. The net result of these actions was an increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance to over $1.1 billion, excluding restricted cash at quarter end or over $1.7 billion pro forma for the debt issuance cash we received on April 1st. Next, I would like to provide some additional context on our capital structure and debt covenants. We evaluate our optimal capital structure including our five times leverage target on a continual basis. We are also very thoughtful in how we construct our debt structure within the context of five times leverage. Our debt structure is designed to balance costs, duration, refinancing risk and flexibility overtime. We source capital from various financial markets, including high yield bonds, leverage loans, and the asset backed securitization market. Each market has its own unique investor base and characteristics. We like participating in each of these markets as participating in multiple markets provides access to a broader base of investors. We issue debt primarily from three distinct groups of entities, each subject to different financial covenants, including the Yum! Brands Incorporated Holding Company our restricted group entities and our Taco Bell Securitization entity. Outstanding debt issued at our holding company consists of unsecured bonds issued under investment grade life indentures, which include no maintenance or in current covenants. Approximately $3 billion of our gross debt is issued as this hold-co level pro forma for our April 2020 issuance. Loans and bonds issued from our restricted group are subject to covenants that are typical in high yield indenture with various maintenance and incurrence covenants, including maximum leverage ratios and minimum coverage ratios. Approximately $6 billion of our gross debt is issued out of our restricted group. Please note, we provide restricted group financials on our website each quarter. Lastly, notes issued from our Taco Bell Securitization entity are typical in investment grade asset backed security issuances with various maintenance and incurrence covenants, including maximum leverage ratios and minimum coverage ratios. Approximately $3 billion of our gross debt is issued out of our Taco Bell Securitization entity. Excluding on our outstanding revolver balance and pro forma for April\u2019s issuance, our debt is approximately 92% fixed rate with an average duration of approximately six years and average rate of approximately 4.5% and minimum maturity through the end of 2021. We ended Q1 with significant cushion to all of the major covenants in both our restricted group and Taco Bell Securitization entities. And we will continue to monitor covenants going forward in light of the COVID situation. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from David Palmer at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. And good morning, I believe in your prepared remarks you talked about where things bottomed in the second half of March and into early April in each of the global brands. Could you speak to the pace of recovery that you have seen in recent weeks and where things are lately? And if there is anything unusual about that, are those things that are causing those weekly numbers to be weird or somehow unsustainable, we would love to hear about that. And then separately on the franchisee health, I know that that is a big topic these days. Could you talk to what you are seeing out there from your biggest franchisees? Are there any major issues things that are causing your franchise revenue to be in arrears or anything there we should be aware of. Thanks. David Gibbs : Thanks, David. As far as the comments about bottoming, I think we called out that the number of units that were closed at any one point looks like it bottomed at 11,000. And then we have opened back at least 1000 of those, if not a few more. And we are opening more every day. So we think from a unit count standpoint that we are past the trough on that and backed it into the business of reopening. In fact, there is just an announcement that just came out, that KFC UK is going to have up to about 100 of their stores reopened by next week. And they are having success reopening stores primarily through offering delivery from the reopened stores. As far as the sales trends, we are really not going to comment in great detail beyond the comments that we made. That trends have improved significantly, as we have moved through April. That is owing to a number of factors. Certain markets have really figured out how to operate in this environment. Just to give you another example, the Pizza Hut Japan business looks like it is going to be up well over 50% in the month of April. So that is a business that is figured out how to market with value and in low contact options in this environment. Certainly KFC, Australia is doing well. KFC UK, as I mentioned is reopening stores. In the U.S., the stimulus impact on consumers is obviously helping our business and helping build momentum there as well. But I think you heard last night from Yum! China that what they have learned as they have gone through the recovery isn\u2019t that it has been a little bit uneven makes it very difficult to forecast, where bottoms are and exact trends, but certainly look forward to sharing more details on sales, when we get to the Q2 results. I will let Chris talk a little bit more about the franchise health question that you asked in some of those issues. Chris Turner : Yes. Good question on franchisee health David. I will provide a little bit of context on that. I would say first and foremost, I have had a chance to work along with several folks at Yum! with our franchisees through this crisis. And it is just been amazing to see the great leaders that the men and women who lead these franchisee organizations. How great their leadership has been during this time of crisis. They have been so focused on protecting and enhancing the safety of their team members other customers and continuing to operate, where the stores are open throughout the crisis. And I think we are going to emerge from this with an even stronger bond with our franchisees. On the specific topic of franchisee health, we typically evaluate franchisee financial strengths as new franchisees enter our system. And in some cases, we have contractual arrangements or policies and provisions in our arrangements with franchisees related to their financial health. Of course with 2,000 franchisees across our 290 plus brand country combinations. It is really hard to paint the franchisee base, or our arrangements with them with a broad brush. Just to give you a feel for that in the U.S. about 60% of our franchisees in the U.S. operate one to three stores. And many of them are feeling the same stress that small businesses across the country are feeling through this crisis. Of course, we go around the globe, we have many larger franchisees. In fact, about 80% of our international restaurants are operated by franchisees with 100 or more units. And while these larger franchisees are generally strong and resilient, many of them are feeling the same financial pressures that other large companies and other industries are feeling as a result of the crisis. So with over 2,000 franchisees, we did have a small number that were struggling before the crisis hit. And in a few cases, the sales impact of the crisis has accelerated to financial distress and we are working with those partners to address their health and their role in our system. But overall, we are fortunate that the vast majority of our franchisees came into this situation in solid shape. And while we expect the vast majority to be able to weather the storm. The challenges they are facing are real. In many situations, franchisees are going to need a range of support, including not only assistance from Yum!, which we have offered in the form of the royalty grace periods and capital deferrals, but also from their other partners, their lenders, landlords, suppliers, distributors, and many others. In some countries, including government programs and support. It really is an all hands on deck situation. And we appreciate all the support that all of the partners to our franchisees are providing. And again, we appreciate the hard work that our franchisee leaders are putting in. Last thing I will mention is that we are fielding some inbound requests from outside Capital Partners who would like to put money to work in our system. So when you think about that, that really gives us a multi layered approach to bolstering the health of our store network. It starts with the primary focus on working with our existing franchisees, in particular those who are suffering the most distress. But we do have backup plans with partners who could step in if needed in certain parts of the globe. So hopefully that gives you a feel for the current franchisee health landscape. Keith Siegner : Thanks. Operator, next question. Operator : Yes sir. Next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Just a clarification and then a question. On the franchisee support, I was wondering and I apologize if I missed this. If you could just talk about the franchisee expense. And I think that was the one line item that was a bit higher than we had expected versus very tight control on some of the other operating service lines. So just a little bit more color on that and the extent to which it reflected the support that you have provided. And then after the peak out you said you are starting to see the benefits of the new marketing approach. Could you just talk about maybe what that looks like? How you are measuring it? Is it customer satisfaction scores or something more tangible? I recognize that in this environment, there is a lot of puts and takes, but just wanted to get a little more color on that. Thank you. Chris Turner : Great. So this is Chris, I will start with your question around the bad debt expense and then I will turn it over to David for the second part of your question. So on the bad debt expense. You just noted in the release this morning that that was a driver in both Pizza Hut and KFC. And for Q1, it continues to be a story of a small number of accounts. So I will try to give you some context around it. So in Q1, we had $28.5 million of bad debt expense, which is up about $22 million year-over-year versus Q1 last year. Historically on bad debt expense, our approach has been to book allowances for specific doubtful accounts. In general, we include 100% of the balances for any franchisee that gets over 60-days in arrears. This quarter, one of the things that happened is, as I\u2019m sure you are aware of the implementation of the new GAAP standards on current expected credit losses. So given the implementation of that standard, we of course reflected on the COVID crisis. And the disruption that it is causing. And we thought it was appropriate to book some additional allowance in Q1. And that represented about $5.5 million of the $22 million increase year-over-year. So that leaves about $17 million increase versus Q1 last year that was in franchisees specific situations. That was primarily driven by a few KFC accounts, mostly in Europe and Latin America, and a handful of Pizza Hut U.S. accounts.  If I if I take this from a different lens, just to give you a sense on this being an issue around a small number of accounts in Q1. If I take our total balance you know for allowance for doubtful accounts on a global basis, that if you took the top-20 franchisees that we have reserved, which is 1% of our 2,000 franchisees around the globe, that represents about 70% of the total franchisees specific reserves. A different way to slice the current balance, about half of it is driven by Pizza Hut U.S. And Pizza Hut U.S., again is driven by a handful of accounts. There are eight Pizza Hut U.S. accounts that drive 80% to 90% of that balance. We have discussed those handful of situations in the past. So obviously, that is just a snapshot of where we are in the first quarter. As Keith mentioned, when we were opening up this call, it is a really unprecedented situation and the pandemic is causing strain on our franchisees particularly in markets where stores have been closed and we are working hard with them to help bridge to the other side. David Gibbs : And Sara as far as your question on Pizza Hut, we are very excited about the impact it that Kevin Hochman is having on that business, and his new team, he has brought some new people in with him. you have probably seen that we have repositioned the brand\u2019s tagline, to from Our Hut to Yours, that was done before the impact on our business from COVID-19, but really reinforces our credentials as a delivery player. There has been all sorts of work on the operation side in terms of our delivery capabilities. You have seen us rollout contactless carryout in addition to contactless delivery. As a reminder, both of those things were invented by our Pizza Hut China business. And Joey Wat and her great team is being very innovative on reacting to the challenges of this environment. And now they have rolled across our business all around the world. And in fact have also rolled across the industry as it is a great idea to meet the needs of consumers at this time. So this focus on contactless, the repositioning of the brand and focusing on the delivery and carryout component. Actually led to - recently we set a digital sales record in the Pizza Hut U.S. business doing more sales on typical Friday than we did on either of the last two Super Bowls which held our previous record. So it gives you a sense that the brand is going through some rapid changes, things that have been on our roadmap. And what I would like to say is, this three month period we are in right now is basically going to have three years worth of changes to our businesses. And it is accelerating the plan that we had for Pizza Hut and getting us to be truly this digital delivery carryout business. Another major benefit to the Pizza brand, which Kevin and the team are leveraging, it is just the trust that consumers have with the brand given its long operating history and being part of the fabric of the community, Pizza Hut is a trusted restaurant brand. And in times like this, I think consumers are turning to those kinds of brands. Keith Siegner : Next question, operator. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger, UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Thanks and hope you are all doing well. Just wondering, if you could talk a bit more about the longer term unit growth and potential impacts exiting the COVID situation. Understanding it is difficult to determine when you settle back into that algorithm. Could you help us think a little bit about the puts and takes to unit development over the next couple of years maybe how the current situation could broadly impact you know franchisee demand or ability to open units based on access to capital, et cetera. And any kind of puts and takes, any thought would be great. Thank you. David Gibbs : Obviously, we are excited about the unit growth that we delivered in 2019 with over 2,000 net new units and that was obviously up from 2018, which was up from 2017. We have had sequential improvement in unit development and expected that to continue into 2020. This new environment changes a lot of the variables. But we still think long-term that the ability to grow our unit count will be there, it may be slightly different. Obviously, with off-premise being a bigger part of the equation, our assets may be a little bit more designed for off-premise than they are today. And in terms of the variables, Dennis as you think about this, there could be an opportunity from a real estate standpoint, I think Yum! China talked about this last night on their call. There could be an opportunity for locations that might not have previously been available. Brands that are doing well in this environment should have an opportunity to expand their footprint. Of course, the challenges in the short-term, our capital availability to our franchisees. And that is something that we will look for them to get through. But we have obviously withdrawn our guidance. So I\u2019m not going to give you exact numbers about what we think about the future. But there is no reason to think that this brands - that our business in any way, shape or form is not going to be a growth business long-term. And unit development is a big part of that. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. Hope everyone is doing well. Chris, my question is about the level of cash that you might need to consume here in the short run to assist franchisees. I was wondering if you could help frame up that dynamic. And then as you think about bad debt expense heading into the second half of the year. I guess how are you thinking about the risks of allowing some of the I guess weaker performing franchisees to defer payments. And what that might look like as the year unfolds here. Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, David. Good questions. Obviously I think for all companies right now managing liquidity through the crisis is top of the list. We feel really, like we are in a really strong position given the moves that we made that I mentioned earlier around starting last year hitting pause on share purchases. And then making the bond offering right at the beginning of April that short up our cash position. We think that gives us plenty of liquidity and plenty of cushion to work with our franchisees as we move through the next quarter. So you think about these grace periods, it is only a subset of franchisees. We will be making those available to franchisees who need the access to capital. And so if you think about our cash burn over the next few months. The number one factor is what is happening to the overall sales rate. And then second, as we see franchisees take advantage of the grace periods we will see couple of months there where, we will have fewer royalties coming in the door. But then as we collect on the back end of that, that will shore back up. But we have got plenty of cushion we feel with our current cash position. In terms of franchisee health, you know, as we mentioned one of the qualifications for being able to take advantage of those grace periods for the franchisees who need it, is that they are in good standing. And so around the globe, our brand teams have worked closely with the franchisees to manage eligibility into that program. So that is something that we have been managing carefully as we go through this. But as I mentioned earlier, this is just one leg of the stool. There is so many other components starting with the great leadership of our franchisees and what they are doing to drive sales, what they are doing to drive the performance of their own businesses, plus all of the assistance they are getting from their other partners in certain cases. And it is the collection of those that gives us confidence about how our franchisees come out on the backside even stronger. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question operator. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. I appreciate the visibility on unit openings is unclear at this point. Do you expect though, an uptick in the number of permanent closures in the system? And if so what do you think that is. Could you specifically inside of that talk about the Pizza Hut situation in the U.S., I think there was already some anticipated closures does that accelerate that process? And then finally, you talk about franchisee assistance in relief on royalties? Are there other options on the table? Or do you draw the line there, I\u2019m thinking about either add fund contribution top-ups from the company or even direct capital injections into certain franchisees, if those are considered options or not? David Gibbs : Thanks John. I guess on your first question on unit development, you are right it is unclear just because of the variables that I mentioned earlier. Certainly when you have 50,000 restaurants around the world, we are naturally closing certain number of them every year. That is why we open a growth number of units and have net no openings. That was what we talked about. So to the extent that there may be some situations that we wanted to get out of with units, this would be an opportunity to take advantage of them, if they are closed now. But we are not anticipating a massive number of permanent closures coming out of this. And as far as the Pizza Hut business goes. In the U.S., as I mentioned, Kevin Hochman and franchisees are working really closely together to take the brand to new heights. And become the modern delivery player in the category. And that involves the asset base, and they are working together on that. So there may be opportunities there. But again, capital and there are other constraints that will play into that. As far as the relief that we are providing for the franchisees. As Chris has described it as a grace period, and the money is coming back to us at the other end of the grace period, there really haven\u2019t been discussions about other items like advertising or anything like that and we think the franchisees are working closely with us and we are getting through this. As far as other options for things that we might do, there may be a couple of specific situations, where we will have to do something beyond different than what we have described. But there is no wholesale other programs without the launch to address any of that. Keith Siegner : Thank you. operator, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks. One clarification question. Within Taco Bell\u2019s 30% sales decline at the March. Can you contextualize how much of that is attributable to those lack of breakfast both in terms of sales and the store counts. And then my question was really just in the comment on the outside capital is available to assist here. Just curious what that means for what options are on the table. Is this a willingness to take on more debt? Could this perhaps even you know pipe in the business? Just your thoughts and what kind of is in the range of play there. Thanks. David Gibbs : Thanks, Andrew. As far as Taco Bell specifically, I do want to just give a shout out to Mark King and the Taco Bell team who put up a great year in 2019. And then as we mentioned in the script, we are targeting along at 6% same-store sales growth until the impact of COVID-19. I have been really proud of how the Taco Bell team has reacted to this. As you mentioned in many ways, their business has had the most impact because they have a breakfast business which our other businesses don\u2019t and because they were relies on late nights. As some of you can imagine, the breakfast business is impacted when people aren\u2019t on the roads going to work. They are not going through a drive through for breakfast as much. And the late night businesses obviously impact people aren\u2019t out in bars and theaters and things like that. So that Taco Bell had the impact from that. But their core businesses drive through business is perfectly designed for this time. And then they are embracing the delivery and carry out model. And, I think Taco Bell and their creative team is well positioned to get through this. As far as the outside capital, that wasn\u2019t meant to imply anything along the lines of pipe or anything like that. That was more designed to address. If we do have franchisees that are in financial distress, one of the options we have is interested buyers outside the system, in addition to in many cases, buyers in the system as options to take over those businesses and restructure them. So I think people recognize that Yum! given the skew towards off-premise is well positioned to come out of this stronger. And there are a lot of outside people with capital that want to participate in that, which Chris and the team will take into account as we address the few situations that become problematic. Keith Siegner : Thank you. operator, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. Just kind of looking at this overall crisis. I was just curious that if there is any initial type of thinking about maybe as you kind of look at the corporation, the brands kind of the need to I guess accelerate some work or dig even deeper on things like digital consumer insights and data. If there is an opportunity I mean again, you are kind of coming out of the other side of this. You kind of think about the way that Yum! as a corporation is structured or are you happy with the work that you have done in the past couple of years from a structural perspective? And secondly and related is there an opportunity to how some of the brands themselves work closer together? I know from your many logical reasons, a lot of efforts have had to be siloed. But is this an opportunity to maybe kind of apply more comprehensive digital data consumer insights offered across all the brands that Yum! and maybe you do some more cross brand functionality that perhaps you weren\u2019t doing before? David Gibbs : Yes. Great question, John. As I mentioned earlier, I really do things in the few months that we are in the middle of right now are accelerating a lot of trends in the business that would have taken years to take hold like digital order and pay and delivery and technology and all the stuff that everybody is talking about. So in a lot of those things, we have already been working on. We have talked a lot on these calls about the fact that we beefed up our technology team adding Clay Johnson. And at the brand adding all sorts of talent and all the different projects that we have to become much more technology oriented and leveraging that for our business. Those things lend themselves to cross brand collaboration. One of the great things that is going on right now is myself and all of the brand teams and the Yum! executive team are meeting every other day on this crisis to compare notes and leverage our learnings from around the world. We sit in a very unique position, starting with leveraging the learnings that came out of Asia and Yum! China, but all of the other things that are going on around the world right now. This is a great opportunity for us to work closer together and that is exactly what is happening. So I don\u2019t think that is going to be a structural change. I think it is a mindset change. I have talked a lot about the need for even more collaboration in the new world. That is happening, and I think that will serve as well, when we come out of this on the other side. Keith Siegner : Thanks operator. We have time for one more question please. Operator : Okay. Today\u2019s final question will come from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Awesome. Great, thanks. Just a couple for me. First, how close are you working with the franchisees to access the PPP loans in the U.S.? And then I guess second, in terms of thinking about historically that the growth of the franchise system and new store growth. How much of that has been self funded versus debt funded? And then I guess lastly, it is thinking about this business longer term. And I think you just kind of answered part of this, but kind of continuing the thread. Has there been anything that you have implemented throughout this crisis that you believe will carry forward from an operating perspective, post crisis across the brands? Thank you. David Gibbs : Why don\u2019t I take last two, and then I will turn it over to Chris on the PPP. As far as new store development, the same thing that Chris talked about, we get 2,000 franchisees, some of them have no debt, like Yum! China, some of them have significant debt. So I don\u2019t know that there is one broad brush answer to how we financed new store development. I think some of it is through taking on debt and others are doing cash flow of their business? Clearly the increase in new unit development indicates that the return and almost all the it being done by franchisees indicates that the returns franchisees are getting meet all of their requirements. And we still, we do think that those that can access capital or have capital will take advantage of the opportunity to build a potentially insecure size at potentially better rates right now. As far as, I\u2019m sorry, the third part of the question? Jon Tower : What things will sustain? David Gibbs : What things will sustain? Yes, it is a great question in terms of what the future of the restaurant industry looks like. Obviously, there is these trends that are accelerating right now, as I mentioned, digital order and pay, delivery and off-premise. I think automation has a bigger role to play in the business as people look for less contact in their food. But then I also think that this is creating new opportunities that play to the strengths in Yum!. We have this strength in value and convenience and really customer trust. The foundation of QSR has always been value and convenience, but these may have different definitions as we go forward. So convenience, one of the things I\u2019m excited about is curbside pickup. Curbside pickup in a contactless way, is really a great way for customers can take control of the order process, it has all sorts of advantages over delivery in some ways in terms of cost, accuracy and time. And we are seeing surprisingly well, our delivery businesses increasing our carryout business through the contactless curbside pickup, like we have launched at Pizza Hut is also increasing pretty strongly. So that is a change that I think is here to stay I bought a TV the other day and did it through curbside pickup and it was an easy process. And I know consumers are starting to talk more about that. I think on value you are seeing a big change in terms of family meals, obviously with more people eating at home. I think some of that is going to stay in our brands have been great at pivoting to offering more value in larger party size constructs. And, I think the thing that we probably haven\u2019t talked about enough is, when you have three brands like we have with the history that they have with consumers. There is a level of trust that consumers have. I have seen it in a lot of surveys about what brands they want to use at this time. There really has to be that trust. We have always been about things like going above and beyond in food safety. We have had a long history of operating in the communities that people live in. And I think they trust our brands. And I think that trust in brands is going to continue. I will let Chris talk just a little bit about franchisee accessing PPP. And then I will close out. Chris Turner : Yes. So, on the question of Government support. Again, we are thinking about franchise health globally. And if we think about our 2000 franchisees around the globe, I mentioned earlier the mix of small businesses and larger businesses. When we talk about that sales drop we experienced in March. The overall average being down 30%, but in some markets with full closures, those franchisees experienced even bigger drops. That was a dramatic cash flow hit to any of our franchisees in markets that were affected like that. And, as we mentioned given the nature of the pandemic, it is requiring this multifaceted solve that includes the franchisees driving their business. Yum! providing things like the grace periods, the other suppliers being involved and these Government support programs. Those Government programs are different from one country to the next. The nature of the program and the extent of the program is obviously specific to what each government and each country or locality is doing. To the extent we can we try to help our franchisees understand those programs. And we appreciate that they are available. Ultimately, it is the individual franchise\u2019s decision to access any of those programs. But certainly, to the extent the franchisees have been challenged, and the aim of many of those programs around the globe is focused on keeping employees employed, keeping them safe, and helping provide a service to consumers in that market. We appreciate the fact that that has been there to support our franchisees and market where it has been available around the globe. David Gibbs : Great. Thanks, Chris. And thanks, everybody. Just want to reiterate. As you all know, we finished 2019 on a really strong note. And we are off to a good start in 2020, before the impact of COVID-19. The business, on a widespread broad basis, it was in good shape before the end of 2019. But we are incredibly uniquely positioned to get through this and come out stronger. And that is our marching orders. And so all we talk about is how do we identify the consumer trends that we need to react to, be nimble and evolve the business, leveraging the learnings that we have from those 290 brand/country combinations. Our unrivaled culture and talent, particularly in terms of the way we are always been attuned to consumers\u2019 needs and constantly evolving. What we offer to the changing consumer is serving us well in this time of changing consumer needs. Our iconic brands, as I mentioned, with the trust and this combination of value and convenience. The diversified business model with 290 brand/country combinations gives us this ability to leverage learnings from around the world. And then finally the fourth point is off-premise. We are made for contactless. Just one simple stat in the U.S. Taco Bell and KFC 95% of their stores have drive through. These were always competitive advantages but bigger advantages today.  So I will just finish by thanking the people that bring our business to life on the front lines every day that have been amazing as we have gone through this, our employees and the restaurants and our franchisees. Our franchisees are building stronger bonds with us than we have ever had working together to get through this together. And our employees are doing an incredible job of serving consumers safe food in a contactless manner, to bring some normalcy to their lives during these challenging times. Thanks, everyone, for your time today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Second, third quarter earnings will be released on October 29, 2020, with the conference call on the same day. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking and recognizing our employees, franchisees and restaurant team members around the globe. They have adapted to the incredible challenges of 2020 with remarkable agility bringing our delicious, affordable food to customers in a low contact manner. As a result, we are well positioned to leverage our scale and capabilities to generate profitable system sales growth in the new customer environment. On the foundation of our resilient, highly diversified business model, we are driving our recipes for growth and good to emerge a stronger company for all stakeholders. Our Recipe for Growth, using our four key growth drivers, continues to guide our business strategy. So I'll start with an overall review of the second quarter and use a few examples to illustrate the power of our relevant, easy and distinctive, or RED, brands unmatched operating capability and Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth drivers. Then Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our bold restaurant development growth driver and our healthy liquidity position. First, Q2 results, the quarter was significantly impacted by COVID-19, the primary driver of our 25% core operating profit decline. Overall, Yum! system sales declined 12% with a 15% same-store sales decline, offset by a 3% increase in net units year-over-year. The impact on our sales in each of our market's dependent on the timing, severity and duration of the outbreak as well as our reliance on dine-in sales in the market. Overall, our sales declines were primarily driven by temporary store closures, which peaked in early April at about 11,000 restaurants. We then experienced a consistent pace of reopening until our June 10 8-K filing when approximately 5,000 units or 10% of our global system remained close. I'm excited to share that closures have now fallen to less than 2,500 units, which means roughly 95% of our system is open for business in full or limited capacity. The remaining closed stores are dispersed around the globe with about 70% located in balls, transportation centers, airports and the like. We're encouraged that, generally speaking, when our stores are open, customer trust and demand are high. This is true even though the majority of our dining rooms have been and remained closed, highlighting the importance of executing the off-premise occasion well and demonstrating the resilience of our business model. Our brands are becoming even more RED by leveraging consumer insights to adjust operations, menu options and marketing and by digitally enabled off-premise capabilities across the globe. With our focus on delivery carryout in digital, we have passed some tremendous milestones this year. We now have over 34,000 restaurants offering delivery around the world, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, in part driven by expanded aggregator partnerships. Our digital sales mix has increased dramatically to over 30% of system sales, a 15-point year-over-year improvement. To put that into context, during the quarter, digital sales were approximately $3.5 billion, a $1 billion step-up from Q2 2019. Our brands, working in concert with our Yum! Central technology team, have shown remarkable agility and will continue to unlock sales growth over the near and long term. That's a perfect segue to our 4 RED brands. Let's start with KFC Division results. Q2 system sales declined 18% as a 21% same-store sales decline was partially offset by 6% net new unit growth. Encouragingly, trends improved from early April troughs, fairly in line with the rate of store reopens. KFC started the quarter with 5,000 restaurants temporarily closed; peaked in mid-April with about 6,000 closures; and following a massive effort to reopen, ended Q2 with about 95% of stores opened. Our performance in open stores is primarily linked to off-premise capability within a given market. We saw consistent strength in Canada, the U.S. and Australia. And after government-mandated closures eased, we saw resiliency in Germany and the U.K. All of these markets have good drive-thru coverage, strong off-premise capabilities and robust digital foundations. Western Europe, in particular, KFC France, which was hit hard early on, led the way in reopening markets where all channels and restaurants have been closed due to lockdown. The local teams took action to keep our team members and customers safe while working with government bodies to ensure that we were among the first QSRs to reopen. In the U.S., KFC is serving the right occasion at the right time, fulfilling families' needs for delicious meals to take home and unpack around the dinner table. The timing of our launch of kfc.com for pickup and delivery, the addition of new aggregators and our bundled bucket meals that travel well all contributed to a fantastic quarter. We recorded the highest average sales per store in the brand's history during a week in early May, and we finished with 7% same-store sales growth for the quarter. Moving on to Pizza Hut, the division reported a Q2 system sales decline of 10% with a 9% same-store sales decline and a 1% net new unit decline. Pizza Hut entered the quarter with over 3,500 restaurants temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with same-store sales growth trending in line with temporary closures. Closures then peaked in mid-April with about 4,000 restaurants temporarily closed. By the end of Q2, about 87% of Pizza Huts were open, with Pizza Hut U.S. Express stores representing half of the remaining closures. In general, markets that operate a diamond segment have significant stores in malls or transport hubs or have Express units have been most impacted by closures and government restrictions. While the effect has been partly offset by increases in delivery and carryout demand, the net impact globally has been a headwind. At Pizza Hut International, temporary closures peaked at approximately 24% in April. Importantly, certain markets, including Canada, Japan and Australia, closed the quarter with positive results, though this was offset by markets with substantial dine-in and Express footprints. Those markets include the U.K., much of Europe and Central America, the Middle East and select markets in Asia. In aggregate, off-premise channels generated a positive 10% same-store sales growth and represented 80% of total sales internationally. At Pizza Hut U.S., we balanced value and innovation as we introduced the $9.99 large 3 topping deal and premium products such as the Big Dipper and the Big Dinner Box. Same-store sales grew 5% in the second quarter, and I'm excited to share that in early May, the U.S. recorded its highest average sales week for delivery and carryout in the past 8 years. Our off-premise channel generated 21% same-store sales growth when excluding the drag of closed Express stores or 16% same-store sales growth when including the drag of closed Express units. During the quarter, we launched our contactless initiative by adding additional pickup and payment options for customers. Since March 2020, Pizza Hut has served close to 20 million contactless digital orders. We've also welcomed several million new and reengaged customers to our Hut Rewards loyalty program. At Taco Bell, system sales declined 6%, driven by an 8% same-store sales decline, partially offset by 4% net new unit growth. Taco Bell temporary closures peaked at 500 at the end of Q1 and had reopened 100 units by mid-April. By the end of Q2, about 97% of Taco Bell units were open. At Taco Bell U.S., we pivoted our marketing to promote group bundles, drive awareness of contactless drive-thru and delivery and thanked our fans, heroes and communities by giving away free Dorito Locos tacos. We coupled this with abundant value offerings such as cravings, boxes and party packs and our all-new at-home Taco bar, which supported record-breaking sales on Cinco De Mayo and further established Taco Bell as a destination for groups. And to adjust to widespread dining room closures, our company and franchise partners doubled down on world-class operations as Taco Bell served an additional 4.8 million cars through our drive-thruns while achieving an 18-second faster drive-thru time year-over-year. Taco Bell has always been an easy brand for customers to access. And now with the ability to order on the Taco Bell app and pick up through our world-class drive-thru, they are redefining the easy part of RED. During the quarter, we added over 1 million new users to our active e-commerce platforms through our mobile app and tacobell.com. These operational improvements and increased focus on digital and delivery have made an impact in driving profitable growth for our franchisees, and we are extremely proud of our operators for making it happen. Following an eventful first full quarter as our newest brand, I'm pleased to share details about the Habit Burger Grill. With the majority of the Habit's assets being in line or end cap units, COVID-19 significantly impacted Habit sales just as we were closing on the acquisition in mid-March. With over half of sales typically coming from dine-in and temporary closures running at approximately 10% of habit's throughout the quarter, they faced a massive headwind. Impressively, from the April sales lows, the Habit quickly turned things around by shifting focus to off-premise. They ended Q2 with an 18% same-store sales decline, mostly due to temporary closures, and recent trends for open stores are flat to slightly negative. During the quarter, the Habit built customer awareness of new access options and shifted marketing to focus on family meal bundles such as the variety meal that can feed a family for only $30. Digital ordering via mobile and kiosk represented 40% of sales during the quarter. And importantly, each month this year, we have seen a steady increase in the number of app downloads. I've been incredibly impressed with the resilience of this brand, the agility of the entire Habit team and the know-how sharing taking place between Habit and our legacy brands. None of us could have imagined how Q2 would play out when we made the decision to acquire The Habit, but I'm more confident than ever that the brand and the team will create a new long-term growth opportunity for Yum!. I'd now like to spend a moment on the current state of the business. Of course, there remains incredible uncertainty in the global macro outlook owing to COVID-19 and its implications, as evidenced by the different trends we see in each of our 290 brand/country combinations. Due to this uncertainty, we must remain vigilant. That said, we are encouraged about our continued store re-openings, the general financial health of our global franchisee base and our own strong liquidity and balance sheet. Just as importantly, same-store sales trends for open stores stabilized in June, just a few points short of flat. And despite the majority of our dining room still being closed, these trends have continued into July. Finally, earlier this year, we elevated our Recipe for Good to serve as our road map for Yum's global strategy for citizenship and sustainability. That recipe is built on the three key pillars of food, people and planet. Those of you familiar with Yum! know we have always been a people-first company committed to ensuring the safe, welcoming and inclusive environment for our customers and employees. But recent tragedies across the U.S. have revealed this dark and unacceptable reality and have shown us that we must do more. To that end, at the end of June, we announced our unlocking opportunity initiative, with a $100 million commitment over the next 5 years, of which $50 million was funded in the second quarter. This initiative will promote equity and inclusion, education and entrepreneurship for our employees, frontline restaurant teams and communities around the world and will serve as the cornerstone of our Recipe for Good going forward. I look forward to providing further updates on our progress on unlocking opportunity as we bring it to life. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results, bold restaurant development and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. But first, I'd like to express my appreciation for the focus and execution of our team members around the globe who rose to the occasion and generated competitively superior results. It has now been a year since I joined Yum!, and the challenges COVID-19 has presented to the entire restaurant industry have given me an even greater appreciation for the power and resilience of Yum!'s unique and highly diversified business model. That, combined with our tremendous strides in digital and delivery, innovation and operations, give me confidence that Yum! was, is and will remain a high-growth company generating attractive returns for all stakeholders. To begin, let's discuss Q2. As David mentioned, core operating profit declined 25% during the quarter, and overall Yum! system sales declined 12%. This was driven by a 15% same-store sales decline, partly offset by a 3% increase in net units year-over-year. The brand most impacted was KFC, where operating margin, excluding FX, decreased approximately 8% versus prior year, driven by lower same-store sales due in large part to temporary closures, higher bad debt expense and lower company restaurant margins, partially offset by net new unit growth. Excluding The Habit, general and administrative expenses, excluding FX and special items, were approximately flat over the second quarter 2019 as onetime COVID-related expenses were offset by reduced P&E, other efficiency actions and onetime savings. Interest expense was approximately $131 million, a 10% increase from prior year, driven by higher debt balances, including our outstanding revolver balance, partially offset by lower interest rates on our floating rate debt. We recorded $84 million of pretax investment income related to the change in fair value of our investment in Grubhub, which resulted in a $0.21 benefit to EPS in the second quarter. As we recorded $24 million of pretax investment income in the second quarter of 2019 for a $0.06 benefit to EPS, our Grubhub investments favorably impacted year-over-year EPS growth by $0.15. Our effective tax rate was 18.8% during the quarter, a decrease from the prior year, driven by tax benefits from share-based compensation. Adding this up, EPS, excluding special items, was $0. 82. This represented a 12% decline compared to ex special EPS of $0.93 in the second quarter of 2019. On the bold restaurant development front, we delivered 3% net new unit growth over the second quarter of 2019. This was benefited by the addition of 276 Habit restaurants in Q1 of this year and the stellar unit growth we had in the second half of 2019. During the quarter, we opened 328 restaurants and closed 446, with openings led by China, Asia, the U.S., Russia and Thailand. To put the quarter into context, COVID-19 impact and uncertainties led to lower-than-normal gross openings and somewhat higher-than-normal closures which, in combination, drove year-over-year net unit growth to 3% compared to our recent run rate of 4%. These uncertainties should abate in time, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for net unit growth backed by strong unit level economics. Next, the vast majority of our restaurants temporarily closed due to the pandemic have already partially reopened, and we continue to monitor those few areas of the world where we have restaurants that remain temporarily closed. COVID-19 economic impacts and recoveries are unique to each country and hard to predict. Therefore, while it's possible, some of these restaurants may end up closing permanently. As of now, it is too early to forecast that outcome with accuracy. As we've highlighted over the past few months, we are supporting our 3C franchise partners during the pandemic. The primary tools for doing so include capital obligation deferrals and royalty grace periods, which have largely been successful in helping our franchisees. Where a franchisee cannot continue to operate due to deep financial distress, our preference is to assist with having a new or existing franchise partner acquire and operate their restaurants. As David mentioned, we have been encouraged by the resilience of our franchisees during the course of the pandemic. Partnering with and supporting them through the crisis highlighted the importance of ensuring a strong system. The general health of our global franchisee base is good and the vast majority are expected to emerge from the pandemic well positioned for future growth. As our focus shifts from short-term crisis management to long-term growth, our recently formed franchisee health committee is working to enhance our visibility into the health of our global system and to ensure our franchisees maintain long-term financial strength. As it relates to the Chapter 11 filing of NPC, one of our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees, this was an expected development, and we view it as an opportunity to create a better future for Pizza Hut restaurants owned by NPC and therefore, the overall system in the U.S. As the proceedings continue, we expect that there will be some issues that we can resolve with NPC and related parties directly and others that will require briefings and court rulings. Ultimately, we will support an outcome that results in a lower, more sustainable level of debt, a higher focus on operational excellence and a greater level of investment for the restaurants in the NPC system. In Q2, bad debt expense related to royalties, rent and other franchise services we provide was $13 million, an increase of $11 million compared to the second quarter of 2019, but well below our first quarter figure. The expense was attributable to incremental bad debt in KFC International due to financial hardships encountered by certain franchisees, largely due to temporary store closures, as well as bad debt in the U.S. related to NPC. This increase was partially offset by significant recoveries in the U.S. related to Pizza Hut, as sales and unit level profitability rebounded strongly during the quarter. We are encouraged with the improvement shown in the second quarter. Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion, excluding restricted cash. This represented 5.5 times net leverage of consolidated EBITDA, which is slightly above our historical target of approximately 5 times. Importantly, we began paying off our revolver draw during Q2, with only $575 million drawn at quarter's end compared to $950 million drawn at the end of Q1. When considered alongside with the $0.47 dividend we declared during the quarter, we believe this should clearly demonstrate the confidence we have in our liquidity position at this time. Second, our capital priorities remain unchanged : invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return remainder excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. Regarding our commitment to a healthy balance sheet, we plan to continue repayment of our revolver drawdown and to grow back into our historical 5 times consolidated net leverage target over time. Third, we are ending the suspension of our $2 billion share repurchase program. We may resume repurchases should business trends persist and should we continue to gain confidence in the time line for achieving a healthy balance sheet, as I just outlined. As a reminder, we've not repurchased any shares under our current authorization, which runs through the middle of 2021. In summary, Yum!'s future is bright. Our business model has proven resilient, growth in our digital capability and sales has accelerated and overall sales continue to trend in the right direction as we reopen. We remain confident our brands are purpose-built for delivering a modern off-premise dining experience to customers around the globe. Just as important to our long-term growth, the investment case for building new units is as strong as ever, especially when enhanced by our continued investments in digital capabilities, such as ordering and payment and an enhanced drive-thru and numerous contactless off-premise access options. By leveraging these scale benefits to drive profitable system sales growth for franchisees, we believe we are well-positioned to accelerate growth and create value for all stakeholders in the future. That said, lingering uncertainties remain for the near-term, which make the time frame for such acceleration difficult to forecast with confidence. Therefore, we believe it is still too early to reassert specific guidance. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to discussing progress in coming quarters. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Q \u2013 John Glass : Thanks very much. Chris, just going back to the comments on development. What are the conversations with the franchisees? I know it matters by market, by brand. Are you willing to change your philosophy in terms of capital allocation to help rekindle that growth in certain markets? How do they think about the share opportunity ahead of them in certain markets where some of these smaller chain's independents? What \u2013 I know you're not going to give specific guidance, but can you talk about the relative enthusiasm? Is it too early to give a comment about that, about resuming growth in various markets? A \u2013 Chris Turner : Yeah. Good question, John. Obviously, unit development and growing our network has been an important part of our algorithm. And we think in the long-term, we remain confident that it will be an important part of Yum!'s story. Obviously, given the uncertainty in the near-term, we're not sure when we'll get back to that. But if you think about the factors that actually are driving this conversation, it depends really on where you are around the globe. We've got certain markets where sales are strong. Our brands have proven their resilience, and our franchisees are forward focused. You heard Yum! China last night reaffirm their units for the year. And then we've got other markets at the other end of the spectrum where we still got some closures or -- and where sales are more impacted by COVID. Those franchisees are focused on just basic operations right now. So the discussions really depend on where you are around the globe. But in general, we believe the investment case for our restaurants will be even stronger going forward. Our brands have proven resiliency. We believe real estate costs should be more favorable going forward. Our digital capabilities allow us to pivot to off-premise, and we'll obviously be looking at optimizing our footprints for that environment. So we feel really good about the investment case. David Gibbs : And look, that said, we're not wavering from our asset-light model, right? Our model is for franchisees to do development. Within that, though, we've been building a couple of Taco Bells, equity stores. To the point of your question, John, we are going to continue to do that. And then Habit, we talked about the data a little bit in the prepared remarks, but we've been really pleased with how Habit has gone through this and the resiliency of that business, and they have been building corporate stores. We'll continue to do that as we slowly open it up to franchising over time. So there will be company investment in mostly Taco Bells and Habit stores over the near term. Keith Siegner : Next question, please Operator : The next question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks for the question. You just touched a little bit on Yum!'s willingness, I guess, to maybe invest in some of these franchisees. And I guess the question comes back somewhat to the NPC situation. And I guess, if you could put some capital in and maybe accelerate some of the asset changes there. Is that something Yum!'s considering? Or is that something that will be off the table at this point? Thanks. Chris Turner : Yes. Again, back to the comment I just made. We're committed to the asset-light model. We never rule out any possibility, but there's plenty of interest in getting into all of our different businesses around the world as investors have seen how resilient our business is. And we're not going to comment very specifically about the NPC situation, but other than to say we're working productively. There's lots of interest in that business, and we expect it to be in the hands of a capable franchisee coming out of this process. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about Pizza Hut and KFC in particular. They would \u2013 I characterize them as maybe some of the few beneficiaries, if you will, of the changes in the consumer behavior during the pandemic. Both I think comping better. Certainly, the off-premise business repeats that, and we've seen it in a long time. Can you just talk about how you think about retaining some of that strength, specifically the two dynamics I'm interested is what happens when people are able to go out, eat again? Your dining rooms are open. How much of that do you think you'd give back? And then also to the extent that you've taken market share, how do you keep that Pizza Hut, x closures and dine-in comps, I think, over 20%, which is actually pretty consistent with what we've seen from other large pizza chains who have historically, I think, led Pizza Hut in many quarters. So I guess, how do you capitalize on these things? Or can you over the long term? Thanks. Chris Turner : Great question, Sara. And it's obviously our intent to hold on to the gains that we've made. A lot of the gains at Pizza Hut and KFC have been from the fact that they offer great Family Meal solutions, which is right for these times. But one of the things that I'm really encouraged about all of our brands is the incredibly positive feedback we're getting in our customer satisfaction surveys. Customers that are \u2013 and the new customers that are being drawn to our brands during these times. So those two things coupled together says that we should be able to hold on to some of these new customers, given the great experiences that they're having and the new normal It's very hard, obviously, to predict what the world will look like six months from now. I think we're most proud that we've demonstrated how resilient our businesses and how nimble we are and how we can pivot to meet customers as their needs change. We know, like a lot of other retailers, we're looking at data about how -- what happens when customers do return to dining-in in certain parts of the country or in certain markets. And we see a little bit of an impact on that to our business, but not to the degree that will lead you to conclude we'll give up the gain -- all the gains that we've gotten here. So, it's a pretty bright picture in terms of what it paints for the future. Keith Siegner : Thanks. Operator, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you and apologies, I went through the release, obviously, very quickly. First, the Taco Bell store margins really did jump off the page, considering the comp that you guys reported. Can you provide some color on that in terms of like what happened? And what out of that margin is actually sustainable? And if there is a kind of a new Taco Bell company store margin coming out of this is the first question. And then secondly, if I may, there's obviously been a lot of news in disruption in terms of third-party delivery. Can you comment on -- in the U.S. business specifically and around the world, if you'd like to, your ability to grow delivery dollars year-over-year? And how some potential changes in the relationship might benefit or, I guess, impact your business in some way? Thank you. Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, John. Good questions. On the Taco Bell store margins, I'd say, yes, obviously, 24.5% and outstanding result from Taco Bell. And I think the main takeaway for us is that shows how resilient the Taco Bell business model is, similar to what we've seen in our other brands around the globe. But I think that's the main takeaway for us is the resiliency. That was primarily driven by some things that probably are related to pandemic. So, we have seen higher average check sizes as consumers are buying more for family occasions than prior to the pandemic. We've also had some labor efficiencies as the dining rooms have been closed, and we've adjusted our operating hours for a bit. So, I'd say those two things were the primary things that helped. Of course, we had some things on the other side of the equation. We paid some extra bonuses to our front-line and had other COVID-related expenses. So, that helped balance it. So, I think it was a good story. But those two primary drivers of check and dining rooms, once those things go back to normal, those would be things that would sort of swing back to the other direction. So, I think the main takeaway is resiliency during the crisis. On third-party delivery, I think at the highest level, our philosophy remains we want to be accessible to our customers where they want to do business with us. And we build relationships with aggregators to serve that purpose. In terms of total delivery capabilities around the globe, we saw a more than 10% increase versus last year in terms of our number of restaurants. We're now north of 34,000 restaurants that offer delivery, up from just over 30,000 at this point last year. Part of that's driven by our aggregated relationships. Of course, we've got our own proprietary delivery capabilities and a number of those restaurants as well. So, it's a mix there. But I think in general, where customers are doing business with aggregators, we want to be there. David Gibbs : Yes. The other point about delivery as much as we've seen delivery growth, we've also seen a lot of carryout growth with options like curbside pickup in a contactless way, which is obviously great for our operators because it's a high-margin business when you can do -- carry out in that way. So the growth that we're seeing, yes, delivery is one of the drivers. But carryout is very much growing at the same kind of pace. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Thanks, and I hope you're all doing well. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about Taco Bell, the strength of the brand and the franchisees, and thinking about maintaining that industry-leading momentum going forward. Maybe specifically, if you could comment on some of the latest developments, including the loyalty program, what the opportunity there is, as well as menu simplification? And if the drivers there are more operations in speed or making way for new items coming in the future? Thank you very much. Chris Turner : Yeah. Look, Taco Bell was a bright spot for the quarter. If you look at -- they're basically flat on a two-year basis, and they made tremendous progress during the quarter. If you just look at our previous filings from sales results, you can see that they probably had the best results moving from April forward through the quarter. If you think about what -- in the U.S., for example, Taco Bell, with almost one-quarter of their sales is dine-in and the late night and breakfast business, they were impacted the most. So they had the most ground to make up. And now we've got into July, and Taco Bell, along with the other two big U.S. brands are all positive. So that's enormous progress given the hit to their business. It's due to the fact that they've pivoted really well, leveraging the option -- the menu that consumers love with items like the Grilled Cheese Burrito, that's obviously proven a hit. And the loyalty program, as you mentioned, which recently launched still in its infancy, but obviously has a lot of upside. The margins actually were somewhat of a record, tying a record for us for store-level margins in the quarter. So when you add all that up, it's the brand with a huge amount of momentum as we come out of the quarter. I'm very excited about the future for Taco Bell. The relationship with the franchisees, as you mentioned, couldn't be more positive. They've been great partners working through all these challenging times. Again, they were hit the most at the beginning of this pandemic. So they were the ones that were in some ways in the U.S. in the most dire straits, but quickly partnered together with the franchisees. Mark King and his team have done an amazing job to get the business on much more solid footing and with momentum right now. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. As investors try to better understand when the business can return to 4% net restaurant development, can you help set the backdrop a little bit? I'm looking to learn more about KFC International franchisees access to capital, particularly in emerging markets since this is the biggest engine behind Yum! development in the context of the bad debt expense step-up that you saw during the quarter? Thanks. Chris Turner : Yeah. Look, the return to 4% is not a matter of if, it's just a matter of when. And we have 2,000 franchisees around the world. The vast majority of them are coming out of this in good shape. But we have pockets where franchisees are still challenged. We still have a couple of thousand stores that are closed with our bigger presence in emerging markets and emerging markets struggling more to deal with the pandemic in their countries. That's a challenge, which all adds up to making it very difficult to predict exact timing on when we'll get back to our long-term algorithm. But again, there's so many positive things when it comes to development in terms of availability of sites, how resilient our business model has proven, which is obviously attractive to investors that want to invest in this space; the partnerships that we've developed with the vast majority of our franchisees to get through this together; and the positive feelings that creates and the interest in working together long-term to grow the brand. So it will vary by market. It will vary by franchisee in terms of when we get back to the algorithm. Obviously, Yum! China is already there, as they announced last night, which is very encouraging. Keith Siegner : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your advertising strategy, especially in the U.S. in the second half of the year. Do you guys plan to continue to advertise? Or do you plan on pulling back at all with the election year? And just my second question would be, do you need to get the dining rooms open to start to recapture the previous same-store sales, I guess, momentum you had pre-COVID? Or can you do that with the drive-thru units that you have currently? Thanks. Chris Turner : Yeah. Just taking the last one first on the dining rooms. The reality is that we've got 24,000 dining rooms... David Gibbs : That closed. Chris Turner : That are close today. So \u2013 and in the U.S., we really just have a fraction of our dining rooms open. So when you look at the results that we're getting, when you talk about our \u2013 excluding closed stores, we still have a lot of stores that are opened with closed dining rooms, it's really quite impressive that we're able to get sales globally back to approaching flat, without those dining rooms in the majority of our stores. So it's not critical to our success. It's obviously something that we will return to over time when it makes sense. And the teams have developed all the right safety protocols to do that, as you can imagine with plexiglass on the front counter and cleaning captains in the dining room to make sure that we clean high-touch points every 30 minutes, all the different things that you would imagine, we \u2013 company \u2013 the largest restaurant company the world would develop to ensure the safety of our customers. But the dining room piece is really something that we've been able to overcome quite successfully in most markets. Certain markets, obviously more reliant on it, Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants, obviously, in some cases, very reliant on it. So it does \u2013 the story does vary. But on average, it's a pretty good story in terms of overcoming dining rooms. On the advertising piece, obviously, our advertising algorithms have been changed in this environment. And we're looking at different ways of promoting our brands. The promotions that we're doing with products have changed. You've heard announcements about us skinnying down our menu. We're advertising more core products, advertising more through digital channels. But for the most part, we're committed to continuing to spend the advertising spend that we \u2013 each of our brands has. It varies by brand in terms of what the percentage of sales they spend are, but we're committed to that for the balance of the year. Keith Siegner : Thanks, operator. We'll now take the last question. Thank you. Operator : At this time, I'm not showing any additional questions. Keith Siegner : Okay. David, do you want to wrap up? David Gibbs : Yeah. Look, thanks, everybody, for spending time with us this morning. As you can tell from the comments, we're incredibly proud of the progress that we've made during the quarter. We were joking that April feels like it was back in 2018. It was so long ago. And what's relevant is the momentum we have coming out of the quarter. I think we've demonstrated that the business is incredibly resilient and nimble, that our teams around the world can move with speed to get new solutions out to meet customers' needs. And they've done that incredibly successfully. And really, what's happened this quarter is accelerated a lot of the strategies that we already had in place, which is a big positive in terms of the business that we do digitally. As we've mentioned, that's up $1 billion year-over-year, actually more than $1 billion. And we \u2013 that was part of our plan to grow that business, and we're proud of the progress we've made there. And even things like moving from dine-in assets to delivery assets, that's been accelerated by Q2 2020. So we're coming out of it much stronger, excited about the future. Yum! was, is and will remain a high-growth company for all stakeholders. I think we've demonstrated that this quarter. So thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Second, fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 4, 2021, with the conference call on the same day. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying thank you to our entire global system for exceptional execution of our Recipe for Growth and Good strategy during the quarter. Our employees, franchisees and restaurant team members are successfully adapting to this year\u2019s ever-changing environment, while also accelerating progress on our digital and technology journey. We\u2019ve deepened collaboration around the world and across functions and brands to bring customers our delicious food through safe contactless methods, while also caring for our team members, employees and communities. For that, I am incredibly proud. These efforts led to encouraging third quarter results, including a return to year-over-year core operating profit growth. Our restaurants that had temporarily closed because of the pandemic continued to reopen throughout the quarter. And despite many of our restaurants operating with only a portion of their normal sales channels, same-store sales growth in our open stores was approximately flat in aggregate. While 2020 has presented many challenges, our portfolio of brands has proven resilient. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong, franchisee health has improved and we\u2019re incredibly well positioned to drive global growth and maximize stakeholder value for years to come. Our Recipe for Growth using our four key growth drivers continues to guide our long-term strategy. So I\u2019ll start with an overall review of third quarter results and use a few examples to illustrate the power of our relevant, easy and distinctive, or R.E.D. for short; unmatched operating capability and unrivaled culture and talent growth drivers. Then Chris will share more details of our Q3 results, including some discreet one-time impacts, our bold restaurant development growth driver and our healthy liquidity position. First, Q3 results. Overall Yum! system sales grew 1% with a 2% increase in net unit\u2019s year-over-year, partially offset by a 2% same-store sales decline. COVID continued to impact the business both in terms of temporary closures of restaurants and limitations on the use of dining rooms, which some of our markets heavily rely upon. Despite the challenges related to COVID, we delivered core operating profit growth of 7%. This strength can be attributed to strong growth in our Taco Bell division and an improvement in franchisee health. Our third quarter same-store sales declines were once again, primarily driven by temporary closures. You may recall that as of our last earnings call we had less than 2,500 units fully closed. This number decreased to approximately 1,100 by the end of the quarter. And today it stands at about 1,000, which means roughly 98% of our system is open in a full or limited capacity. Assets located in malls, transportation centers, airports and the like continue to be pressured, making up many of the closures. Geographically, Pizza Hut at U.S., Latin America, Asia, and India make up the majority of these closures, but the situation remains dynamic and largely dependent on government responses to COVID based on local conditions. At the end of the quarter, we continued to have a significant number of our open restaurants, subject to dining room closures, or other limitations on access. However, as I mentioned earlier, despite the drag from these limitations, our off-premise channels aided by digital, enabled our open store base to deliver same-store sales that were flat for the quarter. This was an improvement of a few points from what we saw in the second quarter. Now let\u2019s talk about our four R.E.D brands. Starting with KFC division, which now accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit; Q3 system sales declined 1% as a 4% same-store sales decline was partially offset by 5% net new unit growth. KFC continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q3 with about 99% open in a full or limited capacity. The rapid recovery at KFC has largely been driven by off-premise capability, acceleration of digital and the reopening of temporarily closed stores. Many markets have started to show improvements, though the pace is varied. During the quarter, markets with robust, off-premise, and/or digital capabilities excelled, including strength in the U.S., the UK, Australia, Japan and Canada. Many of these markets delivered sales performance above their pre-COVID levels, and collectively represent about 30% of the KFC global portfolio. KFC continues to innovate on our core menu, including launching great products like the Famous Chicken Chicken Sandwich in Canada, and the Slab in Australia, and adding new bundles that offer great value for off-premise family dining. Importantly, markets such as Africa, much of Asia, parts of Europe and the Middle East started to show sequential improvement during the quarter by growing their off-premise capabilities to partially offset their dine-in reliance. KFC\u2019s most impacted geographies where markets where most of our temporary closures remained elevated, including Latin America and Caribbean, Asia, India, and the Middle East. These markets also tend to be are more dine-in-centric and had lower consumer mobility during the quarter. KFC U.S. had another fantastic quarter with 9% same-store sales growth owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business and digital. Our KFC U.S. drive-thru sales grew about 60% year-over-year with our largest day part growth occurring at midday and continued strength during the dinner day part. We also hit a delivery milestone with about 80% of KFC\u2019s in the U.S. now delivering many through multiple aggregator partners. Moving on to Pizza Hut, which now accounts for approximately 18% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported a Q3 system sales decline of 4% with a 3% same-store sales decline and a 4% net new unit decline. Global off-premise same-store sales grew mid-teens year-over-year, which is clearly encouraging. COVID is highlighting how important the future of off-premise is and we intend to use this momentum to further advance the off-premise category and continue to decrease our dine-in asset footprint. Please note that as we lean in on this opportunity to transition the asset base, we may continue to see closures present the near-term headwind to overall division net unit growth in Q4 and into next year. During the quarter, Pizza Hut continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q3 with about 96%, at least partially open in a full or limited capacity. Express units continue to be pressured, making up many of the remaining closures. The 9% same-store sales decline at Pizza Hut international for Q3 marked a significant improvement from Q2 lows, but the continued softness was largely a result of markets with substantial dine-in footprints such as China, parts of Asia, Central America and Europe. On the other hand, our off-premise focused markets continued to see strength. Canada, Japan, Taiwan, and Australia, all posted strong results, while the UK delivery business and South Africa saw improved momentum during the quarter. Importantly, our off-premise channel generated another quarter of positive 10% same-store sales growth, giving us confidence that our off-premise strategy is working and will be the foundation of the long-term growth story. Similarly, Pizza hut U.S. had another positive quarter with same-store sales growth of 6% with our off-premise channel generating 17% same-store sales growth, despite a 4% drag from closures and sales headwinds in express units. In addition to digital and convenience driving sales, we promoted abundant value with our $10 tastemaker, followed by a $11.99 Large 3-Topping Stuffed Crust Pizza, and $12.99 Double It Box. As for Taco Bell, which now accounts for approximately 35% of our divisional operating profit, system sales group 5%, driven by 3% same-store sales growth, and 3% net new unit growth. Taco Bell continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q3 with about 80 closures. And even more impressive was the profitability delivered by Taco Bell in part due to a 400 basis point increase in restaurant margins, a testament to the strength of the brand and the operating capabilities of the team. We expect these margins will likely return closer to historical levels as check averages normalize, dining room patronage increases and value focus moves to balance abundant value with price point value. In the U.S., Taco Bell\u2019s focus on abundant value offerings continued as the primary theme throughout the quarter. We also reintroduced innovation beginning with the debut of the Grilled Cheese Burrito, which quickly became a customer favorite mixing at 9%.This was followed by the $5 Grande Nachos Box, and $1 Nacho Crunch Double Stacked Taco. Taco Bell also continued to focus on a faster and easier customer experience by expanding aggregator partners and digital reach while breaking records in drive-thru times. Drive-thru demand skyrocketed this quarter as Taco Bell served over 30 million more cars and was 17 seconds faster year-over-year. During the quarter, we also unveiled our new Go Mobile asset design in the U.S. These assets will have a smaller footprint with a big emphasis on digital and off-premise with dedicated mobile pickup lanes and bellhops for outside in-person ordering. Better experience for customers and better economics for franchisees is a winning formula. Stay tuned for more about this exciting development opportunity. Now on to the Habit. We continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q3 with 97% of Habit restaurants open in a full or limited capacity. Same-store sales declined only 3% as effective off-premise solutions basically offset the dine-in sales mix loss, which was over half of sales pre-COVID. Supporting this, digital sales maintained second quarter\u2019s 40% mix, even with dining rooms and patios reopening. The Habit restaurants with drive-thru capabilities are performing exceptionally well, and they\u2019re yet another proof point for us as we continue to position the brand to fit the needs of consumers today. This is a perfect segue to our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver. When we first approached the Habit team about joining Yum!, one of our biggest takeaways was their operational excellence, consistently serving delicious quality food to customers. Now that they are part of Yum!, it\u2019s clear that they fit right in with our culture as well. We\u2019re extremely pleased with Russ Bendel and the team\u2019s ability to pivot. They joined our organization during this unprecedented time and jumped right into action, making sure that their food was accessible and safe, low contact and off-premise environment. Many of you have asked us about our interest in refranchising the Habit. Interest is extremely high, but we plan to be judicious with the approach and timing as we refine the off-premise aspects of the model, likely picking a few cornerstone partners to begin with. Now on to our unmatched franchise operating capability. We\u2019ve continued to accelerate our digitally enabled off-premise capabilities across the globe. We now have over 35,000 restaurants offering delivery around the world, representing an 11% increase year-over-year, in part driven by expanded aggregator partnerships. In addition to Grubhub, we now have order and delivery agreements in place with numerous scale delivery aggregators in both the U.S. and around the world, expanding our overall accessibility to customers through whatever channel they prefer. Our digital sales mix sustained second quarter\u2019s 30% of system sales and an 11-point year-over-year improvement. To put that into context, during the quarter, digital sales were approximately $4 billion, a $1 billion step up from Q3 2019. Our brands working in concert with our Yum!\u2019s central technology team have shown remarkable agility and will continue to unlock sales growth over the near- and long-term. To that end, we\u2019re optimizing our resources, reallocating them towards critical areas of the business that will drive future growth with strategic initiatives that include accelerating our digital technology and innovation capabilities to deliver a modern world-class team member and customer experience and improve unit economics. Like many companies, optimization includes managing expenses through a number of levers, including reduced travel, elimination of large meetings, freezing open roles, optimizing current roles, no 2021 salary increases and offering an early retirement program in the U.S. Of course, over time, we\u2019ll continue to invest in new roles across Yum! and our brands to support the most important areas of growth in our company. We\u2019re confident in the resilience of our highly diversified global business model and believe that investing in things that are integral to our growth and social impact strategy will help us emerge as an even stronger company. During the quarter, we published our 2019 Recipe for Good report. Since our last report, we have made significant progress, advancing our sustainability agenda globally with expanded efforts to offer customers more balanced choices, including plant-based and vegetarian menu items, and continuing action on climate change by increasing efficiencies in our restaurants and corporate offices and making progress on key deforestation commitments, including paper, palm oil, beef, and soy. And as we mentioned last quarter, we are stepping up our investment in Yum!\u2019s new social purpose to unlock opportunity in our people and communities, while championing equity, inclusion, and belonging across all aspects of our brands and franchise business. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results, bold restaurant development and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let\u2019s discuss Q3. As David mentioned, overall Yum!\u2019s system sales grew 1%. This was driven by a 2% increase in net unit\u2019s year-over-year, partly offset by a 2% same-store sales decline. Core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter, outpacing system sales growth, owing to strength at Taco Bell and improved franchisee health. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.01. This represented a 27% increase compared to ex-special EPS of $0.80 in Q3 2019. I\u2019ll now provide some additional color on several line items, beginning with general and administrative expenses. G&A, excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Habit, FX and special items increased by 3% over the third quarter 2019 due to charitable contributions related to COVID relief efforts; incentive compensation and other items, which offset reductions in T&E and other efficiencies. We are constantly balancing the need to be efficient with the desire to lean in on digital and technology during a period when acceleration in these initiatives should only enhance our competitive advantage. For the fourth quarter, our current estimate is that consolidated G&A expenses will approximate the fourth quarter of 2019 due to accelerated growth initiatives, which may offset continued efficiencies. Interest expense, ex-special was approximately $127 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, driven by higher outstanding borrowings offset by a decrease in rate on our floating rate debt. We recorded $8 million of pre-tax investment income related to the change in fair value of our investment in Grubhub, which resulted in a $0.02 benefit to EPS in the third quarter. Our Grubhub investment favorably impacted year-over-year EPS growth by $0.17 this quarter, as we lapped $60 million of pre-tax investment expense in the third quarter of 2019, which generated a negative $0.15 impact to Q3 2019 EPS. Our effective tax rate was 19.3% during the quarter, an increase from the prior year due to reversals of reserves in the prior year, as well as lower year-over-year share-based compensation benefits. Before moving on to bold restaurant development, I\u2019d like to add some detail around the impact of quarterly timing on our profitability this quarter, and how that relates to Q4. Beginning with bad debt, our franchise and property expenses were $13 million in the quarter compared to $43 million in the prior year. During the first half of 2020, we recorded significant bad debt expense due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID and increasing past due receivables from certain franchisees. During the third quarter, we saw significant recoveries of amounts past due in KFC international, as well as in the Pizza Hut U.S. business, including NPC. These recoveries resulted in a net $21 million benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, an improvement of $30 million compared to $9 million of expense in the third quarter of 2019. Now moving on to bold restaurant development. We delivered 2% net new unit growth over the third quarter of 2019. This includes the addition of 276 Habit restaurants in Q1 of this year and the stellar unit growth we had in Q4 2019 offset by COVID-related dislocations and Pizza Hut closures. We always anticipated uncertainties and delays could arise in development owing to global macro conditions, including the potential for COVID-related dislocations. This remained the case in the third quarter, as we opened 556 restaurants and closed 823, including 672 closures at Pizza Hut. Gross openings were led by China, Asia, the U.S., Russia, and Thailand. To put the quarter into context, three of our four brands have positive net new units year-to-date, despite these macro headwinds. This adds to our confidence that a return to net unit growth rates equal to, or better than 2019 is a question of when, not if. Nothing has changed on this front and we remain confident that these uncertainties should abate in time, and that we will generate meaningful net unit growth backed by strong unit level economics for years to come. In regards to Pizza Hut, where units have declined 5% year-to-date, there are several factors at play, which should assist in the transition to a healthier global estate off of which to grow. First, as it relates to the Chapter 11 filing of NPC, one of our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees, we consented to up to 300 mutually selected closures of underperforming and primarily dine-in stores. These closures are largely complete and are reflected in our ending unit count for the third quarter. Second, on our Q4 2018 earnings call, we mentioned that we anticipated between 100 and 150 closures due to overlap following our Telepizza alliance. While only six overlap closures occurred in 2019, 47 closures have occurred thus far in 2020. Third, COVID dislocations have impacted off-premise location development as with our other brands. Fourth, while COVID has hastened the transition and the closure of casual dining based restaurants, we still have a lot of work to do on transitioning the global asset base to off-premise focused assets. For both Pizza Hut U.S. and international, the closures for the quarter resulted in an asset mixed shift to about 36% dine-in, down from 38% in Q2. We expect the mix to continue to migrate downward over time, though caution the transition will continue to take some time. The hasten transition in the Pizza Hut asset base and the closure of Telepizza overlap units will present a near-term headwind to the divisions net unit growth in Q4 and into next year. Taking this dynamic into account, along with lingering COVID-related uncertainties on our global development across all brands, we currently estimate Yum!\u2019s overall absolute units to be roughly flat at the end of Q4 as compared to the end of Q3. This would be an improvement from both the second and third quarters\u2019 results and a solid step toward returning to net unit growth rates equal to or better than 2019 Now, for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position, as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 5.2 times, which is marginally above our historical target of approximately 5 times. I\u2019d like to highlight that owing to the improvement and stabilization in our core business, we felt confident enough to repay the entire outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility, which had been $575 million drawn as of the end of the second quarter. When considered alongside, the $0.47 dividend we paid during the third quarter, we believe this should clearly demonstrate the confidence we have in our liquidity position at this time. Second, we refinanced our 5% coupon rate restricted group notes due in 2024 with newly issued 10.5-year unsecured holding company notes with a coupon rate of 3.625%. This coupon rate now represents the lowest fixed rate coupon in our debt structure, a testament to the health of our global system. In addition to lowering the coupon rate and extending the maturity by approximately seven years, the refinancing action increased flexibility since the new notes are not subject to financial maintenance and debt incurrence covenants, which the restricted group notes were subject to. Third, our capital priorities remain unchanged, invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return remainder excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. Commensurate with the performance of the business, the health of our balance sheet and liquidity position and our confidence in returning to 5 times consolidated net leverage by second quarter of 2021, we plan to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about Taco Bell, strength of the brand and the strength of the franchisees you touched on. And just kind of thinking about maintaining the industry-leading momentum in recent years; and maybe if you can comment someone on latest developments, loyalty program, delivery, and kind of the opportunity going forward post-COVID, as we think about menu simplification speed and what that new product pipeline could look like, please? Thank you. David Gibbs : Thanks, Dennis. Look, the Taco Bell brand performance in Q3 is obviously something we\u2019re very proud of. Mark King and his team have done an amazing job of pivoting in this environment to meet the consumers\u2019 new needs. So you touched on a couple of other things that they\u2019ve done \u2013 to do so, but the ability to embrace larger meals \u2013 family meals, they\u2019ve seen a doubling of their party size meals. They\u2019ve obviously rolled out a lot of tech, rolled out a loyalty program to connect better with consumers and giving them access to delivery. They\u2019ve added delivery partners as the quarter went on and they\u2019re now on multiple platforms. And I think Taco Bell always has their finger on the pulse of the consumer. That\u2019s what makes the brand great, the way they connect with consumers. They\u2019ve recognized that this is \u2013 we\u2019re really in an environment where the food is going from something as fuel to being something a little bit more like entertainment. This is an environment where people are now comfortable with how things are going to be for awhile and they\u2019re looking for a little bit more excitement. That\u2019s why you saw the success of something like the Grilled Cheese Burrito that got rolled out and was well received by consumers. So across multiple fronts, the brand is really connecting well with consumers and excited about the progress they made. Obviously, the margin progress they made in the quarter is somewhat related to the limited hours. The menu simplification that you mentioned, Dennis, was also helpful in that regard. So I think they\u2019re getting through this in an admirable way. Keith Siegner : Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you so much. The question was also on Taco Bell, but I want to pivot it a little bit. Can you talk about your experience with new unit openings internationally? I mean, are you kind of seeing the type of new consumer reception and trust that you see in the U.S. internationally in a post-COVID environment? And guess what, some of your international franchisees are telling you in terms of their willingness to kind of accelerate unit development of this important brand. And where I want to go with that is, do you think Taco Bell \u2013 it is potentially the driver internationally to get you back to 4%-plus unit development, where \u2013 is Yum! in a position where it can start to take advantage of what is obviously a much stronger balance sheet and cash position to maybe consider even adding additional either brands to the portfolio to add to some of that international unit growth? Thank you. Chris Turner : Hey, John, this is Chris. Good question. Look, I think I\u2019ll start a little bit more broadly. As you think about the development journey, we\u2019ve got three of our four brands, where we\u2019ve had positive net new unit growth globally so far this year. Taco bell is one of those. We remain very confident in the long-term potential for development in Taco Bell around the globe. In certain markets, the sales in this situation have been impacted, but there are other markets where the business has done quite strongly through COVID, including all of the things that are supporting us around the globe in terms of shift to off-premise and digital and delivery, those trends have existed in the Taco Bell international stores. And so in the long run, we continue to remain confident in Taco Bell\u2019s international growth as a pillar of our overall unit development engine. Nothing\u2019s changed there in the long run. It\u2019s just the uncertainty on the timing of us getting on that track. David Gibbs : Yes. On Taco Bell development, I mean, just to pick an example, market Australia just opened their 15th units starting from scratch two years ago. That unit in its first day did weekly type sales volumes. The team in Australia, we\u2019ve got two great franchise partners. They couldn\u2019t be more excited. They have big plans for development next year, probably more than doubling the unit count there. So I think your question though is really country specific. Like everything, if we talk about averages on average, we\u2019re pretty excited about development, but there\u2019s going to be pockets and countries where we have franchisees that have \u2013 are more reliant on dine-in for any of our brands, they\u2019re more affected by this obviously. And so we\u2019ll have impact in certain markets and hopefully other markets where we\u2019re on fire with our off-premise business can make up for that. Operator : Our next question is from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Great. Thank you. Good morning. I\u2019ll just squeeze in two quick ones. So just if you have a big comment to be made about what your divestiture of Grubhub, what that stake \u2013 removal of that stake means about your strategy with delivery over the long-term? And maybe you\u2019re thinking about the future of third-party delivery in general. And then also on Pizza Hut, what would you say to people about this brand longer-term? Post-COVID, you\u2019ve put a new brand management there. There\u2019s been some closures. You\u2019ve gotten rid of some margin dilutive value, but what would you say about the restaging of that brand and sort of the concern that it remains in a fragile financial state and the brand is just benefiting right now from COVID. Thanks. Chris Turner : Thanks. I\u2019ll take your first question and turn it over to David for your second question. Yes, during the quarter we did sell our position in the Grubhub shares, all 2.8 million shares for a total of $206 million. That doesn\u2019t reflect anything about our view on the delivery space in general. As David mentioned, we\u2019ve expanded our relationships with aggregators. Our overall thesis is we want to be where our consumers want to do business with our brands. And if that\u2019s through a delivery channel with an aggregator, we want to be there. And with the relationships we continue to bring online in the U.S. and around the globe, we\u2019re off to solid starts on those. It\u2019s also a story of leveraging our scale. When we bring our restaurants under those platforms, the economics improve for the aggregator, and we\u2019re able to get advantage economics for our franchisees and for Yum! when we do it. So we think it\u2019s a way to drive profitable growth for the system. David Gibbs : Yes. On the other point on Grubhub, obviously, that our ability and our scale, our ability to get a board seat participate and understand what\u2019s going on in the aggregator space was helpful to us with that investment. And we made a little money on the investment on the side. So I think that worked out the way we essentially had hoped. Turning to your question on Pizza Hut, obviously, this is an environment right now as we \u2013 as us and a lot of people have talked about where existing trends in the restaurant industry have just been accelerated. It\u2019s not as so much about new trends being introduced. It\u2019s just existing trends being accelerated like off-premise, like delivery, like ordering through tech. Pizza Hut is perfectly positioned for a lot of those trends. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing such a strong performance from the Pizza Hut brand right now in the off-premise category. Our delivery carry out sales in the U.S., if you just isolate those sales, are up 21% mid-teens globally. So we do think the brand is well positioned for the future based on these accelerating trends. Franchisees are obviously benefiting from that in terms of their financial condition. And the opportunity to execute the strategy that we\u2019ve talked about for now for a couple of years about wanting to get out of certain dine-in assets that aren\u2019t brand building assets that are essentially holding us back. We\u2019ve accelerated the transition out of those assets as you\u2019re seeing in the numbers. So, certainly it\u2019s a brand with a bright future in our portfolio, but still has a lot of work to do to pivot the asset base, the asset base that makes sense for today\u2019s consumer. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. I want to follow-up on the unit growth. When you\u2019re talking about unit growth, I noticed a couple of times in your prepared remarks that not only do you think you can get back to 2019\u2019s pace of unit growth, which was over 4% and kind of hit on all cylinders, but you\u2019ve said you could potentially do better than that. I\u2019m just wondering, what\u2019s driving that commentary. Are you starting to see specific incremental growth opportunities open up because of what\u2019s happened through the pandemic or any other color you can put on that comment would be helpful. Thanks. David Gibbs : Great. Good question. Look, if we think about the overall development picture, as we\u2019ve said before, we remained very bullish on the long-term opportunity for Yum! And we think it\u2019s, as we said, a matter of when, not if, we get back to that long-term unit growth algorithm. The macros are promising. Our brand stand tall in this type of environment, they stand for value which pivoted to off-premise. So that\u2019ll drive the top line for the stores. Our teams are developing prototypes that are fit for this with lower footprint sizes that have great digital capabilities and enhance even further our off-premise capabilities. And in certain markets, there likely will be some real estate tailwinds from a real estate cost standpoint. And our franchisees have been growth minded, historically, and they\u2019ve shown their resilience through this situation and we\u2019ve got great development teams. And even if you just think about what\u2019s happening this year in the pandemic, there are some very positive signs. As I mentioned earlier, three of the four brands have grown their units this year. And if you think about KFC and Taco Bell alone, we\u2019ve had 540 net new units this year, which is three, three quarters, 1.5 of net new unit growth. Even at Pizza Hut, we\u2019re working through the asset transformation that David mentioned, we\u2019ve had 340 gross opening so far this year. So it indicates that our development teams and our franchisees are working hard there. So all of that I think is what gives us the long-term confidence. I\u2019d love to say that we\u2019ll get there as soon as we can. And our teams are going to be striving to do even more as you described, but we\u2019re confident in the long run. We still have uncertainty about the timing of it. And that\u2019s why we just can\u2019t commit to the exact timing of when we get back to that algorithm. You\u2019ve seen the news from Western Europe over the last couple of days. That\u2019s an example of the types of things that are driving the uncertainty on exactly how this will play out. And that\u2019s why we just can\u2019t provide specific guidance on the timing or the exact number. Operator : Our next question is from John Glass for Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. John Glass : Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. One is on Pizza Hut. Can you just help us understand what the system sales impact would be for the closures? Either the year-to-date, the 5% closures or decline in 5%, what was the system sales? I assume these are lowered volume units. And if you think about the portfolio over time, is there a way to think about the system sales impact versus just a unit closure, so we can try to understand the financial impact? And then Chris, can you also just on the bad debt recoveries, where are you now? So is this an expected fourth quarter benefit again? And what\u2019s kind of the order of magnitude that\u2019s still outstanding recoveries versus a normalized level to get back to sort of what you\u2019re fully up to normalized levels of collections? David Gibbs : Great. Couple of good questions there. Look, I\u2019ll give you a couple of facts that help on the Pizza Hut side just as we think about the closures that we\u2019re seeing. First, there, more than 50% of the closures are our dine-in units and our express units, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re driving the asset transformation. That\u2019s why you saw the two-point reduction in the dine-in percentage of the estate both in the U.S. and internationally. And as you might expect, those stores that were closing are underperforming stores. So on average, in the U.S. as an example, the average unit volume of the closed stores is about two-thirds that of the overall system average. And that\u2019s true, whether you\u2019re talking about the regular stores that are closing, the dine-in stores that are closing, or the express units, they\u2019re both on the underperforming side. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a feel for the nature of how we\u2019re cleaning up underperforming assets and driving this asset transformation in Pizza Hut. On the bad debt side, yes, you saw this quarter the recoveries were dramatic. We think that is a great signal about the long-term health of the franchisee base and the resiliency of the franchisee base and the way that we\u2019ve worked with them through the pandemic. In the quarter, relative to last year, it was about a $30 million swing, $17 million in KFC and about $13 million in Pizza Hut, mostly in Pizza Hut U.S. Look, in the long run, we hope to get back to more normal levels of bad debt expense, but I think we\u2019ve got to remain vigilant in the near-term just given the uncertainties around COVID. But we\u2019re certainly pleased with what happened in the quarter and think overall it\u2019s a great sign of the resiliency of our franchisee base and business model. Operator : Our next question is from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. A quick follow-up on that question, please. The follow-up was, if you could just talk a bit about Taco Bell\u2019s business mix before the current crisis. I knew breakfast has historically been about 6% of sales, but what would late night or fourth meal look like? I\u2019m trying to figure out what the sort of headwinds might be from those day parts which has lagged. So that\u2019s just a quick housekeeping. And then could you talk about sort of acquisitions and portfolio, I mean, given [Technical Difficulty] would you consider a larger acquisition [Technical Difficulty] may not be top of the list of things you\u2019re focused on. But I would say after a circle of mixed track record in the past of acquisitions for Yum!, there seems to be \u2013 at this point relatively unambiguous in its success. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, Sara. And part of your question broke up at least for us here, but I think I got it. On the Taco Bell mix and the impact from the impact to ours, our breakfast business, as you said, typically mix is around 6%. I think that mix is down to four now as a number of people have stopped serving breakfast, although it\u2019s still in more than half of our stores. And we obviously we are committed to breakfast long-term and expect to be back into that with all stores as time goes on. I do \u2013 as far as the impact to the business, it\u2019s a point or two of same-store sales impact depending on how you want to cut it. So it\u2019s nothing that we can\u2019t overcome, obviously, as we pivot to other means of serving customers. And then the question on acquisitions, I think we mentioned it in the speeches, I\u2019ll repeat it. We\u2019re really pleased with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019d be the QuikOrder acquisition that we did on the technology side a couple of years ago. We recently bought Heartstyles, Collider, a consumer insights company. Now these are smaller acquisitions, but more recently obviously the Habit Burger Grill. It\u2019s worth really taking a look at what they have done in this environment. They went from over 50% of their sales coming from dine-in and another good portion of their sales coming from carry out in the restaurant to pivoting almost everything coming outside the restaurant and recovering to nearly flat. I think they\u2019re basically flat in the stores that are open. So I think that\u2019s an incredibly positive data point for a brand that we believe is on the rise. We have lots of interests in the franchise community from it. But we\u2019re in no rush to do another acquisition. We want to digest Habit, get that established, get the right partners around the world and get the growth going there. And if we continue to see the kinds of results that we think we\u2019re going to see and that we have seen from them that would be obviously a positive data point as we think about other similar type acquisitions down the road. Operator : Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. My question is on G&A. I just want to make sure I understand your comments there. What is your long-term G&A outlook? Is it still a target of 1.7% of system sales? And I guess the nature of my question is I think you talked about achieving some efficiencies in the current environment about reinvesting. Just want to try to reconcile that on your long-term target. David Gibbs : Yes. So David on G&A, we\u2019ve removed guidance right now, but in general, the way we think about G&A is coming out of the transformation we were right-sized. We did a lot of work in the transformation to right-size the expense base. And so we were already fairly lean and of course our mindset is one that\u2019s driven by lean. We\u2019re going to invest in things that make sense and drive value for the customer and for the business. But we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re reducing expense otherwise and managing those expenses carefully on things that aren\u2019t driving value. And right now I think the main thing we\u2019re doing on G&A is continuing to reallocate spend to things that will drive long-term growth. So we\u2019re continuing to invest ahead in digital and technology, invest in our Recipe for Good. And so that\u2019s our focus. At the same time, in order to create room for that investment, we are doing the things you\u2019d expect us to be doing in terms of optimizing the way that we work, taking advantage of the cost reduction opportunities that COVID puts on the table. And so we\u2019re trying to manage it very smartly. Obviously in the long run, some of those day-to-day expenses will start to come back, but we\u2019ll continue to manage this in a lean way. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chris Turner for closing remarks. Chris Turner : Great. I\u2019ll actually let David give the closing remarks here. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks for everybody\u2019s time today. Obviously, we\u2019re excited and proud of the results that we put up in Q3, showing strong sequential improvement on the recovery from Q2, driven by the things that we wanted to see. Our ability to adapt and pivot to off-premise, embrace digital, the billion dollars of extra digital sales in the quarter, just like we did in Q2 is incredibly encouraging. But yet, we know it\u2019s a fluid environment, and that as we\u2019re seeing in Europe, it\u2019s just not an environment where we can predict and guide for 2021. We do have confidence in our team based on how they recovered so far, and that whatever thrown our way, we\u2019ll be able to pivot to it. As we\u2019ve gone into Q4, the trends from Q3 have continued, but we know that it\u2019s an uncertain environment and that we\u2019ll be faced with more challenges and excited about the way the business can pivot, meet those challenges and continue to thrive. So thank you for your time today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We entered 2021 a stronger company; primed to grow, made better and more resilient by the challenges of 2020. I'm incredibly proud of our people and the way our global system came together to navigate these challenges and offer new ways to safely and affordably serve customers. We galvanized our global systems commitment to our Growth and Good strategy, underpinned by a culture of collaboration across our brands, people and franchisees that we believe is unmatched and has put us on solid footing to move forward. In fact, to ensure this momentum on collaboration and execution continues, we recently elevated our Chief Transformation and People Officer, Tracy Skeans to Yum! Chief Operating Officer. This promotion formalizes the role she has already been playing to drive cross-brand collaboration on people capability and customer experience imperatives that fuel same-store sales and net new unit growth. This underlying alignment of vision and action is an often under appreciated competitive advantage for us and it's fundamentally central to our current and future growth. Across Yum!, we intensified our focus on leveraging our scale. As you're well aware, having more restaurants than any other company enhances our opportunity to create sustainable competitive advantages to fuel growth for our franchisees. This includes accelerating our deployment of digital and technology initiatives to enhance the customer experience, off-premise capabilities and unit economics across the globe. We now have over 35,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, in part driven by expanded aggregator partnerships. We ended 2020 on a digital sales high note, hitting a record of $17 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. As I enter my second year leading Yum!, I'm more confident than ever that our customer-focused digitally enabled brands will grow same-store sales, unit economics will support profitable development and Yum! is well positioned to maximize value creation for years to come. Our Recipe for Growth, using our four key growth drivers, continues to guide our long-term strategy. So I'll start with an overall review of 2020 results and use a few examples to demonstrate our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short, unmatched operating capability and unrivaled culture and talent growth drivers. Then Chris will share more details of our Q4 results, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. First, 2020 results. Overall, Yum! system sales declined 4%, including a 1% headwind of the lap of the 53rd week in 2019 with slightly positive net units year-over-year and a 6% same-store sales decline. COVID continued to impact the business through the end of the year, both in terms of temporary closures of restaurants and limitations on the use of dining rooms, upon which some of our markets heavily rely. This adversely impacted our core operating profit, which declined 8%, including a 1% headwind from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019. Now I'd like to provide some details regarding COVID-related temporary closures and the progress that we've seen. As of the end of the third quarter, we had about 1,100 temporarily closed units. This improved to about 1,000 as of the third quarter earnings conference call we hosted on October 29. We continued to see re-openings through the balance of the fourth quarter, but due to second wave COVID impacts, including increased government restrictions, temporary closures climbed back to about 1,000 in January, which is where we remain today. This means roughly 98% of our system is currently open in a full or limited capacity. Not surprisingly, the geographies experiencing temporary closures have evolved and we are now seeing more closures in Europe, Canada and the Middle East, offset by some re-openings in Latin America and India. By asset format, restaurants located in malls, transportation centers, airports and the like continue to be pressured, making up many of the temporary closures. All-in, the situation remains dynamic and largely dependent on local government responses to COVID. We've also continued to have a significant number of our open restaurants subject to dining room closures or other limitations on access. Pre-COVID-19, about one-third of our system sales came from the dining room. Despite the drag from these limitations, our off-premise channels, aided by digital, offset most of those lost sales and enabled our open store base to deliver same-store sales that were about flat for the fourth quarter in aggregate. Now let's talk about our four RED brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which now accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales declined 1% driven by a two percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019 and the 2% same-store sales decline, partially offset by 4% net new unit growth. KFC continues to reopen temporarily closed stores, though different geographies suffered from the second wave impacts of COVID and ended Q4 with about 98% open in a full or limited capacity. At KFC International, same-store sales declined 4% during the quarter, an improvement from Q3. The UK, SOPAC and Canada continued to show strong customer residents and operational execution, leveraging drive-thru and other off-premise channels to grow sales. Importantly, the most impacted geographies from Q3, such as India, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East, started to show recovery. Across the globe, KFC continues to invest in innovation by filling gaps on their core menus or through rebundling, repackaging and reconceptualizing the core menu items. KFC U.S. continued to see positive same-store sales growth, delivering 8% growth in Q4, owing to continued strength in group occasions and digital. To kick-off our launch with DoorDash, we had a free tenders promotion, which performed particularly well and helped digital grow to a high-single-digit sales mix for the quarter. Moving on to Pizza Hut, which now accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported a Q4 system sales decline of 6%, driven by a three percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week in 2019 and 6% net new unit decline and a 1% same-store sales decline. During the quarter, Pizza Hut continued to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with about 98%, at least partially open in a full or limited capacity. Express units continue to be pressured, making up many of the remaining closures. Pizza Hut International same-store sales declined 7%. Our off-premise focused markets continue to excel, while our dine-in footprint continue to be a headwind. Our off-premise channel generated a positive 9% same-store sales growth. And we are continuing to emphasize and support the shift to off-premise, both through our operations and brand strategies. Further, markets that offered abundant value to customers helped drive strong performance in markets such as Canada and Asia. Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 18% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel with 8% overall same-store sales growth. Our $10 Tastemaker value offer continued to perform well, mixing over 20%. Just in time for the holidays, we introduced our Triple Treat Box, a premium product with abundant value. We also partnered with Beyond to be the first major pizza chain to successfully introduce a plant-based alternative product to the market. A few weeks ago, Flynn Restaurant Group announced its intention to acquire NPC's approximately 950 Pizza Hut U.S. restaurants. Flynn is an existing Yum! Brands franchisee for Taco Bell that is well capitalized and brings a strong track record of operational excellence. We expect Flynn's ownership of these restaurants will make the entire Pizza Hut U.S. system stronger, and welcome Greg Flynn and his team to the Pizza Hut family. The near-term plans include modernization of a significant portion of the restaurants acquired, while improving operations. As for Taco Bell, which now accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales declined 3%, driven by a five percentage point negative impact from the lap of the 53rd week. This was partially offset by 1% same-store sales growth and 1% net new unit growth. Taco Bell continues to reopen temporarily closed stores and ended Q4 with less than 50 temporary closures. Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking number one in the Franchise 500, beating out peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. In the words of Entrepreneur Magazine, which produces this list, Taco Bell was recognized for a well seasoned blend of innovative products and value prices, customers who are willing to follow the brand on wild marketing adventures and some of the most satisfied franchisees in the business. During the quarter, Taco Bell U.S. stayed focused on simultaneously building the brand over time and building sales overnight. First, we improved ease by expanding to additional aggregator marketplaces. Bolstered by dedicated media, these marketplaces helped delivery grow to a high single-digit sales mix for the quarter. Second, we launched a loyalty program with promotions geared toward customer acquisition and adoption. All in digital sales mix reached 12% for the quarter and about $1 billion for the full year 2020. We are very pleased with this progress on such essential components of building the brand over time. Third, we offered compelling and craveable product to drive sales overnight. The quarter began with the return of the fan-favorite, the $5 Grande Stacker Box, which had a strong performance mixing at 9%. Next we brought back the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa and saw a sales mix of 10%. We then rounded out the year with the grilled cheese burrito and Nacho's Party Pack, both having a positive sales impact. Now on to The Habit. Despite ending Q4 with 7% of Habit restaurants temporarily closed as well as COVID-related on-premise restrictions in California, same-store sales declined only 5%, a slight step back from the pace in late Q3. I'm pleased to say that we were able to fill much of this void through our digital ordering platform, which continued to perform well, constituting over 40% sales mix. Two permanent new menu items were added during the quarter to keep customer engagement high, including the Habits own amazing crispy chicken sandwich, as well as chicken bites. Now onto our unmatched operating capability. First at KFC U.S. with most of the sales occurring in the drive-through, our teams have successfully adapted to better support the drive-through lanes, as a result of transaction times during the quarter improves 16 seconds from Q4 2019. At Pizza Hut International, we're modernizing the team member experience through the launch of Phase 1 of our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot to improve shift level store performance. After launching HutBot and other process improvements in the UK, delivery times improved over six minutes and drove a 20 point improvement in customer satisfaction scores. There is lots of franchise excitement around HutBot and nine other markets have already rolled out this store management and coaching aid. Similar to KFC Taco Bell U.S. saw a record breaking drive-through performance and with consumer demand in our drive through at an all time high achieved its goal of completing a full year with transaction times below four minutes with the fastest quarterly average achieved in Q4. Next, our newest brand, the Habit Burger Grill aggressively rolled out off-premise solutions this year, such as pop-up drive-throughs and curbside pickup. Curbside in particular has continued to be well received by customers accounting for over 10% of total sales and about 50% of mobile orders. Now to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver, with the restaurant team member in mind, we held our first ever virtual global ops summit. What stood out the most to me was how the summit integrated key talent from our digital and technology teams directly into the unmatched ops agenda more than ever before, our young digital and technology team is not solely focused on the customer experience, but the team member experience as well through focus on building systems at scale, harmonizing platforms and leveraging an agile mindset. The goal is to unlock our pace of innovation and adoption for front and back of house platforms, which will be launched in a major market first, iterated until mature and then scaled globally. There was a lot of excitement across the globe for our newly developed technology solutions, and Chris will provide a few examples of specific platforms launching in the U.S. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David; and good morning, everyone. Today I'll discuss our fourth quarter results, our progress on our digital and tech journey, our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let's discuss Q4. Overall Yum! system sales declined 2%, including a 3% headwind of lapping the 53 week in 2019. This was driven by slightly positive net units year-over-year, partly offset by a 1% same-store sales decline. Core operating profit declined 9% in the quarter, or declined a 5% when excluding the lap of the 53 week in 2019. EPS excluding special items was $1.15. This represented a 15% increase compared to ex-special EPS of $1 in Q4 2019. I'll now provide some additional color on several items. General and administrative expenses, excluding the impact of special items were $306 million for the fourth quarter 2020, roughly consistent with the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year of 2020 G&A, excluding the impact of special items represented 1.9% of consolidated system sales. We saw an opportunity to enhance our systems competitive advantage by accelerating digital and technology spending during a period when many others could not. We all set this through proactive austerity measures. However, because of 2020 sales pressures, we were temporarily above our historical framework for G&A spend as a percentage of systems sales. 2020 was not representative of a fundamental change and approach or in our commitment to be an efficient growth model that leverages fixed costs. Our business model is positioned for rapid recovery once we emerged from the pandemic and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. In the fourth quarter interest expense was approximately $132 million flat compared to Q4 2019, driven by higher outstanding borrowings offset by a decrease in rate on our floating rate debt. Our fourth quarter and 2020 ex-special effective tax rates were lower than the prior year, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance against net operating losses, we now expect to utilize in a foreign jurisdiction. We are currently evaluating potential changes in taxes under the new administration in the U.S., though it's too early to provide an assessment. At this time, we believe the 21% to 23% range we provided last year remains appropriate for an effective tax rate for 2021, excluding any potential impact of special items. Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds of $19 million were $141 million for the full year 2020, including $16 million at the Habit, while our 2021 capital spending plans remain fluid, given the macro-environment, I'd like to discuss our general approach. We believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx, appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business, as well as occasional opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We also anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. For 2021, we may be slightly higher than the gross CapEx amount I just mentioned. This upside relates to catch-up spend on repair, maintenance and remodeled delayed owing to COVID, as well as select strategic development in the U.S., primarily for the Habit, for which re-franchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. As you're all aware, the global macro-environment remains quite fluid owing to the impact of COVID-19, governmental actions including stimulus packages and more. We have the utmost confidence in our teams and their ability to pivot to whatever challenges and opportunities arise. However, the environment is still unpredictable and therefore we will not guide to specific financial results. Before moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, I wanted to share some of the work we've been doing around restaurant technology to transform the customer and team member experience. As David mentioned, we are launching our new solutions in major markets before we scale globally. First KFC U.S. began the national rollout of our new e-commerce platform in early 2021. This will allow KFC to take orders from our own digital platform for both pickup and third-party delivery. Second Pizza Hut U.S. launched our omnichannel menu management system, where there is one source for menu customization and pricing that can be sinked across multiple digital channels. This is particularly important as we grow our delivery capability across multiple aggregator the partners. And lastly Taco Bell U.S. is the first to test a new advanced point of sale system, a modern tablet based application that is completely customizable. This technology should increase accuracy, speed and reliability as well as allow for a more intuitive team member experience optimized for each brands specific needs. Now, moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, during the fourth quarter, we opened 1,024 restaurants and closed 797, including 540 closures at Pizza Hut, which placed our year end unit count slightly ahead of the estimate I shared on our third quarter conference call. For the full year 2020, we delivered slightly positive unit growth, this includes the addition of 276 Habit restaurants in Q1 of this year offset by COVID related dislocations and Pizza Hut closures. I am pleased to say that despite COVID headwinds, three of our four brands achieved positive net unit growth for the year, an encouraging sign for the future. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% net unit growth with strength in China, Russia and Central and Eastern Europe and Thailand. Importantly, 10 out of 13 KFC markets were net unit positive in 2020 ending the year with 25,000 restaurants, an incredibly impressive milestone. This momentum gives us confidence that there is capital available when we provide strong economic models. In regards to Pizza Hut, units declined 6% for the year, as we continue the previously announced transition of the asset base to a healthier and more modernist date. Closures that occurred this year were largely underperforming units or units with lower AUVs. COVID has hastened the transition and the closure of casual dining based restaurants. We have more work to do and we expect this to weigh on unit growth into this year. As it relates to franchisee health and appetite for development, as David alluded to earlier, we are entering 2021 from a position of strength. Unit economics are improving in many markets and many franchisees are prime to grow. During the quarter, we saw recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International, Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell. These recoveries resulted in an $8 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, an improvement of $14 million compared to $6 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. Importantly, deferred royalties outstanding from grace periods provided during the year were less than $1 million as of the end of 2020, down from $60 million as of June 30, 2020, and our allowance for doubtful accounts is below where it was in Q4 2019 before the pandemic. Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q4 with cash and cash equivalents of $730 million, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 5.2 times, which is marginally above our historical target of approximately 5 times. Second, we resumed share repurchases and repurchased 2.4 million shares totaling $250 million at an average price per share of $103. Third, our capital priorities remain unchanged, invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. To that end, we are pleased to have recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by over 6% to $0.50 per share. After maintaining our dividend in 2020, despite the impact of COVID-19, we believe this increase conveys our confidence in the cash flow generation and growth potential of Yum!\u2019s business model. With iconic category-leading brands and a uniquely diversified global business of over 50,000 restaurants, Yum! is well positioned to accelerate growth and drive healthy franchise unit economics by leveraging our massive scale and by expanding digital technology and delivery. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2021. Now, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : We would now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. My question is about the unit growth, and I appreciate the comments that the many franchisees are kind of primed for growth. But I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on your previous long-term target to get to a 4% annual growth and if there is any framework you can share on how long do you think it might take to get to that level given what you know today? David Gibbs : We're having some technical difficulties. One second, please. Keith Siegner : Hold on a second folks. One of the lines dropped. We appreciate your patience. David Gibbs : Can you repeat the question, please. So that, team that didn\u2019t hear, can hear it again, please? David Tarantino : Yes. So my question is about the unit development, and I appreciate your comments about kind of many of the franchisees being primed for unit growth, but I guess the main question is about your prior target of 4% annual growth. And given what you know today, I was asking about how long do you think is reasonable for us to expect for you to get back to that type of growth rate on a system-wide basis? Thank you. David Gibbs : Thanks for the question, David. And apologies to everybody for our phone dropping out. That's a first for us on an earnings call, but I guess \u2013 and everything has happened in the last 12 months, so why not that. As far as unit development, I know that's on everybody's mind. So just a couple of thoughts there. To the question of can we regain that 4% pace and is that in our cross hairs, and our goal certainly to get to 4% and beyond. And the answer is, certainly, yes. There's a lot of reasons why we're confident that we will get there over time. Our business model really has gotten stronger over the last 12 months. The shift to off-premise suits us well and improves our franchisees' economics. And obviously, in our open stores, we're seeing that show up as sales. Most of our franchisees are in good shape. They're coming out of this situation with \u2013 in good financial shape and they're ready to grow. Certainly, it's a more favorable real estate climate. And I will point out that in 2020, we actually opened over 2,400 gross units. So it's not as if the development pace at Yum! just disappeared. The challenge obviously with a lot of the closures, which we had for good reasons, things we've talked about over the years, wanting to close, particularly, Pizza Hut restaurants to strengthen our asset base. So we've got a lot of that behind us in 2020. And then, certainly, three out of our four brands grew last year and we got 3% growth in the global business when you exclude the Pizza Hut business. So all of those good proof points for why we can get back to 4%. As far as the timing though, I know the question is when and there is still some uncertainty on that, which is why we're not providing guidance on that number. We certainly can't be certain of the pandemic course. Since our last call, we've obviously seen flare-ups that have impacted our business. Yum! China talked about that as well last night. It's a challenging environment just to build stores. And there are markets that we want to get stores open and we're having trouble getting permits and getting the right people to construct the stores. And certainly, as we've changed our asset models, that has got our franchisees looking at making changes to the kinds of sites they pursue in some cases, the type of stores they build on those locations. All of that leads to some delays. And then, certainly, we all know in the development game in retail, it takes time to build the pipeline. And the fact that our pipeline was disrupted last year, we have to rebuild it. So confident that we can get back to 4% and beyond. Still not at a point where we're going to commit to a certain timeframe on that. But the mood is definitely one of confidence. Keith Siegner : Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. Good morning. Can I just ask about digital, you've talked a lot about the success you've had in the digital penetration. Underneath of that, can you just talk about at the enterprise level what you're doing to support franchisees? Specifically, I guess, I mean, is there a common platform by brand, for example, now globally that allows all franchisees to access that and integrating mobile pay, integrating delivery, integrating loyalty or is even bigger than that, like across the enterprise you've got one? Just maybe just an understanding where you are and where are your investments in digital specifically are going to be in 2021? Thanks. Chris Turner : Thanks, John. This is Chris. Really good question. Digital has been such an important part of our resilience during the pandemic. We're proud to say that we had the $17 billion in digital sales for the year. A very significant increase over the previous year. And we're just very pleased with how digital is supporting the business. And we are, as we said, investing ahead in digital. We're finding other places to manage cost to help us to continue to fund those investments. And to your point, what we really care about in the long-term is that we earn a return on those investments. And so that gets at how we're thinking about the digital strategy. We want to continue to have the consumer-facing and team member-facing technologies be curated by the brands and be right for each individual market. The needs of a customer and the expectations for e-commerce in one market may be very different from another. So those front ends are tailored. But to your point, we are building common platforms underneath that. We don't need to replicate those common platforms multiple times. And so we gave a couple of examples earlier around how we're doing that. We mentioned that in KFC U.S. we've now introduced an internally built e-commerce platform. We will test that in a major market like KFC U.S. and then we will take it to other brands and other markets over time. Similarly, the POS example that we used on Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the first place where we'll implement that. And then we will customize and tailor that as a platform for other markets, both of those allow the front ends to be customized. So it's a blend of customer focus and platform underneath. Operator : The next question will come from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you very much. There's obviously a lot of discussion both in the U.S. and Europe, but I think specifically on the U.S. of kind of this major wave of restaurant consumption that will happen post-vaccine. And I wonder just kind of what your thoughts were on that? I mean, if you are prepared for significant shifts back to dine-in and obviously you have a lot of off-premise assets. I mean, if there are any examples around the world and maybe even cities within countries that are more or less kind of post-pandemic that you have a significant amount of stores that maybe you could talk about some experience of sales and the brands where you have some scale? Thanks for that color. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, John. Look, obviously, the environment has changed over the last 12 months that we're operating in and we're pleased at how the business has pivoted to off-premise, but that doesn't at all mean we're giving up on dine-in, and we know that dine-in can play a role in our business as we go forward. I think Yum! China talked about it yesterday on their call that they've seen sequential improvement in their dine-in business. And while it hasn't gotten back to where it was, they've done some innovation around technology to help in dine-in and have been able to regain some of it. So we have 300 different combinations of brands in countries. Every one of them is a different story. As we've gone through this, what you're seeing is the markets that have a more that were built for off-premise are the ones that are doing better. And the ones that had more of a dine-in skew are developing better off-premise solutions and improving their situation. But we are preparing for people reengaging with dine-in and we have the assets that can serve it and we still think it will be part of the business, but lesser going forward than it has been. Operator : The next question will come from Greg Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Greg Francfort : Hey, thanks for the question. My question is more of a high level one. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 it seems like a lot of the big franchise stores are making a decision right now on what portions of the tech stack to bring in-house and what portion to kind of buy from third-parties. Can you talk just a little bit about how you're thinking about that dynamic and what's going to be a proprietary advantage to Yum! on the technology front going forward? Thanks. Chris Turner : Yes. So good question, and it's one that we think about on each element of the tech stack. And in general, we focus on ones where we think that element could provide a competitive advantage. The ones that we want to build and have control of internally. Others that are more of a support or enabler role are ones that we would work with third-party vendors through hopefully advantage commercial relationships where we bring our scale to bear. So it's always a blend, and we're always constantly reevaluating each of those aspects. But I gave a couple of examples a moment ago of ones where we've clearly said we need to have a differentiated proprietary platform on e-commerce and POS as a couple of examples that are so strategically important to the business. Operator : The next question will come from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Good morning. Thanks. Hope you're doing well, and congratulations to Tracy. Just wondering if you could talk more about the brands in the U.S. broadly. I guess, specifically given the momentum that you saw through 2020 and really to end 2020 given some new menu items this year across brands, already this year and I guess a good pipeline for the remainder of the year thinking about stimulus benefits, etc. Just curious if you kind of care to highlight any of the momentum that may have been continued into this new year? And just how you're thinking about the brands as the broader industry opens as we go throughout the year? Thank you. David Gibbs : Yes. Obviously, the U.S. was the bright spot for us in Q4 and during the course of the year, collectively positive in both despite all of the impact from closures on same-store sales growth. So I think in each case, we're really excited about where the brands are. Pizza Hut's the one that we've talked about a lot because of the remaking their asset base, moving to more off-premise, the progress they've made on digital. One of the things that we mentioned in our comments, but bears repeating is, 20% of the Pizza Hut stores were in the hands of a poorly capitalized operator previously. Now with Greg Flynn entering the system, a proven commodity in the Taco Bell world, we know that that's going to provide a boost to Pizza Hut. So there's lots of reasons to be enthusiastic about Pizza Hut with their off-premise SKU and the move they've made. The numbers are pretty staggering when you exclude the Express units. It's a 21% increase in Pizza Hut's off-premise consumption for the quarter in the U.S., so lots of excitement there. Taco Bell, again, getting through this with less of a family meal SKU, they had to pivot more and embrace the new needs of the consumer, and I think they've done an amazing job of that. They just put up a decent quarter, and on top of that, spent a lot of time in the quarter building up their loyalty base through programs to acquire new loyalty customers. So we think that bodes really well for the future as they \u2013 as we \u2013 in our language, we talk about, they've really focused on building the brand over time and entering 2021 with a lot of reasons to be excited about the loyalty program, some of the product launches that we've had, you've heard the news about bringing back potatoes, but there's a lot more to come in the world of Taco Bell. And then KFC, one of the exciting things about KFC in this environment is obviously it's built for this environment. Off-premise has been good to them. We've seen a massive increase in their bucket sales in the quarter. And as we go into the year, we've talked about their new Chicken Sandwich coming and the rollout of that's in 20% of the stores now. But we'll \u2013 we're pleased with how that increases our mix of sandwiches and how that will play out as we get it in all of our stores. So across every brand, there is a reason to be excited about the future. But there is also very uncertain environment in the U.S., as we all know. And we are remaining cautious as we move forward. Chris, a couple of things to add? Chris Turner : Yes. I'll just add a little bit of color on sales trends to start the year. We've been pleased with how the brands have started the year given all of the elements that David mentioned. But I will try to provide a little more context for trends that we've seen. So first, if we take the U.S. specifically, in the first few weeks of the quarter, across all four brands, our same-store sales growth in aggregate was in the mid-teens. Of course, that strength was partly bolstered by the U.S. stimulus, which appears to be waning. Internationally, the sales trends have been softer. We've seen a slight deceleration from Q4 trends owing to the impact of regional COVID resurgences, plus the temporary closures due to COVID and local restrictions, plus some restrictions on operating hours in some of the restaurants. If you step back and you think about this quarter in total, there is a fair bit of uncertainty that makes it a bit unpredictable. We've got many different labs. The Lunar New Year moving, plus all of the COVID impacts in various markets around the globe but hopefully, that gives you a little more context for how the quarter has started. David Gibbs : And one last comment on the U.S., The Habit Burger Grill. I know it's of such a scale that it can have a meaningful impact on our numbers in the short-term, but we are excited about the long-term potential of the brand. The way it's gotten through this environment, pivoted to off-premise, the technology that they've deployed, the quality of their operations. There is a lot of reasons why you would be excited going forward with Habit. We've seen a lot of interest from the franchise community in becoming Habit franchisees. We're going slow in that regard to make sure we do it exactly right. But that's a brand that I think is also poised for a lot of exciting things in 2021. Operator : The next question will come from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great, thanks. Just kind of a few in one hopefully. I think the gross CapEx number moved up a bit higher than in the past or at least what you're talking about the past, roughly say, $25 million or so. Is this step up mostly attributed to tech spend? And then on the internally built e-commerce platform in the U.S. and some of the other solutions you're coming up with over time that are internally built. Are these solutions going to allow for a pay back to the franchisor by the franchisees? And then just lastly, in terms of thinking about the tech initiatives, where does modernization of the global drive-thru experience? I'm thinking digital menu boards fall in the priority stack. Thank you. David Gibbs : Great. So I've got three questions, and I'll tick through those. So first on gross CapEx, yes, prior to the pandemic, we had gross CapEx around $225 million in a normal year. And so, yes, but the $250 million, there is a tick up there. It's really driven by two factors. One, we've now got The Habit as a part of the business and we still have a large equity store base there. And so we will be investing in development in The Habit. And second, smaller pieces driven by the digital investments. And of course, as we mentioned, we want to have at least $50 million in refranchising proceeds, north of that. We obviously have more stores in the portfolio now with the acquisition of Habit. So hopefully that explains that slight tick up in the gross number. Second, in terms of payback on technology investments. Yes, our focus is earning a return on those investments over time. However, the primary way in which we earn those returns is by those investments leading to higher sales growth and higher strengths in the business, which also aids net new unit growth. And that supports our franchisees, it supports us. That's the primary way in which we earn a return on those investments. And then your third question around drive-thru, obviously, off-premise has been such an important shift as we've gone through the pandemic. And yes, we continue to invest in the right drive-thru technology and experience in each of our markets. In some cases that does include digital menu boards. In other markets, we might say that's not the needed investment. But in virtually all cases, we want it to be an easy fast experience for our customers. And we continue to focus in each brand on making sure that experience is terrific and enabling it through the right technologies for the particular market. Keith Siegner : We have time for one more question, please. Operator : The next question will come from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Maybe I can squeeze in two here. With regard to Pizza Hut, you mentioned how the franchisee base, the financial health has been improved and you'd shifted certain units into sure hands there. But I'm wondering about the insights of the company from a brand perspective, the pause of COVID in terms of giving you a sales lift, they have also given you an opportunity internally under Kevin Hochman to rebuild the innovation pipeline [Technical Difficulty] that you think might position that brands for long-term growth beyond the second half of 2021? And if that's \u2013 could you just comment on that might be? And then with regard to [Technical Difficulty], clearly, there's going to be less of that on that part of the business in terms of going through COVID. How fast are you thinking you can rebuild that walk-in business overseas? And perhaps versus 2020 levels, how you think you'll get back to par in those markets? David Gibbs : As far as Pizza Hut goes, David, you broke out \u2013 broke up a couple of times. I think I got the gist of your question. On the U.S. business and the brand, we're really pleased with the progress that Kevin under his leadership, but also the team that we brought in from a brand and a marketing standpoint; David Graves and George Felix have done an amazing job of reinvigorating the innovation pipeline and bringing the brand forward to consumers in a way that's really resonating, and that's why you're seeing the great results there. We do think, as you've seen with the launch with the Detroit-style pizza more recently. We do think that there is an important role for innovation to play in that brand. And I think those guys are spot on the way they're bringing it to life. So we're confident in the brand coming to life. As we've always talked about, the challenges are more around the asset base than it is about consumers' loves for the brands or the products that we serve. On the international side, it's obviously a different story. The assets are in better shape, but they skew more toward dine-in. And you're seeing that shift in the asset base to off-premise. Even the dine-in stores themselves are now in many cases offering delivery, coming up with innovative solutions to leverage technology on the dine-in experience. So I think that will continue. And yes, we will be helped at on the international side when we get past the pandemic and people return to the stores. But the base model that we have at Pizza Hut both internationally and domestically of building a delivery carry-out unit is a low-cost asset to build that usually gets very high returns, is attractive to our franchisees. And that base model and the unit economics of it bodes very well for the future of the brand internationally and domestically. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Gibbs for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. David Gibbs : Well, thanks everybody for your time today. Obviously, in summary, 2020 was a challenging year across almost every dimension. But we feel really good about the massive progress we've made in so many ways, progress we wouldn't have made without the challenges of 2020. I'll just end on a high note. If you didn't pick it up in the release, we opened our 25,000th KFC in Q4, ended the year with 25,000 restaurants. If you look back just five years ago at the end of 2015, we had less than 20,000 restaurants. KFC in 2020 opened \u2013 had 4% net new unit growth. Even in the toughest of times, this brand is growing. It's our biggest brand. And that kind of 5,000 unit growth over a five year period bodes well for the future. We've still only scratched the surface of penetrating the world with KFC. Probably most importantly though, 2020 was a year in which our culture and talent was a differentiating factor in getting through it as successfully as we have. And I was so proud of the way our franchisees and our employees took care of our customers and our communities, partnered together to pivot the business and we clearly have emerged stronger, and there is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around the world about the growth ahead of us. Thank you for your time. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. We've had a strong start to 2021 with solid same-store sales results on a 2-year basis and a meaningful uplift in unit development. This performance is a testament to the incredible focus and dedication of our restaurant teams, franchisees and above-store leaders around the world who are rising above the challenges presented by the pandemic to unlock new areas of growth such as digital and off-premise, while putting the needs of our customers and local communities first. I've always believed that our success will come from leaning into our core strengths and building new capabilities that enhance our ability to grow. And the way our business has navigated through COVID-19 has only reinforced this belief. This mindset is reflected in our Recipe for Growth and Good framework, which has successfully guided our strategy and will continue to serve as our north star. Our recipe highlights our unique strength as a company, notably, our iconic brands, our unmatched global scale, our diversified network of highly capable and well-capitalized franchisees and our unparalleled culture and talent. Today, we'll discuss our Q1 performance through the lens of this framework and the growth drivers that underpin it, and we'll highlight the specific areas where we've introduced new capabilities as we look toward the future. I'll cover two growth drivers, namely, relevant, easy and distinctive brands, or RED, for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then Chris will share more details of our Q1 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. I'll start with a few first quarter highlights. In Q1, Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and the addition of 435 net new units during the quarter. Importantly, same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of nearly 900 or about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. This was driven by strong sales performance in North America, the UK, Australia and Japan, with some offset from COVID-related trading restrictions in parts of Asia and Europe. Notably, all four of our brands had a weekly per restaurant sales record in the U.S. at least once during the quarter. And I'm very encouraged that on a 2-year basis our overall same-store sales in the U.S. increased 10%. Importantly, each of our brands experienced positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis in open and operating stores during Q1. This is a great indicator for the strength and breadth of our recovery. The key focus point for our teams was the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe, all geared towards providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Delivery has been a significant part of this strategy, and we now have over 39,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, driven by expanded aggregator partnerships and continued investment in our own branded channels. We had another record digital system sales quarter with over $5 billion, about a 45% increase over the prior year. Now let's talk about our four brands, starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for approximately 48% of our divisional operating profit. Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales were flat on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Globally, KFC's digital sales mix reached a record of 43% during the quarter, driven by the rapid expansion of delivery, click and collect and the introduction of new channel ordering options. At KFC International, same-store sales grew 7% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 '21. We continue to see strength in the UK, Australia, Canada and Japan during the quarter and saw encouraging results in the Middle East, Mexico and Africa. Each of these markets performed well above their 2019 sales levels, owing to their off-premise capabilities, digital strength and impressive product launches like the Share Box in Japan and the Chicken Nights promotion in Mexico. Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales, with 14% growth in Q1. Importantly, same-store sales grew 11% on a 2-year basis, thanks to all the team's hard work in building additional sales channels and growing the core business while adding hyper-relevant product innovation such as the new Chicken Sandwich. Our sandwich is performing at more than twice the volumes of our prior U.S. sandwich launches. And all initial indications are that it's highly incremental. Customers are loving the product and coming back more frequently for it. In fact, as we've entered Q2, demand for the new sandwich has been so strong that, coupled with general tightening in domestic chicken supply, our main challenge has been keeping up with that demand. Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit. The division reported Q1 system sales growth of 7%, driven by 12% same-store sales growth and a 4% unit decline. Global Q1 same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 8%. Same-store sales declined 7% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 10% same-store sales growth for the quarter. Similar to KFC, our developed markets with high off-premise capabilities, digital strength and newsworthy products continue to perform well. Pizza Hut U.S. had another stellar quarter, delivering 23% same-store sales growth in the off-premise channel, with 16% overall same-store sales growth. Overall same-store sales grew 8% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of 3% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021 and was driven by a combination of compelling value with the $10 Tastemaker offer and category-leading innovation with the launch of the unique Detroit Style Pizza and the reboot of our iconic Stuffed Crust Pizza. As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 36% of our divisional operating profit, Q1 system sales grew 11%, driven by a 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. For the division, Q1 same-store sales grew 10% on a 2-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of Nacho Fries, this time offered in the $5 Nacho Fries Box. We also introduced our first digital-led product launch with the $5 Build Your Own Cravings Box available exclusively on the Taco Bell app or web, which drove a meaningful increase in loyalty memberships during the quarter. And finally, our newest brand, The Habit Burger Grill, delivered 13% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth during the quarter. Q1 same-store sales grew 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores that were temporarily closed as of the end of Q1 2021. We introduced our new Patty Melt, and our sales growth was aided by reduced government restrictions and government stimulus. Encouragingly, digital sales continued to mix above 40%, even as dining rooms reopened, and we saw a steady improvement in the dine-in channel throughout the quarter. On to the Recipe for Growth, starting with RED brands. Having four brands across more than 50,000 restaurants provides us with an enviable platform to understand how consumers are behaving in every corner of the world and to use that understanding to capture future growth in our sales overnight and our brands over time. In some cases, this means strengthening our ability to grow sales at a faster pace and bringing in strong diverse tech talent. It's with this in mind that we were excited to close on two strategic acquisitions during the quarter, being Kvantum, Inc. and Tictuk Technologies. Kvantum is a true innovator in marketing optimization with a proven track record of adding significant value with enabling data-driven decisions to drive return on advertising dollars and sales increases. We have seen material improvements in both marketing spend efficiencies and same-store sales growth in our Pizza UK off-premise and Pizza Hut Taiwan businesses as a result of leveraging their toolkit. And at the end of last year, both Taco Bell U.S. and KFC U.S. engaged Kvantum services on marketing calendar and mix optimization. Tictuk presents an exciting opportunity to expand access by providing frictionless ordering through text, social media and other conversational channels in literally just a few clicks. We've deployed their platform in approximately 900 KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants across 35 countries outside of the U.S. and have been thrilled with the agility and customer obsession of the Tictuk team. In fact, we have several examples of customers completing orders on the Tictuk platform in under 10 seconds, a truly seamless experience. Beyond their proven capabilities, what excites me most about these acquisitions is the high-quality, culturally aligned teams we've brought into our global organization. This is a perfect segue to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver. Given the environment we have been operating in, we have to find new ways to connect with the people across our vast global business. One way we've done this is through virtual market visits where we virtually walk through a restaurant and connect with team members. The leadership team and I attended four virtual market visits during the quarter in Pizza Hut Japan, KFC Asia, Taco Bell U.S. in Times Square and KFC Africa. We each left those meetings energized and proud of how our brands are represented around the world and the incredible people that make it all happen. Here, I also want to highlight two key actions we are taking to bring our Recipe for Growth and Good to life. On the equity and inclusion front in the U.S., we are taking tangible actions to represent the diverse communities where we operate by increasing Black and Latin employees and leaders in our corporate and restaurant management roles. As part of this effort, we're proud to partner with OneTen, a coalition of leading companies coming together to upskill, hire and advance 1 million Black individuals in America over the next 10 years. These actions advance our global Unlocking Opportunity Initiative in the U.S., and we are looking forward to working alongside the community of companies in OneTen as well as our franchisees to advance equity and opportunity. Finally, as part of our broader strategy to address climate change, earlier this week, we announced our pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with a science-based target to reduce emissions by nearly 50% across our supply chain and restaurants by 2030, in partnership with our franchisees, suppliers and producers. This is an incredibly important issue to us, our customers and other stakeholders. And I'm proud of our continued progress in this space. To wrap up, I'm encouraged by the momentum in our business as we execute our Recipe for Growth and Good to set ourselves up for the next chapter of growth. Although COVID continues to impact many geographies and make our overall path to recovery uneven, I believe that, with our iconic brands, world-class talent, inclusive culture and healthy franchise system, we are poised to enter a post-COVID world even stronger. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let's discuss Q1. As David mentioned, overall Yum! system sales grew 11%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 1% unit growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 2%, which includes the negative impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q1 2021. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.07, representing a 67% increase compared to ex special EPS of $0.64 in Q1 2020. Core operating profit grew 33% in the first quarter. This performance is attributable to a stellar same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. I'll now provide some additional color on several items. Starting with Taco Bell, we had another impressive quarter of profitability, where company restaurant margins were 24.1%, representing a 1.7% increase over prior year. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we expect these margins to return closer to historical levels later this year as check averages normalize, dining room patronage increases and we adjust staffing levels at our restaurants as a result. During Q1, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due at KFC International and Pizza Hut U.S. These recoveries resulted in a $6 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $34 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $28 million of expense in Q1 2020, while we ended 2020 with $12 million of full year bad debt expense, we had large quarterly swings last year due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to continue to be impacted as we lap bad debt expense of $13 million in Q2 and bad debt recovery of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we don't expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full year basis. Most importantly, our franchisees are generally on solid financial ground despite the uncertainties caused by COVID. We recently completed the restructuring of our largest Pizza Hut U.S. franchisee NPC. that resulted in Flynn Restaurant Group joining the Pizza Hut family. We believe our franchisees are well positioned to partner with us as we look to accelerate out of COVID. General and administrative expenses were $206 million. We still anticipate the timing of full year 2021 G&A to be back-end-weighted as it has been historically. And we estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be slightly less than $1 billion for the full year 2021. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs and utilizes our unique scale remains unchanged, and we expect our G&A ratio to move back toward our historical target as sustained growth resumes. Interest expense was approximately $131 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q1 2020, driven by write-offs of historical debt issuance costs and other one-time financing costs associated with the Q1 refinancing. Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $25 million for the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business, with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up spend on repair, maintenance and remodels delayed owing to COVID as well as selective strategic development in the U.S., primarily for The Habit Burger Grill, for which refranchising proceeds may not be fully realized this year. Now on to our unmatched operating capability growth driver, with so much of our sales now going through off-premise channels, our operations teams have been laser-focused on delivering a fast, enjoyable experience for customers. As a result, KFC U.S. improved their drive-thru speed by nearly 15 seconds in the quarter over last year. And Taco Bell U.S. delivered their fastest average drive-thru speed in 8 years, while serving a staggering 17 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. Importantly, one-third of these additional cars served were digital orders, which typically carry a higher check value, not to mention an optimized customer experience. Additionally, we continue to make tangible progress on scaling our in-house built technology platform. During the quarter, we deployed the pickup and delivery ordering solution across all KFC U.S. restaurants, including the launch of our first ever custom-built KFC app. Early signs are highly encouraging, and this gives us confidence as we look to further optimize and scale the platform. Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, during the first quarter, we opened 660 restaurants and closed 225, resulting in 435 net new units. Most notably, KFC delivered 4% unit growth, with strength in China, India, Russia and Thailand. At Pizza Hut, we were pleased to add 71 net new units, reflecting a positive trajectory following the COVID-related dislocations and closures of last year. We still have more work to do, and there will be choppiness related to the uncertainty of COVID and our continuing transition to a more modern estate, but we are encouraged by strong unit economics in many markets and our resilient global franchise base. We are also proud to announce that, shortly after the quarter ended, we opened our first ever Taco Bell in Malaysia. Not only was this the 31st international market Taco Bell has entered, but it was the first market entry where all training and launch programs were conducted virtually, a real breakthrough by the amazing Taco Bell Asia team. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the end of 2020 and into the early part of 2021, and this increases our confidence that we can return to 4% annual unit growth sooner rather than later. In 2021, we are optimistic that we will accomplish at least 3% unit growth. Now for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as our latest thoughts on capital structure and priorities for capital allocation. First, we ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $560 million, excluding restricted cash. Consolidated net leverage was 4.9 times which returns us to our target of approximately 5 times. Second, we repurchased 2.6 million shares totaling $275 million at an average price per share of $106. Third, we executed a series of transactions that added resiliency to our business while balancing liquidity, flexibility and cost. During the quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility and refinanced our term loans. We also priced a new Yum! Brands, Inc. holding company bond, which closed on April 1, subsequent to quarter end. Proceeds from this new bond, which carries a coupon of 4.625% and matures in 2032 will be used to repay $1.05 billion of 5.25% restricted group notes due in 2026, which we intend to retire later in the second quarter. All combined, the transactions were leverage-neutral and importantly, allowed us to boost liquidity, lower interest going forward and extend maturities. As always, we will continue to look for opportunities to further optimize our capital structure, depending on market and business conditions. Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged; invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. I will try to squeeze in a two-part question. Just really about the U.S. brands for KFC and Pizza Hut, I am particularly curious about Pizza Hut. But both of those brands have had a pretty good run during COVID, but they have also been doing some pretty good stuff on the marketing front lately, so new management and the like. So, I am wondering how you feel those brands are set up for post-COVID. Do you think they can lap me or flat coming out of this as they lap some of these COVID comparisons? And I think, particularly with regard to Pizza Hut, I think people are curious about the health of that system. And obviously, it\u2019s a long way away now the concerns of 2019, the franchisee profitability if the unit closure is over, any sort of feelings about the long-term health of that business? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks Dave. I think you are right. KFC and Pizza Hut have done a tremendous job navigating this tricky environment over the last year. But very importantly, they have done a great job setting themselves up for future success. A lot of that, as you mentioned, good marketing, the rollout of the KFC sandwich, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but it bears repeating. That has been a very successful launch with a great product. It really is a winning product in the category, and we are excited about the impact that will have, along with Secret Recipe Fries that rolled out in the quarter. But on Pizza Hut specifically, the comment about health is also well put. The Pizza Hut franchisees over the last year, given the success they have had, the ability to close some of the underperforming dine-in stores that we have been trying to get out of, those \u2013 all of those moves together have strengthened their financial condition in a very big way and that sets them up for a much growth going forward. A big part of that is just the ownership of NPC, which we also mentioned, Greg Flynn and his organization taking over a good chunk of the Pizza Hut U.S. stores is a huge positive for the brand. They are great restaurant operators, great businessmen that has a great team underneath him, knows how to run restaurants as well as anybody in this country. And very excited about the impact he will have taking over those stores and improving their operations, fixing up the assets and growing the business. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks and good morning. It was good to hear that unit growth is now sort of within the historical range, 3% this year, perhaps on the path back to 4%. Can you just drill down a little bit? One, just by brand, how you think that plays out? Obviously, you have led with KFC, but maybe there are some other opportunities within the other 2 brands this year. And also just thinking out over the next 2 years to 3 years, historically, you have led with KFC, but is there \u2013 has COVID changed the way you think \u2013 thought about the growth opportunity for the other 2 brands and maybe the balance of growth is going to be different going forward than it has been historically? David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks so much. Good question on development. And as we said, we were encouraged by the momentum at the end of last year and the momentum in Q1. Our expectation for all of our brands is to be growing units, and that\u2019s been our history and will continue to be our expectation going forward. KFC, we think, has historically been strong, and we want it to continue to be strong. But we have high expectations for Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and The Habit. Common across all of them is we think strong franchisees, very strong unit economics that improve as the business rebounds from COVID, continued brand love from consumers and ability to serve them on an off-premise basis. Plus, you are seeing us now integrate digital into the formats. And so post-COVID, optimized formats in each of those brands. And so with that, coupled with our very strong development teams, we think supports us on that trajectory back. And so we have expectations that we see strength across all of the brands going forward from a development standpoint. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great, thanks for the question. And wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Taco Bell and some of the brand strength and the franchisee strength that you have seen in recent quarters. David, I think you talked about some of the key drivers of strength in this most recent quarter. Just curious, on the go forward, some of the drivers you are most excited about, whether it\u2019s digital, the loyalty program that you touched on, how that new products pipeline looks. And just as we think about the reopening developments and dynamics going forward, some of the headwinds may be from competition reopening, but also talk about kind of late night coming back, maybe breakfast coming back. Curious if you guys could speak to some of those tailwinds as well. Thank you. David Gibbs : Yes. And for Taco Bell, I think there is excitement across the board for everything they have done over the last year under Mark King\u2019s leadership and the great talent that we have at the brand and with our franchise partners, one of the strongest franchise systems you will ever find. The international development story is one that bears mentioning in terms of the opportunities we have there. We are starting to see ourselves get to scale in some markets. We always know that when we get to about 100 units in a market that\u2019s when you really can start to unlock development, leverage marketing dollars to really create a virtuous cycle and a better unit economic play. We are starting to see that happen in a few markets around the world, and I think we are excited about the upside there. But even in the U.S., we also are leaning more into development as the unit economics look great right now. The opportunities in the U.S. real estate landscape are there. And our franchise partners are financially healthy and eager to go after them in concert with our team and picking the right opportunities that make money for them. The progress that we have made over the last year on digital is also an important part of the Taco Bell story. We are coming out of 2020 with a great loyalty program and a lot of loyalty members. That progress was made last year as we increased our digital sales. That lays the foundation for more success going forward. We did this \u2013 the first digital-only promotion of the $5 Create Your Own Box. It\u2019s a great example of how having that digital business increasing gives us new tools to grow sales. So, I think the brand is really hitting on all cylinders. The product innovation is there. Once again, they have got something out of fries for the quarter, and they have got a great pipeline of stuff coming down the road. And the future for Taco Bell is incredibly bright with accelerating development growth, a strengthening brand, a great leadership team, great franchise partners. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. I wanted to come back to your outlook for unit growth. And I guess, if I look at the first quarter, I think 435 net openings is the highest you have achieved in perhaps at least 10 years, according to my model. But I am wondering if there was anything unique to the quarter that would have driven that strength. And if you can comment on how that strong start to the quarter kind of translates to your guidance of at least 3%, but not perhaps getting to that 4% run rate, that would be helpful? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. David, good question, if you look at Q1, I think a couple of things stand out. We had strong gross openings which were, in particular, driven by a few key markets in Asia, but general strength in openings across the board. You saw in the U.S., fewer closures. And in general, in the Pizza Hut global system, fewer closures than we had last year, which as we said in the prepared remarks, we think reflects a bit of a turn there, although there is still a lot of work to be done on the asset transformation, and there is still going to be choppiness from a unit standpoint in the Pizza Hut system. And so those are kind of what drove the shape of development in the quarter. As we said, there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward. If you get outside of the U.S., the COVID situation in certain countries is still very dire, and that leads to some unpredictability. That\u2019s why we are not yet ready to commit to exactly when we can get back to the 4% number. But we do have enough confidence as we look at the current pipeline to say that we think we will be at the 3% number at least this year. But again, we have still got a fair bit of uncertainty out there given the global situation. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. Chris, I think you touched on it briefly in your prepared remarks, but ticket drove the majority of quick service comps in 2020, just speaking for the category with ticket being hugely positive and transactions generally being negative. Can you comment \u2013 and this is, I guess, for the whole team \u2013 on your thoughts of maintaining that ticket as traffic returns or should we, by definition, be looking for a positive transaction environment, perhaps at least partially offset by negative ticket environment? And if you could talk about maybe some experience that you have seen in markets that have been reopened the longest in terms of that ticket traffic dynamic, if there is any differences in those markets that have been opened the longest relative to national average? Thanks. Chris Turner : Yes. Good question, John. And obviously with 290 brand country combinations it varies, a lot of this varies by each one of those. But in general, we are seeing as markets reopen, ticket come down a little bit. But the thing that determined a lot of our success going into this was our ability to serve family meals and serve larger tickets. So, the brands that had those options, like KFC buckets, and Pizza Hut meals for sharing, tended to do better. And we are not seeing that all go away. I think, as you think about the things that happened during COVID, accelerating trends, which ones of those are going to be sticky. I think we expect that ticket will come down from where it\u2019s at, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going return to its old levels. And we think that\u2019s good. The same thing could be said for some of the digital business, the increases that we have had in digital, that\u2019s going to be stickier and stay in our business. So even in the U.S., as we see dining rooms reopen, we are not seeing, for example, a decline in Taco Bell\u2019s digital business. And so we are holding on to those gains. So yes, it\u2019s probably fair to expect ticket to start to moderate. But not \u2013 I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to return to pre-COVID levels. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate it. I was just hoping you guys can tell us a little bit on the recent tech investments. I know David, you had mentioned that Kvantum has been in a couple markets so far. And Tictuk, if I am saying the name correctly, has been in about 900 stores outside of the U.S. So, I am curious to hear what you expect these platforms to deliver, and how you expect them to spread across the globe. What sort of unlock you are expecting for sales, and maybe perhaps dig into what you are seeing in those stores where the technologies been deployed versus stores where that hasn\u2019t been the case? And if there is any incremental investment, perhaps on headcount, in order to see this opportunity scale-up across the globe? David Gibbs : Great, great question. So, we are excited about both of these acquisitions. If you think about the key areas of our technology strategy, they tied to two of those key areas, one being our e-commerce and technology platform. So, Tictuk enhances that by giving us one more way, one more channel for customers to easily access our brands, through channels like WhatsApp, social media, text messaging, we have had a really good success with it. And nearly 1,000 stores where we have already used Tictuk, and we have high expectations for that team, to continue to bring on new markets, and expand within each of the brands around the globe, we think it\u2019s a great customer experience, really easy to reorder just a few seconds for those customers. So, we are excited about what it does on the platform. If you then think about another key area of our technology strategy, which is data and analytics and our ability to drive insights, Kvantum did squarely against that, brings a new capability in-house that many of our markets around the globe have used to optimize their marketing investments. And so we are excited that they are now continuing to serve more and more of our businesses internally. Both of these we think are high return, they are on the smaller side, but high return acquisitions. And importantly, they create a competitive advantage. And the reason we decided to acquire them is there is also the scaled economies that come from being able to apply their capabilities across the breadth of our global business. Chris Turner : Yes. And just one thing to expand on the return piece, we are buying these companies in order to improve our capability and provide services to our franchisees at the lowest possible cost that are really unique proprietary capabilities that we would have. They are not designed to drive a profit for Yum! We want to provide them at the lowest cost to our franchisees. The return for Yum! comes through top line growth in our franchise units, which leads to more royalty income. We think we have really got a great model here where we do these smaller acquisitions, but we can scale them across the world. They have almost no impact on our P&L initially, and then the return comes from growing sales and units improving franchise economics, which we all know is a virtuous cycle, which leads to more development and healthier franchisees is really our number one goal. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Good morning. As you analyze your different regions in country combinations for specifically for the KFC portfolio outside of the U.S., where are you in faxing store level volumes, having the biggest outperformance versus \u201819 levels? And on the flip side, where are you seeing the biggest underperformance versus 2019, just so we can maybe better understand what market recoveries are needed to drive a further acceleration in this positive to your trend that you are starting to see? David Gibbs : Sure, good question, Brian. I think all of this is actually fairly intuitive. Where we are seeing ourselves successful is for the most part in developed markets, like the U.S., Canada, Australia, the UK, for KFC, where they are ahead of the curve a little bit on vaccination, keeping the virus under control, people are back trading, and where our business is going into the pandemic had skewed more off-premise to begin with, and had well developed digital and tech capabilities. So, that trend is continuing for all the markets. Well, I think that\u2019s something that we are pleased with is that where we were going, which usually we are a little bit ahead in developed market versus emerging markets is on point environment. So conversely, the other markets that are struggling, are the ones, perhaps where we had skewed more dine-in going into the pandemic, and where we have maybe government action that is limiting our ability to trade, for example, in some markets, I think, in India, we have got to close our stores now, at 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, that\u2019s obviously going to have an impact on our business. So, less mobility leads to less sales, but we know that those situations will work themselves hopefully out sooner rather than later, which is why I think long-term, we are still very confident in the international business and returning to even stronger growth. Operator : Our last question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Just a quick follow-up to an earlier question. And then another one there Quick Order technology. And the follow-up was, I think, to John\u2019s question about tech acquisitions that specifically could us maybe talk about give some context in terms of maybe the success or what you have seen from previous acquisitions, I think like Quick Order, a couple of years ago, and just maybe how your technology strategy has or hasn\u2019t changed as you think about build versus buy. And then any color, you can give on loyalty for Taco Bell, I know Pizza Hut has a loyalty program, anything you can tell me about your frequency, what that looks like when people join or average spend, just as loyalty programs become more pervasive, I am trying to figure out they are still having the same kind of impact on the business. Thank you. Dave Russell : Thanks, Sara. I will take the first part of your question on technology. If you think about it, we do ask ourselves the question of should we build the capability in-house, should we acquire it and bring it in-house or should we contract with an external provider. And we run that test, and we think about, gosh, we should have it in-house, if it is a strategic competitive advantage, with high switching costs, and we need to have that in-house. We then assess our ability to develop it versus, the speed of integrating and the opportunity to attract or find a great candidate to acquire. Obviously, our ability to develop in-house is terrific right now with Clay Johnson coming onboard over a year ago, plus the strong technology teams that we have at each brands. And that\u2019s where you saw the success with the launch of our KFC U.S. e-commerce platform which will continue to expand to other parts of the business. The Tictuk and Kvantum acquisitions for the reasons we talked about earlier, we think it was the right thing given that we had already seen the success and the impact they have had on our system to bring those in-house. And we have got plenty of examples where we contract with service providers where it\u2019s either a less strategic capability or the switching costs are low. So that\u2019s how we think about that. And again, as David said, we drive return from these primarily by driving system sales growth and creating better unit economics for our franchisees, which furthers development in the long run. David Gibbs : Yes, in past acquisitions that we have done like Quick Order have really paid off not only being done as a Pizza Hut acquisition, but leveraging the talent and some of the IP across other brands. So this thing is really, got all sorts of synergies and benefits as if as we make the right acquisitions. We have also done acquisitions outside of tech, like we bought Collider, a consumer insights company, that has been enormously helpful in us navigating the marketing environment all around the world and making sure we stay connected with consumers. And Collider in particular is really excited about the acquisition we did with Kvantum which will help them come up with insights on the marketing side, and then implement those insights most efficiently using Kvantum\u2019s algorithms. So, a lot of this stuff is going to start to create even more synergies as we put the \u2013 what we believe is going to be the greatest tech team in the restaurant industry together. On the loyalty side, clearly, the move to digital that we are seeing with the consumer \u2013 with our consumer base, really enables us to leverage loyalty in an even bigger way. So Pizza Hut, which has had a loyalty program for quite some time now, continues to see more and more of their business going through that loyalty program, driven by frequent users that love the program. That\u2019s why I have mentioned earlier, I was so excited about seeing Taco Bell launch their loyalty program would be hard to do when their digital mix was pretty low. Now, that they have a much bigger digital mix. That\u2019s a great backdrop for us to engage with loyalty on our Taco Bell customers. And just as we would expect, we are seeing those customers coming back more frequently. Excited about the program and seeing giving us a new channel to communicate with them, market to them and grow the business. David Gibbs : I guess, as the last question, I will just wrap up by saying we are all quite excited about Q1. But we know there is a lot more work to do. I think what you saw in Q1 just demonstrates the resilience of the business, how we are coming out of the pandemic in a lot of markets that are now getting to the other side of this stronger with a better foundation to grow. Evidenced by the development progress we are made in the quarter. But we all know this is a journey. We haven\u2019t reached the finish line. We are not doing a victory dance. But we are very excited about the future. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time today and look forward to talking to you on the next call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Third quarter earnings will be released on October 28, 2021, with the conference call on the same day.  Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share our strong second quarter results as we delivered record second quarter unit development and 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, each division reported positive same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis, a step-up from first quarter trends. This sustained momentum was underpinned by our investments in digital and off premise and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of consumers in an ever changing environment. Though COVID obviously creates a more challenged operating environment, our confidence is stronger than ever in our ability to navigate the resulting uncertainties and in the long-term growth potential of Yum!. As a result, we're reinstating our long-term growth algorithm with one important change, we are raising our previous guidance of 4% unit growth to between 4% and 5% unit growth. As a reminder, our long-term growth algorithm includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth, and mid-to-high single-digit system sales growth, leading to high-single-digit core operating profit growth. The diversification of our global portfolio, the resilience of our business model, and the agility of our teams are allowing us to compete and win in a full range of market conditions, including both those markets with accelerated recovery and markets still heavily impacted by COVID. Looking forward, our iconic brands and unmatched scale, in combination with the world-class talent in our restaurant teams, franchisees, and above store leaders have uniquely positioned us for sustained growth. Now, we'll discuss our recipe for growth and our Q2 performance and the growth drivers that underpin it. To start, I'll cover two growth drivers, namely relevant, easy, and distinctive brands or RED for short; RED, for short; and Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Then Chris will share more details of our Q2 results, our Unmatched Operating Capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers and our strong liquidity and balance sheet position.  First, a few highlights from the quarter. In Q2, Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. Importantly, same-store sales grew 4% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of approximately 700 or about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. This was driven by continued strong sales momentum in North America, the UK, and Australia with improved performance in Europe as it began to reopen and showed signs of recovery. As I mentioned earlier, each of our brands delivered positive 2-year same-store sales growth on a global basis, including the impact of temporary closures, and each brand also reported an improvement in the 2-year trend from Q1. This is a great indicator for the sustained strength and breadth of our recovery, even more exciting as the extremely strong net new unit growth of 603 units that we delivered during the quarter, which was both broad based and record setting. Looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, we've seen that while the overall global trend is positive, the recovery will neither be consistent from country to country nor linear within a country. This insight reinforces the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple armed and off premise channels. We've seen that increased customer mobility driven by reopening trends and vaccinations contributed to strong performance in many of our markets. A key growth driver for our business and priority for our teams is the continued acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives across the globe geared toward providing customers with new and seamless ways to access our brands. Even as economies continue to reopen, the importance of the off-premise occasion remains a top priority. We delivered a second quarter record with over 5 billion in digital sales, a 35% increase over the prior year. Even more exciting for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered more than $20 billion in digital sales. We believe these sales are highly incremental and result from our investments in our digital and technology ecosystem, which enable our teams to deliver an even more RED customer experience. To bring the impact of our digital efforts to life, I want to share a few proof points. At Taco Bell U.S., the launch of our Taco Bell Rewards Program in 2020 has continued to grow digital sales for the brand with features such as loyalty member exclusives, and early access to crave worthy promotions. We're incredibly excited by the early results from the program and the future growth opportunity that remains. We're seeing significant uptick in frequency and higher spend per visits leading to an increase in overall spend of 35% for active customers in the Taco Bell Rewards Program compared to their pre-loyalty behavior. As another example, at KFC U.S., we launched our internally built KFC e-commerce website and app in early 2021 replacing our previous third-party solution. As a result, our 2021 digital sales are on pace to soon surpass last year's full-year digital sales amount. Now, let's talk about our RED brands. Starting with the KFC division, which accounts for approximately 51% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 35% driven by 30% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. For the Division, Q2 same-store sales grew 2% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. At KFC International, same-store sales grew 36% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. We had truly outstanding results in market leading to recovery with double-digit 2-year same-store sales growth in the UK, Australia, Canada, and the Middle East. Our strong off-premise capabilities, digital strength, and value offerings have continued to meet shifting consumer demand around the globe, and there is opportunity for continued recovery as reopening and mobility increases globally. Next, at KFC U.S., we continue to see strong momentum with 11% same-store sales growth in Q2. Importantly, same-store sales grew 19% on a 2-year basis, owing to the continued strength of our group occasion business, the digital capabilities mentioned earlier, and our new chicken sandwich. Our chicken sandwich performed exceptionally well and provides us with a solid platform to drive additional sales layers in the future. Moving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for approximately 17% of our divisional operating profit, the division reported Q2 system sales growth of 10% driven by 10% same-store sales growth. While the division had a 3% unit decline versus last year, driven by the elevated COVID-related dislocations and closures of 2020 it has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1. Global Q2 same-store sales grew 1% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Overall, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 16%. Same-store sales declined 6% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 2% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Importantly, the off-premise channel achieved 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis for the quarter and delivery continued to be the primary driver of growth as the shift towards an off-premise model continues in most of our Pizza Hut markets. The top line results from our Australia, Canada, Malaysia, and our U.K. delivery business are shining examples of what it means to nail the RED Brand strategy. These markets continue to unlock off-premise growth opportunities through a focus on value and innovation, a digital-first customer experience, and distinctive communications with the help of our magnetic ambassadors, spokespeople who bring our brand to life across the world. At Pizza Hut U.S., we continue to see positive same-store sales with 4% overall same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, the off-premise channel grew 18% and overall same-store sales grew 9%, which includes the impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q2 2021. Pizza Hut also delivered strong product news with the continued success of our iconic stuffed crust pizza and the successful return of a consumer favorite, the Edge Pizza during the quarter. As for Taco Bell, which accounts for approximately 31% of our divisional operating profit, Q2 system sales grew 24%, driven by a 21% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. For the division, Q2 same-store sales grew 12% on a two-year basis. The quarter kicked off with the return of the Quesalupa as part of the fan-favorite $5 Chalupa Cravings Box, followed by the re-launch of the iconic Naked Chicken Chalupa. In May, we launched our first-ever global brand campaign, #ISeeATaco, in which fans could score a free taco when the moon looked like a taco. We generated over 2 billion impressions and step-change brand awareness, especially in our international markets where we have a tremendous run rate for growth. And finally, the Habit Burger Grill delivered 31% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Q2 same-store sales grew 7% on a 2-year basis. Importantly, digital sales continued to mix over 35%, only a modest pullback from Q1, even as dining rooms continued re-opening and dine-in sales saw a steady improvement throughout the quarter. On the innovation front, we introduced the Brunch Charburger during the quarter, a unique all-day breakfast offering that included crisp golden tots, house-made secret sauce and a freshly cracked egg. In addition to providing customers with a seamless experience to access our brands, we continue to invest in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate and run a restaurant. As previously announced in the quarter, we\u2019ve agreed to acquire Dragontail Technologies, a cutting-edge restaurant technology company, whose platform is focused on optimizing and managing the entire food preparation process from order through delivery, including automating the kitchen flow, driver dispatch, and customer order tracking. The acquisition is subject to various approvals and we expect to close by the end of the third quarter. We will not be able to comment further on Dragontail today, but you can find additional information in the May 26 press release. An important factor of RED Brands is having a positive impact and the desire to make good easy for customers. Our Recipe for Good framework focuses on our commitment to investing in the right recipe today. We were proud to publish our 2020 Recipe for Good report this week, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and sustainable stewardship of our people, food, and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments on critical issues like climate change and equity and inclusion. I\u2019m confident that our plans in these areas have the right ingredients for us to succeed and make a positive impact for our people, franchisees, customers, and communities. Now, to unrivaled culture and talent. Two of our key assets are our iconic brands and the people that bring our brands to life around the world every day. As I\u2019ve mentioned in previous quarters, COVID has further strengthened the collaboration partnership across our entire system. A great example of this is our relationship with our independent supply chain purchasing co-op in the U.S., RSCS. Many of you probably saw the recent announcement that the CEO of RSCS, Steve McCormick has made the decision to retire in early 2022 and that RSCS Chief Operating Officer, Todd Imhoff, was unanimously selected to succeed Steve in the role of CEO. Steve has had a tremendous and positive impact on our business for nearly a decade and our entire system is grateful for his leadership.  At the same time, Todd is the right leader to step into this role and lead the RSCS moving forward as it continues to provide a true competitive advantage for our entire U.S. business. Our unrivaled culture and talent has always been a towering strength of Yum! and I\u2019m incredibly proud of our ability to bring our brands and people together in ways we haven\u2019t in the past. During the quarter, we hosted several virtual meetings where we fostered collaborations on a global scale for our franchisees and teams, including marketing, planning meetings, ops, development programs, a global finance summit, leaning with leaders sessions, and company-wide chats just to name a few. It\u2019s during these meetings that we realize we are all more alike than we are different and the power that our brands and our culture have to bring people together. To wrap up, I\u2019m pleased with the sustained momentum in our business and the agility we\u2019ve shown in the last year and I\u2019m optimistic that we are set up to win. Our results demonstrate the resilience of our diversified global business and confidence in our strategies, which are fueled by the underlying health of our franchise system. We are poised to accelerate growth and maximize value creation for all our stakeholders for years to come. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll discuss our second quarter results, our unmatched operating capability, and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers, and our solid liquidity and balance sheet position. To begin, let\u2019s discuss Q2. Overall, Yum! system sales grew 26%, driven by 23% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 4%, which includes the negative impact of about 1% of our stores being temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q2 2021. We delivered 2% unit growth year-over-year, which included a Q2 record of 603 net new units. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.16, representing a 41% increase, compared to ex-special EPS of $0.82 in Q2 2020. Core operating profit grew 53% in the second quarter, driven by accelerated same-store sales growth in several developed markets at KFC, the combination of strong sales and restaurant margin growth at Taco Bell, and a year-over-year benefit associated with reserves for franchisee accounts receivable. At Taco Bell, company restaurant margins were 25.9%, 1.4 points higher than prior year. Favorable sales flow-through was partially offset by labor and commodity inflation, as well as increasing semi-variable costs as we return to normal operations. As mentioned on our previous call, we expect these margins to return closer to historical pre-COVID levels later this year given inflationary pressures, along with increased staffing at our restaurants as a result of increases in dining room patronage and a return toward our historical day part mix. During Q2, we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due, primarily led by KFC International. These recoveries resulted in a $4 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter, representing a $17 million year-over-year tailwind to operating profit growth as we lapped $13 million of expense in Q2 2020. As a reminder, we ended 2020 with $12 million of full-year bad debt expense with large quarterly swings due to COVID. As such, we expect year-over-year operating profit growth to be negatively impacted in the second half as we lap bad debt recoveries of $21 million and $8 million in Q3 and Q4, respectively. While difficult to forecast, at this point, we still don\u2019t expect bad debt to significantly impact our year-over-year operating profit growth on a full-year basis. General and administrative expenses were $230 million. Full-year 2021 G&A is expected to be back-end weighted, as it has been historically. We now estimate that our consolidated G&A expenses will be approximately $1 billion for the full-year 2021, a slight increase from our Q1 estimate attributable to increased incentive-based compensation. Our commitment to be an efficient growth company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged and we expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back toward our historic ratio as sustained growth continues. Reported interest expense was $159 million, an increase of 21% compared to Q2 2020, driven by a special item charge of $34 million related to early redemption of restricted group bonds during the quarter. Interest expense, ex-special, was approximately $125 million, a decrease of 5%, driven by recent refinancing actions and the elimination of revolver balances held in the prior year. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million, excluding the previously mentioned $34 million special item charge similar to 2020. We plan to continue to take advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance debt at attractive rates. As a reminder, this will result in higher one-time expenses that will be favorable to interest expense going forward. Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $16 million for the quarter. As we\u2019ve discussed on prior earnings calls, we believe roughly $250 million in annual gross CapEx appropriately balances the inherent needs of the business, with opportunities to invest in technology initiatives and strategic development of equity stores. We still anticipate at least $50 million in annual proceeds from refranchising, which will fund the strategic equity store investments. As a reminder, for 2021, we may be slightly higher than the $250 million gross CapEx amount to catch up on repair, maintenance, and remodels, as well as selective strategic development in the U.S. Now, on to our unmatched operating capability growth driver. Our restaurants are operated by world-class franchisees who are experienced and competing and winning in any environment. It\u2019s well known that the U.S. is facing a competitive labor market, which is more pronounced relative to other markets across our diverse global footprint. We and our franchisees are leaning into our unrivaled culture, which differentiates our brands to compete in a tight labor market with a focus on retention and recruiting. I\u2019ll add some color by sharing examples from our Taco Bell company restaurants. I\u2019ll start first with recruitment. We posted hiring parties, which have led to a significant uptick in employee hires. We also launched a fast apply option to make the application process easier and more efficient by reducing the application time from 8 minutes to 2 minutes. On the retention front, we\u2019ve supported and rewarded our team members by offering a variety of incentives, including paid time off, free family meals, and increased employee development activities to name a few. We\u2019ve always prioritized investing in our people and we recognize the importance now more than ever to ensure we maintain focus on our unmatched operating capability to deliver a RED customer experience. At the same time, our system is well-positioned to sustain strong unit economics while managing the inflationary environment related to labor market dynamics and commodity cost trends. On the commodity front, there is no one better equipped to navigate this environment, given our massive cross-brand purchasing scale through our domestic supply chain co-op RSCS that gives our franchisees many benefits, including advantaged end-to-end sourcing and supply chain costs. We are also confident in the pricing power of our brands and partner closely with our franchisees as they make strategic pricing decisions in their respective markets to deal with cost pressures, while still providing customers with relevant value and distinctive products. As David mentioned earlier, we are also prioritizing investments in restaurant technology initiatives that make it easier for our team members to operate a restaurant, while also providing an enhanced customer experience. As an example, Pizza Hut International continues to demonstrate significant momentum on this front, as evidenced by increased customer satisfaction metrics. Their improvements are fueled by continued adoption of frictionless restaurant technology, including our in-house intelligent coaching app called HutBot that launched at the end of 2020 and is now live in 40 markets, covering 4,000 restaurants. HutBot eases the daily management of our stores with the [RTM], leading to a better customer experience. At Taco Bell, we\u2019ve continued excelling at serving more customers through our drive-thru\u2019s. We had our sixth consecutive quarter of under 4-minute drive-thru order to delivery time. Speed for Q2 was 6-seconds faster than Q2 2020 and our teams served 4 million more cars compared to the same quarter last year. A huge shout-out to our operators and team members for continuing to break records in speed with the increased demand in off-premise.  The drive-thru experience is an increasingly critical competitive advantage for our brands. So these improvements position us well to win going forward. That\u2019s a perfect segue to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver, which I\u2019m particularly thrilled to speak about today. Our net new unit growth of 603 during the quarter was broad-based across brands and geographies, making this not only a record quarter, but also capping a record first half. These results speak to the strength of our iconic brands in growing food categories supported by a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. Most notably, KFC opened 428 net new units during the quarter with significant builds in China, Russia, India, Latin America, and Thailand, contributing to 5% unit growth year-over-year. As many of you know, KFC has the first-mover advantage in several emerging markets with a strong domestic footprint upon which to grow. This impressive development quarter from KFC speaks to the power of this global brand and the unit economics that underpin it. Pizza Hut has sustained its positive 2021 development momentum, delivering 1% unit growth relative to Q1, underpinned by the strength in gross openings and moderating store closures. Pizza Hut opened 99 net new units during the quarter, led by strong development in China, India, and Asia. Taco Bell opened 74 net new units and we\u2019re excited to share that Taco Bell International had its best development quarter ever, opening 30 net new units led by Spain and the U.K. In the U.S., we opened our flagship Taco Bell Cantina in Times Square, with a digital forward footprint and personalized experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the first half of the year and we\u2019re extremely proud to announce 4% to 5% unit growth guidance, led by development from all four brands across our footprint. Next, I\u2019ll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position and priorities for capital allocation. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $552 million, excluding restricted cash. The strong recovery in EBITDA during Q2 drove our consolidated net leverage down to approximately 4.5 times, temporarily below our target of approximately 5 times. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares, totaling $255 million at an average price per share of $119. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve repurchased $530 million of shares at an average price of $112. Finally, our capital priorities remain unchanged, invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend, and return the remaining excess cash flows to shareholders via repurchases. Overall, I\u2019m extremely proud of our Q2 results, the resilience of our business model, and the agility of our teams. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks and good morning. Chris and David, I just wanted to, you know on your new unit development target, I\u2019m wondering what signals you\u2019re getting that prompted you to not only reinstate the guidance, but increase it from a pipeline perspective? What time frame is reasonable to expect? Could this become visible in 2022, for example? And just specifically on the KFC brand domestically, it\u2019s doing very well on a same-store sales basis. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a lot of development, though, over the last several years. How do you think about domestic development specifically or generally playing into that? And the KFC brand, specifically, do you see opportunity here in the U.S. just given the repositioning of that brand? Thanks. David Gibbs : Thanks, John. Yes, obviously, we\u2019re excited about net new development. And as you know, we do have a lot of visibility into the pipeline of our development because it takes about 12 months to plant the seed of development before you get the opening. So, we\u2019re working with our franchise partners around the world to get that visibility, understand what\u2019s coming down the pike, and that\u2019s what gives us the increasing confidence, but really that all starts with the unit economics.  When our unit economics are good, it\u2019s an attractive proposition for our franchisees to build. You saw Yum! China last night talk about that. We\u2019re seeing that in the vast majority of the world right now, which is what gives us the confidence to make that commitment to 4% to 5% net new unit growth. And just to clarify, that would apply to 2021, as well as 2022 and beyond. As far as domestically, we do think we\u2019ve talked about this past on calls. We do think that there\u2019s upside for KFC and Pizza Hut, particularly in the U.S. Taco Bell is starting to accelerate the development. So that went all \u2013 that trend is moving, but KFC and Pizza Hut haven\u2019t historically been growing in the U.S., and we think there\u2019s every reason in the world they should be net growers and they\u2019re shifting into that in 2021 and we think that will continue. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. Maybe just a follow-up on that impressive unit growth target acceleration, David and Chris. As it relates to kind of where that might be coming from, as you contemplated that acceleration, Chris, I think you spoke to all brands would be seeing the increase. Is it any in particular over the next few years or longer-term where you feel like you\u2019re really seeing something interesting where one brand more so than others might be driving that acceleration, and how to think about the timing of that over the next few years perhaps, just curious if any additional insights to share there? Thank you. Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, Dennis. Just to elaborate, our development engine is working and we expect it to work across all four of the brands, as David said. KFC has historically been our development leader. And if you look at what they did in Q2, it was very broad-based growth across a number of countries in the KFC system, I think north of 60 countries in the KFC system. And we expect them to continue to be the leader. But we have high expectations for the other brands. You\u2019re seeing Taco Bell with strong domestic growth, but you also saw a strong international growth in Taco Bell development. And they are now back on track running ahead of where they were in 2019. We expect to get to 100 units, for example, in Spain this year and have other markets that are getting to scale. And then you\u2019ve seen a market trajectory change in Pizza Hut. We took last year to drive our asset transformation strategy. We made some closures that helped accelerate that. And now you\u2019ve seen the trajectory change and plus 99 in Pizza Hut this year. So, we have high expectations for growth across all the brands. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I think these are all related questions. Just for clarification, I may have missed this or just didn\u2019t catch it. Is there a quarter coming up maybe over the next eight or so, where you do expect to be in that 4% to 5% net unit growth? Your kind of parameter or goal that you\u2019ve set out, I mean, if you can maybe point to a specific quarter that will get us all on the same page? And secondly, how many of the units that you are opening in 2021, whether you want to talk about the first half or you want to talk about the full-year, are units that are still catch-up units from 2020? In other words, you now is 2021 a year where it\u2019s 2021 development and 2020 combined and 2022 doesn\u2019t necessarily increase much from 2021, or am I thinking about that the wrong way that the actual development pipeline is so robust that 2022 development will exceed that of 2021? Thank you. David Gibbs : Thanks, John. And just to clarify, obviously when we report quarterly results that has the trailing 12 months in it, which we had some closures last year. So, when we\u2019re talking about our 4% to 5% net new unit growth algorithm now, we\u2019re talking on an annual basis starting in 2021. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting for 2021, 2022, and beyond. As far as the second question on catch-up units, certainly, there were some units that were put on hold in 2020 that have opened in 2021, no doubt. And that\u2019s helping us get to the number for 2021, because we had to restart the development engine. But by issuing the guidance on \u2013 as part of our long-term algorithm, we\u2019re obviously clearly trying to signal that we think that will continue into 2022 with organic growth, again, based on the factors I mentioned earlier : strong unit economics, healthy franchisees. We\u2019ve got strong brands all around the world, in general. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m going to ask my question on the KFC International business. When you adjust for the store closures, the two-year same-store sales for KFC International were positive. They turned positive in the quarter. This was despite what we heard from China last night, your largest international market, where sales do still remain below pre-COVID levels. So, can you again highlight where you are seeing this offsetting strength KFC International? And maybe, if possible, could you give us a glimpse of how those better markets are performing on a 2-year basis relative to the whole international business? David Gibbs : Yes. Great question. The KFC International business obviously showed quarter-over-quarter improvement in the 2-year trends which we are excited about and we think reflects the strength of the brand across its markets. You do see differences depending on the COVID situation in the state of each of those markets in that business. More developed markets where we\u2019re seeing recovery advance are running further ahead where you\u2019ve got more customer mobility and fewer restrictions on operating hours, those sorts of things for our restaurants, and where the footprint is more off-premise-ready. And so, if you look at markets like the U.K., for example, running incredibly strong, north of 40% growth in the quarter. The emerging markets have a bit of a longer tail on recovery. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing, but in general, great trend and improvement over the entire KFC International business. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. A question on digital sales. I think you mentioned that digital sales was up 35% in the quarter and that you believe it\u2019s incremental. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s an interesting reason why multi-year growth might be higher coming out of COVID as the headwinds from COVID directly ease. For example, I think the digital order mix was 20 points higher at global KFC versus pre-COVID levels at least earlier in this year. So, I\u2019m wondering what brands and maybe broken out by U.S. versus International, do you see the digital step-up proving to be the biggest help to multi-year sales growth in 2022 and beyond or whenever we finally have COVID headwinds ease? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, David. I\u2019m glad you asked about digital. Obviously, it\u2019s something we\u2019re really excited about as we are now on track for trailing 12-month $20 billion of digital sales. We\u2019ve been making investments and developed a long-term strategy for how to win in digital for many years now. So this is starting to pay off, not something that happened overnight. You\u2019ve seen us make investments in things like Quick Order, Quantum, Tictuk, Dragontrail now more recently, and then investments in people. So, this is something where we\u2019ve been building up the capability in all aspects. We developed a road map to win in digital and now we\u2019re implementing that, and it\u2019s actually been accelerated by COVID. But it\u2019s all the things that we were expecting to happen to the business are happening. It\u2019s really hard to single out which part of the business is going to benefit most from digital, because all of our brands are very rapidly becoming digital brands. You\u2019re seeing that in the numbers. Obviously, the brands like Pizza Hut that tend to \u2013 that started with a bigger digital base of customers, launched loyalty first. They\u2019re getting a benefit because it\u2019s central to what they do. But really on a growth basis, it\u2019s the brands like our other brands that started up from a smaller base that are really getting a big benefit, and it is both the U.S. and an international play. It\u2019s widespread and we do think it can fuel the business for a long time to come, part of the reason why we confidently reinstated our long-term growth algorithm. Operator : The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the broader inflationary topic, which you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Clearly, the franchise model insulates corporate, which is a good thing. But I am just wondering how you think about the outlook maybe for the system in terms of both commodities and labor over the next 12 months or so? I\u2019m assuming the pressure is outside and I was wondering how you respond in conversations with franchisees. I guess, qualitatively, whether you prefer to take the hit to margin or suggest they would take a hit to margin or are there maybe incremental cost savings or incremental menu pricing, maybe you can share the current pricing by brand to help us understand how the franchisees are managing? Thank you. David Gibbs : Yes. This is clearly a topic that is top of mind right now. We are seeing inflationary pressures primarily in the U.S., much more mark there than in our global footprint outside the U.S. represent 60% of our business. In the U.S., it is a topic that we and our franchisees are collaborating closely on. We are well-positioned to deal with this. First, when we had commodity inflation, as we mentioned in the remarks, we have greater purchasing scale than most players in the industry. RSCS, which leverages purchasing across the brands, gives our franchisees advantaged cost and negotiating capability from a sourcing standpoint. We are also seeing some wage inflation, as you mentioned. But when we think about dealing with both of those, the next lever that our franchisees and our brands pull is pricing. And so, we are confident that our brands have strong pricing power and our franchisees, who are the ones who actually make those decisions in their restaurants, are being very thoughtful about how to do that. They use analytics, they tend to layer these in over time, so that they don\u2019t get too far ahead of the consumer. And our brands, obviously, are very smart about how they create mix in the menu. I would say, we\u2019ve been very thoughtful and have increased pricing moderately across the brands in the U.S. to deal with this. But we\u2019re confident in the ability to continue to pull those levers to deal with this tactfully. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. I was just kind of following up on the question about digital and specifically how it ties into development. Is this higher digital mix that you\u2019re seeing across your brands across the globe allowing you to, kind of penetrate in the markets and specifically urban versus suburban at a different rate than you had once thought? And specifically, how is the digital mix impacting the type of future development that you\u2019re thinking for these brands, meaning, our footprint is a little bit smaller than you had previously thought, say, two to three years ago, because digital mix is higher. Just curious to get a little color there. David Gibbs : Yes. Look, digital is one of those things that had no downside. Obviously, the customers are \u2013 you have a better experience when it\u2019s a digital experience. The average check is higher. There\u2019s labor savings from processing orders on digital. So, the link to development is probably pretty \u2013 is pretty clear, right? It\u2019s going to give you better unit economics when you have higher check and less labor associated with the check and stickier customers by the way. So, we do think digital as part of our upside for development as we go forward and you\u2019re also seeing our brands develop new assets that take advantage of that, Taco Bell is best example of that, is the Taco Bell Go Mobile asset, which is, as you mentioned a smaller footprint, more on digital and should give our franchisees better unit economics. Obviously, this all starts and ends with franchisee unit economics, and to the extent that digital improves that, it\u2019s going to drive development. Jodi Dyer : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. My question is on Pizza Hut, and I wanted to specifically ask about the transformation or asset transformation that you\u2019ve been going through there. And whether your unit growth guidance now assumes that you\u2019re largely completed with that transformation, the closings that would be tied to that? And then I guess secondarily, can you just kind of frame-up how you\u2019re thinking about growth for that brand globally? Do you think Pizza Hut can get closer to your overall average on growth as you think about the next several years? David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, David. The Pizza Hut strategy, as we\u2019ve talked about over the last few years, has been to revitalize the brand and driving asset transformation. But it\u2019s focused on a modern off-premise business. And through COVID, both Pizza Hut U.S. and Pizza Hut International has continued to drive progress on that front. If we take Pizza Hut U.S. specifically, if you saw last year that we drove a number of closures in the system that did move our mix of [Delco assets] by a few percentage points. So, we\u2019re continuing to make progress on that transformation. There is still further to go. So, we\u2019re going to continue to drive that. But in terms of net unit count, you\u2019ve seen a change in that trajectory. We were actually slightly positive this quarter in Pizza Hut U.S., which we think reflects the improved unit economics in the U.S. that stem from the strength of the brand. And then across both Pizza Hut U.S. and across Pizza Hut International, you\u2019re continuing to see strong growth in off-premise, roughly 20% [indiscernible] I think we were 18% in Pizza Hut U.S. on a 2-year basis and 21% in Pizza Hut International. So, we think the strategy is working. We think the brand is strengthening. Still more work to go on continuing to transition the asset base, but we\u2019ve seen a change in trajectory on unit counts.  I think with that, we\u2019ll wrap up. I just want to thank everybody for the time on the call. And obviously, you sense that results are strong. But underlying those results, what\u2019s really encouraging for us is that all four brands are performing well. You saw that on a global 2-year basis they were all positive. They were all positive on a global basis in the U.S. Those all four brands had improved trends from Q1, which really bodes well for the future. And a lot of it is being fueled by digital obviously with $5 billion of digital sales in the quarter and on-track for over $20 billion on an annual basis. But it\u2019s not just the top line story, it\u2019s also on the net new units side with 603 net units in the quarter, a record no matter how you slice it. And all of that obviously adds up to great confidence in the business and the way forward and which is why we reinstated our guidance and raised our net new unit target. We know we have a lot of work and a lot of exciting work ahead of us to continue to grow and accelerate the brands. The team is fired up for it and it\u2019s a great quarter, but there\u2019s a lot more to come. Thanks for your time, everybody. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

David Gibbs : Thank you Jodi and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our strong third quarter results, underpinned by record-breaking unit development, continued strong digital sales, and the adaptability of our brands to meet the needs of our consumers in an ever-changing environment. During the third quarter, we delivered 5% same-store sales growth, or 3% same-store sales growth on a year basis. Despite a challenging operating environment due to the ongoing COVID pandemic, I'm extremely proud that we opened 760 net new units. A Q3 record with broad-based strength across our portfolio. While Yum China continues to be a leader in development, we opened 379 net new units across the rest of our portfolio, roughly equivalent to our Q3 2019 global net new units, including China. Our continued positive development momentum this quarter is a testament to the strength of our iconic brands fueled by a strong unit economics and a healthy, well-capitalized franchise system primed for sustained growth. Now will discuss our Q3 results and 2 of the 4 growth drivers that underpin our recipe for growth. Our relevant, easy, and distinctive brands for red, for short, and our unrivaled culture and talent. I will also share an update on our ESG agenda, which we call our recipe for good. Then Chris (ph), will talk about our other 2 growth drivers. Our unmatched operating capability and bold restaurant development in addition to providing more details on our third quarter financial performance and our strong Balance Sheet and liquidity position. First a few highlights from the quarter. Overall young third quarter systems sales grew 8% led by same-store sales growth of 5% on a two-year basis, same-store sales grew 3%, which includes the impact of around 500 stores or 1% temporarily closed due to COVID as of the end of Q3. COVID restrictions that limited mobility in a few markets primarily in Asia, had a significant impact on sales. However, our sales momentum remain strong as evidenced by the fact that our global two-year same-store sales growth excluding Asia, accelerated since last quarter. Sales strength continued in many developed markets, including the U.S. U.K and Canada, with significant recoveries seen across Europe as restrictions is throughout the quarter. We've also seen pockets of strength in our portfolio of emerging markets, including the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, and India, to name a few. As we've previously shared, looking across the more than 150 countries in which we operate, our recovery will neither be consistent from country to country, nor linear within a country reinforcing the competitive advantages of our diversified portfolio and our ability to serve customers through multiple on and off premise channels. A key growth driver for our business remains the continued acceleration of our digital and technology strategy, including how we leverage our global scale with technology investments to enhance the customer and employee experience, strength in restaurants unit economics, and provide a competitive advantage for our franchisees. We're seeing strong and sustained momentum through our digital and off-premise channels across our global business, even as customers return to our dining rooms. We posted over 5 billion in global digital sales with a near 40% digital mix during Q3. We continued to expand delivery capabilities across the globe, setting a record this quarter with over 41,000 stores offering delivery to our customers.  Most recently, we acquired dragging tails systems, which will allow us to tap into the powers of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and further enhance our delivery capabilities. Where we've deployed Dragontails cutting edge technology, we found that it makes it easier for team members to operate and run a restaurant and helps our franchisee strengthen store operations, all resulting in a better customer experience. This is the perfect segue way to talk about our 4 RED [Indiscernible]. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for 52% of our operating profit, Q3 system sales grew 11% driven by a 6% same-store sales growth, and 7% unit growth.  On a 2 year basis, Q3 same-store sales were up 1%, which included the impact of 1% of the stores being temporarily closed due to COVID. At KFC International same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. Same-store sales declined 1% on the 2-year basis. As previously mentioned, increased COVID case counts and limited mobility to a few key Asian markets, pressured top-line trends in the quarter. This quarter, several Western European markets joined the group of resilient market leading the recovery where sales have fully recovered to pre -COVID levels. Strong digital and off-premise growth, newsworthy products, and doubling down on value offerings have fueled top-line growth in these markets, coupled with the continued strength of the Chicken category across the QSR segment goal.  Next at KFC U.S. same-store sales grew 4% during the quarter while same-store sales increased 13% on a two-year basis. The continued success of our chicken sandwich and the strength of the group vacation remains significant drivers of our same-store sales growth. Additionally as of July, our year-to-date digital sales in the U.S. surpassed our full-year 2020 digital sales, which speaks to the results we're seeing from our investments in this critical growth channel. Now onto the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 17% of our operating profit. Q3 system sales grew 4% driven by 1% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth For the division, 2 year same-store sales grew 1% during the quarter, which included the impact of 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3, 2021.  Pizza Hut international, same-store sales grew 6% during the quarter. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales declined 4% while our Pizza international business continues to be pressured given our substantial value index that sustained strength in our off-premise business, as reflected by 21% same-store sales growth on a 2-year basis bodes well for the future of the brand and continues to fuel franchisee interest in investing in assets focused on serving the all-premise occasion. Our markets continued to demonstrate what it means to be read by focusing on strong value propositions and innovative partnerships, including Beyond Meat product offerings in 2 markets this quarter. At pizza in U.S., we continued to see positive momentum with 2% same-store sales growth. On a 2-year basis, same-store sales grew 8%, and the off-premise channel grew 17%. Pizza Hut continues to delight customers by bringing only from Pizza Hut premium innovation with the launch of the Edge Pizza and the return of the successful Detroit Style Pizza in Q3. Additionally, we promoted the big dinner box during back-to-school season for operating easy dinner solution for our Pizza Hut customers. Moving onto Taco Bell, which accounts for 31% of our operating profit, third quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 3% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. 2 year same-store sales growth was 8% for the quarter. Taco Bell continues to focus on long-term growth opportunities by expanding into multiple category entry points, including the re-launch of breakfast in August and the fried chicken category with the Crispy Chicken Sandwich Taco during the quarter. Meanwhile, Taco Bell International remains focused on their visions to make tacos cool around the world, while also ensuring the brand is culturally relevant in each market. In the UK, we gave away three tacos to the country to celebrate England advancing to the finals in the European Championship. Players on the English team even tweeted on behalf of the brand, resulting in Taco Bell being 1 of the top trending brands on Twitter during the final. And finally at the Habit Burger Grill, we saw our system sales grow 19% during the quarter, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. On a 2 year basis, same-store sales grew 7%, which included the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of June 3. We continued to see strong results through our digital channels, even as customers returned to our dining room. During the quarter, we launched the culinary forward balsamic grilled chicken and asparagus salad that highlighted our unmatched chargrilled chicken and seasonal ingredients. Now I'll discuss our unrivaled culture and talent growth drivers.  The whole market beyond was our people first culture. We have tremendous leaders across our organization that have been developed internally to lead our brands. And because of our culture, we're able to attract world-class external talent. This quarter we had the opportunity to announce some exciting internal promotions with planned leadership transition. First, Tony Lowings, CEO of KFC, will be retiring on March 1st, 2022. I want to thank Tony for his more than 25 years working at Yum!. He has embodied what it means to be a people first leader throughout his career, and will no doubt leave a lasting legacy on the KFC brand. Tony's (ph) successor will be Sabir Sami KFC's Global Chief Operations Officer, who is an incredibly well-respected, and experienced leader who has played a pivotal role in the KFC Global Business.  Sabir's promotion to CEO of KFC provided an opportunity to elevate another internal talent with Dyke Shipp stepping in as President of KFC, after serving as KFC's Global Chief People and Development Officer. With their combined experience of over 40 years with Yum!, both Sabir and Dyke will assume their new roles effective January first 2022. I couldn't be more confident in our ability to continue to unleash the power of this iconic brand with both Sabir and Dyke leading KFC. Next, we recently announced that David Gibbs, Pizza Hut, U.S. General Manager, will be promoted to President of Pizza US. effective January 1st, 2022. Alongside Kevin Hockman, David has helped architect the Pizza Hut, U.S. strategy and is the right person to lead the way forward for the brand by continuing to partner with our franchisee. With this promotion, Kevin Hockman, Interim President of Pizza U.S. and President of KFC U.S. will return full-time the KFC U.S. I would like to thank Kevin for his unwavering commitment and leadership over the past 2 years as he led the Pizza U.S. business and franchisees for a critical turnaround that has shown tremendous progress to date all while simultaneously taking KFC U.S. to new heights. These internal promotions demonstrate that our deep bench of experienced leaders is a real competitive advantage for us across the restaurant industry. Lastly, we recruited significant external talent with the appointment of Aaron Powell as Chief Executive Officer at Pizza Hut. Aaron joined us from Kimberly-Clark where he most recently led their Asia-Pacific business.  We're thrilled to have Aaron join our leadership team with his season CPG executive experience and believe his leadership alongside [Indiscernible], David Graves, will help fuel the brand growth strategy. Equally as important as our recipe for growth is our recipe for good. I could not be prouder of the progress Yum! Brands have made this year in sharpening the focus and execution of our ESG agenda, particularly on climate action and sustainable packaging, alongside our global unlocking opportunity initiatives to tackle inequality. We are advancing our plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our global system and supply chain by nearly half by 2030 while we work to implement, learn from and scale pilots for reusable, recyclable, and compostable packaging in the front of our restaurants to meet our 2025 public commitments.  Across all programs, we're focused on building a resilient business for the future with purpose and sustainability as the core. Our iconic brands and unmatched scale put us in a class of our own. We're competitively advantaged given the size and capabilities of our franchise system. And I'm thrilled with our teams as we continue to be nimble and meet the consumer where they are. Overall, I'm proud of how our business is performing and I'm confident that we're positioned to win in a post-COVID world. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our financial results. Our unmatched operating capability, and bold restaurant development growth drivers and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. I will start by discussing our financial results. Our results year-to-date through Q3, highlighted by 15% system sales growth, translating into strong core operating profit growth of 26% demonstrate the resilience and strength of our economic model. The continued momentum reflected in our results, reaffirms our confidence in delivering on an annual basis the long-term growth algorithm we reinstated on our last call.  Specifically 2% to 3% same-store sales growth plus 4% to 5% net new unit growth, translating to mid to high single-digits system sales growth and high single-digit operating profit growth. In the third quarter, specifically, Yum! system sales grew 8% driven by 5% same-store sales growth, or 3% on a 2-year basis, which includes the impact of about 1% of stores being temporarily closed as of the end of Q3. We delivered 4% unit growth year-over-year, which included a record of 760 net new units this quarter. core operating profit increased 3 percent for the quarter. In line with our internal expectations, when accounting for 1-time items that impacted comparability.  The largest of these items was the [Indiscernible] of last year's bad debt recoveries, which accounted for a 5 point headwind to core operating profit growth. EPS, excluding special items, was $1.22 representing a 21% increase compared to ex special EPS of $1.01 in the third quarter last year. Reflected in our ex-special EPS this quarter is an investment gain on our approximate 5% investment in Devyani International Limited, an entity that operates KFC and Pizza Hut franchised units in India. Our minorities stake in Devyani was acquired in lieu of cash proceeds upon the refranchising of approximately 60 KFCs in India during 2019 and 2020. During the third quarter Devyani completed an initial public offering and we began reflecting the change in fair value of our investments in our results during the quarter.  This resulted in $52 million of pre -tax investment gains on our approximate 5% stake, which added $0.16 to EPS but did not impact our core operating profit. During Q3, we had bad debt expense of $3 million. As a reminder, we had large quarterly swings and bad debt last year due to COVID, and we're lapping $21 million in bad debt recoveries in the third quarter of last year, resulting in a year-over-year headwind of 5 points or $24 million to core operating profit growth this quarter. We expect core operating profit growth to be negatively impacted again in Q4 as we lap bad debt recoveries of $8 million in the fourth quarter last year. Our general and administrative expenses on an ex special basis for the quarter were $249 million.  On a full-year basis this year, we now estimate consolidated G&A will be approximately $1.05 billion, an increase of about $60 million above our incoming expectations for the year, driven entirely by our above target incentive compensation based on our strong business performance. Our commitment to be an efficient growth Company that leverages fixed costs with our unique scale benefits is unchanged. We expect our G&A to system sales ratio to move back to 1.7% next year on a full-year basis. Finally, we note that Taco Bell Company store margins have begun to normalize in the back half of this year due to increased staffing in our restaurants as we return to our historical daypart mix, wage investments and recent commodity inflation. While there will be quarterly variability due to the dynamic environment, we are confident in our ability to consistently deliver Taco Bell Company store margins in line with our historical pre -COVID levels for full-year 2021 and beyond. Next, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities. We continue to invest in our technology strategy to expand both our digital capabilities and restaurant technology solutions. We're prioritizing making it easier to operate our restaurants, ultimately driving efficiencies in our stores to enhance franchise unit economics, while also improving the customer experience. To that end, during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Dragontrail systems, a restaurant technology Company that enhances both the team member and customer experience. Dragontrail usages innovative technology that streamlines the order management process in the restaurants and optimizes delivery routes for drivers, resulting in our customers receiving the freshest possible products. Thus far, the Dragontrail solution has been deployed in 13 markets and over 1,700 stores across the Pizza Hut system. Many Pizza Hut restaurants leveraging Dragontrails platform have already seen a positive impact on sales, orders fulfillment, and customer satisfactions force, including product freshness and delivery times. I recently participated in virtual store visits in the U.K. and in Latin America where franchisees demonstrated benefits of the dragon tales system and shared their team members excitement. Another example of how our technology investments yield enhanced operating performance is Taco Bell 's continued execution of its all access technology initiative. This connected suite of core restaurant technology solutions is used to optimize operations and create a frictionless customer experience. These strategic efforts contributed to Taco Bell 's 7th consecutive quarter with drive-thru times below 4 minutes, enabling the brand to serve more customers through the drive-thru, while also delivering a great customer experience.  Moving onto our bold restaurant development growth driver, I am thrilled to discuss how we delivered another record development quarter with 760 net new units, including meaningful contributions across multiple geographies at our KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell global brands. While we continue to see strong development from Yum! China, our brands are also seeing broad-based development across other markets. The widespread strength in our store level economics and cash-on-cash returns improving relative to pre - Covid levels are key drivers contributing to the acceleration and development we're seeing around the world.  Our KFC International markets have seen impressive development as China, Russia, India, Latin America, and the Middle East continued to deliver strong unit development during the third quarter. Additionally, over the past year, Pizza Hut international has driven a significant inflection in their unit growth, going from negative net new units in 2020 to opening nearly 200 net new units during the third quarter. We expect this momentum to continue, a further testament to the confidence our franchisees have in the future of the brand. at Taco International, we continue to see strong development as key markets are approaching scale. Not only are we seeing strong development across our brands, but given the continued strength of digital and off-premise growth, our teams continue to evolve the asset types being developed into more digitally-enabled formats. As an example, we now have 23 Go-mobile locations at Taco Bell U.S. the technology forward restaurants, which include dual drive - throughs with a dedicated mobile pickup lane, mobile pickup shelves, and a faster bell-honk experience, among other things, have been a big hit, and we have more in our development pipeline.  Next, I'll provide an update on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. In August, we completed our third whole business securitization issuance at Taco Bell in the past five-years, issuing $2.25 billion of new securitization notes. The weighted average yield of the new notes was approximately 2.24% and the proceeds were used to opportunistically repay $1.3 billion of existing higher-coupon Taco Bell securitization notes, and to support our share buyback program. We still expect our 2021 interest expense to be approximately $500 million in line with 2020.  We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion excluding restricted cash. Due to our continued recovery in EBITDA, our consolidated net leverage continues to be temporarily below our target of approximately 5 times. With respect to our share buy-back programs, during the quarter we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an average share price of $127 per share, totaling approximately $330 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $860 million of shares at an average price of $117. Capital expenditures, net of re-franchising proceeds during the quarter were $49 million. We now expect net capital expenditures of approximately $175 million for the full year, reflecting roughly $75 million in re-franchising proceeds and $250 million of gross capex.  Lastly, our capital priorities remain unchanged, invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend, and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Before wrapping up, I'd like to take a moment to address both labor and cost inflation pressures and how a Yum! is well-positioned to navigate these challenges. U.S. labor availability remains tight across most industries, driving wage inflation and staffing challenges that have resulted in a small number of our stores limiting operating hours, particularly during the early morning and late-night day parks.  While our franchisees are not immune to these market pressures, we believe the power of our scale and the larger average size of our franchisees, relative to those of our QSR peers, enables our system to manage the inflationary environment better than most. For example, while many small chains and independent restaurants experienced difficulties adapting to these market dynamics, our franchisees continue to invest through this environment, accelerating investments that helped widen their strategic advantage. Additionally, our people first culture is a true competitive advantage in both attracting and retaining team members. We're confident in the ability of our brands to respond to the dynamic market conditions and are working closely with our franchisees to assess strategic opportunities to take price as and when needed while ensuring we continue to offer compelling value to our customers.  While store level margins have moderated franchisee unit economics generally remained incredibly healthy. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter, driven by impressive unit growth and sustained digital sales. We continue to invest in our digital ecosystem to scale technologies and provide a unique competitive advantage for our franchise operators while enhancing the customer and team member experience. Our franchise system is healthy and well-positioned to invest through the near-term pressures fueling our development engine and future unit growth. Our unit growth and sustained sales momentum, despite lingering COVID impacts, only make us more confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm. With that, Operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question [Operator Instructions] Again please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks. And good morning. I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit more about Taco Bell 's performance this quarter, while it was strong in a 2 year basis to raise some deceleration, stimulus may have played a role last quarter. So maybe that was a false read. That would also have seemed to be the brand just given your comments on staffing in early morning at late night that may have been impacted. Is there any notable impact of sales just from staffing shortages there? Typically just talk about the overall trends in staffing in particular. And why maybe you saw some deceleration on a 2-year basis. David Gibbs : Yeah. On a -- In terms of staffing, obviously, we're pressured in our restaurants just as everybody else is. But I think we're doing an amazing job in the field of being focused on retention. We won't have a staffing problem if we don't have any open jobs if we retain the employees that we have. And given the culture that we have in our restaurants across all of our brands, and the kind of environment that our franchisees create for their employees with pay checks and pathways to advancement, I think we're getting through this better than most. We're really proud of the results we put up across all of the brands this quarter. You guys probably saw it's on a 2-year basis. We're positive on all 4 brands. On a 1-year basis, we're positive on all 4 brands.  And then obviously, the big news is the 760 net new units that we open for the quarter, so very strong quarter. We've got pluses and minuses. John, if you're talking about in the U.S., KFC was up 13 on a 2-year basis, Pizza Hut, HMR, business -- Home Meal Replacement business was up 17, Taco Bell was a little bit softer. For them, late-night and breakfast become a little bit more of a challenge, and they skew a little bit more towards individual meals. And I think that's what you're seeing. Every brand has a different set of attributes as we go through this. Some will play better in this environment than other, but all of our brands are doing quite well, which is contributing to this great quarter. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on John's, and then I have one on unit growth. The Taco Bell results, 8% two-year. That's below the industry's comp. Taco Bell has been a long term share gainer. If you have a big picture comment about maybe sources of weakness, whether supply chain, the Midwest, something like that, also just bigger picture. Why you think Taco Bell on a two-year basis might not be as doing as well as the industry average of drive-through chains out there? And then on unit growth do you -- the results are very strong and it's hard to see weakness or hold backs from a development standpoint from a macro sense. But we would expect there to be that, that there would be some friction out there given all the macro challenges around COVID. Do you believe that there is something hold you back even in the strong numbers? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yeah, it's a great point. Obviously, the numbers that we put up in this quarter are truly record setting, right? 760 net new units in third quarter is a record for Yum! We're at 1,800 net new units year-to-date, basically, which is closing in on the record we set for Yum! in 2019 for full-year development. And I think you're right. There's probably some friction that we're experiencing that we haven't been able to open all the units that we could because of some challenges. But this is where the big advantages of Yum! come in. Our scale, our purchasing capability, the size of our franchisees, their access to capital.  We've been anticipating some of the supply chain challenges ordering ahead of time, securing the inventory we need on equipment, for example, to get through this without having equipment delays to open restaurants. I do think there is further upside to the numbers we're putting up, and I do think if we continue these trends, we'll obviously set a record for Yum! in the fourth quarter, and we probably have a shot at setting a record for the restaurant industry all time for a number of units open in 1 year. I look forward to reporting back on that in our fourth quarter call. As for Taco Bell, the Taco Bell sales are up 15%. System sales are up 15% on a two-year basis. We make no apologies for that. The business is doing quite well, very strong. It does have its own unique challenges since it skews a little bit more towards individual meals versus family occasions, you are seeing the brands like pizza, I think KFC, that's skewed towards family occasions performing even better. But Taco Bell performance is strong. In Q3, we made some investments in -- on the marketing side, they weren't designed to pay off on the top line, such as re-launching breakfast. We know those will have benefits for us down the road. We're proud of what's going on at Taco Bell with system sales growth like that, unit growth like we're seeing all across Yum! and the Taco Bell. I'm excited about the future for all our brands. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. I have another question on development. And first, I just wanted to see if you thought this year's development strength was due in part to some hands up activity from delays that you saw last year and or just underlying strength. And then Chris, I think you mentioned in your comments that you're seeing improved cash-on-cash returns and a lot of markets, and I was hoping that you could elaborate what you meant there specifically. Thanks. David Gibbs : Yeah, thanks, David. As David mentioned, we are very excited about the momentum in development. And if you think about the drivers, the number one driver is unit economics. So that gets that both parts of your question. Around the globe -- in general, our franchisees are seeing strong EBITDA, and they are seeing that translate to improved returns whenever they build restaurants. Remember, these are our franchisees putting their capital to work, and that's where I think the strength of the brand and the larger average size of our franchisees Chris Turner : really matters. They're able to see through near-term fluctuations related to COVID around the globe and invest for the long term. The 2nd driver on development is the strong development teams that we have who are focused and incentivized to go create great results on the development front. And they have an improved set of capabilities. We're now bringing analytics to bear and how we set our development plans in a number of markets around the globe. We're bringing new prototypes to bear. We talked about the Go mobile concept, which is primed for digital growth with Taco Bell. We have similar examples and other brands.  So it's a broad set of drivers that are supporting this growth. And you've seen this trajectory change, in particular in the Pizza Hut business. That's been an important driver of where the numbers are. Pizza Hut international putting up plus 200 in the quarter. That's more than 300 better than where they were a year ago and you've seen Pizza Hut, U.S. stabilized. Those are also important drivers. Broad-based strength in development right now. David Gibbs : As far as the issue of pent-up demand, I'm sure there's some units that spilled over from 2020 into 2021, but we do believe that these trends in development will continue We think we've gotten to a new level on development that's why we raised our development guidance on the last earnings call. Look, we're talking about net new units. Let's talk about growth new units for the quarter. In the quarter, we opened over a thousand gross new units. That's a store every other hour, basically, all quarter long. Pretty amazing. And when you think about just the side effect of that, how we're modernizing the estate with that kind of development, it's really encouraging. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you very much. I think a lot of us on the call know what the U.S. issues are in terms of construction labor, and permitting, and even equipment. But I wanted you to give us a rest of the world view in terms of how supply chains are around equipment and your ability to, I guess again, keep us get current rate of development over the next couple of quarters. And of course, asset in the context of your supply chain seems to have gotten worse in the past 6 months, and perhaps some of the stores that opened in that third quarter benefited from what was ordered, 6 months ago or even longer. Do you expect this momentum to continue with their -- that pipeline, just in terms of overall supply chain constraints, however, you want to define it that you feel good on a market-by-market basis? David Gibbs : Yes, thanks a bunch, John. It's a good question. And I think this is where the strength of our operating model and our capability set around sourcing really shines. We saw some of those supply chain challenges related to equipment that are a global challenge. We saw those on the horizon earlier this year and our supply chain teams were building resiliency plans at that point and they worked with our franchisees around the globe to get ahead on purchasing for those equipment and reserving capacity with suppliers. There is certainly are going to be some local challenges here and there related to permitting. But again this is where that capability set helped us get ahead plus our larger, more sophisticated franchisees who invest ahead. They have a sophisticated teams who are driving their development, and that's a big asset here as well. So yes, we probably left a few units on the table this year as a result of that. But in general, we don't see that as a constraint on our long-term development pattern. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Awesome. Thank you for taking the question. Just real quick in terms of thinking about the value proposition to the consumer and obviously the inflation that's running through the market today. Curious to know how your franchisees are handling the pricing situation now and that heading into '22 Jon Tower : with obviously wage rate inflation as well as commodity cost inflation. How are you messaging to the franchisees? The best way to handle it to the extent obviously can have influence on it. In terms of new product news, are you constructing items, say at Taco Bell or KFC, for next year that will allow them to at least maintain some of the penny profits so they're not getting squeezed too much in this inflationary environment? Thank you. David Gibbs : Yes, thanks, John. Obviously, inflation is a story not just in our industry, but across sectors. And again, I think this is a situation where Yums! operating model sets us and our franchisees up to deal with those challenges really well. And I think of three things. One, keep in mind our footprints. 60% of our sales are outside the U.S. and this inflation challenges are most acute in the U.S. We see it in a few pockets around the globe, most acute in the U.S. Second in the U.S. think about our scale, we purchased across all four brands together with RSCS, we have a professional team of highly talented strategic sourcing experts. They're working right now. I can tell you throughout this inflationary trends, they saw it coming.  They've got plans on finding ways to offset that. So we're leveraging our scale to help manage costs in those -- against those pressures. And then third to your point, we pull a number of leavers to manage margin with our franchisees. Our brands are working proactively with the franchisees. You've mentioned product design. I'm sure we're going a little bit of that. We've done some menu management. We'll think about how to optimize promotions. And of course pricing is a lever that's available, but our franchisees and our brands, they manage and they balance the short-term and the long-term.  In the short-term, they want to make sure we're providing strong value to the customer that we don't get too far ahead of the consumer. But in the long run, whenever I talk to our franchisees, they're confident that long term margins in the restaurants will be sustained And we can continue the momentum we've seen on a restaurant profit coming through the last couple of years. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Mullan : Hey, thank you. Just a two-part question on Habit. Just number 1. Have you look to eventually refranchise some Company-owned stores there. Can you talk about what you'd be looking for in any franchise partner for that brand. Maybe -- and making sure about how far along you may or may not be or operational goalposts that you would like to achieve first. And then just number 2, David, I'm curious are you spending any time yet looking for international partners or is it just too early for that for Habit? David Gibbs : We appreciate the question on Habit. We're really excited about Habit 's performance. If you think about it, they started pre -pandemic 60% dine-in sales. So they had the biggest hill to climb in this environment and just put up a plus 7 on a 2-year basis. So the way they've pivoted has been truly impressive. I think it hasn't gone unnoticed, we've had lots of demand from franchise -- from potential franchisees, both in the Yum! system and outside the Yum! system to enter. We've now started closing on a few deals. We closed on two already with Yum! franchisees entering the Habit system, and we have more in the hopper.  So we're seeing strong demand and interest in becoming Habit franchisees because the unit economics are great to all the reasons why we bought them. As far as international goes, same-story there. As you know, they're already in a couple of countries. I just was on a call yesterday where we were evaluating a new potential partner to enter in another country. So we've built up a little bit of capability and the team internationally to focus on Habit International and see every indication that that can become a growth driver for Yum! down the road. Jodi Dyer : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. And that will come from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Pizza U.S. both near-term momentum and then your thoughts on longer-term positioning. Just first on the near-term, anymore details, current impacts, maybe driver staffing challenges if there was a bit more of an outsize impact there versus stepping challenges at the other brands across the portfolio. And then more importantly bigger picture, just any more color on the broader strategic shifts. The benefits you're seeing and specifically how the work that you've done across asset base digital, new product development, etc. impacts how you're thinking about improved brand health and positioning longer-term for Pizza Hut in the U.S. Thank you. David Gibbs : Yeah. Look, Pizza Hut U.S. is obviously a bright spot for us right now and will be for the long term as all the work that we've been doing over the last few years, investing in digital and capabilities and working with our franchise partners has really starting to pay off. This quarter Pizza U.S. sales were up 17% off-premise basis, which is the heart of the business and the future of the business. But it's not immune to the same staffing challenges that everybody's facing. So I'm sure those sales were held back to some degree by the challenges of getting drivers. We actually saw our carryout business is now starting to grow faster. When we don't have the ability to get drivers were still able to pivot to carry out.  But so we know that there's a lot of demand for what we're offering at Pizza Hut and with a bright future in the U.S. The other thing I'll point out is our investment in digital at Pizza Hut has been really one of our leading investments in the world of digital. That's one of the advantages at Yum! has are knowledge of digital through the Pizza Hut business. You guys all picked up on the fact that we had over $5 billion of digital sales yet again, this quarter. But interesting context on that across Yum is our dine-in business started to climb this quarter. So from Q2 to Q3, we did see a return to dine-in, yet we saw digital sales go up and we saw digital mix go up, which is proving that not only is it sticky that it's still something that's going to continue to grow for us, which is a great sign for all of our brands as we move forward. With that, I want to thank everybody for the time on the call. We're obviously excited about what's going on with digital and what's going on with net new unit development, widespread same-store sales growth on a 1 and 2-year basis across all of our brands. A lot of momentum in the business right now, a lot of enthusiasm from our franchise partners with record profits at the unit level. And very excited about the path forward for Yum! and our four brands. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

David Gibbs : Thank you, Jodi and good morning, everyone. As we reflect on 2021, I couldn't be prouder of the collective accomplishments of our world-class franchise partners and collaboration of our global teams, guided by our Recipe for Growth and Good. While the last two years have been the most challenging operating environment we've ever navigated, we exit 2021 stronger than ever with over 53,000 global restaurants. Compared to 2019, we've nearly doubled our digital business. System sales have grown over $5.5 billion and operating profit has grown over $200 million. Additionally, since 2019, we've added another iconic brand and closed on three technology acquisitions, all while launching our global Unlocking Opportunity Initiative with a $100 million commitment over five years investing in equity and inclusion, education and entrepreneurship, the cornerstones of our Recipe for Good. In 2021, we opened 3,057 net new units, driven by 4,180 gross unit openings, with meaningful contributions from each of our brands, marking the strongest growth year in our history and setting an industry record for unit development. To put that into context, as the world's largest restaurant company, we opened a new restaurant on average every two hours. This speaks to the health of our business; iconic brands; capable, committed and well-capitalized franchise partners; and strong unit economics. This is yet another significant development milestone on our ongoing growth journey, providing customers with access to our brands through a variety of restaurant formats and on- and off-premise ordering channels. Now more than ever, we've leaned into the structural advantages of our diversified global portfolio by leveraging our unmatched global scale, sophisticated supply chains, marketing and consumer insights expertise and our growing digital and technology capabilities to fuel growth and deliver strong results. Even as dining room sales recovered throughout the year, we continued to grow our digital sales that reached a record $22 billion in fiscal 2021, an increase of approximately 25% over 2020, suggesting a more permanent shift to digital channels. We ended the year with over 45,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing more than a 25% increase year-over-year. We galvanized our digital and technology strategy and accelerated the development of our ecosystem with both internal investments and the closing of the Kvantum, Tictuk and Dragontail acquisitions. Our teams remain focused on elevating the customer experience, expanding our off-premise capabilities and empowering our team members with tools to make it easier to run our restaurants, all ultimately fueling improved unit economics. Expectations of our customers, team members and franchisees have forever changed due to the experiences over the past two years and we continue to challenge ourselves to exceed their rising bar. I'm confident we're poised to lead the industry as we embark on the next chapter of our growth journey. Today, I'll discuss our 2021 results showcasing a few examples across our brands for two of the four pillars in our Recipe for Growth : our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or R.E.D. for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll share progress on our Recipe for Good. Chris will share our fourth quarter results and provide an update on the other two pillars of our Recipe for Growth, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability, as well as an update on our strong balance sheet position and capital allocation strategy. To begin, full year 2021 system sales grew 13% with same-store sales growth of 10% or 3% on a two year basis and 6% unit growth. Each of our brands recorded positive same-store sales growth for the year and contributed to broad-based development strength. Full year core operating profit increased 18%, driven by same-store sales growth and the impact of unit development throughout the year. As we ended the year, COVID outbreaks and resulting government restrictions limiting mobility continued to impact sales in a few key markets, primarily in Asia, presenting a headwind to fourth quarter results. However, our sales momentum remained strong with continued global recovery as evidenced by our two year global same-store sales excluding Asia up 10% on a two year basis, accelerating sequentially from last quarter. Next, I'll talk about our four R.E.D. brands. I'll begin with KFC which accounts for 52% of our divisional operating profit. KFC full year 2021 system sales grew 16%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 8% unit growth. Q4 system sales increased 10% with 5% same-store sales growth or 3% on a two year basis. We continue to see ongoing recovery in emerging markets as evidenced by the fact that more than half of our 13 global KFC regions delivered system sales growth in excess of 25% for the full year. KFC International Q4 same-store sales grew 6% or 2% on a two year basis. Sales remained strong throughout the quarter despite regional impacts from COVID variants, with momentum holding in many recovered markets more than offsetting heavily impacted markets including parts of Asia and Western Europe. Common themes fueling top line growth in the quarter include off-premise and digital capabilities, newsworthy products and a strong value offering. KFC U.S. Q4 same-store sales grew 4% or 12% on a two year basis. Strong top line momentum was fueled by strength in group occasions, growth in the digital channel and the success of our chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich continues to perform well for the business and now makes up roughly 9% of our sales mix as of Q4, a strong improvement from a 1% mix last year. Our sandwiches are served straight from the fryer and hot to our guests. We expect the chicken sandwich platform to continue to be a significant driver of our positive sales momentum for the business going forward. Next, Taco Bell which accounts for 32% of our divisional operating profit. Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking number one in the Franchise 500 for the second year in a row, beating our peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. Entrepreneur magazine which produces this list, recognized Taco Bell for it's franchisee collaboration and innovation. This recognition is further evidence of our intentionality to be the world's franchisor of choice. Now I'll discuss our results for the year. Taco Bell full year 2021 system sales grew 13%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Fourth quarter system sales grew 11% with same-store sales growth of 8% or 9% on a two year basis, reflecting an acceleration from Q3. Taco Bell kicked off the quarter by introducing the new Cantina Crispy Melt Taco and later in the quarter brought back the Grilled Cheese Burrito, featuring a grilled and bubbly blend of real cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack cheeses. Additionally, the team kept value front and center with the launch of a new Crave More Value Menu featuring the $2 burritos. In addition, we launched a new lineup of toasted breakfast burritos as a way to welcome customers back to our breakfast day-part. Taco Bell fans continue to adopt digital ordering channels as we set digital sales records in both the U.S. and international this year. We will continue to bring distinctive products to life through our digital channels with early access to new products, digital-only campaigns and loyalty rewards. Moving on to Pizza Hut which accounts for 16% of our divisional operating profit. Full year 2021 system sales grew 6%, driven by 7% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. Q4 system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 3% or 2% on a two year basis. Overall, we saw an inflection in the growth trajectory of the Pizza Hut brand this year, a testament to the hard work of our team members and franchise operators and a reflection of the overall health of the system. Pizza Hut International Q4 same-store sales grew 4% while same-store sales declined 3% on a two year basis. Key markets that contributed strong performance in the quarter included Africa, Canada, India and the U.K. The brand remains focused on emphasizing easy through embracing continued growth in off-premise channels through utilization of both first- and third-party delivery networks. Pizza Hut U.S. Q4 same-store sales grew 1% or 10% on a two year basis. The team continues to bring iconic pizza that customers love to market in relevant and distinctive ways. In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut received strong recognition for an influencer-based marketing campaign that resulted in Pizza Hut being named a 2021 culture driver by TikTok. Additionally, we brought back a fan favorite, the Triple Treat Box, offering customers a convenient and value-oriented family meal option which drove sales in the quarter. Lastly, the Habit Burger Grill achieved full year 2021 system sales growth of 24%, driven by a 16% same-store sales growth and 11% unit growth. Q4 system sales increased 20% with 11% same-store sales growth or 5% on a two year basis. To showcase their chef-inspired innovations, The Habit Burger Grill reintroduced the Chicken Caprese Sandwich on garlic ciabatta bread with garlic aioli during the quarter. As dining rooms have reopened over the course of the year, Habit team members welcomed customers back into the restaurants while continuing to serve customers through their digital and off-premise channels. Now, I'll discuss our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. The hallmark of Yum! is our people-first culture which drives retention and recruitment of amazing talent. We remain committed to growing our talent from within and recruiting top external talent, as you've seen from some of our recent internal promotions and leadership transitions. This past quarter, we were excited to welcome former Nike Executive Sean Tresvant to serve as Taco Bell Chief Brand Officer while former Nintendo Executive Nick Chavez joined KFC U.S. as Chief Marketing Officer. The past two years have allowed us to build a strong foundation centered on our culture, talent and unwavering relationships with our franchisees. The collaboration with our franchisees has never been more powerful as we're aligned more than ever on the future growth trajectory of the business. Finally, I want to give an update on our Recipe for Good and the work we're doing around our three priority pillars : planet, food and people. When it comes to our planet pillar, 2021 was a milestone year. We announced science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 and pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We are expanding our foundational requirements for green building standards for new unit builds and advancing our corporate office and company-owned restaurant footprint to renewable energy. In terms of our food, we remain focused on food safety and listening and responding to customers' evolving preferences and improving the nutritional value of our menu items. We continue to introduce relevant and distinctive plant-based offerings from KFC's national launch of Beyond Fried Chicken in the U.S. to Pizza Hut offering Beyond Italian Sausage Crumbles in Canada. Finally, on the people front, we're committed to investing in Yum!'s social purpose focused on unlocking opportunities for our people and communities while championing equity, inclusion and belonging across all aspects of our business. Just last week, we announced the Yum! Franchise Accelerator, a groundbreaking partnership with the University of Louisville and Howard University to train and advance underrepresented minorities and women interested in building a career in the restaurant industry. Not only is this a priority for Yum! but unlocking opportunity remains a focus for our brands as well with the recent launch of the Taco Bell Business School. As a result of our elevated commitments and transparent disclosures, we've received notable recognition this quarter, including being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the fifth consecutive year and being named on Newsweek's ranking of America's Most Responsible Companies. I'm incredibly proud of our Recipe for Good and know that this work is more important than ever when it comes to building resilient and relevant brands for the future. As I take a moment to reflect on the past two years, I'm extremely proud and grateful for the significant accomplishments and collaboration across our teams to both serve our customers and community while fueling growth for our franchisees and shareholders. We're entering 2022 which marks Yum!'s 25th anniversary, with confidence in our Recipe for Growth and Good strategies and I'm energized for what lies ahead. I'm certain we'll continue to build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest growing restaurant brands while delivering lasting value for our stakeholders. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter financial results, Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability as well as our strong balance sheet position and capital allocation strategy. I'll begin by discussing our financial results. We finished the year strong, opening a record-breaking 4,180 gross units or 3,057 net new units, resulting in 6% unit growth for full year 2021. A robust 10% same-store sales growth helped us achieve 13% system sales growth, driving full year core operating profit growth of 18%. That is a tremendous outcome given the inflation, labor, supply chain and consumer mobility challenges our brands faced in the back half of the year particularly in Q4. Q4 results also reflect impressive performance. System sales grew 9%, led by same-store sales growth of 5% or 4% on a two year basis, accelerating from Q3. Strong underlying profit growth was masked by elevated G&A levels owing to higher incentive compensation as a result of our strong full year results and the normalization of Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins in the quarter as previously signaled. We anticipate quarterly variability in our company-owned restaurant margins as we remain focused on balancing relative value for our customers while protecting margins in the long run. To that end, full year 2021 Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins were in line with our historical range of 23% to 24%, virtually unchanged relative to 2019 levels. This demonstrates our ability to drive strong top line results while managing profitability in an inflationary environment. Our Q4 ex special EPS was impacted by two items. First, we recorded a $35 million pretax gain on our investment in Devyani International Limited. Second, we had a higher-than-normal tax rate for the quarter due to a tax reserve related to a prior year filing position that was challenged. And so our Q4 results were in line with our internal expectations and culminated in full year results that exceeded all elements of our long-term growth algorithm. Moving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. We opened 1,678 gross units in the quarter or 1,259 on a net new unit basis, resulting in nearly 4,200 gross units opened for the full year which is a record for Yum! and the restaurant industry. That equates to over 100,000 jobs created worldwide last year alone. We're able to achieve these record-breaking openings thanks to contributions from each of our four brands and incredible franchisees around the globe. China continues to be the biggest developer. However, we continue to see broad-based strength across our portfolio, evidenced by over 2,500 restaurants opened outside of China this year. In fact, we saw new restaurants built in over 110 countries this year, a step-up from prior years, signaling our development engine is diversified and stronger than ever. At KFC, the brand delivered a record development year, led by significant contributions from China, India and Russia. Overall, KFC International opened over 2,400 gross units and nearly 2,000 net new units during 2021. At KFC U.S., after several years of same-store sales growth and strengthening unit economics, we have a much stronger foundation now on which to grow in the future as evidenced by the inflection point in developments with the system moving to positive unit growth in 2021. Taco Bell reported a strong development year in both the U.S. and international. In the U.S., Taco Bell reached an impressive milestone, ending the year with over 7,000 restaurants and ample white space for future developments. During the fourth quarter, Taco Bell celebrated m\u00e1s international expansion as Spain was the first market to surpass 100 units. We believe this development threshold unlocks accelerated growth, fueled by the benefits of scale, including supply chain advantages as well as marketing and brand awareness. We're confident in what the future holds for Taco Bell International, particularly as scale ties directly to profitability. Pizza Hut International delivered a record year in development with all international business units reporting net positive growth, led by China and India. Continued improvement in unit economics and a more HMR-focused footprint are drivers of the broad-based unit growth. Pizza Hut U.S. continues to make progress on it's development journey and is poised for future growth, thanks to improved unit economics and a healthy franchise base. Finally, The Habit Burger Grill restarted their development engine this year with 23 net new units. Our brands are entering 2022 from a position of strength with plans to continue exceptional growth, owing to our world-class operators and franchise partners. We're confident in our future growth engine given our broad-based strength, improved unit economics and the visibility we have into our development pipeline. I want to say a huge thank you to our development teams and franchise partners for all the hard work it takes to open nearly 4,200 restaurants in a single year, let alone a year with ongoing COVID and supply chain-related challenges. Next, I'll talk about our Unmatched Operating Capability growth driver. We remain focused on leveraging our digital and technology strategy to elevate both customer and team member experiences by leaning in on three key elements : easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights. Starting with easy experiences. We expanded our digital ordering channels, including chat ordering via Tictuk, to nearly 2,000 stores at year-end, an increase of roughly 60% since our acquisition in the first quarter. We also saw digital sales at KFC U.S. grow approximately 70% year-over-year, fueled by our delivery service channel and e-commerce platform that launched nationwide in early 2021. We continue to invest in technology platforms focused on delivering a frictionless experience for our guests, including the launch of Quick Pick-Up at KFC U.S. in the fourth quarter that allows guests to bypass the drive-thru and grab their digital orders from cubbies inside the restaurant. The outstanding sales growth across our digital channels is evidence that our customers continue to expect and opt for easy access to our brands. Now moving on to easy operations which are focused on making it easier for our team members to run the business and ensure a superior customer experience. I want to highlight the exceptional operating performance of our brands, starting with Taco Bell, whose team members were unwavering in their commitment to deliver a superior customer experience. In 2021, Taco Bell's drive-thru times were two seconds faster year-over-year and the fourth quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of an average drive-thru time under four minutes. This truly is an impressive performance considering labor availability challenges. Additionally, the Dragontail order and delivery platform is now live in 2,800 stores in 21 markets across KFC and Pizza Hut, up from 13 markets last quarter and 9 markets from the end of 2020. Dragontail allows us to tap into the power of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and optimize delivery routes for drivers. At Pizza Hut International, we continued deploying HutBot, our intelligent coaching app designed to enhance both the team member and customer experience by digitizing routines and insights into operational efficiencies. When HutBot is deployed and used effectively, it's proven to increase customer satisfaction scores. We ended the year with HutBot live in over 6,000 Pizza Hut locations in 70 markets. To round out our technology strategy, our easy insights platform provides us with invaluable knowledge about our consumers, enabling us to enhance the customer relationship. When we acquired Kvantum, a leading AI-based consumer insights and marketing performance analytics business, in the first quarter, it was operating in 13 markets. We have since tripled Kvantum's footprint to over 45 markets. We will continue to prioritize initiatives that lead to incremental sales growth and improved unit economics for our franchisees. The impressive adoption rates of these technology platforms are evidence of our franchisees' confidence in the investments we made to advance our digital and technology ecosystem this year. We're confident these investments have created a meaningful competitive advantage and will be a point of differentiation for Yum! as we serve the elevated expectations of customers. Now for an update on our strong balance sheet position and our capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $486 million excluding restricted cash. We closed the year temporarily below our net leverage target of 5x as a result of our strong earnings growth. Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $55 million during the quarter and $145 million for the full year. The full year consisted of $230 million in gross CapEx and $85 million in refranchising proceeds. We paid a healthy quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or approximately $600 million for the full year. With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares at an average share price of $128, totaling $720 million. For the full year, we have repurchased 13 million shares at an average price of $122, totaling $1.6 billion. As we look to 2022, our capital priorities remain unchanged : invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining our asset-light business model of at least a 98% franchise mix. Going forward, we expect strong returns from our equity store investments to continue and like our franchisees, see attractive opportunities to invest in unit development. Capitalizing on these opportunities, we expect net capital expenditures for full year 2022 to be approximately $250 million, reflecting up to $350 million of gross CapEx and $100 million of refranchising proceeds. In the long run, we expect our refranchising proceeds to offset our new store investments as they have in the past. But in the near term, new store investments may exceed refranchising by $50 million to $100 million annually, primarily driven by our strategy to accelerate growth of The Habit equity estate. We were pleased to announce earlier this week an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 14% to $0.57 per share in 2022. The recovery of our business in 2021 and proven resilience of our free cash flow supported this increase, reflecting a two year double-digit CAGR, in line with our historical earnings growth and dividend increases. I'd like to wrap up by providing color on the shape of 2022. I'm pleased to share that we expect to deliver full year growth in line with our long-term growth algorithm which includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and 4% to 5% unit growth, culminating in mid- to high single-digit system sales growth leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth which excludes FX. Reflecting on 2021 results, we had several quarterly drivers that created lumpiness in the shape of the year, creating noise in our year-over-year lapse in 2022. We expect our full year G&A to be approximately $1.1 billion but our G&A spend will return to a more balanced quarterly cadence relative to 2021. Given the shape of our anticipated G&A spend throughout 2022 in comparison to 2021, we expect G&A to be a headwind to operating profit growth in the first half and a tailwind to growth in the second half of 2022. Due primarily to these timing factors related to G&A, we are expecting roughly flat core operating profit growth in the first half and high teens core operating growth in the second half, culminating in full year high single-digit core operating profit growth, in line with our long-term growth algorithm. Finally, on our 2022 effective tax rate. Although it's difficult to forecast with precision at this time, we continue to believe 21% to 23% is the appropriate range but there are factors that could move us toward the high end of the range. We'll continue to provide updates as appropriate. Overall, I couldn't be prouder of the results for the year. Looking forward to 2022, I'm confident we're poised to take share and deliver on our long-term growth algorithm, driven by our expanding competitive advantages tied to our unmatched global scale, investments in our digital ecosystem and world-class franchise partners. I'm looking forward to the year ahead and the continued success of our iconic global brands while delivering consistent earnings growth for shareholders. With that, operator, we're ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. DavidTarantino: Hi, good morning. My question is on your outlook for 2022. And Chris, I think you mentioned that you're planning it to be on algorithm for comps and unit growth. And specifically on comps, 2% to 3%, it looks a little maybe conservative in light of the fact that many of your markets will still be cycling some issues related to COVID, so arguably could see a recovery phase as you move through the year. So I just wanted to ask if you could give some context to that 2% to 3% outlook and whether you view that as a baseline that could prove conservative or if there are any offsets that we should consider as we think about the year. Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, David. I think we view all of our brands as having strong momentum coming out of 2021. Our long-term growth algorithm is just that, it is our long-term algorithm and we feel confident in delivering it in 2022 and beyond. You do have lots of puts and takes around the globe in terms of lapse, in terms of where Omicron is in any of our given markets but we feel good about the momentum that each of our brands have. And so we're always going to strive to deliver the algorithm and find ways to beat it. And so that's going to be our aspiration but the long-term algorithm sort of defines the plan. Operator : The next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. JaredGarber: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Actually, somewhat of a follow-up to the prior question just on the comp algorithm as we look to next year. It looks like in today's results, the average weekly sales growth across the brands didn't exactly line up with sort of the comp growth so there was some noise in between those numbers. And I wonder if that maybe is what's driving potentially some of that -- what David said as some conservatism in the comp algo. So I just wanted to understand maybe if there's any specific drivers there, if it's just lapse on a year-over-year basis in some of these markets or if it's maybe lower productivity units that are being opened. Any color there would be really helpful. Chris Turner : Yes. So when we think about how same-store sales and net new units add up to overall system sales growth, on that net new unit number, there are always going to be some factors like timing of when the stores open within the quarter, where we see stronger sales in -- or stronger growth in markets that may have slightly different AUVs than the overall average. But that's what's driving that difference. But overall, as we say in the algorithm, 2% to 3% same-store sales growth, 4% to 5% net new unit growth translating to mid- to high system sales growth is how we think about it. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. SaraSenatore: Thank you very much. Just a two part question on the digital sales and some of the technology investments. First, on the digital sales mix, could you just talk about -- you said it's structurally your sustainably higher mix. How is that playing out by brand or channel? Is this coming from delivery which is lower margin or order ahead which is higher margin, just as I think about the shape of the business going forward? And then you are investing for Pizza Hut on digital and technology. Can you just give a little more color on this? Is this sort of pass-through where fees show up in revenues and the costs show up in G&A? Or are you kind of investing ahead of the curve to support franchisees? And will that likely persist? Chris Turner : Yes. So first, if I take the drivers of the $22 billion in digital sales, it's been broad-based. We've seen strength across all of our brands and we're seeing strength across all of the channels. So delivery has continued to grow. Carryout has grown over the two years where people are using click and collect. And of course, as people have come back to the dining rooms, we've seen growth in the kiosk business which has rebounded at Taco Bell, for example. So we're seeing strong growth across all of those channels. And of course, on a brand-by-brand basis, you've got real strength in each one. KFC, if you go ex-China, was up 46%. Taco Bell in the U.S. is approaching 20%, Taco Bell International with a 40% mix. And of course, Pizza Hut is sustaining their strength on digital. So it's just a really great story. Clearly, those strong digital numbers come as a result of the investments we've been making and our strategy around digital because we knew this was the future of the industry. As we've said before, COVID accelerated those trends and we're glad that we were in a great position to be able to capitalize on it. But whenever you nearly double your digital sales in two years, I think that's evidence that those investments are paying off. And of course, our franchisees are co-investing with us to help make that happen but they're doing that because they're seeing strong returns from those investments in their business as well. So, I think overall story is we're getting a strong return and we're very pleased with the digital results and we're going to continue to drive that. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. DennisGeiger: Great. Thanks for the question. Wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the industry challenges in the current environment, even as you're managing them well, what you're seeing globally but particularly in the U.S. across staffing, impacts on operations and sales. And I guess more importantly, how do you think over the coming quarters and going forward as some of these industry challenges ease and the headwinds potentially turn to some tailwinds for the business as it relates to hours, et cetera? David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks for the question, Dennis. Obviously, this is a challenging environment to operate in, in our industry. That's been well documented. Q4 was more of the same of that and that extended into the early part of this year. As far as Omicron goes in the U.S. specifically, it does feel like we're moving to a better place. I was just on the phone with our chief operating officers yesterday, comparing notes across brands and there were some really similar themes of we're past the peak impact of Omicron, applications for team members are starting to come back up. So we think that the challenges and the impact on our restaurant hours may start to slowly abate over time. As far as the global picture, what we're seeing internationally is through most of the COVID pandemic, we had, had a more severe impact in our emerging markets. They were less well equipped to deal with the challenges of COVID. That's starting to change a little bit and we're starting to see the gap between the developed markets and emerging markets narrow. As you know, Yum! has outsized exposure to emerging markets. So even though we put up some amazing numbers over the last two years through this, we've been held back by those emerging markets. As that gap starts to narrow, we can see that there can be some strength in emerging markets to help strengthen our overall sales picture internationally, where, of course, 2/3 of our restaurants reside. But it's always a challenge to predict and forecast in this environment. We've all learned that over the next two years. But quite optimistic right now that both internationally and domestically, the business is heading to a better place. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. DavidPalmer: Thanks. Good morning. Heck of a unit growth year in '21 with 4,200 gross opens; I think it was 6% net unit growth, at least as far as an exit rate. I was wondering if you could give a hint as to where you could see globally, by brand, by region, some areas of acceleration and perhaps moderation in unit growth. For example, it's amazing that 1,800 of the 4,200 gross opens were from China. And I think there's some people concerned about economic headwinds there. And then you mentioned that Pizza Hut U.S. was no longer a drag to the unit development. So hoping for some highlights and lowlights as you look ahead. David Gibbs : Glad you talked about the new unit development, David. For me, it's an amazing accomplishment at Yum!. In my 32 years in this business, I've never seen anything like it obviously. The growth rates are industry records, Yum! records. It was widespread. It's across all brands. It's occurring in the vast majority of our countries which is really encouraging. And the question about where do we see softness going forward, it's a great question. I can tell you that there's no countries that we're worried about pulling back on development. We see all of our countries that are developing today being able to continue to develop at the pace that they're at and even accelerate. India is one I would highlight. We opened 335 units in the country of India on the strength of some development agreements with really great partners across all of our brands. Obviously, there's a huge opportunity for Yum! in India and one that should be accelerating. But even in the U.S., we're starting to see the momentum develop in our Pizza Hut and KFC businesses, who historically haven't been contributing net new unit growth. We're optimistic about that. And Taco Bell U.S. is back to developing at a really fast pace like in the early days of Taco Bell and we see that accelerate. But Taco Bell International is probably one of the most exciting stories we have right now. We've talked about it a lot and you're seeing over 160 net new units built on a base of 600 entering the year. That's a 26% growth. That's pretty impressive and we see that accelerating. Spain, for example, passed 100 units on the ground. We know when you get to that 100-unit tipping point, you see an acceleration but we have other markets poised to do the same. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. JohnIvankoe: Hi, thank you. And I apologize if I missed this. Have you gone back and looked at the fourth quarter system sales and determined how much the labor environment may have actually constrained system-wide sales growth, whether that's in the U.S. or global, it's up to you how we talk about that, just in terms of having less hours in the store that -- the store than you would have -- labor hours in the store than you would have liked? Are you actually having less store hours than you would have like, perhaps even day-parts in certain cases than you would have liked, I guess, is the first part of the question. And then secondly, we talked about easy operations and you mentioned a few things that you were doing at the store to help your franchisees. Are any at the point now where stores can be more efficient from a labor perspective where they can do the same or even more customer counts on a reduced level of labor? Or might that come from future initiatives that you are working on? Chris Turner : Yes. Great questions, John, on the labor front. As David mentioned earlier, it's obviously been a challenging environment but kudos to our teams, our franchisees for navigating through that. And I'm thankful that we have such a strong culture that goes from top to bottom, to our stores in Yum! that our franchisees help bring to life. So if we think about your specific question on how it impacted our sales in Q4 and coming into Q1, first, it's important to put this in context, that these labor challenges are most pronounced in the U.S. And of course, the U.S. is 40% of our business. There are a couple of markets, say the U.K., Australia, that are also experiencing some pressures but they are most pronounced in the U.S. So our global footprint provides us a natural advantage in this type of environment. But obviously, let's dig into the U.S. where we know those challenges have been tough. We did see some constriction of hours across the brands in Q4 as our franchisees dealt with the Omicron impact on staffing availability. The nature of that impact varied from brand to brand. For example, in Pizza Hut, you saw it really constrained delivery hours because of the challenges in staffing those driver positions. I think it's been well documented that's a challenge for the pizza category and we've seen other folks talk about that challenge. But that's an area where it was particularly pronounced, particularly coming into early January. I think the good news is we believe, as David said, that we're past the peak probably two or three weeks ago and things, we've been talking to our COOs yesterday, have gotten significantly better in the last couple of weeks. All of that has had a small but real impact on sales but again, trend coming out of that's much better. I will say that in terms of dealing with it, our franchisees have been focused on all of the levers that you would expect but we think the one that differentiates us is the culture that we have in the restaurants that causes our team members to want to stay. Second part of your question around efficiencies. I think the Taco Bell example of how we've driven more volume through the drive-thrus while reducing service times is the best example of how we're bringing efficiency to life in the restaurants. We are doing a number of things on the technology front, whether it's Dragontail, other systems. We have an innovation team that is in place. And of course, our core ops process teams are always improving processes in the restaurants. So things are in motion; there are things that have been implemented. And in the long run, we think there's a lot more to come. Jodi Dyer : Operator, we have time for one question. Operator : Thank you. The last question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. JohnGlass: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about KFC International. I was struck by how strong the comps were on a one and two year basis despite the fact that China was down 12%. David, I know you commented earlier about some of those key markets but just maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of what offset that decline in China which is an incredibly important market for KFC. And if you're willing to talk about how you think about the China recovery in your plans for '22 just broadly. Is it a recovery story? And is that embedded in your plans or not? David Gibbs : Yes. As far as KFC International, obviously, that's a really positive story for us and more than most, benefits from that turnaround in some of our emerging markets. You saw markets like India put up some really incredible numbers as they've recovered from COVID. And that also gives us confidence that some of these markets, as we get more on the other side of COVID, are going to really start to take off. Look, this idea of forecasting specific countries and how they're going to do, I think the benefit of Yum!'s model is how diverse we are across brands, across countries all around the world. We're not reliant on any one country. I'm glad you pointed out that even with softness in China, that we can put up numbers like we did this quarter. And we think that's the exciting part of the business as we head into 2022. We've got this diverse business model that is stronger than ever. We've been through over the last two years some amazing challenges. But all they've done is really proven that our business is resilient, that our talent is the best in the industry and that our business model is one that franchisees want to invest behind in a huge way. You saw that in the numbers this quarter on net new units. That gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to maintain top line momentum and profit strength as we go forward and truly, the team is incredibly excited about the future. Thank you all for your time today on the call and look forward to talking to you on the -- and sharing Q1 results. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to our host, Jodi Dyer, VP of Investor Relations, to begin. Jodi Dyer : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that may be used in today's call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that during today's call, all system sales and operating profit results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, as it relates to our Russia business, our operating results for the first quarter continue to reflect revenues and expenses related to Russia within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, we have reclassed net operating profit attributable to Russia for the month of March that had not yet been redirected to humanitarian efforts as of the end of the quarter from the operating segments in which it was earned to our corporate and unallocated segment. Those operating profits have been reflected within other income/expense and reflected as a special item. David and Chris will provide additional context in their prepared remarks. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. We would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. Second quarter earnings will be released on August 3, 2022, with a conference call on the same day. Finally, we will be hosting an in-person Yum! Brands Investor Day on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at the New York Stock Exchange. Stay tuned for more details. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Before I go over our first quarter results, I'd like to begin by sharing an update on our business in Russia and Ukraine. As a company that puts people first in every decision, I'm incredibly proud that we have made the safety and well-being of all those impacted by the tragedy in Ukraine as the top priority. I want to personally thank our many dedicated team members and franchisees working hard to navigate through this deadly conflict and manage our business in the most complex and challenging geopolitical environment in recent history. I'm proud of how our people in the surrounding regions have banded together and are doing everything possible to support impacted Ukrainian refugees, team members and franchisees, some of whom have overcome incredible challenges and have reopened a number of stores to serve food in communities where it is safe. Additionally, the Yum! Brands Foundation made a donation to the Red Cross to support those affected by the crisis. We activated the Yum! Disaster Relief Fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and are matching employee donations to organizations providing relief in Ukraine, including UNICEF, the Red Cross, the World Food Programme and the International Rescue Committee. We previously announced the suspension of all investment and restaurant development efforts in Russia as well as operations of company-owned KFC restaurants and that we are finalizing an agreement with our Pizza Hut master franchisee to suspend all restaurant operations. In addition to these actions, we have begun a process aimed at transferring ownership to local operators while, in the interim, we continue to redirect any profits from Russia operations to humanitarian aid. This is not a decision we take lightly and I know that it will be a complicated process to execute these transactions. We will update you on this process during our second quarter earnings call. Chris will provide more details around the financial impact from Russia on the quarter. I'll now discuss our first quarter results, which illustrate the resiliency of our highly franchised diversified growth model. Our first quarter system sales growth of 8%, driven by both unit development and same-store sales growth, is a testament to our iconic brands and the unmatched operating capabilities of our world-class franchise partners. We set a first quarter development record, opening nearly 1,000 gross units, supported by positive unit growth at each of our brands. Our continued same-store sales momentum was fueled by our brands executing our Recipe for Growth strategy by providing relevant value, access via new channels, distinctive products and a strong brand voice, all supported by our digital and delivery capabilities. Our digital channels continue to accelerate with digital sales of approximately $6 billion, a new first quarter record, reflecting an increase of 15% year-over-year. Importantly, we set a new digital mix record, now exceeding 40%. In this complex and highly inflationary operating environment, we and our franchisees remain focused on maintaining long-term profitability by leveraging our scale and strategic pricing actions while still offering our customers convenience and value. The many competitive advantages of our unrivaled talent, our sophisticated franchise system and the power of our business model give me great confidence that we are well prepared to navigate these complexities and deliver robust global growth. Let me share a few global trends from the quarter. As Yum China shared on its first quarter earnings call last night, COVID-related lockdowns impacted restaurant operations and depressed sales in that market, temporarily delaying an eventual recovery. However, our results outside of China remains strong. In fact, excluding China, both our KFC Division and Pizza Hut International same-store sales were up 10%, which would result in consolidated Yum! same-store sales excluding China of 6% for the quarter. We're pleased with the continued momentum in our developed markets as they lap strong results from last year and we're excited about the continued resurgence of emerging markets, with same-store sales excluding China of positive 18% for the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the global consumer recovery underpinned by returning consumer mobility, creating a tailwind for our on-premise dining while we sustain our off-premise business. Next, I'll discuss two of the four Recipe for Growth drivers : Our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll discuss the progress we've made on our Recipe for Good. Turning to our first growth pillar : our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which represents 51% of our operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 9%, driven by 8% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth. To illustrate the strength of the KFC brand around the world, I thought I'd highlight a few markets that showed meaningful improvement in the quarter, specifically the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Our Middle East market delivered 40% system sales growth, fueled by robust transaction growth. Our marketing teams led with a healthy balance of new products with the launch of the Messy Burger as well as innovative value-focused flavory items such as the Twister Blaze. These items drove both value perception and new customer acquisition. Additionally, the team's focus on meeting the needs of our customers through digital and off-premise channel growth while the dine-in business bounces back fueled our strong results. Latin America is another standout market. This quarter, system sales grew 34%, thanks to our team hitting on all fronts. All countries in the market deployed a balanced marketing calendar focused on value to drive velocity and transaction while taste campaigns continued to build brand strength. This came to life for consumers in January with the Genius Menu value ladder that's helping recover the individual occasion. In March, the Latin American market launched the Kentucky Fried Chicken sandwich for the first time, which drove over 10% growth in the sandwich category. Another market worth highlighting is our Africa business, which has been incredibly resilient as system sales grew 25%. Results were fueled by a continued traffic recovery, leading to transaction growth ahead of pre-COVID levels, a sign our value-driven strategy that offers successful price points resonated well with customers. Finally, in the U.S., our KFC team is working hard to maximize convenience for the customer and focusing marketing efforts on creating greater awareness of our off-premise channels, including Quick Pick-up services and our white label delivery offering. The incremental sales layers we've built over the past two years, including our digital ordering channels and the chicken sandwich platform, contributed to top line growth this quarter in the face of a difficult operating environment. Additionally, we offered Beyond Fried Chicken in the quarter, which elevated the brand and boosted relevance, resulting in more media impressions than any other product launch in the brand's history. A consistent theme across each of these four markets is the continued growth of digital transaction and the ability to execute an omnichannel strategy. Moving to the Taco Bell Division which represents 32% of our operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 5% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Taco Bell U.S. system sales grew 7%, driven by 2% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. I thought I'd start by celebrating Taco Bell's 60th anniversary as a brand. Given the brand's role as a culture leader in the industry, it's easy to forget its experience and heritage, all of which makes us even more confident in the brand's ability to navigate any economic environment. Taco Bell is executing on its strategy to inspire and enable the world to live m\u00e1s by remaining relevant, easy and distinctive to its customers. On the relevance front, Taco Bell continued to champion customer value with new offerings to meet all occasions, including the introduction of $2 burritos on the new Cravings Value Menu, adding to Taco Bell's existing $1 menu offering. The combination of Taco Bell's new Cravings Value Menu with its box and combo offerings positions Taco Bell well to serve the needs of all customers. Beyond value, Taco Bell was actively marketing craveable distinctive foods, from its limited-time crispy chicken wings to the return of our fan favorite Nacho Fries. Additionally, the return to the Super Bowl with Doja Cat marked the distinctive cultural moment in the quarter. We're building on this cultural moment with a long anticipated and much celebrated upcoming return of the Mexican Pizza which Doja Cat announced in April. Taco Bell International system sales grew 37%, driven by 26% unit growth and 12% same-store sales growth. We continue to build brand momentum in multiple markets, including the U.K., Spain and India. Our new strategy to reach scale in a few key markets has driven brand awareness, thereby improving new unit returns that lead to accelerated growth. Next, the Pizza Hut Division which accounts for 18% of our operating profit, saw first quarter system sales grow 3%, driven by 5% unit growth and flat same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International which represents 11% of our operating profit, system sales grew 10%, underpinned by 7% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. We opened 283 gross units, setting a Q1 record. With further easing in COVID restrictions, we saw strong contributions from India and Latin America, where system sales were up 44% and 18%, respectively. At Pizza Hut U.S. which represents 7% of our operating profit, system sales declined 6% for the quarter, attributable to a 6% decline in same-store sales and flat unit growth. While consumer demand remains strong, sales softness in the quarter stems from our delivery channel where capacity constraints limited our ability to meet demand. This was driven by staffing challenges, mainly from delivery driver shortages that have been felt across the industry. The team is prioritizing restaurant operations, including a focus on improving staffing levels, restoring operating hours, increasing online ordering availability and more effectively leveraging the use of our overflow call centers. Additionally, in early Q2, we completed the integration of delivery as a service into our point-of-sale system. This is leading to accelerated system adoption, allowing us to leverage third-party aggregators to augment our own delivery drivers. Another action item we're taking is expanding customer access to the Pizza Hut brand via aggregator marketplace. We are excited about the potential incremental growth from aggregator marketplaces based on outperformance we're seeing from existing franchisees using this channel. Lastly, at The Habit Burger Grill, first quarter system sales grew 17%, driven by 13% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth. To streamline restaurant operations for team members this quarter, we promoted operationally easy to execute customer favorites such as our Patty Melt and the Santa Barbara Charburger. We continued to lean into digital-only promotions and saw a strong response to our delivery and app-only campaigns in the quarter that ultimately drove an increase in app downloads and active app users. Even as consumer mobility improved in the first quarter, our digital sales across multiple channels increased sequentially, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of these ordering options. Moving on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. We kicked off the celebration of our 25th year as a publicly traded company with several powerful forums that galvanized our top talent around engagement and development. For the first time in five years, we brought our top 250 leaders from around the world together for our Global Leadership Summit. Our technology leaders at the summit made up the largest functional group which speaks to the investments we've made in differentiated technology capabilities and growth-oriented functions. We also showcased the progress our brands have made putting our Recipe for Good priorities at the center of our future growth, not only with less carbon and less packaging and waste but also by making equity and inclusion come alive across every aspect of our business, from our talent to our brand marketing to our suppliers and franchisees. Additionally, we were proud to take many of our aspiring leaders to the Women's Foodservice Forum, where our Chief Operating Officer and Chief People Office, Tracy Skeans, serves as chair. It was wonderful to see Yum! so prominently represented in a forum dedicated to growing women in our industry, something truly important to us as we're increasing the number of women in senior leadership globally and are on track to achieve gender parity in leadership by 2025. Finally, a group of our diverse leaders gathered in Washington, D.C. to discuss how we inspire and advance equity, inclusion and belonging across all levels of our organization. When it comes to our Recipe for Good, we invest in critical work that's focused on our three priority areas of people, food and planet. Just last month and as part of our larger climate strategy, Yum! joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition global consortium which was created to accelerate climate action throughout supply chain. Our climate work has started to take shape in markets such as KFC U.K., where they have partnered with the University of Liverpool to develop a road map to achieve net zero carbon and zero waste. To wrap up, this continues to be an incredibly challenging operating environment but my confidence in our future remains high given the resilience of our iconic brands across our global diversified portfolio. Our unmatched global scale provides us unique competitive advantages, including our sophisticated supply chains with cross-brand purchasing power, strong marketing and consumer insights, expanding digital and technology capabilities and our capable, committed and well-capitalized franchisees that are willing to invest in the long-term growth of the business. This quarter's results continue to demonstrate the power and sustainability of our business model while we continue to deliver lasting value for our stakeholders for years to come. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position. I'll start by discussing our financial results. Our first quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 6% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth, reflecting our continued global momentum. During the quarter, we opened 997 gross units, a Q1 record for Yum!. Core operating profit decreased 5% for the quarter, including a negative impact from Russia of 1%. Ex special, general and administrative expenses were $252 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022 and a return to our normal quarterly cadence. Despite inflationary headwinds, we maintained company-owned restaurant margins of approximately 22% at Taco Bell, in line with Q1 2019 pre-COVID margins. Finally, EPS excluding special items was $1.05, representing a 1% decrease year-over-year. Next, I'll address the impact to our first quarter results from the Russia conflict in Ukraine. We previously announced the suspension of all investments and restaurant development efforts in Russia as well as operations of company-owned KFC restaurants and that we are finalizing an agreement with our Pizza Hut master franchisee to suspend all restaurant operations in that brand. In addition to these actions, we pledged to redirect profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian aid. Our core operating profits in Russia declined versus the first quarter of last year, negatively impacting our Yum! core operating profit growth by 1 percentage point. Finally, as David previously shared, we have begun a process aimed at transferring ownership to local operators. We will plan to provide additional updates on the process on our next earnings call. Given the rapidly evolving operating environment, we wanted to provide our latest thoughts on full year results and the shape of the year. We remain confident in the strength of our business and our ability to achieve our long-term growth algorithm in future years. In 2022, the underlying momentum of the business gives us confidence that we can still deliver on the same-store sales, unit growth and system sales aspects of our long-term growth algorithm. Were it not for the loss of Russia profits, we would deliver on all elements of our long-term growth algorithm in 2022. However, losing 3% of full year core operating profit from the exclusion of Russia profits puts us outside of our high single-digit core operating profit range this year, with our current forecast closer to mid-single-digit core operating profit growth. With strength in many key markets, continued emerging market recovery and strong development momentum, our teams will continue to strive to overdeliver against our current forecast. We'll keep you updated as the year progresses. As a reminder, given the shape of our anticipated G&A spend in 2022 in comparison to 2021, we expect our G&A expense to remain a headwind to Q2 core operating profit growth and a tailwind to second half core operating profit growth. Additionally, we expect continued softness in China and a full quarter impact from the exclusion of Russia profits. Therefore, we now expect Q2 core operating profit trends to be similar to Q1 and we remain on track with our prior expectations for high-teens core operating profit growth in the second half of the year. While our system sales and operating profit results shared during today's call excluded the impact of foreign currency, we wanted to provide a brief update on the impact in the quarter and the anticipated impact on both our second quarter and full year results. For Q1, our reported operating profit was unfavorably impacted by $14 million due to foreign currency translation. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to reduce second quarter reported operating profit by approximately $12 million to $14 million and reflect a headwind to full year reported operating profit of approximately $30 million to $45 million. This is directional guidance as rates will likely change as we move through the year. Moving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. I'm excited to share that we had another quarter with each of our brands reporting strong positive unit growth. During the quarter, we opened 997 gross units, resulting in 628 net new units, a Q1 development record for Yum!, contributing to 6% unit growth over the last 12 months. We wouldn't be able to achieve these record-breaking results without broad-based contributions from multiple markets across each of our brands. In fact, we had over 500 gross units and 261 net new units opened outside of China, contributing to 5% unit growth in the rest of world year-over-year. Both KFC Division and Pizza Hut International delivered another exceptional development quarter with 587 and 283 gross units opened, respectively. While Yum China continues to be our lead developer, there were significant contributions from each of these brands in India, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Taco Bell remains on track for another record development year with growth in next-gen assets in the U.S. and additional markets reaching scale internationally. On that front, we're excited to share that Yum China has committed to expanding the Taco Bell brand which will allow even more people to live mass as we build our brand identity globally and grow our footprint in that market. To that end, we now expect to have three more markets to cross the critically important scale threshold of 100 units by the end of 2022, joining Spain which reached that milestone in 2021. The global development landscape is increasingly complex. But the sophistication, scale and capabilities of our teams and franchisees provide competitive advantages that allowed us to deliver yet another quarter of record unit openings. The visibility into our development pipeline remains strong. Now, I'll discuss our Unmatched Operating Capability and the three key elements we're leaning into : Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. Before I provide an update across our Easy pillars, I want to comment briefly on our global supply chain. Our supply chain teams continued doing an amazing job building supply chain contingencies and acting as needed to secure product availability, including restaurant equipment which is necessary for new store openings. Additionally, I'm proud of how our sourcing teams are leveraging our scale and cross-brand purchasing power to help our franchisees and equity stores manage costs in this highly inflationary environment as an important lever in maintaining long-term profitability. This scale combined with our operating experience and learnings from exposure to over 155 markets around the world create a unique competitive advantage for us as we navigate these inflationary pressures. Starting with Easy Experiences. With continued reopening trends in markets around the globe, a frictionless experience remains front and center for the consumer. With that in mind, we are constantly adding new convenient ways for our customers to access our brands. KFC U.S. and The Habit Burger Grill have made digital ordering even easier. Customers can now order via the app and pick up their food from a specific cubby or shelf within the restaurant. This enables a quicker and more seamless experience that eliminates the need to wait in line at the counter or in the drive-thru. Quick Pick-up is fully deployed across the KFC U.S. system and roughly 1/3 Of the Habit stores currently have dedicated pickup shelves, with plans to expand more broadly in the coming months. In addition, Taco Bell U.S. recently launched a similar program in their equity stores and will continue to deploy it across their systems more broadly in the coming quarters. Both delivery and early tests of Quick Pick-up continue to free up drive-thru capacity for the Taco Bell system which helped fuel their ninth consecutive quarter of average drive-thru times under four minutes, with a sequential improvement from their fourth quarter drive-thru speed. Internationally, we have exciting projects in early stages, including our KFC Australia business which is piloting a drone delivery program that gets our finger-licking good products to our customers' home or office in less than 15 minutes on average from when it's ordered. Next, I'll move on to Easy Operations, in which we are focused on streamlining operations for our team members and franchisees. We are installing a new kitchen display system and smart hub and leveraging our cloud-based point-of-sale system in our Taco Bell locations with the goal of modernizing the employee experience and providing more digital capabilities within our restaurants. These systems separate out delivery orders from standard drive-thru orders, allowing for improved visibility and execution in the restaurant by our team members. At KFC U.S., we're improving back-of-house operations by expanding our Mobile Manager, a back-of-house suite of applications which simplifies ordering, inventory management and digital order fulfillment, enabling our team members to spend more time focusing on the customer experience. Pizza Hut continues to make progress putting technology in the hands of its team members through continued global expansion of Dragontail, HutBot and the 360 Coach platforms. Given the driver staffing challenges we're experiencing in the Pizza Hut U.S. business, we're piloting the Dragontail platform in over 100 of our U.S. stores to improve the efficiency of our delivery network. We're excited by the early results and the platform is working as we hoped given the outstanding performance we've seen in other markets around the world. We're in conversations with our franchisees to expand this cutting-edge platform across the U.S. system. Third, I'll discuss Easy Insights, in which we focus on using data and analytics to drive more effective marketing and leverage our insights to enhance the customer and team member experience. At Taco Bell U.S., we continue to experiment with new and innovative ways to engage with our consumers through LTO programs such as the Taco Lover's Pass which helped fuel growth in loyalty memberships during the quarter and which drove customer frequency. Kvantum continues to scale its media mix marketing tool which was recently used in several Pizza Hut International markets to drive incremental sales with a more efficient use of marketing spend. Additionally, we continue to build targeted artificial intelligence and machine learning-based tools, including an exciting new pricing tool that is being piloted in select international markets. Next, I'll provide an update on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $365 million excluding restricted cash. On April 1, we called our $600 million 7.75% YBI bonds due in 2025. The repayment was funded by the issuance of a new $1 billion 5.375% YBI bond due in 2032. We were especially pleased with the strong demand and execution in light of the rate environment and volatility in the financial markets. With the recent bond offering which closed subsequent to the quarter, our consolidated net leverage is roughly in line with our target of 5x. Our capital priorities remain unchanged : invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, during the quarter were $18 million. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $250 million for the full year, reflecting roughly $100 million in refranchising proceeds and up to $350 million of gross CapEx. With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares at an average share price of $121 per share, totaling approximately $407 million. In closing, I'm pleased with the results of the quarter. We opened a record number of units for the first quarter, driving impressive system sales growth. We remain committed to advancing our digital and technology capabilities, leading to enhancements in both the team member and customer experience. And I'm confident in our team's and franchisees' ability to win in a dynamic and complex global landscape. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the brands in the U.S., how they're positioned right now and I guess, really what you're seeing from the customer in recent months. Have behaviors changed at all? Anything that you would call out there? And I guess, most importantly, just kind of looking ahead. David, I think you spoke to the resiliency and how Taco Bell and some of the brands can navigate a tough consumer spending environment. So just wondering if you could speak a little bit more to that, please. David Gibbs : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Dennis. Just as far as the consumer, I would say that the U.S. demand is generally strong. But this is a really complex environment. I know a lot of people talked about the K-shaped recovery and bifurcated with higher income consumers in better shape than lower income. I think that's true but I think that's probably a little bit of an oversimplification. I don't know in my career if we've seen a more complex environment to analyze consumer behavior than what we're dealing with right now. From an economic standpoint, you've got inflation, rising wages. You've got the funkiness of the stimulus lap -- that we're lapping from last year. But you've also got all these societal issues, like mobility coming out of COVID, consumer reaction to war in Eastern Europe, working from home, changing consumer patterns. All of this makes for a pretty complex environment to figure out how to analyze it and market to consumers. And that's a great part about Yum!. We've got the scale and the talent to do that better than we think anybody else in the industry and navigate that complexity with our internal divisions like Collider, which is an expert on consumer behavior; Kvantum helping us figure out how to navigate the immediate landscape to market to those consumers; and all of our marketing and talent -- marketing talented leaders in the U.S. and around the world. So complex environment, but as usual, convenience and value matters in this environment. And we believe we're leaders across our brands in that regard. You're seeing that result really in all the brands in Q1 in the U.S. The challenge obviously at Pizza Hut was less of sales performance, it's simply just due to demand -- the demand is there but simply due to our ability to meet that demand with drivers. This has been documented by others. But generally, as you mentioned, resiliency is a key feature of our brands. And going forward, we actually feel really good about our ability to navigate this environment and continue to prosper. Operator : Our next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Chris, just inside your new mid-single-digit core operating profit ex -- with the impact of Russia, what are you assuming China does in that? I suspect that's another pivotal piece. What gives you confidence in that reacceleration in the back half? I understand comparisons are easier. And just when you look at that guidance, 6% unit growth is above that long-term reset target. Is that a realistic view for this year? Or was the first quarter just unusually good and that's not necessarily the right run rate? Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, John. On the profit side, we feel really good with the profit plan for the year. We laid out the shape on our last call. We said the first half was going to be roughly flat. Of course, we now have a Russia impact. I think, that was one point in Q1. And of course, if you think about the lost profit growth in Russia, that actually gets you closer to a couple of points. And as you mentioned, the China impact. As you heard on their call, the business there is softer than expected, so that's had a bit of an impact. And we expect that going into Q2 as well. But -- so Q2 is going to land about where Q1 is. But those are the two primary drivers. And of course, when we think about the full year, we still think Russia is the one driver that takes us off of our algorithm from a profit standpoint for the year. Of course, we're going to work hard to try to overdeliver against that plan. So in general, we feel really good about the profit plan with a little bit of noise there on those two factors. In terms of development, we feel great about the pipeline. Our Q1 was strong, but the pipeline looking to the rest of the year remains strong as well. And of course, it's our job every day to come in and find ways to overdeliver against that 4% to 5% unit guidance. Of course, keep in mind, we had 100 net new units from Russia last year. Even without the 100 net new units, we still feel good about delivering on that part of the algorithm. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Tower of Citi. Jon Tower : Just two real quick for me. Just going back to that unit growth piece specifically. Can you talk about perhaps how management incentives across the company may have been realigned in recent years to kind of focus more on this growth aspect of the business, the unit growth side, specifically across the brands? And then secondarily, drilling down specifically into Pizza Hut U.S. and the move to 3PD, using it as a sourcing and fulfillment platform. Can you comment on the decision to move that way specifically? Why do the fulfillment side using 3PD and potentially giving up that competitive advantage that the brand holds from a delivery standpoint? David Gibbs : Thanks, Jon. I'll take the first question. Chris will comment on Pizza Hut. As far as unit development, obviously, we're very proud of the progress that we've made. And yes, we have actually introduced some new incentives company-wide around development. We thought it was important to just unite ourselves and our franchise partners to take advantage of, frankly, an environment that's really favorable to us. Our brands have gotten stronger over the last two years in general. Our business model is stronger. And there are really great opportunities to expand our footprint in a lot of economies around the world where there have been some discounts to available real estate. And you're seeing all of that come together through the use of incentives with our team and with - in some cases, in franchise markets. And that's all leading to an increase in the pace of development that we're proud of. And as Chris mentioned, we have visibility into the pipeline and believe it will continue. Chris Turner : Yes. And on the second part around Pizza Hut U.S. and the shift to using third-party delivery, as David said earlier, we still see strong demand in the Pizza Hut U.S. business, but it's primarily a challenge of being able to fulfill it with the labor challenges around drivers in particular. That's the most pronounced challenge that we have from a labor perspective in the U.S. So that's part of the driver for continuing to shift to additional modes of being able to deliver. And we're doing that by adding in both delivery as a service, which is basically still having sales through our website and apps, but then fulfillment, leveraging those third-party drivers during peak periods when we need extra capacity to help us address some of those hiring challenges for drivers. But as we mentioned, we're also working with the aggregator partners on the marketplaces. And that's just part of our strategy for wanting to be ubiquitous, be everywhere that our company -- our customers want to do business with us. And we're seeing, in the early going on that, incremental growth from those channels. In fact, we've got one of our leading franchisees who has already moved on to those platforms and is running 4 points or so ahead of the system which is primarily driven by the incremental customers that they're finding on those platforms. And of course, the way we negotiate the economics in those deals, in the U.S., we really are indifferent in terms of where the sales fall. We ensure that our economics are roughly the same across channels. So we want to be there wherever our customers want to do business with us. Operator : Our next question is from David Palmer of Evercore. David Palmer : That was an interesting comment just right then. You said it was -- the franchisee was 4 points better than the average, so down low single digits as opposed to down 6%. Is that the type of thing you were seeing when they did that third-party collaboration? Chris Turner : Yes, yes, running 4 or 5 points ahead of the system. And the vast majority of that we attribute to the incremental customers that they're finding through the platform. David Palmer : And do you think that that's going to be -- the majority of the system will be doing something similar to that franchisee by the end of the year? And I guess I'm wondering if -- this is a little crystal ball-ish but do you think that the third-party delivery adoption will be fairly universal within the U.S.? And do you anticipate on top of that some sort of labor easing being a path forward here to flat to positive comps for the U.S.? Chris Turner : Well, in terms of the strategy to address these challenges, David Graves and Aaron Powell, who are doing a great job dealing with this very dynamic environment, those are a couple of key parts of their strategy for dealing with this. And we'll be implementing the delivery as a service, as we mentioned in the earlier comments, over the next two to three quarters. And then, of course, the franchisees each have a decision on how to work with aggregators but we do that under our umbrella agreement. And we expect that those kinds of gains continue to show up in the results. Obviously, I think more and more are going to be choosing to move in that direction. So the implementation will take a while but it's certainly part of the strategy for dealing with this really dynamic environment. David Palmer : And then, just one last question is do -- what is the sort of mix that you get? Like that franchisee, for example, what sort of mix do they get from third party when they get that type of improvement? And I'll pass it on. Chris Turner : It's still too early to tell. This is something that has just been implemented over the last few months, so still too early and still too limited a sample size, I think, to draw conclusions on a broad basis. But as we said, if you look at our business, there is this fulfillment challenge. Our carryout business was actually up in the quarter. So the primary challenge was on the delivery business. And so these strategies are directly pointed at that biggest root cause that's getting in the way of being able to serve and fulfill full customer demand. Operator : Our next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : I did want to revisit some of the comments on economics which is -- clearly, I mean, these brands have been around long enough in the U.S. and globally that, I guess, there are enough maybe previous experiences that we can maybe pick and choose from historically. So in environments where consumers' costs have risen faster than their incomes and obviously, there are so many costs that are rising for the consumer, where does the consumer or where might the consumer typically cut back? Is it in visitation? Or is it in ticket? And I guess this is kind of the first point. Secondly, if it is ticket, when you guys look back '22 versus '19, how much of that average ticket gain do you think was actually frothy, the consumer that maybe traded up or added on or larger sizes, what have you, to unsustainable levels versus how much average ticket do you think may naturally come out of the business as the consumers still use the QSR brands for all the obvious reasons but can just find back ways that you'd basically revert to the mean in terms of what they actually buy and how they use the various brands? David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. Obviously, the -- on the ticket, I think the biggest driver of the ticket increase over the last few years has actually been party size rather than premiumization, although they're both drivers. So as we see mobility return, individual meals return, that could bring down ticket without necessarily implying consumers are trying to cut back on cost per eater. But as far as the consumer and how's their behavior in this environment, some of the other things to think about are the fast casual category has grown a lot. We expect that if there's cutting back, that there'll be some trade down from fast casual back into QSR which will be favorable for us, particularly Taco Bell which I think is well positioned to capture some of those visits. But it all comes back to this theme of the QSR industry is built on convenience and value. Convenience and value win in any environment, particularly when you couple it with our great brands and innovative products that we're constantly introducing. And you saw Taco Bell's performance in Q1 in the U.S., plus 5%, one of the better numbers for the major QSR chains. And then you saw the growth that we're getting in Taco Bell internationally. So, I think we feel like we've got momentum and this environment is not going to get us off of it but we're going to have to do what we always do which is continue to pivot and evolve our offerings to meet consumers' needs. Talk about a great example, 70% of our U.S. profit, they've been leaning in on the Cravings Value Menu which is $1 and $2 price points. And that's working to meet the needs of consumers with less money to spend. But at the same time, they've been able to take price across the rest of the menu on their combos and more premium offerings and that's working as well. John Ivankoe : And if it's appropriate to comment, is there any near-term change just in the last month or two from consumers that are closest -- geographically closest to the crisis in Russia and Ukraine? Obviously thinking about some of the Central, Western or -- European markets in terms of how that consumer may have reacted due to some of these terrible events. David Gibbs : Yes. No, surprisingly, our business in Europe and you can see it from the numbers, is doing quite well. So we're not seeing -- to the point of your question, we're not seeing an impact on adjacent businesses. We're seeing the prevailing factor there is just sort of return to mobility in Europe and the recovery of our businesses that were suffering more at this time last year. Operator : Our next question is from David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : Chris, I wanted to come back to your profit guidance for the year. And I think you mentioned multiple times that you're working hard to overdeliver versus that plan. And I wondered if you could just elaborate on what factors that you see could drive upside to the plan. If you were to see upside, where would it come from in your view? And then secondly, I guess, to balance the discussion, where do you see the greatest risk to the current plan? Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, David. As with all elements of our algorithm, we're always working to find ways to overdeliver. We called out the one primary driver which, on profit, creates a headwind this year which -- going into Q2, Q3, Q4, we're going to lose 3 points of operating profit plus the planned growth in Russia as we exclude those from the results and direct any profits from Russia towards humanitarian efforts. So that's the big headwind, of course. In the early going, as we said, this China softness is probably a little bigger than expected. I don't know the long-term trajectory there. You would think at some point in the long term, China will rebound and that business should see growth. But I'm sure the timing on that is uncertain. If you think about other puts and takes, I think emerging market strength. If you look at our 18% same-store sales growth in emerging markets, that's a great sign of recovery and a big important part of our business. So that's a place where you might see upside. Of course, on the flip side, we'll continue to navigate the really dynamic environment around inflation, pricing and how those are playing out in each of our markets around the globe. Right now, we think we're dealing with those incredibly well. Our scale gives us advantage and gives our franchisees advantage in dealing with those. But -- a very dynamic environment but we feel really good about the overall profit engine of the business. Operator : Our final question this morning is from Brian Mullan of Deutsche Bank. Brian Mullan : Just kind of a big picture question but do you see any potential one day for a cross-brand loyalty program at Yum!? Is that something that you think could potentially work in the quick service restaurant industry in the U.S.? Or conversely, are there some reasons why that wouldn't work or wouldn't be a good idea maybe from a consumer perspective or a franchisee perspective? Chris Turner : Yes. So Brian, good question. Loyalty is becoming an increasingly important part of our business, increasingly important part of our digital experience that we provide to customers. More than half of our restaurants around the globe are part of a loyalty program. Taco Bell in the U.S. is a great example of how we're driving excitement through loyalty. That's what we did with the Taco Lover's Pass. And that helps to drive app downloads and people signing up into the program and we continue to see significant growth in membership in that program. Pizza Hut obviously in the U.S. has a large and very impactful loyalty program. And KFC has great loyalty programs in a number of markets around the globe. So we're going to continue to focus on that, implementing it in markets where it makes sense. Interesting question. Obviously, we thought about it in terms of cross-brand loyalty. Right now, we're focused on maximizing the value of our brand-focused loyalty programs. But obviously, as our data and analytics capabilities continue to evolve, all sorts of possibilities are out there in the future. But for the time being, we'll remain focused on brand-specific loyalty programs. David Gibbs : So thank you, everybody. I appreciate your time. Just to wrap up, it was another strong quarter obviously with good top line sales growth, all brands growing. The development numbers, obviously, we continue to set records which we're very proud of. And that's widespread, right? All of our brands grew at least 5% on a net new unit basis in the quarter. Another digital sales record which we keep saying on every call and we just keep on delivering on. And then this time, we passed that important milestone of 40% digital mix. And I just think, in total, the quarter represents our brands all around the world are healthy and can perform in any environment. This is certainly one of the most challenging ones we've ever had to deal with, proving the resiliency of our business model. Thank you for your time. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, everyone and welcome to the Yum! Brands 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Seb and I will be the operator for your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the floor over to Jodi Dyer, VP, Investor Relations. Jodi Dyer : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we will open the call to questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC that by disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that maybe used on today\u2019s call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that during today\u2019s call, all system sales and operating profit results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Next, I will provide an update on the financial reporting treatment related to the exit of our Russia business. During the second quarter, we completed the transfer of the Pizza Hut business to a local operator who had initiated the process of rebranding to a non-Yum! concept. Given the transfer for Pizza Hut and our progress for the full exit from Russia for KFC, we have elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. Specifically, 1,165 units in Russia and their associated system sales were removed from our total unit count and total system sales respectively as of the beginning of the second quarter. This negatively impacted our reported second quarter unit growth by 2 percentage points and our reported system sales growth, excluding foreign currency by 2 percentage points. Additionally, these units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus do not impact our same-store sales results for the second quarter. However, we continue to include Russia and GAAP measures in the second quarter for Pizza Hut prior to the date of transfer and for KFC for the entire second quarter, including royalty revenue and all expenses to support the business and one-time expenses related to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit the Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segment subsequent to the start of the conflict to our corporate and unallocated segment and reflected as a special item within the other income and expense warrant.

Brands Investor Day on Tuesday, December 13, 2022 at the New York Stock Exchange. Please stay tuned for more details. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Jodi and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results are a testament to the resilience of our iconic brands and the power of our highly franchised business in this complex operating environment. System sales grew 5% after adjusting for the exclusion of our Russia business, driven by sustained development momentum. We opened 781 gross new units in the quarter, with broad-based contributions from each of our brands. Additionally, we delivered positive same-store sales growth while lapping last year\u2019s growth of 23%, the strongest quarter of same-store sales growth in Yum!\u2019s history. We are pleased with the continued growth in our digital business with sales of nearly $6 billion fueled by the adoption of our global platforms and capabilities. Our unmatched global scale and digital capabilities are key differentiators in the restaurant industry and these competitive advantages enable us to thrive in any environment. I will now share a few global trends from the quarter. As Yum! China shared on its earnings call last week, COVID-related restrictions continued throughout the quarter, significantly impacting second quarter results. However, trends outside of China, remains strong. Our consolidated same-store sales, excluding China grew 6% for the quarter. Despite a complex consumer landscape in the U.S., Taco Bell U.S. knocked it out of the park with 8% same-store sales growth. The team achieved these results through exceptional execution of a well-balanced marketing agenda that sustained brand buzz, distinctive product news and compelling value offerings and that was all supported by operational improvements and a focus on elevating the digital experience. Additionally, emerging markets, excluding China, continued to recover to pre-COVID levels, driven by the reopening of dining rooms and growth in our digital business. In fact, same-store sales growth for emerging markets, excluding China, was up 22%, a 4 point acceleration from the prior quarter. We remain confident that we are well positioned to win in this environment given our iconic brands that customers love, strong consumer value proposition, scale advantages, expanded digital access and sophisticated franchise partners with unmatched operating capability. Before I provide an update on our growth drivers, I\u2019d like to share an update on our ongoing process to exit Russia. Last month, we shared that we completed the transfer of ownership of our Pizza Hut business in Russia to a local operator who has initiated the process of rebranding locations to a non-Yum! concept. As for our KFC restaurants in Russia, we are in advanced stages of transferring ownership, operating systems and master franchise rights, including the network of franchise restaurants to a local operator who will be responsible for rebranding locations to a non-Yum! concept. Upon the completion of this process, we will have fully exited from Russia. Our franchisees and team members in Ukraine continue to demonstrate incredible fortitude through this conflict. And I am proud to report that nearly all of our stores in Ukraine have reopened to serve the people of Ukraine, while ensuring the safety of our team members. Now, I will talk about two of our growth drivers, our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short and Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I will provide an update on our Recipe for Good. Chris will share the details of our second quarter financial results, including an update on our capital strategy before providing an update on our unmatched operating capabilities and bold restaurant development growth driver. Let me begin with our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands. Our KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our operating profit, grew system sales 1% this quarter, driven by 3% unit growth and a 1% decline in same-store sales. Adjusting last year for the exclusion of Russia, KFC division system sales growth was 4%, with 7% unit growth. Continued sales weakness in China contributed to significant year-over-year pressure in the quarter. Excluding China, our same-store sales grew 7%. So China remains difficult to forecast, pressures gradually improved throughout the quarter. However, as Yum! China said last week, given the recurrence of COVID outbreaks, the sales recovery will likely be non-linear and uneven. It\u2019s been well noted that many developed markets experienced increasing macro pressures and headwinds to consumer spending this quarter. In addition, the U.S. and UK markets faced tough compares due to government stimulus last year. While KFC U.S. faced difficult laps from stimulus and the successful launch of the chicken sandwich platform, we are pleased to share that same-store sales growth improved sequentially throughout the quarter. However, the macro pressures were not felt consistently across all developed markets in our portfolio. For example, Australia grew system sales 7% as same-store sales growth doubled from the prior quarter. This strong demand has followed the introduction of modern menu, which highlights our uniquely craveable products and contemporary value offerings. Turning to our emerging markets, which delivered remarkable results in the quarter. I\u2019d like to highlight India, the Middle East and Latin America. In India, where system sales grew 103%, the team continued to advance their digital ecosystem and provide consumers with disruptive value offering. System sales grew 41% in the Middle East driven by accelerating digital sales that grew approximately 70% year-over-year even as dine-in sales continued to recover. The launch of Click & Collect functionalities, including QR code ordering via the KFC app in several of our Middle East markets helped drive these results. The Latin America market achieved 32% system sales growth, propelled by a well-balanced marketing strategy, including a focus on product innovation and dedication to value offerings, while advancing digital capabilities following the launch of the KFC mobile app and kiosks. Our diverse global portfolio is one of the many reasons we have great confidence we are well positioned in the current environment. Turning to our Taco Bell division, which accounts for 36% of our operating profit, system sales grew 10%, driven by 4% unit growth and 8% same-store sales growth. Taco Bell continues to fire on all cylinders as evidenced by the broad-based strength of its second quarter results. For Taco Bell U.S., system sales grew 9%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. Taco Bell remains a culture leader in the industry successfully executing on its strategy to inspire and enable the world to live mass through innovative marketing campaigns, buzz-worthy brand news, distinctive products and strong value offering. Despite significant inflation, Taco Bell maintained restaurant margins by leveraging its pricing power for premium products and craveable LTOs, while still providing consumers with everyday value through a broad range of price points such as those items featured on the Cravings Value Menu. The return of the Mexican pizza as an LTO this quarter is a prime demonstration of these strengths. Taco Bell\u2019s most loyal fans were granted early access, increasing the average loyalty registrations 15x during the 2 days of early access and fueling 10% growth in loyalty members in the quarter. Demand for the Mexican pizza was 7x previous levels, reaching over 20 million pizzas sold nationwide, with some stores selling out within a week, creating a sustained positive halo for the brand. Given the overwhelmingly positive reaction from our customers, we are excited to bring back the Mexican pizza in the fall when it will become a permanent fixture on the venue. At Taco Bell International, system sales grew 31%, owing to 27% unit growth and 9% same-store sales growth. 5 of our 7 European markets saw double-digit same-store sales growth, thanks to the balanced execution of everyday value and disruptive value, while also continuing to grow brand awareness. Taco Bell International is building on its development momentum and now meaningfully contributes to the division\u2019s total unit growth. Moving on to the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 15% of our operating profit. Q2 system sales were flat, driven by 4% unit growth and a 3% same-store sales decline. At Pizza Hut International, which represents 8% of our operating profit, system sales grew 3%, led by 7% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. As I mentioned before, COVID lockdowns in China led to sales softness in the quarter. Excluding China, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 6%. I\u2019d like to highlight two of our leading markets for the quarter, India and Latin America. India system sales grew 79%, a 35 point acceleration from the prior quarter, driven by further recovery in dine-in sales and home meal replacement strength. System sales grew 18% in the Middle East, where the team has successfully executed a balanced strategy of offering everyday value and customized products, with particular success from the MyBox offering. MyBox offers a compelling entry price point that is well positioned to serve the individual eater and lunch occasion and is now live in nearly 50 markets. At Pizza Hut U.S., which represents 7% of our operating profit, system sales declined 3%, driven by flat unit growth and a 4% decline in same-store sales driven in large part by continued operational challenges in our delivery business. We made progress expanding system-wide adoption of third-party delivery as a service to help address our delivery driver capacity constraints to meet consumer demand. As of the end of Q2, approximately 55% of our U.S. locations have implemented delivery as a service, up from 40% at the beginning of the quarter. Additionally, we are leaning into our aggregator partnerships by joining third-party marketplaces so our consumers can access our craveable food wherever they shop. As of the end of Q2, roughly 70% of eligible stores have opted into using at least one aggregator marketplace, up from approximately 45% at the beginning of Q2. Finally, the team shifted promotional focus towards compelling value to address the needs of the consumer. Lastly, the Habit Burger Grill grew system sales 10%, driven by 15% unit growth and 4% same-store sales decline. During National Burger month, Habit provided exclusive offers through its mobile app, resulting in a 10% increase in mobile app installed, while also highlighting its culinary inspired innovation, which included the spicy green beans a spicy twist on its signature, Tempura Batter green beans. Moving on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. We continued to see growth of our unrivaled talent with Tarun Lal being named President of KFC U.S. and Shannon Hennessy taking on a new role as President of the Habit Burger Grill. Tarun is a prime example of growth from within joining our organization 25 years ago and serving in various leadership positions. He is not only a best-in-class operator known for driving breakthrough results. He is also a driver of our culture. I am confident Tarun\u2019s leadership and winning partnership mindset with our franchisees will be an asset as we drive the next chapter of growth for the KFC U.S. business. Shannon joined Yum! a few years ago as a KFC Global CFO and immediately hit the ground running. She has a unique ability to work across functions and bring people together and solve problems, drive change and deliver meaningful results for our business. She is also a standout culture leader with a commitment to growing talent and to advancing equity inclusion and belonging. When it comes to our recipe for good, we recently published our Annual Global Citizenship and Sustainability Report, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments, including our social purpose and how we have awarded more than $50 million in grants to nearly 30 social impact programs globally. This is accomplished through Yum!\u2019s unlocking opportunity initiative, the Champions equity and inclusion, education and entrepreneurship for frontline restaurant teams and communities around the world. It reinforces our industry leading commitment to food safety as well as our efforts to respond to customers\u2019 evolving preferences and improve the nutritional value of our menu items. Finally, the report also highlights our environmental commitments, including our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 as well as a newly harmonized packaging policy across our brands that commits to moving all consumer-facing plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. To wrap up, our performance continues to demonstrate the power of our unmatched global scale in a challenging operating environment, thanks to the advantages of our unrivaled talent, global development capabilities and expanding technology platforms and capabilities, our iconic brands continue to drive consistent growth. Our best-in-class teams and franchise partners are committed to serving up the most loved, trusted and fastest growing restaurant brands in the world. With that Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers and our capital strategy. I will begin with an overview of our second quarter financial results. Adjusting last year for the exclusion of Russia in our reported results, system sales grew 5%, underpinned by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Despite more severe inflation this quarter, our teams achieved strong performance demonstrating the resilience of Yum!\u2019s business model. As you may recall, we shared during our last earnings call that Q2 core operating profit growth would look similar to Q1, given continued softness in China, a full quarter impact from lost Russia profits and a headwind from normalized G&A spend in comparison to 2021. I am pleased to report that we exceeded our previous guidance with core operating profit down 1% for the quarter owing to outperformance at the Taco Bell division. Ex special general and administrative expenses were $252 million tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022, consistent with our previous guidance. Despite double-digit labor and commodity inflation in the U.S., Taco Bell, company-owned restaurant margins of 26% were in line year-over-year and 200 basis points ahead of the pre-COVID Q2 2019 margins. This is a testament to the brand\u2019s pricing power and the operational efficiencies the team continues to achieve both contributing to best-in-class unit economics. The FX impact to reported operating profit was $23 million, nearly double our expectations shared on our first quarter earnings call. We now expect the full year FX headwind to reported operating profit to be approximately $70 million to $90 million and expect similar amounts in Q3 and Q4 as those reported in Q2. Finally, EPS, excluding special items, was $1.05, a 9% decrease year-over-year. However, there was a $0.13 impact to EPS driven by items that are non-operating in nature including higher foreign currency exchange, an increase in our effective tax rate and a decrease in the value of our investment in Devyani International Limited. I\u2019m pleased to report that given the strength across our diversified portfolio, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 guidance that we shared on our first quarter earnings call. As a reminder, other than core operating profit growth due to the removal of Russia profits, we expect to deliver on all parts of the long-term growth algorithm this year. With this impact, we anticipate full year core operating profit growth of mid-single digits. And as we previously mentioned, that profit growth is weighted to the second half of the year, especially the fourth quarter, largely owing to timing of G&A expense in comparison to 2021. Next, I\u2019ll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities through the lens of our digital strategy, easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights. First, I\u2019ll provide an update on our efforts to create easy experiences for our customers. This quarter, Taco Bell franchisee, Border Foods, owned and operated by the Engler family, opened one of the most revolutionary restaurant formats in the industry\u2019s history, Taco Bell Defy. Taco Bell Defy features one of the most innovative drive-thru experiences yet. It\u2019s the first of its coming two-story restaurant design, featuring a proprietary vertical list to transport iconic, craveable Taco Bell menu items straight from the kitchen to pans. This is on top of unique digital check-in screens for mobile orders that enable a differentiated, fun and seamless experience for consumers. Taco Bell Defy boast many features that could show up in future Taco Bell restaurants given it is a hit with consumers and performing well. At KFC Africa, the team doubled kiosk penetration in its store footprint with significant commitments to further deploy across the majority of the system by year-end. Kiosks served to modernize our assets, improve customer experience and drive greater insights into customer behavior. Additionally, we continue to deploy chat and e-commerce products across our global portfolio and surpassed 2,400 stores in 43 markets this quarter, serving KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Earlier in the year, Pizza Hut Germany launched its new e-commerce website fully powered by Tictuk. Germany has seen impressive early results, including a 15% increase in conversion rate and a \u20ac2 increase in average ticket when compared to previous performance on aggregator platforms in the market. We are seeing similar success stories across the markets where it Tictuk is live. Next, I\u2019ll provide an update on our efforts to enhance the team member experience as part of our easy operations initiative. Pizza Hut International reached 25 markets using the Dragontail system, bringing global adoption of this platform to 28 markets across both KFC and Pizza Hut brands. We also made significant progress during the quarter in the rollout of digital order pickup shelves, including adding shelves at 100 more Habit Burger Grill stores. Approximately two-thirds of our Habit Burger Grill stores are now equipped with pickup shelves. Taco Bell also has joined our other brands in the U.S. to deploy pickup shelves which are now fully deployed across company-operated stores with plans to roll out across the rest of the system by early 2023. Expanding options and ease for off-premise consumption improves the customer, delivery driver and team member experience. Finally, I\u2019ll discuss our efforts around easy insights. Our data and analytics experts, along with Quantum, the AI-based marketing analytics team we acquired last year, continue to scale a Quantum media optimization tool, while also developing additional AI and machine learning products that drive performance for Yum! and our franchisees. As an example, they are currently partnering with Taco Bell and KFC U.S. to test and deploy an inventory management tool that helps our restaurant managers more accurately forecast food and supplies. The tool is driven by our cutting-edge demand forecasting platform. Based on encouraging early results, we plan to scale this platform throughout the remainder of the year. Moving on to our bold restaurant development growth driver, we sustained our robust development momentum this quarter. At KFC, we opened over 400 gross new units, reaching nearly 1,000 gross new units opened year-to-date. China, India and the Middle East led development this quarter, each opening more than 40 gross new units. It\u2019s worth noting that the year-to-date development pace is attributable to a broad contribution from our emerging markets outside of China. At Pizza Hut, we opened nearly 300 gross new units leading to over 600 gross new units opened year-to-date. The Pizza Hut division remains on pace to set another development record this year with significant contributions from India, China and Indonesia. For the third consecutive quarter, Taco Bell International Development outpaced Taco Bell U.S. development, opening 46 net new restaurants in Q2 and 67% year-to-date. For the first time, full year Taco Bell International development is on pace to surpass U.S. development this year. Our broad-based development continues to be driven by healthy unit economics, significant white space and our world-class franchise partners who are committed to growth. This global development momentum, coupled with the visibility we have into our development pipeline, gives us line of sight to deliver unit growth within our long-term growth algorithm range of 4% to 5%. Next, I\u2019ll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our capital priorities remain unchanged : invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $412 million, excluding restricted cash. On April 1, we closed on a new $1 billion 5.375% YBI bond due in 2032. The majority of the proceeds were used to call our $600 million, 7.75% YBI bond due in 2025. We closed the quarter in line with our net leverage target of 5x. We have a well-positioned capital structure and debt guideline for a high inflation environment, considering approximately 94% of our debt is fixed with no significant maturities for the next 3 years. Capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds were $38 million. Our full year expectation for $250 million in net capital expenditures remains unchanged, now reflecting $65 million in refranchising proceeds and up to $315 million in gross CapEx. With respect to our share buy program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average share price of $118 per share, totaling approximately $150 million. In closing, I\u2019m pleased with the resilience of our performance in the quarter. The structural advantages of our business model and our unmatched scale uniquely positioned us to navigate complex and uncertain macro environments with incredible stability. I remain confident that our global portfolio provides investors a high-quality, best growth opportunity with visibility into consistent compounding returns. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : Our first question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. David, please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. My question, David, is about just the overall macro environment you\u2019re seeing? And I know there is a lot of talk about pressures on consumer spending and potentially a global recession. And my question for you is, one, if you could share your thoughts on where we stand relative to that debate. And then any insights on how you\u2019re planning the business now versus maybe you were at the start of the year in light of some of those pressures? David Gibbs : Sure. Thank you, David. I commented on the last earnings call, and I think it remains true today. This is truly one of the most complex environments we\u2019ve ever seen in our industry to operate in because we\u2019re not just dealing with economic issues like inflation and lapping stimulus and things like that, but also the social issues of people returning to mobility, they have to lock down, working from home and just the change in consumer patterns just to mention a few. So against that incredibly complex backdrop, I think these issues play out differently in each market. So it\u2019s very hard to talk about generalities with the consumer. But one generality we\u2019re seeing internationally is really the emerging market consumer is returning. We mentioned the 22% increase ex China in our emerging markets. Obviously, that\u2019s a flip from early in the pandemic when those markets were hit hard. We like that tailwind in our business, and I think that that\u2019s going to help lift us as we go and developed markets are fairly stable on overall performance as well. But in terms of the global consumer, we do think they are getting more cautious. We are leaning more in on value offerings all around the world and that also is playing out in the United States. If you look at the U.S., I think what\u2019s happened over the last quarter is this the low-income consumer pulling back has become more pronounced. We\u2019ve seen that in our business and we\u2019re reacting accordingly. So we know the formula to win in any environment for us is to have a lot of brand buzz, to have product news and to have great value. You got to \u2013 you can\u2019t pick one of those things, you got to deliver on all three. So when you ask how we\u2019re planning, that\u2019s how we\u2019re planning and making sure in particular that we have the value offerings. Taco Bell is a great example of it this quarter when they obviously had a great brand buzz with the Mexican Pizza LTO, and that was also a great product news. But not to be left behind you, they did a great job on value with the cravings menu and the $2 Burrito offerings. All of that added up to a blowout quarter for Taco Bell, obviously. And we think we can win and thrive in any environment. So the changes in consumer behavior are really going to get us off our game. If we stick to our formula, we know we can win. Jodi Dyer : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a bit about some of the technology that you mentioned and specifically having some of these systems in other markets. Could you just talk about the value of having global platforms? Is it that you can leverage some of the development costs or are there other operational benefits? And then specifically to Dragontail, is this something that can help you partner with third-party aggregators to help solve some of the delivery bottlenecks that you have in terms of allocating orders between in-house delivery and aggregators. So, just a little more color on that and the labor shortage? Thank you. Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, Sara. Our digital strategy continues to work. We like just about everything about those nearly $6 billion in digital sales. And we continue to progress, the nearly $6 billion even came after removing the Russia sales. Russia had a strong digital market. So it gives you a sense that our digital business continues to thrive. The 40% digital mix tells you that the customers are seeing the value and the easy experiences that we\u2019re providing. So even as they are starting to come back to the dining rooms more and more, they are continuing to interact with us in a digital manner. And then you touched on the operational benefits, which is really part of our easy operations plan in our digital strategy and how technologies like Dragontail are helping us to operate better. Dragontail, we mentioned continues to expand. Our franchisees continue to adopt Dragontail in a number of markets. We are now up to 28 markets north of 3,300 stores that employ Dragontail. Whenever we implement, we see a significant improvement in customer experience. And you hit on the exact \u2013 one of the exact places where we see that benefit is coordinating those delivery orders and ensuring that we have a fresh product coming right on the oven or the prior because we are now in three KFC markets right at the time when the delivery driver gets to the restaurant. That\u2019s what helps us to get a fresher hotter product to the customer. So, there are other benefits of Dragontail as well. You see that it helps to communicate the team members in the back of house when we are reaching a peak period in the restaurant, for example, and they can move into different operating modes to respond to that. We have been doing lots of piloting in additional markets including here in the U.S., and we are going to continue to push Dragontail. Of course, that also speaks to the fact that our franchisees see the value in it. They only implement this when they see the value of working in their stores and in their restaurants. So, we continue to be very confident in our digital strategy and continue to invest, but believe we are getting a high return on that investment. Jodi Dyer : Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Phenomenal quarter from Taco Bell. I wanted to ask about Pizza Hut and KFC in the U.S. That quarter probably would be peak for family meal demand comparisons and stimulus comparisons. And I would also guess that the food costs would be peaking in that quarter as well, and making it \u2013 correct me if I am wrong, but I just wondered, you made some commentary about how the quarter progressed for those brands, but I wanted to get your \u2013 maybe you could add some more detail about the outlook for those domestic brands, both in sales and also franchisee cash flow. Thanks. David Gibbs : Thanks David. Yes, obviously, we had a difficult lap in the U.S. in Q2 basically lapping stimulus. KFC was also lapping the launch of the chicken sandwich. I think we did comment in the prepared remarks that the cadence during the quarter for KFC got better as the quarter evolved. And then at the end of the quarter, they launched Mac & Cheese Bowls to more directly address the value issue I talked about earlier. Same thing with Pizza Hut as the quarter went on. They introduced a $6.99 deal. Both of those have launched well. And look, it\u2019s hard to predict anything, but I tend to agree with your statement that we are probably pass peak inflation and obviously, the lap that we had in the quarter was one of the most difficult we have ever had at Yum!. We were lapping a plus 23% on a global basis. So, the fact that we came out of that quarter with positive sales was really encouraging. Jodi Dyer : Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. David, excluding Yum!\u2019s exit from Russia, it was another robust quarter for global development 6% and as you sit here today with long-term annual guidance for 4% to 5% development and speaking to the broad-based strength and diversity of historic development, do you need to see to help raise more guidance? David Gibbs : Look, appreciate \u2013 I think the development piece, we have been talking about a lot. And obviously, we just continue to put up great numbers on the development front. One of the things I am really encouraged about in the quarter and really for the year is, first of all, we are up year-over-year on net new unit openings for the first half of the year. We are also up in terms of the mix of where those openings are coming from with more development coming from outside of China, which has historically, obviously been our biggest developer. So, the development is becoming more widespread, to answer your question about what do we need to see to think about raising guidance. We want to see a continuation of that trend, continuation of building the pipeline for future years. But certainly, development, a real highlight of the quarter, it was widespread in terms of a number of countries. And we are also seeing the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell start to play a bigger role in our development formula as well as have it down the road. So, we think we are going to have even more diversity in our development as we move forward. We are obviously cautious in this environment though as we have learned over the last 2.5 years in terms of what it means for our business. So, at the appropriate time, we will relook at our guidance. Obviously, the other impressive thing for the quarter is not only did we lose the Russia units that are in our unit count, but we also lost the planned development for Russia, which I don\u2019t think people think about. We were supposed to open over 100 units this quarter. But yet, we are still sticking with being able to hit our range and being inside of hitting the range of 4% to 5% unit growth despite all of those enormous headwinds. Jodi Dyer : Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. On Taco Bell, if you are willing, can you talk about either the benefit to comps from the Mexican pizza or the percent mix or something so we can get a sense of how that contributed to the sales? And how do you think about sustainability once that promotions ended. Maybe you can talk about day-parts. Have you seen strength or weakness in certain day-parts and maybe if there has been a change in usage of the value menu, maybe you are getting a benefit from trade down to those value items, any other color just on how we think about sustainability of Taco Bell beyond this quarter? David Gibbs : Sure. Thanks John. I mentioned this earlier, but really, the benefit of things like the Mexican pizza is the connection it has with consumers the love they have for the product and the halo it provides to the brand. It\u2019s just as much about the buzz that, that creates and the relevance it creates for our brand as it is about the discrete amount of sales that we had during the weaker or that we have the product in store. And I think that is really our formula. We have got to be the most relevant brands in the industry and connecting with consumers the way Taco Bell has done in Q2. And you can see the results when that happens. So, to answer your question, it really wasn\u2019t about the exact sales during that period of time, contributing to the quarter as much as it was just how relevant and connected to pop culture and our consumers Taco Bell is the way they brought the mix compete back, the way they marketed it. But certainly, there is a love for the product, and we know when we introduced it in the fall that we will get actual discrete sales benefit that might translate into a couple of points of sales. Jodi Dyer : Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Tower at Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Hey, great. Thanks. I just had a question on the expansion in the 3PD with \u2013 you have had U.S., I am curious obviously, the number of restaurants opting in has moved up quarter-over-quarter. Just curious if you can give us some sort of insights as to how that\u2019s performing for the brand with respect to contribution from a same-store sales standpoint or even getting the message out there to consumers more broadly about the brand\u2019s value. And then separately, I believe that the company is pushing a \u2013 or the brand is pushing a $6.99 carryout promotion right now. Is that something that the company views it in LTO or more of a permanent fixture on the menu to address value? Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks Jon. I will take first, the expansion of the delivery partnerships. As we said in Q1, we saw a similar dynamic in Q2 where we believe we have got not as much of a demand problem. Demand remains strong. Our carryout business was up strongly, but we saw declines again in the delivery business. And so that\u2019s what we are focused on addressing it, the availability of drivers to deliver the product whenever a customer wants to order through that channel. We talked about last quarter, we were starting to implement changes. Some of those are internal where we are changing things like our hiring practices to make a faster hiring process because that\u2019s what folks who are in the market for driving jobs look for. But we also talked about how the partnerships with aggregators can help us as well. So, if you think about the 55% where we ended the quarter on delivery as a service, that was an expansion throughout the quarter. The 70% on marketplaces. That number represents 70% who were on at least one marketplace. We only have about 35% who are on multiple marketplaces. So, we still got further to go on implementing marketplaces across the business. But if we look at the franchisees who have been implemented both of those they are running mid-single digits ahead of those who haven\u2019t. So, we are continuing to see an impact here from reaching incremental customers and from giving us that delivery capacity that we need to serve that channel. On the $6.99 promotion, really what that reflects, going back to David\u2019s point on the state of the consumer in the U.S., we know we have got to have value options and more full range pricing on the menu. And this was a move by the team to give that value to the customers who needed it and to just give us a little bit more breadth and range on menu prices. So, we still have great craveable products that they can trade up to, but we also want to have value there for the customers who are looking for it. Jodi Dyer : Operator, we have time for one final question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger, UBS. Dennis, please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks very much. Just wondering if you could speak a bit more to the international business and perhaps at a high level, where do you think you are now from a recovery standpoint relative to thinking about some of the macro challenges out there, particularly in the emerging markets ex China? Thank you. David Gibbs : Yes. Obviously, we are excited about the growth in international and the future for our international business. In particular, Taco Bell, you saw they put up over 30% system sales growth. The development machine at Taco Bell is really hitting on all cylinders internationally. And we are proving that with focused effort, the right team against, Julie Masino and her team are doing an amazing job, the right franchise partners that we can get to scale that needs Taco Bell international markets, and they can be massive growth drivers for Yum!. We should get to the end of the year with over four markets at the 100-plus unit count, which that\u2019s what we know to be the tipping point for really accelerated growth down the road. But in general, international is really a tale of a lot of different stories. And you are seeing that best exemplified by \u2013 China is still in lockdown, and we are \u2013 it\u2019s hard to sell product when you have a lot of the market locked down. But as I have mentioned earlier, the exciting thing is that we have got \u2013 20% of our business is in emerging markets like China. That business is on fire. As we anticipated, it\u2019s recovering from COVID and lockdowns with increased mobility and new capabilities on the digital front that Chris talked about. And that\u2019s really driving our business there, and that should be a growth driver. And we should see the same thing play out in China down the road. All the while our developed markets remaining stable and growing and even coming off of tough laps as they were doing better in the previous years. So, I think it all sets up to be a nice growth driver for Yum! for many years to come. Yes. And so with that, I am going to just close the call, thanking everybody for their time. Obviously, reiterating it was a strong quarter despite all these well-documented headwinds. If there is ever a quarter to demonstrate how resilient Yum! is and our business model is stronger than ever, this is this. The same themes continued from previous quarters with digital and development, both being really strong and those teams are doing an amazing job. We have got this emerging market tailwind now that I just talked about. And then Taco Bell, one of the things we didn\u2019t mention is they grew sales. They delivered 26% margins, and they did it with essentially flat trend. So, all that pricing that they took, clearly still value for consumers, which bodes well for the future, up 20% versus pre-pandemic, up 20% at Taco Bell on a 3-year basis. So, when you got 26% margins and you are up 20%, you got a lot of happy franchisees and once again, amazing resilient business. This quarter demonstrates we can thrive in any environment. Thanks, everybody, for your time today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I'm now going to hand over to Gavin Felder, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim Head of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead. Gavin Felder : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I will be covering from Jodi Dyer while she is out on maternity leave. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that may be used on today's call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that during today's call, full system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Next, I'll provide an update on the financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. This negatively impacted our third quarter unit growth by two percentage points and our system sales growth by three percentage points. Additionally, these units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus do not impact same-store sales results for the third quarter. For the purposes of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base. We continue to include Russia in GAAP measures for KFC, including royalty revenue and expenses to support the Russia business and expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected as a special item within the other income and expense line. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included about our live conference and in any future use of the recording. We would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and following. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. We will be hosting an Investor Day in person on Tuesday, December 13, 2022 at the New York Stock Exchange. The event will also be webcast via our website at investors.yum.com. Fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 8, 2023, with the conference call on the same day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. Our strong top line momentum this quarter highlights clear demand for our iconic brands. We delivered 10% system sales growth underpinned by 5% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. While the broader macro environment evolves, our brands continue to thrive by being distinctive, creating excitement for consumers and by delivering exceptional value and convenience. The investments we have made in areas such as consumer insights, marketing analytics, and new technology platforms allow us to act with pace and confidence to meet the needs of consumers around the world.  I'm particularly thrilled about the performance of the KFC and Taco Bell division that were both standout performers this quarter. KFC did an excellent job in driving transaction growth through its omnichannel approach, leading to a sequential improvement in comps from the prior quarter. Taco Bell is winning, thanks to its ability to generate and amplify standout moments in culture and translate the resulting top line growth into impressive restaurant-level margins. I'm also excited to share that we opened a total of 979 gross units across 74 countries, proof that our development engine is powerful and diversified. As these results show, our committed and well-capitalized franchise partners are seeing opportunities to invest in the growth of our brands for the long term.  Next, I want to provide an update on our Russian business. As Gavin mentioned, we have a signed purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights to an existing KFC Russia franchisee. Following the completion of the transaction, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.  I want to say that I'm incredibly proud of how our local teams have managed through this extremely difficult time and prioritized the safety of our people in the region. Our number one priority is our people, and they will always be at the center of every decision we make.  Now I'll talk about two of our growth drivers; our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or RED for short, and our unrivaled culture and talent. Then I'll provide an update on our Recipe for Good. Chris will share the details of our third quarter financial results before discussing our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities growth drivers.  First, I'll discuss our RED brands. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our operating cost. System sales grew 12%, underpinned by 7% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. As these results prove this business can perform well in a multitude of environments, even as certain pockets of the local portfolio that experience tightened macro pressures.  At KFC's International business, which represents 46% of our operating profit, our system sales grew 14%, driven by an 8% increase in same-store sales. This represents a significant acceleration from the 1% same-store sales growth in the second quarter. We saw notable strength in the Middle East, India and Africa, thanks to momentum across our digital channels and a focus on operations and value.  Our Middle East market is truly on fire, where system sales grew an impressive 46% with strength across all channels, including a ramp-up in the use of kiosks and Click & Collect. Our India market saw system sales grow 45% during the quarter with customers enjoying the convenience-driven 7-minute Express takeaway guarantee.  In Africa, where system sales grew 31%. The team is focused on providing an easy and convenient digital experience for consumers. They've done an outstanding job rebranding their Click & Collect channel, as well as rolling out kiosks across the market to drive sales, underpinned by talent sharing offers like the all-in-one fees.  At KFC US, we brought back our famous $5 Mac & Cheese bowls as a value-oriented item this quarter. The reboot of this much lost product helps drive a positive 2% same-store sales comp. Additionally, for a limited time, we launched a $6, two-piece drum and thigh, which has driven positive results in a meaningful sequential improvement in transactions. Moving on to our Taco Bell division, which represents 34% of our operating profit. We saw extremely strong momentum with system sales growing 9%, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. At Taco Bell US, system sales grew 8% for the quarter, undermined by a 7% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. The brand is bringing to life is one-of-a-kind venue through creative innovation in a way that only Taco Bell can. This was most evident with the team adding products to its $2 creating menu, such as the Cheesy BB Burrito, while innovating with premium offers like the grilled cheese burrito. Taco Bell is a brand is truly relevant, easy and distinctive with the unique ability to stand for value with the current economic environment, you have a broad enough range to appeal to consumers across every demograph. As we enter the fourth quarter, we're even more excited about the momentum in Taco Bell US with the relaunch of the Mexican pizza, which occurred in mid-September. At Taco Bell International, system sales grew 26%, driven by 30% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. In the third quarter, five markets delivered double-digit system sales growth, marking another milestone in Taco Bell's international expansion journey. Year-to-date, we've opened 111 net new units, almost double the number opened at this point last year. We're driving scale in key markets, helping our franchisees leverage their size to optimize marketing spend, expand development capabilities and gain local sourcing efficiencies. Next, at the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 15% of our operating profit, our system sales grew 5%, led by 5% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 8% of our operating profit, system sales grew 6%, underpinned by 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Across our markets, we are focused on finding ways to expand our reach to become a more everyday brand. For example, as a leading everyday value offering, the Pizza Hut India team launched a fun flavor pizza costing roughly $1. More broadly, the My Box value platform is proving to be a key traffic driver through innovation and giving customers the option to customize with new entrees and sides. The platform helps us lean in on the individual meal and [indiscernible] and is now live in over 50 countries. I'm also pleased to say that our emerging markets are seeing a recovery in traffic and demand, as we lap the impact of COVID. Pizza Hut US, which accounts for 7% of our operating profit, saw system sales growth 2%, driven by 1% same-store sales growth. A key focus for this business has been to provide our customers with the ability to access our brands wherever they are. As part of this initiative, we continue to partner with third-party aggregators and integrate them into our POS systems with 90% of our system using at least one-third party marketplace. In addition, we are working to ensure we have the right value offerings to meet consumer demand and maintain franchisee profitability. This effort led to the introduction of items such as the $6.99 medium one topic Pairs deal and the return of the Big Dinner Box as an abundant family value offering. Lastly, as the Habit Burger Grill, same-store sales trends on a three-year basis have sequentially improved since the second quarter. Additionally, we continue to see consumers download our mobile app, leading to a 10% increase in app downloads since last quarter. Digital sales at the Habit now account for 33% of mix. The team is making good progress, growing new sales channels and forming direct relationship with our customers. Moving on to our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver front. As we've mentioned on previous calls, we have been celebrating our 25th anniversary as a publicly-traded company in various forms throughout this year. I'd like to acknowledge the important role our unique people-first culture and world-class talent have played in our success over the last 25 years. Our culture, which is focused on recognition and collaboration, is a key differentiator across our portfolio of iconic brands. It continues to drive retention and recruitment of amazing leaders who are developing others, growing their careers and ensuring the continued strong performance and success of our brand. I'm proud of Yum!'s deep bench of outstanding leaders and how our commitment to growing our people from within has driven a healthy increase in promotions and new opportunities for our teams. Our culture continues to attract top external talent as well. We recently welcomed former Mars Inc. Executive, Allyson Park, to our global leadership team as Yum!'s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, overseeing communications and public policy as well as our ESG strategy, an area of increased importance as we continue driving our recipe for good. At Pizza Hut, we welcomed former Starbucks executives Shannon Garcia as the brand's Global Chief Operating and Transformation Officer, a role that will evolve the way in which the brand works with its markets to add value and operate with a digital-first mindset. These are just two examples of the incredible talent that our culture enables us to attract from outside and within our industry. When it comes to our Recipe for Good, we continue to invest in critical work that's focused on our three priority areas of people, food and planet. I'm proud of our commitment and the progress we're making on the execution of our ESG jet. For example, when it comes to our climate efforts, we moved Yum!'s US offices as well as all of our company-owned restaurants to renewable electricity. We're now conducting a global study on renewable energy markets to identify low-carbon solutions at our restaurants worldwide. And in August, Pizza Hut US announced an exciting partnership with Dairy Farmers of America on an innovative farm-level sustainability project to provide participating farmers with the technology and data needed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With iconic brands and unmatched scale, I truly believe that we're in a unique position to make a significant impact in the areas we are prioritized. To wrap up, I'm excited about the momentum in the business that we demonstrated this quarter. The power and resilience of our brands was clear as we continue to prove we can perform well in any environment. With our diversified global scale, world-class franchise partners and unmatched operating capabilities, I am more confident than ever in the future success of our business. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, followed by our capital strategy. I'll begin with our third quarter financial results. System sales grew 10%, with broad-based strength evident across our portfolio. Same-store sales grew 5%, while units grew 6%. Core operating profit grew 8%, which includes a 3-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Ex-special general and administrative expenses came in at $259 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022. Impressively, our Taco Bell store level margins were 24% trending above third quarter last year and above pre-COVID levels. With respect to reported operating profit, FX had a negative $39 million impact and we now expect a full year FX headwind of approximately $100 million. Third quarter EPS, excluding special items was $1.09, an 11% decrease versus the prior year. In addition to a three percentage point impact from foregone operating profits in Russia, EPS growth was also negatively impacted by nine percentage points from the aforementioned FX, nine percentage points owing to a higher tax rate and six percentage points from lower year-over-year unrealized gains associated with our investment in Devyani. Our next special tax rate this quarter was higher than usual at just under 27%, largely due to adjustments recorded in the quarter associated with prior year taxes. Given these adjustments, we now expect our full year tax rate to land between 23% and 24%. Overall, given the same strength of our global business, we continue to expect to grow core operating profit in the mid single-digit range for the full year. As we mentioned on the past two quarterly calls, whereas not for the loss of Russian profits, we would expect core operating profit growth to be high single-digits this year, in line with our long-term growth outlook. Now let me share some more detail on unit growth and our bold restaurant development growth driver. This quarter, we opened 979 gross new units with encouraging momentum across our brand portfolio. At KFC, we opened 485 gross new units with China, India, the Middle East and Thailand leading the charts. Our Pizza Hut International division saw incredible development progress this quarter, opening 344 gross new units, setting a third quarter development record. This puts Pizza Hut International's year-to-date gross openings at 879 units, which is 280 units ahead of this time last year. China, India and Turkey led Pizza Hut development with each market adding more than 30 gross new units. The Taco Bell division opened 98 gross new units this quarter, led by strong international development, achieving a Q3 record of over 50 gross new units. For Taco Bell International, I'm excited to share that this quarter, both the India and UK markets joined Spain in the ranks of countries that now exceed 100 units. While Taco Bell US development remains robust, we expect international development to lead Taco Bell's unit growth this year. Despite the uneven macro pressures across our markets, our development remains strong as our franchisees use market disruptions as opportunities to grow. We are partnering closely with our franchisees to navigate challenges in the supply chain and higher construction costs. We are leveraging both our sourcing expertise and scale to secure equipment and realize favorable pricing on key items. Our teams are highly focused on balancing long-term profitability for our franchisees and offering value for our customers. With the power of our well-capitalized and committed franchise system and the unique global scale we have at Yum!, we remain confident in our ability to grow in any economic environment. Next, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the three pillars of our digital strategy, easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.  I'll start with an update on our easy experiences pillar, which focuses on delivering exceptional customer experiences through technology and dedicated operational programs. QSR Magazine ranked Taco Bell and KFC in the top 3 for fastest in drive-thru times the US. In fact, Taco Bell drive-thru times were 9 seconds faster year-over-year. KFC division kiosk sales also stood out this quarter with a more than 40% increase in sales year-over-year and 6% system sales mix, an impressive result considering that only 15% of KFC restaurants currently have kiosks.  We are also encouraged that the TikTuk platform is expanding beyond chat ordering with its e-commerce engine with a front and backend website and mobile app that is serving some of our smaller international countries. We recently went live with TikTuk's e-commerce engine in KFC Mexico and saw an increase in conversion rates post launch. We expect TikTuk's e-commerce engine will be live in 18 countries by year-end.  Moving on to our easy operations pillar, that centers on the team member and franchise partner experience. We completed the integration of our second delivery aggregator into the Pizza Hut US system this quarter, building on our initiative to partner with third-party aggregators and provide our customers with more options to access our brands.  Further adoption of third-party aggregators for delivery as a service has also helped ensure that we can meet customer expectations during peak delivery hours and save valuable time for our team members who can then spend more time elevating the customer experience. Additionally, the global rollout of Dragontail's Smart kitchen management and driver tracking system continues to progress at an impressive rate.  Lastly, I'll cover our easy insights pillar, which leverages the power of data and analytics to allow our teams to make smarter decisions. Quantum, the marketing analytics company, we acquired last year continues to roll out to markets around the world. We are now leveraging Quantum's media optimization platform across nearly 60 brand-country combinations, covering more than 60% of our system sales.  Notably, Pizza Hut Australia has seen a double-digit increase in return on media spend after deploying Quantum's advanced media mix analytics platform. Our brand teams are also using Quantum's expanded suite of tools in areas such as customer analytics, pricing optimization and market intelligence.  Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 5x, despite the exclusion of our Russia business. Though capital markets continue to adjust the higher interest rates, we are proud of the work our treasury team has done to put us in the enviable position of having no significant maturities over the next three years and approximately 94% of our debt fixed.  As we've said before, our capital priorities remain consistent : invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and returning the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Our capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds were $51 million. Our full year expectation for net capital expenditures is now approximately $200 million, reflecting $5 0 million in refranchising proceeds and roughly $250 million in gross CapEx. With regard to our share buyback program, we repurchased 1.4 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $116 per share, totaling approximately $157 million. Additionally, during September, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $2 billion through June 30, 2024, that will take effect upon exhaustion of the current authorization. To close, I'm excited about the continued growth we saw this quarter and the momentum in our diversified development across the portfolio. This once again shows that our iconic brands and world-class franchise partners are well positioned to navigate any economic environment. Before wrapping up, I'd like to remind everyone that our Investor Day is taking place in person at the New York Stock Exchange on December 13. We look forward to seeing you then. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now start today's Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is now open. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the strength in the US business and maybe David or Chris, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing across the brands in the US? What you're seeing from a consumer behavior standpoint? And I guess really, how that guides how you're thinking about the resiliency of the brands in the US going forward. Thank you. David Gibbs : Yes. From a consumer standpoint, obviously, you saw the top line results we reported this quarter. We're very pleased with them. They're very strong. So, generally around the world, we're not seeing any concerns from a consumer standpoint. Then, if you dig deeper into what's going on in the US, it's been well documented that there's a little bit of a K-shaped recovery. And we're seeing a little bit of that. We're higher in consumers having a little bit more demand. But the great thing about our business is our brands are so well positioned to succeed in any environment. And in particular, our business is 80% globally based on Taco Bell US and KFC International. Those two businesses make up 80% of our profit. They're incredibly well positioned to deliver value to consumers and with appealing brands. So in the US, this K-shaped recovery, there's a little bit of K-shaped demand for value on the high end. The demand is more for premium value. That's why you're seeing us do things like the Double Stay Grill Cheese Burrito at Taco Bell, which is at a higher price point than normal, but still a great value and a big part of our success in Taco Bell. And then on the low end, in Q3, KFC go back to Mac and Cheese bowls with some success that moves the needle. So, that's value offering, but at a price point that's appealing to a line consumer, but still not just discounting our core product, something interesting that consumers are [indiscernible]. Cravings menu in Taco Bell, the same thing, where we're offering burrito for $2. As far as the consumer environment for us and our industry and for our brands, which are particularly well suited to navigate, it looks good. Now, I know in other industries like in other parts of retail, if you bought some furniture a couple of years ago, you probably pulled your demand forward and that they're not going to have the same demand today. We don't have that issue in our industry because if you bought lunch two years ago, that's not influencing your decision today. And your decision today is more determined by how we stack up versus your options. We know that we're a really attractive option versus grocery, which is experiencing a lot of inflation. So this is a good environment for us. Operator : Our next question today comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 John Glass : Good morning. Chris and David, is 6% unit growth, the new 5%? I guess I'm thinking about durability of that growth rate as you think out and just remind us one, when you think about sort of targets for growth rate, what's the time horizon? Ultimately, the base effect of large numbers catches up with such a large system. So is it a three-year target, five-year? How do you sort of frame that internally? And Chris, can you also just talk about cost of capital, cost of debt has gone up. Is that a worrisome impediment to growth over the immediate term as the rate environment changes? Thanks. A \u2013 David Gibbs : Thanks, John. I'll take the first part of that and then let Chris talk about some of the capital issues out there. Look, I don't think the law of large numbers. If we're anything close to catching up on that and ours, we continue to put up impressive development numbers. You saw this -- the numbers this quarter and our year-to-date numbers today are roughly in line with what we had last year at this time, showing -- which was a record for us and for the industry, we believe, showing the strength of our development, and it is broad-based. The amount of development that's occurring outside of China continues to climb nearly 60% now, and that's in 74 countries last quarter. So this is broad-based. We think we have tons of opportunities around the world for all the foundational reasons you would want. The returns that our franchisees are getting are strong. Taco Bell, being voted the best franchise opportunity out of the 500 that are ranked in the US. And then Yum! China, I think last night on their earnings call talked about the great two-year KFC paybacks and three-year Pizza Hut payback. So with those kind of returns, we're going to continue development. We have visibility into the pipeline and we feel good about it despite all the challenges in the environment. As far as the pace of development, we're pleased with the strength that we have and even in the face of losing the development that we had in Russia. So the development story is good, and we know it's a big part of Yum!'s growth equation going forward. I'll turn it over to Chris, just for a few comments on the capital challenges. A \u2013 Chris Turner : Yeah. So John, on the capital side, I'll take it in two buckets. One, just following up on David's comments around franchisees and unit development. Just a couple of additional thoughts there as it relates to capital. David mentioned in many of our markets around the globe, we had very strong returns that are significantly higher than interest rates or even with small moves in interest rates. These are still highly attractive investments for our franchisees to make. And keep in mind that our franchisees on average compared to many other systems are larger, more sophisticated, more well-capitalized and more growth-minded. They're able to look through near-term noise in the market and actually take advantage of these types of disruptions in the marketplace to accelerate their growth. And so we're very pleased with the state of our franchisee base and our partnership with our franchisees, plus we have the strongest development team in the business. So we're working with them to navigate through that, but we feel good. In terms of cost of capital, for our balance sheet, our balance sheet at Yum! remained strong and very resilient. I think we proved that as we navigated the last few years. We're proud of the cash that we return to our shareholders. And we're set up well right now in this higher interest rate environment. We have no maturities, as we mentioned earlier, through 2026. 94% of our debt is fixed. We've also, over the last few years, created more capacity in some of the lower cost areas of our capital structure that we could access if needed. Right now, we're at five times leverage. But to be clear, going forward, we're not wedded to five times leverage. We're going to do what optimizes returns for our shareholders. We review our strategy regularly with the Board. So when it comes time, the next time that we would consider issuing debt, we'll look at where rates are at that time, we'll look at a set of other factors, and we'll make a decision on when the issue or whether to grow into a slightly lower leverage ratio. But just know, we're going to do what optimizes returns for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. Also a capital question, if I may. Obviously, there's a lot of focus on new unit development as there should be. Clearly, the same-store sales around the world, particularly KFC International really does support underlying franchise system that should. And I'm sure is doing very well. But the question is on the existing base of assets, especially the existing base of assets that might be 10-plus years old. I mean just how the overall system is from a capital perspective, are there any major projects that are happening in some major countries around the world that maybe we just haven't heard about? And does it make sense? Would it make sense for Yum! to co-invest with its franchise system around the world. Obviously, we all see the US, but you have a lot of big countries around the world where maybe putting some capital in the existing base of assets could be something that could drive longer-term brand value and shareholder value as well? Thanks. Chris Turner : Yes, a good question on the existing asset base. We're -- as we just discussed, a tremendous unit grower, but we also want to make sure that our current asset base remains fresh and relevant provides a great experience for our customers. Of course, whenever you're growing at 6% units. Every year, that's a new chunk of new stores that are being added to the system. Plus we have programs with our franchisees where they got requirements around remodeling and keeping the asset base fresh. In terms of the responsibility for that, that lies with our franchisees. And it's part of their approach to being in our business, investing in stores. They know they've got to make investments over time to continue to keep the asset base refreshed, and our brands are working hard with the franchisees to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower from Yum! [ph]. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Jon. How is it going? Just a quick question. We heard from one of your larger global competitors about the need to potentially offer franchisee relief to some of their partners in Europe over the next, say, 12 months or so. The picture is kind of reminiscent of what we heard during COVID times due to the inflationary pressures in that market. So I'm curious to learn what you're hearing from your operators in that market and what they're doing to price for the potential volatility ahead? And frankly, maybe if you could even frame your own operating profit exposure to that region, that would be helpful as well. Chris Turner : Yes. So obviously, in Europe, right now, there are some challenges, particularly on energy inflation, they're facing, our franchisees. Europe is an important growth market for us in the long run. We have meaningful but moderate exposure in the context of our global portfolio. Europe as a geography, is about mid-teens percentage of our sales and our operating profit. The business continues to be strong from a top line perspective there. If you look at KFC Europe, we had 25% system sales growth in Q3. Now the UK was a little bit of a different story where those energy inflation is a bit more pronounced, and you've got that holiday overlaps continuing throughout the year. So we had slight negative sales there. Same thing in the Pizza Hut business, strong in other parts, UK a bit more impacted, but we are working closely with our franchisees. We know this is going to be a challenge for them to navigate. And we manage the business on a franchisee-by-franchisee basis. So our teams in Europe are partnering with them setting the commercial plans for the business to help navigate those inflationary challenges. Operator : Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi good morning. My question really is about the sales strength you saw for both KFC and Pizza Hut, especially when you factor out China. You saw a pretty material acceleration in the comps relative to pre-COVID levels. So I guess, on a three-year comp basis, a pretty big step-up. And I wonder if you could just talk about what you think drove that step up from the second quarter and how sustainable that trend might be? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, David. I'll just comment on a couple of things. And of course, in the speech, I already mentioned the foundational things that are driving our business that will continue to drive it this quarter and in future quarters. Like the progress that we're making on technology and digital.  But beyond that, I guess what I would highlight is outside the US, while we had good growth in both developed and emerging markets. Our emerging markets are really starting to perform strongly. We were plus 20 in emerging markets outside the US ex-China. So that was a big driver and that was expected. We talked about this on previous calls that as these markets recover from COVID, we expected outside growth. The really encouraging thing about that is that's actually plus 16% versus 2019. So not just a recovery but real growth versus the 2019 baseline and then in the US, obviously, Taco Bell has been a steady high performer, but KFC, I think did a better job on value with the Mac & Cheese Bowl this quarter. Pizza Hut, as we've talked about in previous quarters, has done \u2013 has made progress on embracing third-party aggregators to solve some of that delivery challenge. So, we saw a meaningful improvement in their trends on delivery sales. So that all added up to as you mentioned, good strong growth around the world. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Across the US portfolio, you guys are obviously leading to the value across all three brands. And I'm curious how you see the industry evolving as we look at the end of 2022 and into early 2023. Do you expect the domestic quick service industries focused on value to further intensive buy and a difficult traffic backdrop or do you think value activity is going to be challenged by just the high COGS and robust labor backdrop? David Gibbs : Yes. Look, it's hard to predict anything over the last few years in this environment. The one thing that I can predict though, is our brands are incredibly well positioned to navigate any environment. We've demonstrated that over the last few years, and I feel confident as we move forward. Value does seem to be more of a factor today than it might have been six or nine months ago. And that's just more of a return to normal for the industry, rather than it is an exaggerated emphasis on value. But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, the scale that we have, our purchasing ability, the appeal of our brands, the fact that the vast majority of our business is at Taco Bell US and KFC International piece, that are so strong and so successful at navigating that give us great confidence that we will be able to continue to thrive in any environment. And there is a little bit more of an emphasis on this premium value, which is good for the industry where without products that aren't at the absolute lowest price can still be very appealing to consumers as long as the overall equation, the experience, the convenience, the credibility of the food is all there. Gavin Felder : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question today will be from David Palmer from Evercore. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Question on Pizza Hut US. What have been the learnings with regard to third-party delivery marketplaces and drivers as a service, the contribution to growth from that, but also, what concerns did you have going into it with your franchisees? And how has it played out versus your plan? And then related to the unit growth thing, I'm wondering, you highlighted Pizza Hut International having a strong unit open opening quarter, but I'm wondering about the US stabilizing and how you're feeling about that being a driver to your net opens as we go into '23? Thank you. Chris Turner : Yes. Thanks, David. On Pizza Hut US first. As David mentioned, the addition of aggregators has been one part of solving the delivery capacity challenge that we mentioned earlier in the year. We talked about how at the beginning of the year, we view this more as a capacity challenge than a demand challenge. And we've used our relationships with the aggregators, both being on their platforms and working with them on delivery as a service as one mode to solve that. Plus, I think we've mentioned that we have also adjusted some of our hiring practices and our HR practices or our franchisees have to attract more drivers into their jobs, things like reducing the time it takes to apply for a job at Pizza Hut. Both of those have contributed to us having significantly more delivery capacity in the market. If you look at Q2, we had a 23-point gap between our carryout growth and our delivery growth. In Q3, we actually extended our carryout growth, but the gap narrowed to 17 points. So that means delivery was significantly higher, and I think that's just attributable to both of those levers, giving us more delivery capacity into the system. There's one other benefit from the aggregator platforms, which is we get an incremental customer, who sees us on those marketplaces. And so that's probably been a bit of an impact there as well. And we've mentioned earlier that we've seen franchisees who adopted these faster run a little bit ahead of the system. So, I think that is part of what's driving growth in the Pizza Hut US system. A \u2013 David Gibbs : On the unit growth question, obviously, we had strong unit growth in Taco Bell US, Pizza Hut US, and KFC US have stabilized. And in the long run, we expect all of our markets around the globe to be focused on driving units. And so the teams are working on strategies to do that. But right now, those businesses are in a stable place from a unit standpoint as you see in the results this year. End of Q&A: David Gibbs : Yeah. To wrap up, obviously, a very strong quarter for Yum!. We're pleased with the results, led by our great teams in the field. We've got an investor conference coming up, and it's actually the first investor conference that we've had in four years given the delays from COVID. So we're really eager to get to spend some time with all of you in New York on December 13. In particular, we've got some new leaders in the business that you'll get to hear from live in person for the first time very excited about letting them tell the great growth stories that we have going on all around the world. A great quarter, and thanks for your time today. Operator : That concludes today's conference call.",

[Operator Instructions]. I will now hand over to your host, Gavin Felder, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Gavin, please go ahead. Gavin Felder : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I will be covering for Jodi Dyer while she is on maternity leave. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.  Before we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.  Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Please also note the following financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics.  For the purposes of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base. This negatively impacted our worldwide unit growth by 2 percentage points and our worldwide system sales growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year by 2 percentage points. These units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus did not impact same-store sales results for the fourth quarter or full year. All GAAP figures reported continue to include the impact of Russia operations for KFC for the full quarter and year, and for Pizza Hut prior to our transfer of that business to a local operator in the second quarter. These GAAP figures primarily include royalty revenues from continued franchise operations and G&A to support our Russia business. Additionally, our GAAP G&A includes expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments in which they are earned subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected those net operating profits as a special item within the other income and expense line. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Looking ahead, our first quarter earnings will be released on May 3, 2023, with the conference call on the same day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. 2022 truly was a landmark year for Yum!. In spite of the challenges from significant spikes in commodity inflation and pockets of labor shortages, our world-class teams and franchisees partnered together to deliver another year of amazing growth.  We achieved record-breaking industry development, opening 4,560 gross units that translated to nearly 3,100 net new units, beating our prior record set just last year and ending the year with over 55,000 restaurants globally. For the full year, system sales were up 8% and core operating profit was up 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.  Perhaps the most impressive performance came from Taco Bell, finishing 2022 with same-store sales growth of 8%. Taco Bell also bucked the industry trend on margins, holding company operated margins flat from last year despite elevated industry-wide cost pressure. KFC International delivered a record year, opening approximately 2,400 gross units and nearly 2,000 net new units, translating to 9% unit growth. Combined, these 2 parts of the business account for approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit.  We finished the year on a high note with system sales growth of 10% in Q4, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth, contributing to 22% core operating profit growth, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.  Such incredible performance under highly challenging conditions underscores the tremendous confidence I have that even after a remarkable 25 years of growth as a public company, our best days are clearly ahead of us. Before I discuss our 2022 results in detail, I wanted to give a brief update on our planned exit from Russia. As mentioned during our Q3 call, we have a signed purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights to an existing KFC Russia franchisee. We expect the transaction to close following satisfaction of all closing conditions. Following the closing, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.  I also want to acknowledge the devastating impact of the earthquake that happened earlier this week, affecting our teams in Turkey. Our people remain our #1 priority, and I want to recognize the effort from our franchisee, Ilkem Sahin, as he and his team worked to prioritize people's safety as they navigate through this tragedy.  As we shared at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is guided by our Recipe for Good Growth. And today, we will discuss our 2022 results through the lens of that framework. I will talk about 2 of our growth drivers : namely our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll provide an update on our efforts to drive the good agenda across our brands and our business. Chris will then share the details of our fourth quarter financial results before discussing our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth drivers.  I'll start by discussing our iconic R.E.D. brands. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit. KFC full year 2022 system sales grew 9%, driven by 7% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 system sales for KFC increased 10%, thanks to 7% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Results were unfavorably impacted by COVID-related challenges in China. Excluding China, our KFC business continues to grow at an unbelievable pace with same-store sales growing 9% in the quarter, driven in part by our world-class franchisees and continued impressive momentum in our emerging markets.  At KFC's International business, which represents 44% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 11%. Several markets showed stellar results. In Japan, for example, KFC is synonymous with the Christmas holiday family meal. And this year, Japan system sales over the Christmas period grew 16% year-over-year. Africa drove double-digit same-store sales growth in the quarter and continues to benefit from several customer-facing digital initiatives. To build on that success, our South Africa team will continue to roll out kiosks with a goal of installing them in 95% of our stores by 2023. Moving on to our Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit. On a global basis, full year system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. This team continues to deliver industry-leading results, and coupled with the incredible array of talent in place and our strong franchisee partnerships, it should be no surprise that Taco Bell earned the top spot on Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500 Ranking for the third year running.  Moving on to our fourth quarter results. Taco Bell U.S. grew system sales 14%, underpinned by an exceptional 11% same-store sales growth. The powerful momentum from previous quarters continued with the relaunch of the cult classic Mexican Pizza for which we provided early access to our loyalty members. We ended the year with around 45 million Mexican Pizzas sold, an impressive number considering they were only available for 4 months of the year.  We also made encouraging progress in our breakfast layer, building on high-profile branding partnerships such as Doja Cat in Q1 and Davante Adams in Q3. Taco Bell brought in Pete Davidson to help drive consumer buzz for breakfast. This led to 9% transaction growth for the daypart. Overall, Taco Bell did a terrific job this quarter at balancing both ends of the consumer spectrum by featuring premium products that our consumers crave, such as the Grilled Cheese Burrito with sharply priced items like Nacho Fries.  At Taco Bell International, Q4 system sales grew 23%, driven by 29% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 closed a truly breakthrough year for our international business, which has now crossed the 1,000-unit mark. To put this speed into some historical context, Taco Bell International has built 40% of its current estate within the last 2 years. It wasn't just our development engine on fire this year, many of our markets reached double-digit same-store sales growth in 2022, including some of our largest markets with India, up 33%; Thailand, up 36%; and Spain, up 20%.  Next, at the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 16% of our divisional operating profit, our full year system sales grew 3%, led by 4% unit growth and flat same-store sales growth. Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 9% of our divisional operating profit, achieved system sales growth of 4%, driven by 6% unit growth and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the fourth quarter. Results were heavily impacted by the ongoing COVID-related challenges in China. Ex-China, our same-store sales remained healthy, growing 4%. Several markets showed noticeable strength, including Japan, where same-store sales grew 10%, owing to a strong holiday performance and recent product launch of Tuscani pasta bowls that featured a local flavored twist. At Pizza Hut U.S., which accounts for 7% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 5%, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and flat unit growth. The strength in the quarter was driven by a combination of factors that included new advertising to highlight both premium and value offerings, growth partnerships with aggregators and the success of the new Melts product. Melts over-indexed to predinner time frames and individual occasion tickets and helped to recover the lower household income base due to its strong value proposition. Lastly, 5 distinct national marketing campaigns on Uber Eats and DoorDash helped aggregator transactions grow 30% in the quarter. Lastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, the team continues to make progress on setting up the business for long-term growth. Habit's burgeoning digital channel finished the year strong with digital mix ending at 35%, a truly impressive level after only launching in 2020. I'm pleased to share that Habit is now 18% franchised, which is up 5 points from last year. With $2 million average unit volumes and a compelling growth strategy, I'm confident in the long-term growth of our newest brand. And now on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent Growth drivers. Our hallmark at Yum! continues to be our people first culture, which drives retention and recruitment of amazing talent. Highlights in 2022 included bringing our top 250 leaders from around the world together for a Global Leadership Summit and celebrating the important role our world-class talent has played as we marked our 25th anniversary as a publicly traded company.  Internally, we continued to promote talent naming a President of the Habit Burger Grill and a new President of KFC U.S. Externally, we attracted top talent, welcoming a new Global Chief Brand Officer for Taco Bell, a new Global Chief Operating and Transformation Officer for Pizza Hut and a new Chief Corporate Affairs Officer for Yum!.  When it comes to all the good we do, we released our 2021 Recipe for Good report during the year, detailing our strong progress around our 3 priority areas. With our science-based targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by 2030, we decreased emissions against our 2019 baseline by approximately 24% for company-owned buildings and our corporate restaurants, while our franchisees decreased emissions by 20%.  Regarding better packaging, we published a new global harmonized packaging policy with a focus on eliminating unnecessary packaging, shifting to more sustainable materials and supporting better recovery and recycling systems. We increased the number of women in senior leadership globally to 42%, which keeps us on track to achieve gender parity and leadership globally by 2030 in alignment with Paradigm for Parity.  We were pleased Yum! received industry-leading rankings on the carbon disclosure project and inclusion on the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America, the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and Newsweek's list for America's Most Responsible Companies and America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity.  To wrap up, I'm thrilled with our 2022 performance, particularly given many of the unpredictable obstacles our team had to navigate. Our results continue to reflect a resilient, diversified business and the strength of our portfolio, led by our iconic brands. I'm confident we will continue to execute with superior performance and deliver industry-leading growth, all of which will help to maximize value to our shareholders. With that, Chris, over to you. Christopher Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by our capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2022 was a year of huge milestones for Yum!. The resilience and winning mindset shown by our teams around the world helped us open a record-breaking 4,560 gross units or 3,076 net new units on a full year basis. These development numbers put full year unit growth at 6%. System sales for the year grew 8%, driven by strong international same-store sales growth for KFC and another stellar performance from Taco Bell. Full year core operating profit grew 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Fourth quarter system sales growth of 10% was in line with the update we shared at our Investor Day, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Core operating profit grew 22%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Reported operating profit included a negative $42 million foreign currency translation impact in the fourth quarter and a negative $118 million impact to the full year.  Ex special general and administrative expenses came in at $357 million and approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. Taco Bell store level margins were 23%, flat year-over-year. Taco Bell paid additional discretionary bonuses to its store-level employees, given the strong performance for the year, which impacted quarterly margins by approximately 50 basis points. Taco Bell's full year store level margin was 24%, near the upper end of its 23% to 24% historical pre-COVID margin range.  Fourth quarter ex special EPS was $1.31, a 29% increase versus the prior year. EPS growth was positively impacted by core operating profit growth of 22% and a lower current year tax rate. This was partially offset by the year-over-year impact of a current year mark-to-market loss on our equity investment in a franchisee in India, lapping a prior year gain as well as the aforementioned negative impact of foreign currency. The ex special tax rate in the quarter was 12%, due in large part to the release of a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that we now believe we will be able to utilize. Our full year ex special tax rate was 21%, in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 23%.  Now let me share greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. This quarter, we opened 1,830 gross new units, resulting in 4,560 gross units opened for the full year or the equivalent of more than 1 new restaurant every 2 hours. Nearly 90% of new store openings in 2022 occurred outside the United States across 112 countries, proof that our diversified development engine is stronger than ever. Starting with KFC, the team opened 997 gross new units in the fourth quarter with China, India and Thailand leading the charge. The Pizza Hut division had incredible development results, opening 571 gross new units in Q4 with 5 countries contributing more than 25 units, namely India, Indonesia, Canada, China and Turkey. The Taco Bell division opened 253 gross new units in Q4 and 496 restaurants for the full year. In fact, Taco Bell U.S. opened 250 gross new units this year, the second highest annual amount ever. For 2022, Taco Bell International set a record with 246 gross new units, exceeding the prior record of 179 units set last year. I'm thrilled to report we crossed the 1,000 Taco Bell unit threshold internationally and we soon expect to have 4 countries that have over 100 units with China joining Spain, India and the U.K.  Lastly, Habit added 33 gross new units in 2022, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 10%. This level of growth, which includes a significant number of company-owned units create some short-term noise in company-owned restaurant margins due to the inclusion of preopening expenses and the depressed margins that are normal during the initial months of operations before new stores reach maturity. Average margins for Habit stores opened more than a year remain much stronger than our overall reported Habit company store margin. To finish with development, as we head into 2023, we remain confident that we will maintain our strong momentum. We exited 2022 with record site registrations for new units at Taco Bell U.S., and we have over 80% of 2023 planned units at KFC and Pizza Hut outside of China committed with well-capitalized, growth-ready franchise partners.  Next, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy : Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. I'll start with an update on our Easy Experiences pillar, which focuses on delivering seamless customer experiences through proprietary technology and dedicated operational programs. In 2022, we expanded the rollout of Tictuk, our conversational commerce and e-commerce platform across our network and finished the year with Tictuk in over 3,200 stores across 49 markets. We processed millions of digital orders in 2022 with Tictuk continuing to prove it can bring in incremental customers and drive digital sales. This is evidenced by the chat ordering launch in KFC Mexico where more than 90% of users who transacted on the chat channel had previously not placed a digital order on other channels. We plan to roll out Tictuk to more than 1,000 new stores in 2023, including its white label e-commerce platform, which went live in Pizza Hut Chile and Taco Bell Canada in Q4 2022.  Moving on to our Easy Operations pillar, which centers on the team member and franchise partner experience. The rollout of Dragontail is ramping up in Pizza Hut U.S. with over 450 stores onboarded by the end of 2022 and plans to reach up to 1,000 stores by the end of Q1. Globally, we expect to have Dragontail in over 7,000 stores by the end of 2023. At Pizza Hut U.S., we have completed the integration of 2 major aggregator channels into our point-of-sale system. And at Taco Bell U.S., we have fully integrated our delivery as a service partner into our store's technology system. These integrations are important in helping our team members process delivery orders with new levels of ease. Lastly, I'll cover our Easy Insights pillar, which leverages the power of data and analytics to allow our teams to make smarter decisions. I want to highlight 2 key initiatives that our Yum! decision sciences team have been working on, namely Recommended Ordering and Cook Schedule. Recommended Ordering is an artificial intelligence, machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of product for a restaurant manager to order each week with the goal of reducing product waste and intra-store transfers of inventory. The product has been rolled out to 3,000 U.S. stores across Taco Bell and KFC. Cook Schedule is a similar module that helps predict the correct amount of food and timing to cook product to accurately meet demand. The team is working primarily with KFC on this initiative with plans to pilot in an international market soon.  Finally, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 5x, including a small balance on our revolving credit facility that was used to support share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We will enter 2023 with no significant maturities until 2026 and approximately 94% of our debt fixed, excluding our revolving credit facility balance. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. To that end, I am also pleased to announce that this week, our Board of Directors approved an increased quarterly dividend of $0.605.  Our capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $99 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $206 million, reflecting $73 million in refranchising proceeds and roughly $279 million in gross CapEx. With regard to our share buyback program, we repurchased 4.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $119 per share, totaling approximately $486 million.  For the full year, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $119 per share and totaling $1.2 billion. Overall, we are extremely pleased with these results given the complexities our teams faced. Navigating such challenges with industry-leading performance affirms the confidence we have to deliver our recently raised long-term growth algorithm of 5% unit growth, 7% system sales growth and at least 8% core operating profit growth.  Looking to 2023, we wanted to provide a few guardrails for modeling purposes. First, we expect to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm with healthy unit growth momentum continuing into 2023. We expect Taco Bell company operated margins to be in line with full year 2022 margins, and we expect our 2023 G&A to be approximately $1.15 billion, in line with the guidance provided at Investor Day. In terms of the shape for the year, the year-over-year growth in G&A will be highest in the first half, largely owing to the timing of our G&A expense plan across the year.  Based on rate expectations as of today, we expect our interest expense to be up approximately 10% year-over-year and for our leverage ratio to drift modestly lower in 2023. Finally, we expect our full year tax rate to be 21% to 23%. To close, we are extremely proud of the performance of our brands over the past year and look forward with excitement to deliver another year of compelling growth and shareholder value in 2023. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : My question is about the profit outlook for 2023. And I was wondering how you're thinking about the puts and takes related to potential upside or offsetting factors. And in particular, I was curious about the China business. It seems like there's potential for China to recover and be additive to your overall profit algorithm for this year. And I was curious to get your view on whether that would be an upside lever or you would think about potential offsets to that factor for this year. Christopher Turner : Yes. David, thanks. Good question. As we look forward to next year and beyond, we're still confident in the future. As we shared at Investor Day with the raised algorithm, we feel confident in the trajectory of the business and nothing has changed in that outlook as we come into 2023. As you mentioned, the China component of our sales, you heard Yum China talk last night about being cautiously optimistic. So we'll continue to work with them. But in the long run, we are very bullish on the China market as it comes out of COVID, but of course, the timing of that is uncertain as they shared on the call last night. Of course, to the extent that we have rebound in that China sales, it does come at a lower royalty rate as you factor that into the plan for the year. The other elements, I think, are in line with the -- with what we shared in the algorithm. You heard the guidance that we shared on G&A for next year. And so our focus is on driving that growth. And of course, every day, it's our mission to come in and over deliver on that algorithm if we can. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : Thanks, Chris, for that color on G&A for the year. Helpful. Wondering, David or Chris, if you could speak just a bit more to the strength that you're seeing from a sales momentum perspective globally and the resilience really across the brands in the current macro, and how that guides sort of how you're thinking about 2023 if consumer pressure increases. I mean strength at Taco Bell, KFC non-China, International, Pizza Hut U.S. even momentum building. Just any additional color given the last several month's momentum for how you think about '23, particularly if globally, the macro situation gets worse. David Gibbs : Yes. Strength is a good word, Dennis, and it really was widespread, as you mentioned. We feel great about the fact that all of our brands are really on a roll right now. You saw that in the results for the quarter. And the consumer environment, much like my comments last quarter, remains a positive environment for us generally globally. Obviously, there are pockets of challenges when you have things like lockdowns in China last year, but that flips to be a more -- potentially a positive for this year. But the consumer in the U.S., on the high end, we're actually seeing more frequency from that consumer, and we're seeing possibly driven by a little trade down into our brands, which is all good. And then on the lower end, as I mentioned last quarter, consumers are starting -- there's a little bit more interest in value, which our brands are perfectly positioned to deliver on. You're seeing that with our menu offerings. Taco Bell with the Cravings Menu and $2 burritos, the new Melts product at Pizza Hut, which is screaming value. KFC just rolled out wraps as you guys are probably aware of at a great value price point. So I think the environment sets up well for us. From a consumer demand standpoint, more of the same. And then on the labor side, we're seeing an increase in applications, stores returning to their pre-COVID operating hours, which is great that we're able to staff the stores now appropriately. So when you mix it all together, we like the environment we're in. I also saw some data about grocery inflation in December being pretty high. So I think relative to alternatives, we're still a very attractive option. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Andrew Charles : Great. David, a little bit of segue to my question. Can you talk about your philosophy for how you plan to balance pricing versus value for Taco Bell U.S. in 2023? If I recall from the Investor Day, you tend to take most of the price on new menu innovation as largely premium. I was wondering for way to perhaps get more aggressive on value, if you need it, while preserving the strong margins the brand has reached. And perhaps you can just remind us as well what was the level of pricing for Taco Bell U.S. in 4Q as well? David Gibbs : As far as Taco Bell and the amazing job that they do, segmenting their consumers and providing each consumer what they want. That's what we talked about at Investor Day. And obviously, Taco Bell has some amazing value offerings that have been in their menu now for quite some time, on the Cravings Value Menu. But it doesn't -- it's targeted to a certain set of consumers and halos the entire business. So as the environment gets more competitive, we're already in the value game at Taco Bell, and we're already doing a great job. I don't see us changing anything. Well, we're connecting and we're winning because of value. That's why you saw the great numbers that we just put up in the quarter. But the brand with amazing margins, steady year-over-year, just has all the tools at its disposal to navigate any kind of environment and deliver great margins, great top line sales growth and a great proposition to consumers. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore. David Palmer : Congrats on the very strong unit growth. I wonder how you're thinking about EBIT margin over time. In 2022, it was 32%. And it's been near 35% before, but business mix is always changing. I wonder though, how you think about that margin over time. Do you think you could get back to 35% or so in the next few years? And I'm thinking about certain flow through like a China license fee recovery could be very good incremental margins. And so I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the potential for that EBIT margin. Christopher Turner : Yes. Thanks, David. I think in general, we focus on delivering the algorithm and the profit growth that's embedded there. If you think about puts and takes on EBIT margin, obviously, from a core operating profit standpoint, you do have to consider the royalty rate mix. I mentioned earlier, to the extent if any of our lower royalty rate markets were to grow faster than the others, you have to take that into the account in the modeling. We did talk about at Investor Day, our philosophy on G&A and how we're going to have a lower G&A growth rate going into next year than we've had the last few years. So we're going to be managing that carefully in 2023. And then of course, when you go to reported profit -- reported operating profit, you have to take into account FX. And FX was a headwind this past year. Pretty hard to predict. Nobody has the crystal ball on that. I will share that right now, as we look to 2023, FX will continue to be a headwind for us based on our current estimates, primarily in the first half. But we think on a full year basis, our best estimate is between a $30 million to $40 million headwind going into the year. We'll continue to update that as things change. So it's our push to drive the strong profit growth implied in the algorithm, and that's where we're focused. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Citigroup. Jon Tower : Just two quick ones. G&A came in a bit higher than I think guidance had -- or you guys have been targeting for guidance. I just wanted to confirm, maybe there were some one-timers in there. Is there something else that might have hit that line? And then outside of that, we heard from another number of other operators that 2023 started off on some strong footing in the U.S. and frankly, across the globe. So I guess I'm asking if there's any reason to believe that Yum!'s brands wouldn't have been participating in that strength globally. Christopher Turner : Yes. First, on G&A in Q4, we had reported G&A of $1.140 billion but that included special expense. We had approximately $20 million in special expense. So we landed broadly in line with our full year plan, a little bit to the high end of our planned range. There were a number of small items, none of them major, but I'll give you 1 example. As we had to split out the Russia business to prepare for sale, we lost some of the fixed cost leverage in our European G&A. But again, going into next year, as I mentioned earlier, the philosophy that we shared at the Investor Day still holds. We are focused on having a lean G&A model while investing in the things that drive long-term growth and health and we'll have a lower G&A growth rate into 2023. In terms of how 2023 is shaping up, as I said earlier, there's nothing that we're seeing at the start of the year that dampens our confidence in delivering our long-term growth algorithm this year and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : I was looking for a little bit -- a more detailed color in terms of what's happening at a consumption level in some of your major markets between your dine-in or in-store type of traffic, delivery traffic. Are you actually seeing consumers trade down in your opinion to your brand? Are you seeing your core customers come more often? Is there any slippage at all on the lower income consumer? Just kind of, I guess, a little bit more color in terms of -- I know it's always hard talking about a big global business with 3 and now 4 brands, but if there's anything that you can really provide some more detail in terms of what's going on below what's obviously very good aggregated results. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, John. It is hard to talk about a business where we have 290 different brand country combinations versus 290 different stores. But in general -- we obviously saw a shift to off-premise consumption during the pandemic. We've seen some of our on-premise consumption come back, but really for none of our brands is back to where we were, which isn't a bad thing given the efficiency of operating an off-premise model. Our ability with new unit development to build slightly smaller stores that are more efficient with better returns for franchisees. As far as the consumer, I've mentioned this earlier, but I'll -- it does depend -- if we're looking at the U.S. or other developed markets, the environment is still positive, just very similar to what we saw last quarter. We are seeing some increase in our higher-frequency customers -- or higher income customers coming more frequently. And some of that is no doubt due to trade down into our brands. On the lower end, we're not seeing the low-income consumer drop out of our business. What we're seeing is probably a little bit more focus on value, and that's been the trend, that's been continuing throughout 2022 into 2023. And we're there for them with our brands with perfect offerings for them. And in emerging markets, obviously, earlier in the pandemic were a challenge. They've come back now and our emerging developed markets are performing roughly similar around the world. Gavin Felder : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question of today comes from Gregory Francfort of Guggenheim. Gregory Francfort : I just want to ask about Pizza Hut U.S. I mean it seems like the business has picked up the last few quarters. And I'm curious if you're seeing share gains or increased pricing. Or just -- any thoughts on what's going on there would be helpful. David Gibbs : Yes. I'm glad you asked about Pizza Hut U.S. We're really proud of what the team is doing and the success they had in the quarter and the momentum they're building in the business. I know the franchisees and the team are working incredibly collaboratively. And I do believe getting share gains in the category and attracting new consumers. They're doing that a couple of different ways. Number one, how they're playing aggregators with the partnerships with the aggregators and how we've integrated into our IT systems, we're seeing a significant lift in our transactions with aggregators. We started the year with about 5 transactions per store through aggregators. Now we're up to close to 50 by the end of the year. That's a massive progress and obviously, helping us access some consumers that weren't using the brand. But it's also the look tone and feel of the advertising. You'll notice that that's changed. It's a much more modern contemporary approach, which is connecting well with consumers. And then finally, it all comes down to the product. The launch of Melts has been very successful for the brand, attracting younger consumers to different occasions than would traditionally use Pizza Hut. So that all adds up to a very positive story for the Pizza Hut U.S. business. And thank you for the question.  I think with that, we'll wrap it up. And I think the numbers speak for themselves. It was another incredible quarter and wrapping up a great year despite many challenges. I'll point out, we actually closed the year with over 4,500 gross new units being built. Take the 4,100 we built last year, that's 8,600 gross new units. That means 1 out of every 6 locations you see around the world was built in the last 2 years for our brands. I think that shows the momentum that we've got in the business. Our Yum China team talked about the great returns they're getting from their new unit development last year, coupled with the top line growth that we're seeing in existing stores, and there's a lot to be excited about as we head into 2023. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand over to your host, Jodi Dyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jodi Dyer : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions. Before we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call. Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Please also note the following financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. For the purpose of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base. This negatively impacted both our worldwide unit growth and worldwide system sales growth by two percentage points. These units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and, thus, do not impact same-store sales results for the first quarter. All GAAP figures reported continue to include the impacts of Russia operations for KFC for the full quarter. These GAAP figures primarily include royalty revenues from continued franchise operations and G&A to support our Russia business. Additionally, our GAAP G&A includes expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have re-classed net operating profits from the operating segments in which they are earned subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected those net operating profits as a special item within the other income and expense line. As a reminder, in April, we completed the exit of the Russia market by selling the KFC business in Russia to Smart Service Ltd., including all Russian KFC restaurants operating systems, master franchise rights and the trademark for the Rostik brand. Beginning in the second quarter, the Russia business will no longer be reported in our GAAP results, including franchise revenue and G&A. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Looking ahead, our second quarter earnings will be released on August 2, 2023, with the conference call on the same day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results provide further proof of the power of our portfolio of iconic brands. Both the diverse nature of our global footprint and the advantages of our business model enable us to thrive in any environment. Our incredible teams and franchise partners delivered another strong quarter with 13% system sales growth driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. A strong set of commercial strategies that balance compelling value and craveable, distinctive products fueled our first quarter sales momentum. We continue to execute on our digital strategy to create more seamless, personalized experiences to drive greater customer engagement and easier access to our brands. These efforts resulted in broad-based acceleration in digital sales growth, leading to a record quarter for both digital system sales of nearly $7 billion and a digital sales mix that exceeded 45%. Importantly, our core operating profit grew 11% in the first quarter, including a one point headwind from the removal of Russia profits, giving us great confidence in delivering on our long-term growth algorithm this year. Before I discuss our first quarter results, I wanted to provide an update on Russia. In April, we announced the completion of our sale of the KFC Russia business to Smart Service Ltd., including all Russian KFC restaurants, operating systems, master franchise rights and the trademark for the Rostik's brand. As part of the sale and purchase agreement, Smart Service has agreed to retain our company employees in Russia. With the completion of this transaction, we have ceased our corporate presence in Russia. Now I'll discuss our first quarter results through the lens of our Recipe for Good Growth framework. I'll begin by talking about our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or R.E.D. for short, and our Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Chris will then share the details of our first quarter financial results before discussing our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities. First, let's discuss our iconic R.E.D. brands, beginning with the KFC Division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 15%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth, reflecting broad-based strength. Globally, KFC is consistently executing its winning recipe of menu innovation, disruptive value, expanding category use occasions and doubling down on digital initiatives. We were pleased to see strong year-over-year growth in our KFC China business. As usual, Joey Wat and her team did a great job navigating the complex operating environment as consumers became more mobile in the quarter and KFC was there to meet their needs. Additionally, our International, ex China same-store sales, grew 11%, fueled by strong transaction and check growth. We attribute this exceptional performance to strong value offerings, the continued return of dine-in traffic, digital initiatives and strategic third-party partnerships. We've seen sustained momentum across many of our emerging markets, including Latin America and the Middle East. Additionally, we've seen renewed strength in many European markets where the team is promoting value at several price points to appeal to a broader customer base while innovating around our core menu offerings. The focus at KFC U.S. is targeting new audiences and category use occasions by using relevant value and product innovation, as demonstrated with the introduction of boneless offerings, including the return of the DoubleDown sandwich and launch of two for $5 wraps in the first quarter and the national launch of the much-anticipated chicken nuggets early in the second quarter. Moving on to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 34% of our divisional operating profit, before I get to results for the quarter, I want to highlight that Mark King was recently named the 2023 Restaurant Business Leader of the Year for the incredible progress Taco Bell has made, growing the brand while expanding unit economics and strengthening relationships with franchisees under his leadership. Seeing our world-class talent recognized more broadly across our industry gives all of us at Yum! Great pride. Taco Bell first quarter system sales grew 12%, led by 8% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. These incredible results build on years of sustained top line strength as the team executes on its consistent growth formula, which leverages the combination of brand buzz with unparalleled value offerings, buzz occasions and digital initiatives. This quarter, Taco Bell created customer buzz around craveable product offerings that included the Crispy Melt Taco and the Grilled Cheese Burrito while still providing everyday value through $2 Burritos on the Cravings Value Menu. Strong demand for the Grilled Cheese Burrito is a fantastic example that proves Taco Bell can win in the big burrito category and participate in higher price points while maintaining value leadership. Taco Bell U.S. is leaning into its digital initiatives to drive customer engagement, with year-over-year digital sales up approximately 60%, leading to an 8-point improvement in its digital mix. Taco Bell recently launched delivery-as-a-service through its mobile app to create easier access for our customers to get our craveable products. Additionally, the team also continues to make progress against our Recipe for Good Growth strategy with the ongoing condition of their packaging suite to more recycle-ready options. Taco Bell International grew system sales 25% in the quarter, driven by continued development momentum and strong value proposition through core menu innovation offerings. Next, I'll discuss the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 17% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 10% for the quarter, driven by 7% same-store sales growth and 3% unit growth. Same-store sales growth accelerated sequentially from the fourth quarter, driven by China and continued strength in the U.S. Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 9% of our divisional operating profit, grew system sales 10%, led by 5% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Following the successful launch of Melts in the U.S., the team launched this breakthrough product in 10 additional markets, including the U.K., Canada and several markets in Latin America. I'd like to recognize our global pizza team for their collaborative efforts to scale this winning innovation quickly. Our markets not only shared consumer insights and product innovation at unprecedented speed, but the operations team also used augmented reality to expedite training of our international team members through our intelligent coaching app. Pizza Hut U.S., which represents 8% of our divisional operating profit, achieved 10% system sales growth with 8% same-store sales growth and flat unit growth. Melts, in combination with the Big New Yorker in the quarter, helped to drive positive transaction growth by attracting new and repeat customers. The team continues to expand strategic partnerships and is now integrated with the three major food aggregators in the U.S. We view aggregator marketplaces as an additional channel to provide customers greater access to our brand, while also attracting an incremental customer. The Habit Burger Grill Division grew system sales 8% with 8% -- the Habit team continues to focus on expanding its abilities through mobile app user base and partnering with third-party aggregators. Before moving on to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent, I want to take a moment to thank Russ Bendel and celebrate his accomplished career in the restaurant industry as he plans to retire next month. Russ' passion for restaurants has always shined through and anyone who knows Russ knows that what he really values above all else is people. Everyone is a friend to Russ, and he is loved by all who have had the privilege to work beside him, whether in a kitchen or an office. We recently announced that Russ's successor is former KFC Global Division CFO, Shannon Hennessy. Shannon is an exceptional leader, and we're excited to have her drive the next chapter of growth for Habit and continue Russ' focus on people. More broadly on our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver, we've held powerful forums this year that galvanized our franchisees and top talent around our Recipe for Good Growth. In February, we hosted our 11th International Franchise Convention in Singapore, bringing together our global brand leadership teams and many of our 1,500 franchisees from around the world. Having attended this convention for many years, I've never seen this level of unity and enthusiasm for growth, particularly as it relates to development and broad strategic alignment with our franchise community. Our franchisees are some of the most growth-minded entrepreneurs in the world, and the international franchise convention was an opportunity to learn from, recognize and celebrate each other's achievements. Our partnership with our franchisees is as strong as it's ever been. We are strategically aligned to keep our iconic brands R.E.D. and our global growth momentum strong by leveraging the investments we've made in consumer insights, our digital ecosystem, innovative technologies and data analytics. Additionally, we are focused on unlocking opportunities for our people and communities while promoting equity inclusion and belonging across all aspects of our business. We were proud that many of our leaders, including myself, participated in the Women's Foodservice Forum as we focus on elevating all voices and achieving gender parity globally by 2030. We also announced the launch of Franchise Fast Start, the program funded by Lafayette Square to provide lending support to expand Yum! franchise ownership in underserved communities in the U.S. As a result of our efforts, we've recently been named to Newsweek's America's Greatest Workplaces for Women and Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity List. To wrap up, I'm always thrilled to start the year with fantastic momentum, especially when the strength is broad-based across our global portfolio. I remain confident in our ability to navigate any economic environment as our brands stand for unmatched value and convenience, providing a range of products and price points to meet all customers' needs. We are poised to maintain our robust sales momentum given our pipeline of R.E.D. product innovation, accelerating digital sales, strengthening operational execution and compelling value across our global portfolio of iconic brands. With that, Chris, over to you. Christopher Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers followed by our capital strategy. I'll begin with our first quarter results, which reflects strong fundamental performance across all of our core financial metrics. We delivered 13% system sales growth driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Core operating profit growth for the quarter came in at 11%, which includes a one point headwind from the removal of Russia profits. Reported operating profit includes a $27 million negative impact from foreign currency translation. We expect foreign currency translation to be a $10 million to $20 million headwind to second quarter operating profit. Our digital sales accelerated across our three global brands, leading to a record quarter with nearly $7 billion in digital sales. We are confident our digital strategies are working, considering we reached a new high in our digital sales mix, exceeding 45% this quarter. Taco Bell store level margins were 22%, flat year-over-year, ex special, general and administrative expenses were $278 million, in line with our expectations. As we previously mentioned, we expect our year-over-year G&A growth will be higher in the first half of the year. The ex special tax rate for the quarter was 19%. Our first quarter EPS, excluding special items, was $1.06, roughly flat over the prior year. First quarter EPS was negatively impacted by unrealized investment losses of $0.07 relating to our investment in Devyani and foreign currency translation impact of $0.08. As David mentioned, we completed the sale of our Russia business last month. Beginning in the second quarter, the Russia business will no longer be reported in our GAAP results, including franchise revenue and G&A. For modeling purposes, KFC Russia's quarterly franchisee fee revenue and G&A have averaged approximately $20 million and $5 million, respectively, over the last few quarters. We are pleased to see inflationary pressures, staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions abate in the U.S. as we return to a more normalized operating environment. While we've seen similar trends in some international markets, there are others where our franchisees continue to face outsized inflationary pressures. We continue to partner with our franchisees to protect restaurant-level profitability while ensuring we maintain strong relative value for our customers. We're encouraged by trends in commodity inflation and labor availability as both bode well for the health of our franchise system, which is the foundation of our industry-leading development engine. Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Development, we opened 746 gross new units during the quarter. Full year 2023 is shaping up to be another incredible year of development, similar to 2021 and 2022. But it's important to note the quarterly cadence of development will be weighted more heavily towards the second half of the year. As we've said before, we have great line of sight into our development pipeline, with over 80% of 2023 planned units at KFC and Pizza Hut outside of China committed with well-capitalized road-ready franchise partners. Let me share a few highlights of our diverse development drivers, beginning with the KFC Division, which opened 385 gross units this quarter. China, India and our Latin America markets led the charge this quarter, with each opening more than 20 units. I'd like to recognize our KFC team in the Philippines for their efforts to drive our good growth solar panels to build more sustainable restaurants. As for the Pizza Hut Division, the team opened 271 gross units this quarter, including the China, India and Turkey markets each opening more than 20 units. As we had anticipated, we exited our Pakistan Pizza Hut franchise partner and closed all 77 stores in the market. We are committed to partnering with capable, committed and well-capitalized franchisees. In some instances, the best thing for our brands and business in the long term is to exit a market and reopen with the right 3C franchise partner, which is exactly what we plan to do in this situation. Turning to Taco Bell. The team opened 79 gross units in Q1. The Taco Bell team continues to leverage unique store designs to enhance both the digital and drive-through experience for our customers. Taco Bell International is off to a record-breaking start, with 46 units opened this quarter, and Taco Bell China becoming our fourth international market to cross the 100-unit threshold, along with Spain, the U.K. and India. These top four markets accounted for 60% of new builds this quarter, illustrating the power and scale to drive accelerated growth. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our industry-leading development momentum. Next, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the three pillars of our digital strategy : Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. First, our commitment as a franchise-first organization and unmatched operating capabilities are contributing to our position as the global franchisor of choice. We mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call that Taco Bell was ranked #1 in Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500 ranking in North America. Building on that recognition, this last week, Entrepreneur Magazine announced its 2023 top global franchise rankings and our three largest brands made the top five, led by KFC in the #1 spot. Moving on to the pillars of our digital strategy. Beginning with the Easy Experiences pillar, we continued to enhance our digital ordering capabilities and launched new ordering channels. In fact, Tictuk completed its single largest market deployment for chat ordering to date this quarter. Customers are now able to order KFC across 1,000 stores in South Africa using WhatsApp. Early results in the market show this new ordering channel is sticky, with more than 40% of users placing multiple orders in the first 90 days after launch. Within the Easy Operations pillar, Dragontail launched in over 1,000 orders across KFC and Pizza Hut this quarter, led by the Pizza Hut U.S. system, which doubled its store count to reach approximately 1,000 restaurants in total. Additionally, KFC Canada launched nearly 400 restaurants on the platform. Restaurants that implement Dragontail consistently see improvements in product quality and customer satisfaction scores as the order sequencing algorithm and driver dispatch capabilities ensure customers' favorite Yum! products arrive hot and fresh. Additionally, the first quarter marked an exciting collaboration milestone for our restaurant technology teams. The core platform that powers Hut Bott, Pizza Huts Coach in your pocket application that supports over 20,000 Pizza Hut managers in 85 countries will now be managed centrally by Yum! digital and technology. This shift allows us to scale mobile-first technology for our restaurant managers more quickly across our brands and ensures continued product enhancement and future AI-based innovation under the Yum! Super App banner. Finally, for our Easy Insights pillar, we rolled out recommended ordering to nearly 600 additional stores and are live in over 3,600 stores in KFC and Taco Bell U.S. Recommended ordering is an AI module that recommends the quantity of product a restaurant manager should order each week. It reduces the time restaurant managers spend ordering product, improves forecast accuracy and reduces waste and time-consuming off-cycle orders and cross-store transfers. At Taco Bell, we have seen a 70% reduction in off-cycle orders and store transfers which frees up our managers to focus on delivering great guest experiences. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our capital priorities remain unchanged : invest in the business, maintain a resilient balance sheet, offer a competitive dividend and continuously evaluate the optimal use of our excess cash. We constantly revisit the allocation of our capital to optimize shareholder returns. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.9x. As a reminder, we expect our leverage ratio to drift modestly lower this year. Our net capital expenditures for the quarter were $57 million, reflecting $5 million in refranchising proceeds and $62 million in gross CapEx. As it relates to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at an average share price of $129 per share, totaling approximately $50 million. To close, we're incredibly pleased with our results for the quarter. With a great start to the year, we're confident in delivering on our long-term growth algorithm in 2023. Our relevant and iconic brands consistently demonstrate that they are uniquely positioned to thrive in any macro environment and create lasting shareholder value. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim Securities. Gregory Francfort : The first one I had, I update your comments on staffing environment and the labor environment getting better sounds like globally, but also definitely the U.S. Are you seeing changes in wage inflation in your core markets and in the U.S. market? Or is it mostly staffing? I'm just curious. Any more details you can provide there would be helpful. Christopher Turner : Yes, good question around the labor environment. If you step back at a macro level, we think about this in developed versus emerging markets. And in our developed markets, we have had some labor challenges that have been well publicized, not only in the restaurant sector, but in all sectors over the last couple of years. Those labor challenges are abating. We're seeing application rates increase, retention rates continue to increase, and our staffing levels are back to at or near 2019 levels. And we've seen labor inflation abate in those markets which is helping our franchisees from a margin standpoint. If we go globally, because of the position of our brands and the employment markets in those emerging markets, we really haven't had big labor challenges there. And we've seen less labor inflation throughout the last three to four years, and that trend continues. I'm sure there's some pockets for franchisees who are dealing with that, but in general, the Yum!'s culture and focus on talent, plus the way that our franchisees have led their teams during the last couple of years, plus our digital innovations in our Easy Operations area, which make running the restaurants easier, are all contributing to an improving labor environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : As it relates to your core operating profit in the first quarter, it was very strong 11%, very strong start to the year. And interestingly, it actually doesn't really incorporate yet a strong recovery from China. So as it relates to your guidance core operating profit of at least 8% for the year, kind of in line with your long-term algorithm, I'm wondering if you can unpack whether this is possibly tilting a bit conservatively after your strong results in the first quarter? Or maybe you can guide us through the puts and takes as the year unfolds with your core operating profit. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Obviously, it was a strong quarter from a core operating profit standpoint. And as you say, we have further upside as we step through the year if China's results continue. As you know, our long-term algorithm is just that. It's a long-term algorithm over many years, and we don't revise it every quarter. But clearly, we have -- we've gotten off to a strong start to the year, and we feel good about how the year is shaping up. Importantly, we just raised that algorithm last year at our investor conference, and I love the fact that we've started off the year beating all the components of the algorithm. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower from Citi. Jon Tower : I was hoping you could offer some insights from your end on what's going on in the franchisee environment, specifically in the U.S. I think there's a growing concern, particularly with what's happening with regional banks, that franchisees might have difficulty accessing capital and therefore perhaps having challenges growing in the U.S. I think your brands are positioned differently and you guys are in a different spot than smaller competitors, but I was hoping you could kind of dive into that a little bit, please. Christopher Turner : Yes. Thanks, Jon. Good question. I'm going to step back and start at a global level. And if you think about our development, keep in mind more than 90% of our development is outside of the U.S. And when you think about where that development is driven, we shared at the Investor Day that 60% of our global development is driven by 15 publicly traded franchisees. If you go look at the financial factors on those franchisees, you see that they've got, on average, less than one turn of leverage. The two largest have significant cash on hand with no debt. So the financial health, in general, of our 3C franchisee base around the globe is very strong and we think gives us a competitive advantage in this sort of environment to continue to strengthen development ;whereas competitors whose franchise systems aren't as strong, we think, will be at a disadvantage. If I drill into the U.S., keep in mind that Taco Bell is the vast majority of our development in the U.S. Our margins at Taco Bell U.S. have continued to be strong. You saw our restaurant margins this year were a slight improvement versus last year. So we continue to drive strong growth at Taco Bell with strong margins. Those are strong returns on those new units. So we feel like we're in a very competitively advantaged position relative to that issue. David Gibbs : We really haven't heard anecdotes and stories of franchisees getting concerned about accessing capital. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : I think a pretty consistent theme that's emerging for 2023 are some of the bigger, well-capitalized, more desirable brands that are really coming back and focusing and enforcing on operational standards that maybe were back to '19 levels or even maybe even better than '19 levels as their systems are so desirable and so many people want to be a part of them. So it's always hard to talk about multiple brands across the global business, but can you kind of grade, if you can, your operational execution across the brands? Do you see any big pockets of opportunity? And not really problems, any big pockets of opportunity that you see out there of just saying, hey, execution is obviously a very important part of the Yum! business and you have some significant pockets of opportunity that could really move the needle from this point going forward as we're now post crisis. Christopher Turner : Yes, Jon, I'd say, in general, we all know that providing a great customer experience at the restaurant is critical to our business. And if you look at our sales growth results, double-digit growth in -- from a system sales standpoint for all three of our big global brands, we feel like, in general, we're doing a very good job of that. Are we always looking to improve? Of course. I go to our digital capabilities as one example of how we're elevating operations. You go to that Easy Operations pillar, one of three areas of our digital strategy, and we talked about we continue to implement tools that make the restaurants easier to operate and then improve the customer experience. Dragontail being a great example. David and I were in the U.K. just a couple of weeks back, and we got to see in Pizza Hut how Dragontail times the pizzas coming out of the oven, with the delivery drivers getting to the restaurant, that's translating to better customer experience. They're getting hotter, fresher pizzas faster. So that's just one example of how we elevate on that front. Where we do have small pockets of significant improvement opportunity, we manage those situations, and we referenced that on the call. We talked about the Pakistan situation where we felt it was the right move to make a move in our franchise base. The strength of our overall global development gave us the room to do that. But that's just one example of where we made a targeted change to improve our operations. David Gibbs : The only thing I would add is the last few years have obviously been a challenging operating environment. I think at the end of the day though, it has made us stronger as an operator, and I feel better about the quality of our ops around the world today than I have at any point in my long career. We're clearly headed in the right direction. We have leaders at the brands such as Sabir Sami at KFC, who was the Chief Operating Officer of KFC. So we're putting a very strong emphasis on operations. We know that, that can pay off. The other component of this is, as Chris mentioned, getting the right franchisees in. In the U.S., as you know, we had a big change in terms of the ownership of our largest Pizza Hut franchisee, that's having a very positive payoff for us at Pizza Hut because they're running the stores better and a great reminder of how important it is to have the right franchise partners. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Dennis Geiger : Given the momentum that you've got in the business and across the brands, eve in a tough environment, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the momentum that you expect to continue going through the rest of the year, particularly in the U.S. And within that, just wondering if you could touch high level at least on pricing presumably rolling off some in the U.S. and sort of how you think about the traffic outlook and, therefore, the overall outlook for sales momentum to continue. If you could touch on that. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, Dennis. Obviously, we had a strong start to the year with Q1. And we don't normally comment on trends intra-quarter, but what I will say is we're off to another strong start in Q2. No significant change in momentum from Q1. Of course, the puts and takes will look different. Some businesses are doing a little bit better than in Q1. Some have tougher laps. But it gives us a lot of confidence that our teams are doing all the right things to connect with consumers. And this environment is a healthy environment for us, particularly with our brands. When you talk about the U.S. consumer, Taco Bell is just so well positioned to weather any kind of -- there was some kind of pullback, as you saw from the strength they had in Q1, their ability to offer value menu offerings under the Cravings Value Menu, but also offer innovation like the Grill Cheese Burrito for people that might be trading into the category if the economy started to soften. So from where we sit, we feel really good about the momentum in the business. And the pricing actions that you referenced were -- will probably start to roll off a little bit. But at the same time, we've seen inflation abate. I'll give you another good fun stat. In Q1, KFC, as you know, rolled out those $5 wraps. The strongest sales that they saw in a customer segment in Q1 were with the lowest-income consumers. So the part of the business -- the part of the consumer base lifting sales was from low-income consumers because they did a great job connecting with them through that offering. Same thing could be said with Pizza Hut under 6.99 melts. So we know we have all the tools in our arsenal to win in these competitive environments. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore. David Palmer : Wondering if you could provide any details on the ongoing sales recovery versus pre-COVID levels for key KFC International markets. We don't often get to see some of the country-level statistics. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about that multiyear recovery. Where is it still accelerating? And perhaps if it's slowing in certain places, why would that be, maybe shifting patterns between delivering at home or other consumer weakness perhaps cropping up here or there. David Gibbs : Yes. Just talking in terms of trends, David. You saw from the sales breakouts in our release that we've got widespread system sales growth at the numbers that we report. In fact, the vast majority of the businesses that we track are up double digits. I think we identified early on in the pandemic that developed markets were doing a little bit better than emerging markets. And then that sort of flipped more recently as emerging markets have recovered. They've been the one sort of leading the charge. And we're now entering a phase in which I think we're sort of more back to the normal cadence of developed markets and emerging markets contributing to our growth. So obviously, we have 300 brand country combinations we could talk about a lot of different ones, but I think that gives you a pretty good sense of what the landscape is like. And that's why we've talked a number of times today already about returning more to a normal cadence in the business, which is good for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Andrew Charles : Great. I recognize that 1Q is a season-light development quarter, but can you speak to the sequential cadence of growing 5.9% net restaurant growth in 4Q that fell a bit to 5.3% in 1Q, excluding Russia. 1Q certainly exceeded the 5% ongoing guidance, but it was perhaps a bigger step down than we were expecting. So you guys spoke about the robust development commitments. And so I'm just curious, I mean, do you expect that the percentage of year-over-year growth is going to pick up perhaps as 2023 progresses? Christopher Turner : Yes. Thanks. Good question. If we talk about Q1 specifically, I think all the factors that David mentioned around our confidence in long-term development trajectory still hold. We've got strong new economics. We've got tremendous franchise partners. We've got lots of white space out there. And we've got the best development teams in the business. If I go into Q1, keep in mind, don't read too much. We said that this year would be more weighted towards later parts of the year. But in Q1, we put up 746 gross new units. That's our second-highest total ever. That reflects that our franchisees are investing to build restaurants. And that was despite what you heard on the Yum! China call yesterday, which is they were dealing with delays related to the Chinese New Year, delays in contract signing and building permitting that were tied to COVID. And they talked about their view on the strength of their pipeline going forward. If I go to the net new unit side, one of the things that we're doing is we're using our strength in growth development to advance our assets to strengthen our global asset base. I talked about how we, in certain cases, strengthen the franchisee base with the Pakistan situation. Another thing we're doing is continuing the Pizza Hut asset transformation where when we close a unit, we're opening another one in the same trade area that is a stronger, higher-performing unit. And the third thing we're doing is when we have a few low-volume units that need to be cleaned up, we'll take advantage of opportunities to do that. But in general, we remain really confident about the long-term trajectory. And as I said, we expect this year to look similar to 2021 and 2022. David Gibbs : Yes. I mean the only thing I'll add is we know how important development is to our growth algorithm. Obviously, this is a big focus of ours. We think we have upside. Any numbers that we set out, throw out there, and that's our focus is how do we keep on trying to beat these numbers. And obviously, we've been pretty clear that don't draw too many conclusions from one data point at the beginning of the year historically is not correlated. And it was a strong quarter. It was a really strong quarter. So we're proud of what happened in Q1 and feel good about 2023 looking just like '21 and '22. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Noticing, as I think about your brands, the single customer serve opportunity, it feels like Taco Bell has always been about serving individuals rather than big portions of big families. But does seem like there's been a major change in menu strategy elsewhere. KFC, just recently between the sandwiches, the nuggets and the wraps, all for individuals and Pizza Hut seemingly doing well with the Melts. I'm just wondering if you can maybe just talk about the mix of business for each of your brands for family versus single-serve and maybe whether these new products change your mix of sales by daypart. I would think that would help build the lunch business, especially at Pizza Hut. But presuming this is a conscious decision at all brands, just wondering if you can give some high-level thoughts on the mix of business or family versus singles and daypart opportunity. David Gibbs : Yes. A good question. And you're spot on, obviously. Our goal obviously is to be there for our customers for every occasion, not just for family meals or just for individual meals. Pizza Hut has a very conscious strategy through Melts in the U.S., which has gotten a lot of the headlines, but also an offering that they have called My Box, which is an individual meal offered around the world to go after more individual occasions. Pizza is obviously traditionally a family-sharing occasion. So Pizza Hut and KFC with buckets tend to skew more towards family sharing. And Taco Bell with their multiple individual items that you can piece together for your own meal, skew more towards individual meals. And that's why at the beginning of the pandemic, you saw Taco Bell rolling out family meal options because that became the preferred way that people were accessing our brands early in the pandemic during lockdown. So they're continuing to lean in on ways that they can capture more of the family sharing occasion. And then Taco Bell -- and then Pizza Hut and KFC are leaning more on individual meals. Obviously, nuggets, the $5 wrap deal and other offerings we have around the world, the launch of sandwiches more recently, are all designed for individual meals. Operator : Our last question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. David Tarantino : Just a couple of clarifications, Chris, on the outlook. First, on the unit growth commentary, you said you expect this year to look a lot like the last two years. Are you talking about net unit growth or gross opening? So I guess your net unit growth has been close to 6% ex Russia in the past few years. So I just wanted to clarify that. And then secondly, I was wondering if you have an update on your G&A guidance for the year. Christopher Turner : Yes. Thanks, David. First, on development. Of course, our long-term growth algorithm specifies 5% net new unit growth. We've been a little ahead of that. And we're working hard to continue our development momentum. And as we've said multiple times on the call, we continue to have real confidence in our ability to deliver that type of net new unit growth into the future. On G&A, just a couple of things. First, note that about $4 million of our reported G&A in Q1 was classified as special. So then when you look at the ex special year-over-year increase, we had said on the last call that this year, our year-over-year increases would be weighted a little more to the beginning of the year. There are really two factors that drove that. So coming into the year, we had obviously planned to make some targeted investments in G&A in specific parts of the business to support our long-term growth strategies. The second part, we did encounter some expenses that we were not anticipating prior to the year primarily related to the cyber event that we had in January. But still, when we step back and we look at the plan for the full year, we still expect full year G&A to land at approximately $1.15 billion, and we'll provide further updates on the Q2 call as needed. David Gibbs : Well, thanks, everybody. I appreciate all the good questions. And obviously, we're excited about the strong start to the year, the momentum that we have continuing into Q2 and the fact that we've raised our algorithm and are beating it on all measures today. Look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q2 call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last December, we shared our long-term vision for Yum! to deliver accelerated global growth. I am proud to say that our second quarter results are further evidenced by our ability to execute against this vision. Through Yum!\u2019s differentiated capabilities our bold restaurant development engines including 1,025 gross new units in the current quarter, and our distinctive digital capabilities, which drove record digital sales fueled the second quarter\u2019s 13% growth in system sales. I'm especially pleased to report that based on our strong year-to-date results and the continued momentum we see in our business, we expect to deliver full year 2023 results, well above our long-term growth algorithm.  I'll cover the few high-level thoughts on our second quarter results before sharing some additional details through the lens of the relevant, easy and distinctive brands, and unrivaled culture and talent pillars of our Recipe for Good Growth framework. Chris will then provide some additional color on our second quarter results, followed by an update on our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities, Growth Pillars.  For the second quarter, we delivered same-store sales growth of 9% and unit growth of 6% with KFC setting the pace with a remarkable 19% system sales growth on the foundation of our industry-leading development momentum, distinctive marketing campaigns and relevant new product layers, such as the launch of original recipe hand breaded chicken nuggets here in the US. And as I'm sure you've all heard, Taco Bell, in partnership with another global icon, LeBron James successfully liberated Taco Tuesday in a way no other brand could mimic. As we also discussed in December, our Recipe for Good Growth strategy will be powered by digital and technology.  Our distinctive digital capabilities, which enable easier experiences and greater access to our iconic brands continues to unlock incremental sales through higher spend and frequency, as well as incremental profitability for our system. On that note, I'm pleased to report another quarter of double-digit growth resulting in $7 billion in digital sales, representing over 45% of our global system sales.  Turning back to our Recipe for Good Growth and our iconic Red Brand, let me start with the KFC division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profit. Second quarter system sales growth of 19% was driven by 13% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth.  Widespread transaction growth and a strong recovery in our China market as Yum! China detailed in the results earlier this week, powered our same-store sales growth. However, even outside of China, is the global same-store sales growth was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, KFC represents our largest digital business globally on a dollar basis and showed continued momentum with strong year-over-year growth in both digital sales and mix.  Among KFC's emerging Markets, I'd like to highlight our Middle East team for the work they did to drive system sales with a focus on their core menu and new snacking product offerings and the South Africa team for their efforts to grow the breakfast layer through a bold marketing campaign with Trevor and Noah. Thanks to unlocking additional customer use occasions, compelling value offerings and continued digital growth both markets posted strong same-store sales growth. Among our developed markets, Western Europe led the way with strong results in check and transactions by balancing disruptive value and core menu items.  Turning to KFC U.S., same-store sales grew 5%, improving sequentially with the combination of product innovation and an always on value strategy. Building our first quarter, momentum behind wraps, KFC U.S. launched hand breaded original recipe chicken nuggets to expand its off the bone chicken offerings leveraging the learnings from our significant off the bone business at KFC International.  This product innovation was met with an immediate positive consumer reaction, resulting in over 100 million nuggets sold in the first eight weeks after launch. These boneless offerings appeal the younger and new KFC customers and builds upon an already well-established sales layer following the successful launch of the chicken sandwich in 2021.  Moving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our global divisional operating profit and roughly 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit. Once again, I'm thrilled to share more external recognition of Taco Bell's brand power and relevance with the brand's inclusion on the Time 100 list of the world's most influential companies.  This category of One Brand remains ever relevant by pushing boundaries and introducing and reintroducing exciting and craveable menu items and always being part of the cultural moment and conversation. Congrats to the entire Taco Bell team and our incredible franchisees for yet another well-deserved honor.  For the second quarter, Taco Bell's global system sales grew 7% led by 4% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Taco Bell continues to execute its magic growth formula through a balanced set of commercial strategies including building brand buzz, unparalleled value, mass occasions, and digital initiatives.  This quarter, the team launched a campaign to liberate Taco Tuesday in a first-ever global Taco Tuesday, campaign spanning 19 markets in partnership with a true global icon LeBron James. The campaign created massive brand buzz with engagement, and mentions in one week for taco Tuesday Liberation surpassing the entirety of the highly successful Mexican Pizza relaunch last year. Other promotions in the quarter contributing to Taco Bell\u2019s winning magic growth formula includes both our $5 Cravings Creo and Deluxe Build Your Own Cravings Box that help sustain our strong consumer value proposition and maintain over. 25% margins.  In addition an expansion of trading hours with strong growth at both the breakfast and late night dayparts, helped Taco Bell\u2019s second quarter results.  Finally, the team continues to create incremental demand for their digital channels. In the U.S., digital sales increased almost 35% year-over-year with kiosks now deployed in 100% of Taco Bell stores. Taking all of this into account, it is no surprise Taco Bell continues to be a leader in value perception, while also delivering amazing unit economics.  For Taco Bell International, system sales grew 18%, driven by development momentum. The global Taco Tuesday Campaign, which launched in June and will continue through the third quarter, leverages Taco Bell's, US cultural leadership building brand equity and consumer awareness with a consistent look and feel around the world.  I also want to highlight Taco Bell\u2019s continued progress against our Recipe for Good Growth strategy that included raising $20 million so far this year through its Round Up fundraiser. Throughout the quarter to the Taco Bell Foundation donated these funds to over 400 non-profits and nearly 1,000 live mass scholarships. Next I'll discuss the Pizza division, which accounts for 14% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 7% for the quarter, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. Pizza Hut International grew system sales 11%, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. The individual occasion continues to be a growth driver largely on incremental transaction growth from the Melts platform, which in the US has proven to be a self-sustaining layer at an attractive entry price point. Since launching in the U.S. late last year, Melts has now reached 35 markets, up significantly from the 11 markets in the first quarter, now in over half of our global store base. Melts is delivering encouraging early results alongside My Box, our other international individual occasion product offering. Our team is focused on providing distinctive value offerings across markets such as the Super Limo Abundant Value deal in the UAE and the National Pizza Party promotion in Australia.  Pizza Hut U.S. grew system sales 2%, driven by 1% same-store sales growth. In the U.S., we introduced new flavor profiles to our Melts platform, providing yet another reason for customers to order from Pizza Hut. The Habit Burger Grill division grew system sales 9% on 7% unit growth. The Habit team continues to lean into its menu strategy of Culinary Forward limited time offerings, highlighting its craft brand positioning through their elevated craveable offering.  We continue to expand access points for our customers with the rollout of kiosks now in over 60% of stores on average kiosk sales peaked 10% higher checks, compared with front counter sales and excellent profit flowthroughs, yet another proof point of the value from converting to digital sales.  Moving to our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver, which continues to be the foundation of our success, to start, I'd like to recognize Taco Bell division CEO Omar King, who will retire at the end of the year as we celebrate the legacy that Mark will leave at Taco Bell we're thrilled that Sean Tresvant will become the CEO of the Taco Bell division effective January 2024. Sean joined Taco Bell's Chief Brand Officer two years ago and earlier this year, expanded his role to Global Chief brand and Strategy Officer. With Sean's clear vision and strong track record of driving transformative red innovation, I'm confident the Taco Bell will continue to successfully execute its long-term global growth strategy.  This is a great reminder of how people are truly at the center of everything we do, which is also reinforced in our Global Citizenship and Sustainability report, which was published last month. The report outlines our strategic investments in socially responsible growth, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our three priority pillars of people, food and planet.  I'd like to take a moment to highlight work on key issues across each pillar, including the quality, packaging, and carbon reduction. We remain committed to our purpose of unlocking opportunity in part through our $100 million commitment over five years that we announced in 2020 to knock down barriers to equity inclusions, education and entrepreneurship around the world.  Through our unlocking opportunity initiatives, we have funded and activated more than 30 social impact programs in 11 countries, enabling markets to develop localized programs to deliver meaningful change in communities where we operate. We also continue to make progress towards achieving gender parity and leadership roles by 2030, with 43% of global leadership roles held by women in 2022.  These are just two examples of the great progress we've made and that how Yum!\u2019s commitment to its people first culture has never been stronger. In addition, we continue to make progress around sustainable packaging, building upon our harmonized cross-brand packaging policy that was introduced last year. Furthermore, we've had great success as we March toward our climate goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% by 2030. To-date, our teams have achieved a 57% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at corporate restaurants and offices, coupled with a 28% reduction at franchise restaurants.  Reflecting on the first half of the year, our teams have put forward an impressive set of results. And looking forward, the picture we see for the second half of the year will be similarly strong. Our confidence comes from our Recipe for Good Growth strategy and the fact that category leaders Taco Bell US and KFC International drive 80% of Yum!\u2019s divisional operating profit. The vast majority of our U.S. operating profit is driven by Taco Bell, the leading brand in both cultural relevancy and affordability, while globally, KFC is positioned with unmatched scale advantages and growth by the franchise partners eager to capitalize on opportunities in their markets and widen their competitive mode.  In an uncertain environment, we know that consumers make decisions with value in line with good news is that our brands have always stood for tremendous value in addition to convenience, experience, and craveable food. This is a winning combination that will continue to differentiate us from our competitors and when coupled with our Recipe for Good Growth strategy, I am confident that we can continue to deliver on our long-term vision for accelerated global growth in 2023 and beyond.  With that, Chris, over to you. Christopher Turner : Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter financial results and our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers before turning to our capital strategy.  I'll begin with our second quarter results. We delivered 13% system sales growth, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth.  Digital sales improved at all four of our brands with total digital sales up nearly 30% year-over-year. Core operating profit for the quarter grew 12%. Taco Bell store level margins were an impressive 25.6%. We continue to expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be similar to margins in 2022. Taco, Bell's ability to deliver such strong margin performance, despite mid-single-digit inflation, once again demonstrates the power and resilience of their business model and preserves their compelling unit economics, which remain near an all-time high.  For Habit, company-operated margins improved to 11%, thanks to better leverage of Yum!\u2019s purchasing scale, as well as efforts to improve store level labor productivity. We're encouraged with the margin improvement progress at Habit and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the long-term growth of the business and as a result, we expect a small operating loss for the division this year.  Ex-special general and administrative expenses $280 million, in line with our expectations. The Ex-special tax rate for the quarter was 18%.  Finally, our second quarter EPS, excluding special items was $1.41 per share. Second quarter EPS was positively impacted by unrealized investment gains of $0.09, relating to our investment in Devyani, offset by a negative foreign currency translation impact of $0.05. Given our strong first half results, and continuing momentum into the second half of the year, I'm happy to report that we expect on a full year basis, to over deliver on all components of our long-term growth algorithm. We expect full year 2023 core operating profits to grow low-double-digits, which is ahead of our long-term guidance of at least 8%.  We expect second half G&A expenses to be modestly higher, relative to our initial plan, primarily attributable to above target incentive compensation accruals resulting from our strong performance and which we began recording in Q2. As a reminder, employee incentive compensation is tied to internal performance targets, linked to components of our long-term growth algorithm.  The accrual we book throughout the year can go up or down depending on our performance. Consistent with our prior GNA guidance, we still expect our year-over-year G&A growth to be lower in the second half of the year. Balance of year, we expect the third quarter year-over-year G&A growth rate to look similar to the growth rate in the first half, followed by a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter.  Finally, we've faced a $44 million, foreign currency headwind year-to-date and our current forecast is for little to no FX impact to reported operating profit in the balance of the year.  Now moving on to Bold Restaurant Developments, we opened 1,025 gross new units during the quarter contributing to 6% unit growth. We are encouraged by the excitement among our growth ready franchise partners who see broad consumer appeal for our brands and enormous white space opportunity in their markets and who are enthusiastic about Yum!\u2019s unmatched operating capabilities. We continue to expect that the benefits of our scale and the health of our franchise system will allow us to further widen our development advantage relative to the industry. As you've heard me say before, the Yum! system is made up of world-class franchise partners who are truly 3C, Committed, Capable and well-capitalized.  As a result, we expect 2023 will be another incredible year of development similar to 2021 and 2022, which were both industry record-setting years.  Let me share a few highlights of our unit development in the quarter beginning with the KFC division, which opened 600 gross new unit. Yum! China's development momentum re-accelerated 375 gross new units opened this quarter, putting their year-to-date development ahead of last year's pace. The remainder of KFC's unit growth was widespread across markets, led by India, The Middle East, and Asia.  As for the Pizza Hut division, the team opened 357 gross new units, led by China, India, Spain, Turkey, and the US, with each opening at least 20 units. In June, The Flynn Restaurant Group announced its first international expansion with an agreement to acquire Pizza Hut, Australia, which owns approximately 260 Pizza Hut units.  This is a great example of a 3C partner eager to grow within our system. For those unfamiliar with the Flynn Restaurant Group, they are the largest franchise operator in the U.S. restaurant industry with roughly 2,400 restaurants, including nearly 300 Taco Bells and nearly 1,000 Pizza Huts. For some perspective, in 2022 Flynn accounted for roughly 20% of the Pizza Hut U.S. new builds and their overall, same-store sales growth significantly outperformed the rest of the U.S. system. Taco Bell development remains on track for another record-setting year with 63 gross new units, including 27 in international markets across eight countries. Totaling it all up, Yum!s first half unit development reflects nearly 1800 gross new units, a fantastic result that demonstrates the resilience of Yum!\u2019s development engine, despite a more challenging macro environment.  Next, I'll turn to our unmatched operating capabilities that contribute to our position as the global franchisor of choice. This includes our distinctive digital strategy to unlock improved customer experiences that lead to faster sales growth and better store level margins.  With that, let me discuss the three pillars of our digital strategy. Beginning with the Easy Experiences Pillar, this quarter, the KFC US team leveraged the Yum! commerce platform, which was first launched with KFC. U.S. in 2021 to enable a Diablo for limited time promotion in partnership with Activision Blizzard and offered customers exclusive in-game rewards in exchange for KFC purchases.  By leveraging our in-house technology, we were able to build the necessary infrastructure and integration to support this exciting gaming promotion in a matter of weeks. Previously, the process would have taken months with significant third-party expense. This quarter, we achieved a significant milestone in expanding the Yum! Commerce platform as Taco Bell U.S. migrated its digital traffic onto the platform.  All of Taco Bell's web, mobile, and Delivery-as-a-Service digital transactions are now processed through this platform. Additionally Pizza Hut Peru became the first international Market to begin using the Yum! commerce platform this quarter. We will continue to migrate additional brands and markets to the Yum! commerce platform over the coming quarters, including Pizza Hut U.S. throughout 2023 in several international markets. Within the Easy Operations pillar, we continued to expand adoption of both recommended ordering and our Yum! point-of-sale system. As you may recall, recommended ordering is an AI machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of each product a restaurant general manager should order.  Recommended ordering was deployed in another 800 stores this quarter and is now live in over 4400 KFC and Taco Bell U.S. stores. Our Yum! Next-Generation Cloud First point-of-sale system improves operational efficiencies and enhances team member effectiveness. Taco Bell U.S. is leading this rollout having deployed this system to 1,000 stores this quarter and targeting 5,000 stores by year-end.  Finally, for our Easy Insights pillar, we are advancing our digital strategy and using a new customer data platform solution to provide a unified view of customers across our US brands and third-party aggregators. This will enable us to improve digital experiences for our customers and ultimately increase customer frequency.  Eventually, this and other internal programs will provide the infrastructure to unlock personalized marketing, joint branding and future automation. This is the latest step in our vision to One Day Achieve 100% of sales powered by digital.  Lastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. As a reminder, our strategy is to enable growth, while maximizing shareholder value. In doing that, our capital priorities remain unchanged, investing in the business for the long-term, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, paying a competitive dividend and maximizing shareholder value by returning excess capital through debt paydowns and share repurchases.  Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $34 million, reflecting $60 million in gross CapEx and $26 million in re-franchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio declined to 4.7 times, reflecting our previously stated intention to allow net leverage to drift modestly lower this year.  Keep in mind, we have an upcoming bond maturity of $325 million in November of this year, our only maturity until 2026. Furthermore, our current outstanding debt has a weighted average remaining term of six years and our greater than 90% fixed floating ratio is attractive in the current market environment. We paid down $164 million on our revolver, leaving a minimal balance at the end of the quarter.  We continued to evaluate the best use of our excess capital and at current interest rates, we believe funding our upcoming debt maturity before share repurchases best optimizes shareholder value. To round out our prepared remarks, I'm incredibly pleased with our strong, year-to-date results and continued momentum giving us confidence, we will deliver full year 2023 results well above our long-term growth algorithm. Our brand teams and franchise operators remain vigilant in the pursuit to maximize performance and in turn deliver exceptional shareholder value.  With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Our first question today comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Dennis Geiger : Great. Good morning folks and thank you. I wanted to ask a question on the 2023 outlook commentary for growth well ahead of the low double-digits. Could you touch, maybe a bit more on the momentum that you spoke to heading into the second half including any sort of visibility that you have into the top-line, which I think is particularly encouraging in the current environment?  And then, any additional puts and takes to profitability beyond the helpful callout that you mentioned on the call? Thank you. David Gibbs : Yeah. Look, as far as the second half of the year, obviously, we're confident. We're well above algorithms. We confirmed that in our prepared remarks, just to give you a little visibility in why we feel that way, Taco Bell U.S. for example has got very strong momentum as we come into Q3. They've launched value. And if we look at all of our businesses on a two-year sales trend, which I think evens out some of the anomalies. We see basically a continuation of what we saw in the first half of the year. Christopher Turner : And then, Dennis, on the profit trends, we mentioned that we now expect full year core operating profit to be low-double-digits. And I think we gave a lot of color in my comments earlier on the drivers of that around G&A and expectations in the back part of the year continuing trends from the first half in Q3 and then a year-over-year decline in Q4. We're also pleased to have improving margins in our company operated store based.  You saw a 200 basis point improvement there in our biggest - driven by improvements in our biggest store bases and we're going to continue to manage that. I don't think there's anything else to call out in terms of color on back part of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. You've consistently said that Yum! brands is built to showcase blue chip like resiliency, positioned to win in any environment and that dynamic seems to be proving out with 9% same-store sales growth in the second quarter. And you seem to be pointing to a continuation of healthy trends. Can you just help us understand what the drivers currently are for this resiliency?  And if you believe the macro has indeed become more challenged recently across your portfolio despite obviously, continuation of very strong results? Christopher Turner : Sure. And I appreciate the commentary. Just, as far as, why are we able to navigate this kind of environment? Look, I have a lot of confidence in our brand leaders and our marketing teams around the world in so many ways we're writing the playbook for how to build brands in this industry. We have Collider which is an internal group that provides so much to us in terms of our - the inside time and consumer behavior.  And I think that'll just shows up in the way we build these brands being top 100 brands in the world. As far as the macro challenges, this is an environment that I would say is a more than normal operating environment. We've come out of a series of years where things have been a little bit more different than we've ever had in the past.  But I wouldn't, call it a difficult environment to operate in. One way to think about it is, just to breakdown, our markets between developed and emerging. In the developed markets, we saw mid-single digit sales growth is quarter. It's a stable positive environment and we're past really inflation peak in most markets, obviously, in the US that's been well documented.  And this is an environment where we can succeed. Value is rising in importance. But we have solutions and in many ways, our leaders with our brands. KFC for US, for example, in the quarter, their most growth was seen in their low-income consumers, because they had always on value for the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So we can win in this environment and develop markets.  Similarly, Western Europe has been documented as a challenged environment for a lot. For us, we had good results there. Our French and German markets did a great job of mixing innovation and value, and delivering strong growth there. So, developed markets, little bit more of a return to normal, more stable and our brands are built to win in those markets. In emerging markets, it's a little bit of a different story. We're seeing double-digit sales growth for the quarter. Little bit more vary, but in general, we're not past the peak of inflation in a lot of these markets. So, we're still taking pricing some of these markets over that inflation, able to pass it on to consumers. But very importantly, we've got positive transaction growth in those markets. So, we're still growing our share in the industry, at the same time, we're navigating a little bit more challenging environment in those emerging markets. But when you add it all up, as you said, we've proven to to demonstrate how resilient our brands are and how we can operate really in any environment and win. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Citi. Jon, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to zero in on the commerce platform that you're expanding across number of the brands including Taco Bell now and some of the others that across the globe are hopping onto the platform. Does the company collect any sort of fees from franchisees hopping onto this platform? And if so, how should we think about it rolling into the P&L over time? Christopher Turner : Yeah, Jon, we are excited about the progress that we're making on all aspects of the digital strategy. And so, you're asking about the e-commerce platform, which is a core part of our Easy Experiences capability set. And we talked about some of the benefits that we derive whenever we platform systems like this. We think it really, ultimately drives faster profitable growth for our franchisees and for us the ways that you do that, we talked about the Diablo 4 experience in KFC U.S.  It allowed us to implement a marketing campaign much faster than we normally would. And, of course, as you get that platform, across more markets, across more brands, we talked about the big milestone, implementing in Taco Bell, you then are able to implement campaigns in multiple geographies or multiple brands much more quickly, because you don't have to build integrations for each discrete technology platform that we've had previously across the business.  In addition, you've got this robust capabilities. At the base as you build tailored front-ends that are relevant to each market and brand on top. So at the end of the day, we're driving profitable growth for our franchisees and for us through this strategy, franchisees obviously benefit from that and they share in the investments that we make through our digital fees that we have in certain markets. But at the end of the day, if this is an ROI driving move for both our franchisees and for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. John, please go ahead. Your line is now open. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. Obviously, quick service in the US and in Europe has been driven by a very high amount of average ticket increase over 2019, at least. And a lot of that has been price but also the consumer trading up on the menu larger sizes. What have you premiumization, there's been a lot of different factors of that. I was wondering if you, kind of see - I don't know if I want to see risk or opportunity for kind of an unwind of that to some extent. Obviously, quick service over time is firstly the franchisors of quick-service have been very focused on driving incremental transactions, because it's very rare where an incremental transaction doesn't drive incremental profit.  So, do we have an opportunity, I guess over time to kind of think about a higher transaction-driven model, higher dollar profit-driven model that actually might sacrifice percent margin. I mean, it's we came off a such an unusual period, ticket growth over the next four years. I am wondering kind of how you see the future in terms of the direction of ticket and transactions? David Gibbs : Yeah, thanks for the question, John. You're absolutely right. Obviously, one of the first things that got disrupted in the pandemic was sort of transactions and ticket size. The one thing I would add to the list as you mentioned is also party size. As we became much more of an off-premise delivery business, we did see a number of parties per ticket go up.  So that neither translated to a slight decline in transactions, but not in the number of eaters in our business. But the great news is for this quarter, we had good transaction growth in our businesses. And that's what I when I was talking about a more return to normal. We are seeing more individual meal occasions let the party sites go back down which I think it's just the reality of coming out of the pandemic. And our business is growing transactions and growing share all around the world. So, I think you're probably right. We're going to get back into that kind of environment and that just not to sound like a broken record, but I feel like we're winning playing that game. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David, please go ahead. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thank you. What's alike in the quarter with the unit growth, the KFC results, that the 30% digital sales growth too. I'm wondering, though I know there's going to be some curiosity about Pizza Hut, particularly in the US. And then just maybe a comment about whether you see this thing - this division being an ongoing stable same-store sales grower.  I wanted to ask because a lots happened and there has improved marketing, innovation like Melts, the third-party delivery, the systems and a lot more profitable today, but big competitors now doing business with third-party delivery and comps were slower in the quarter. So, also I'm sure there's going to be some curiosity about how you think the brand will do in a slowing economy. So, any sort of thoughts about how you think that brand is positioned well, to be an ongoing same-store sales positive brand? Thanks. David Gibbs : Great. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first and then I'll let Chris talked about the aggregator landscape. First of all, on Pizza Hut, big picture, 7% system sales growth in the quarter is on algorithm. There you can see our nice contributor to Yum!\u2019s overall growth and really importantly, they're gaining share in the category. If you do the numbers on relative to some of their peers. So, we love what\u2019s going on at Pizza Hut. And a lot of that is the leadership team, Aaron Powell, and the team that he's built leading that brand are doing a lot of things differently.  You're seeing them innovate with things like Melts, which is bringing in a lot more individual occasions, accessing incremental business for us. The other thing about the way they're operating, which gives me a lot of confidence in the future is, we're able to run brand like a global brand. That hasn't always been the case. So what you saw with Melts for example, is they are now already in over 50% of the stores around the world.  That's sort of unprecedented for us to be able. You want something in the US, it works pretty well, but every market got their own challenges. You got supply chain challenges. You got different business cases. But they've got the whole world united sharing data, sharing best practices and that is only leading to a stronger business for us at Pizza Hut. So, we I think we're pretty happy with where we are at pizza, particularly when you're on algorithm and gaining share, that's a pretty good starting point.  I'll let Chris talk a little bit about that aggregator space and how we're thinking about the competitors there. Christopher Turner : Yeah, look, on the aggregator front by zoom way out at a Yum! level, we're very pleased with our aggregator approach around the globe and the result that's produced in each of our brands and in large number of markets around the globe. In Pizza Hut, and specifically in Pizza Hut US, we implemented last year and we've been pleased with the incremental customers that we found on the marketplaces and the incremental delivery capacity that we've been able to utilize when needed.  Of course, keep in mind, this was always our strategy. I wasn't here in 2018 when the leadership team started this aggregator strategy. But recall that, we knew that team knew that aggregators would have an impact on the industry. We wanted to be where the customers wanted to transact with us and we made an investment in one of the aggregators that gave us a front row seat to understanding how this space would evolve.  And remember, it was our Pizza Hut CEO who actually sat on the Board of that aggregator. That experience helped to define our strategy. We always intended to implement in Pizza Hut and it's gone as planned. And of course, going forward, we think we have some differentiating capabilities that will help us sustain our competitive advantage in pizza with the aggregators. One of those is Dragontail, which helps to optimize the delivery operations in our restaurants including our interface with the aggregators, plus, we've got some first-mover advantages around marketing expertise and talents in that space that we think will help us continue to drive that business going forward in Pizza Hut. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Brian Harbour : Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about some of the kind of cost trends that your franchisees are seeing. Obviously, we can kind of see your company store margins. Be curious if that\u2019s also true for a lot of your franchisees on food cost? Is some of that favorability starting to show in other markets? Or do you think that'll be more about 2024 as they sort of past weekend placements? David Gibbs : Yeah, good question. Our focus is on ensuring that we always providing strong relative value to our customers. And that our franchisees always have strong unit economics in the long run. That second piece of course is a key driver of our differentiated development capability. If we think about where unit economics are around the globe, they are still very strong.  Now from a market-to-market standpoint, you've got puts and takes in terms of the timing of when inflation is hitting the market. The nature of it. In developed markets, we believe we're past the point of peak year-over-year inflation. And that's part of what David was mentioning in terms of a return to a more normal operating environment.  In some emerging markets, that those inflationary ways were a bit delayed relative to developed markets. But in all markets, we are using our scale to offset as much of those inflationary pressures as we can. We're optimizing business model with the franchisees and of course, we use pricing as needed to help ensure the unit economics remain strong while still providing that strong relative value.  You think about our development results in the quarter up to 1,025 units open. That's the best evidence that unit economics remain strong. Our 3C franchisees continue to put their capital to work. Jodi Dyer : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David, please go ahead. Your line is now open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. My question, Chris, is on the G&A outlook. I was wondering if you could, I think you gave us an actual dollar number the last time. I was just wondering, if you could maybe clarify what that number looks like now with the higher bonus accruals? And then, I guess secondly, just as you think longer term about G&A, if you could just update us on your thoughts on where that should sit on a long-term basis as a percentage of system sales. That would be great. Thanks. Christopher Turner : Yeah, thanks, David. Overall, on G&A, we take a lean philosophy. We talked about that before and that implies that we will invest in areas that drive long-term growth, help in the business and we're going to be efficient on everything else. We came into the year that was - with a plan that was consistent with that philosophy. That plan is largely intact. But as we said in the back part of the year, we will see modestly higher G&A relative to that initial plan.  And the primary driver of that is higher incentive comp owing to our strong performance. Of course, as you think about next year, that incentive comp resets each year. But that's been the primary driver on the change in the plan. We talked earlier about the color on the back part of the year around Q3 looking similar to first half and then a year-over-year decline in Q4.  But net-net it\u2019s on the full year we expect G&A leverage and of course, our long-term algorithm implies G&A leverage in the business. So, I think it's - that gives you a pretty good picture of how we're thinking about it and how the results are playing out. David Gibbs : Thanks Chris and I'll wrap up. I do want to thank everybody for being on the call and just reiterate, this was another really strong quarter for Yum! with widespread growth all brands contributing, system sales at all of our brands were 100 above algorithm and that 19% percent system sales number at KFC is something to be proud of. And we're doing, we're getting those results the right way. It's all about the digital growth, the development, our franchisees being profitable, and a lot of that comes back to the talent that we have at Yum! I was pleased to announce this quarter that, Sean is taking over for Mark. Very few companies have that kind of talent in place to just step in and we know we won't miss a beat and he'll take the business to a higher level of Taco Bell.  I will share one fun stat with you if you haven't done the math on this, just in the last two and a half years, we have added 10,000 new gross unit to the Yum! system. That's nearly 20% of our stores were built in the last two and a half years. Do you think about our brands with 60 plus years operating history, but they couldn't be more new and fresh to consumers and they couldn't really be performing any better if you think about the results for the quarter.  So, truly astounding. I want to thank all of our team members and our franchise partners that helped bring that growth to life every day. And thank you all for being on the call. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes today's conference and you may now disconnect.",

Now, I like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I go over our third quarter results, I'd like to express our deep concern for those affected by the ongoing violence in Israel and Gaza. The safety of our people in the region is our utmost priority and in addition to staying in close contact with our local team members and franchisees, our franchise restaurants in the region are only open when it is safe for staff and customers. The Yum! is supporting affected employees and contributing to humanitarian organizations that are providing critical aid. Our heartfelt wishes for the safety and well-being of innocent civilians and families in the region impacted by this conflict. Turning to our third quarter results, which once again reflect our ability to grow our iconic brands globally through our recipe for good growth. I'm proud to share that we delivered 10% system sales growth, led by 6% same store sales growth and 6% unit growth. We set a Q3 record on unit development, opening an incredible 1,130 gross new units in the quarter. Our digital sales growth remains on fire, with sales up more than 20% year-over-year and digital sales setting a record by exceeding $7 billion. Our third quarter core operating profit grew an impressive 16%. KFC International and Taco Bell US, which collectively contribute approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit, fueled this quarter's growth. Together, these twin growth engines delivered a remarkable 13% system sales growth in the quarter. KFC International has the most units among quick service restaurants in 60 countries and has been adding more absolute units than any other retail brand in the world since 2021. Of course, Taco Bell US is in a class of its own in the domestic QSR category as a culturally iconic brand and clear leader in value perception with the most crave-worthy food in the industry. Taco Bell has unmatched menu flexibility, exceptional pricing power, industry-leading unit economics, and world-class franchise partners. Both businesses are performing at extremely high levels and have ambitious plans to accelerate their growth to even greater heights. Now let me discuss the quarter's results in greater detail through the lens of two of our growth drivers, relevant, easy, and distinctive, or Red Brands, and unrivaled culture and talent. Red Brands are the cornerstone of our strategy and the way we bring this to life continues to evolve as consumers' behaviors shift and new trends are established. Over the past quarter, we've made significant progress in three specific initiatives : building sales layers through new category entry points; leveraging technology to drive brand loyalty; and delivering exciting value offers to broaden appeal. Our brand teams are galvanized around these three focus areas, and we are highly encouraged by the results these areas are driving in our divisions, which I will now highlight. Starting with the KFC division, which grew system sales 12% this quarter, driven by 8% unit growth and 6% same-store sales growth. While much of KFC's recent momentum has been led by emerging markets, this quarter we saw a broad-based strength across a more diverse group of geographies, further proof of our ability to win in any macro environment. A few markets with standout same-store sales growth performance include Africa at 9% growth, Australia with 9% growth, and Latin America and Caribbean at 8%. KFC's hand-breaded original recipe nuggets are a global innovation platform and represent a new category entry point to attract individuals and families. After a successful launch in the US, we expanded nuggets to our Latin America and Caribbean market this quarter and saw incredible consumer reception that helped drive significant sales. The team plans to expand the offering to several more places around the world. KFC Africa delivered their 11th consecutive quarter of same store sales growth with a combination of abundant value offers, strong e-commerce sales, and the relaunch of their breakfast campaign driving this quarter's performance. Finally, I want to highlight our KFC Australia business as they continue to deliver fantastic performance with kiosk sales growing more than 90% compared to last year and the advent of a highly personalized value campaign that drove significant own channel sales. The KFC Global team is also making great progress in expanding its loyalty program around the world, including in the US, where we soon expect to launch KFC Rewards. Next I'll discuss our Taco Bell division, which delivered 11% system sales growth in Q3, led by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. At Taco Bell US, system sales grew 11% with an impressive 8% same-store sales growth and 3% unit growth. The Taco Bell team leveraged its magic formula that encompasses a balanced set of commercial strategies including building brand buzz, unparalleled value, mass occasions, and digital initiatives to grow transactions during the quarter. They delivered unparalleled value with the return of fan favorites like the $5 box, an amazing platform at a compelling price point. Though Taco Bell featured a great value promotion in the quarter, value purchases remained within range of the brand's intended 10% mix target. This, combined with exciting innovation and brand buzz, helped the brand maintain its industry-leading margins of 24%. A key component of the magic formula is mass occasions, the brand's personal expression of building new category entry points. One such example is the growth in chicken offerings, which the team plans to further expand with the launch of its Cantina menu. We're excited about the impact these new menu items will have as we roll out these offerings in 2024. Another component of this brand success is digital, which includes loyalty. While a Taco Bell loyalty customer already spends 40% more per year than a traditional customer, the consumer feedback we've received indicates that we can do an even better job at creating more obvious and exciting ways to both earn and redeem rewards. Starting next year, Taco Bell will enhance its loyalty program and provide easier access across channels to earn and redeem points. Additionally, members will enjoy more exclusive experiences, including more digital innovation, early access to new products, and loyalty-enabled experiences. Eventually, the team will integrate its loyalty program with digital menu boards to create an even more personalized experience. Taco Bell International delivered 16% system sales growth driven by 23% unit growth and 1% same store sales growth. A key contributor to Taco Bell's International business has been robust digital sales, which increased nearly 45% year-over-year this quarter. The Global Taco Tuesday campaign that launched in June continued to drive customer engagement around the globe, bringing greater brand awareness and equity with consumers. The international markets are focused on amplifying National Taco Day and providing consumers with both craveable food and everyday value. Turning to the pizza division, which grew system sales 4% driven by 4% unit growth and 1% same store sales growth. International same store sales grew 2%, driven by transaction growth in China, continued momentum in melts, and more strategically activating aggregator partnerships in international markets. Same store sales results in the US were flat as Pizza Hut leaned into its long-term strategy to build new category entry points through individual meal occasions with products like melts and wings. This quarter, Pizza Hut US teamed up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to relaunch our Big New Yorker Pizza and deliver pizzas into the New York City subway stations, leading to over 1 billion media impressions. As we head into the fourth quarter, the Pizza Hut US team launched a late night initiative, strategically expanding operating hours in more than 1,000 restaurants to give consumers even more ways to access the brand. To wrap up with the Habit Burger Grill, system sales grew 4%, driven by 8% unit growth. The new Habit leadership team is settling in well and has placed a distinct focus on building strong unit level economics to set the brand up for long-term success. Of note, the team is developing a new cost-effective packaging range designed for off-premise occasions along with a new prototype store to optimize CapEx and pre-opening costs. The habit is set to launch its first everyday value platform in November called Simple Crafts after a successful test this quarter. We have tremendous confidence in the long-term prospects of this brand and are encouraged by the improvements that the team is making to deliver success in the future. Now, I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. We've held powerful forums this quarter supporting our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver, including a leadership development conference for underrepresented talent and a new program aimed at preparing high potential female talent to be part of the next generation of senior leadership. In addition, we're furthering our culture of collaboration and building capability across our company. Recently, a cross-brand group of leaders gathered for the first Red innovation experience in our innovation lab, where they learned design thinking and real-time problem-solving through new age innovation techniques. We're also making a meaningful impact in the communities we serve through our global unlocking opportunity initiative to create more equality. For example, in the UK, KFC partnered with a nonprofit with the goal of having one-third of its new hires be at-risk use. In Sri Lanka, Pizza Hut is investing in the development of 30 vocational and technical training facilities to prepare youth for careers in the QSR industry. In terms of our planet pillar and our focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we're educating suppliers through the supplier leadership and climate transition, a consortium of multinational companies created to accelerate climate action in the supply chain. Many of Yum!'s poultry, beef and dairy suppliers in key markets have joined this program or already have emissions reduction goals. These are just a few of the examples of the great work of our teams, earning us recognition like Newsweek's 2023 America's Greenest Companies. Overall, we're incredibly pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date. Our strategy is clear and the emphasis we are placing on building sales layers through new category entry points, leveraging technology to drive brand loyalty, and delivering exciting value offers to broaden appeal is going to drive our business forward even faster. As we conclude our internal annual operating plan reviews and look forward to 2024, it's clear we have the very best teams in place and are perfectly set up to capture an even greater share of a growing global QSR market and deliver compelling shareholder value going forward. With that, Chris, over to you. Christopher Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development, and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. I'll begin by discussing our strong results for Q3. We achieved 10% system sales growth, driven by 6% same store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Our digital sales channels continue to grow with digital sales setting another record this quarter, exceeding $7 billion, an increase of more than 20% year-over-year. Core operating profit grew an impressive 16%. Taco Bell delivered another quarter of exceptional performance, achieving 24% restaurant-level margins, while simultaneously driving transaction growth. Global ex-special general and administrative expenses were $263 million, lower than expected, in part, due to timing, with some expenses shifting into the fourth quarter. Our ex-special tax rate of 19% was lower year-over-year. Lastly, our EPS excluding special items, was $1.44 per share. Ex-Special EPS was positively impacted by $0.05 of unrealized investment gains related to our investment in Devyani. I'd now like to give a little bit of color on the remainder of the year. We're proud to say that we continue to expect that our results will land well above our long-term growth algorithm for the full year, including achieving low double-digit core operating profit growth. On the fourth quarter specifically, we now expect an operating loss at Habit of approximately $10 million, largely driven by restaurant asset impairment charges, which will be higher than we had initially expected due to anticipated impacts from the California Assembly Bill 1228 previously referred to as the FAST Act. Even with the previously mentioned timing shift of G&A expenses, we still expect fourth-quarter G&A to be slightly lower year-over-year. Moving to reported operating profit, we now expect foreign currency translation to represent a $45 million to $55 million headwind on a full year basis. Finally, we expect our ex-special full year tax rate to land at approximately 20%. Next, I'll cover our bold restaurant development growth driver. We are on track to finish 2023 with net new unit development similar to the record-breaking performances of the last two years. This quarter's 6% growth in unit count, led by a Q3 record of 1,130 gross new openings across 65 countries, reflects the continued success of our multi-year effort to accelerate development across our brands. By now, you've seen the announcement at Yum! China's recent investor conference raising their unit growth expectations for our brands in China. This announcement highlights continued strong returns on new restaurant development in our brands, in combination with the best in class development capabilities that Yum! China's leadership team have built in the market. More broadly, we continue to see excitement for our brands all around the world. As an example, in Vietnam, a market with a high population, but relatively low Yum! restaurant penetration, our unit count increased by over 40 units versus last year, reflecting 16% growth. In total this quarter, KFC achieved 8% unit growth, including 664 gross new units, a Q3 record for the brand. This was led by Yum! China, along with our franchisees in India, Sapphire and Devyani, and IS Holdings in Turkey. At Pizza Hut, we opened 383 gross new units with more than 30 markets contributing to this growth. Our Taco Bell division opened 74 gross new units led by the US, China, and India. In the midst of a higher interest rate environment, our world-class 3C franchise partners are stepping up and investing to grow share. One of those exceptional franchisees is the [Serrano] (ph) Group, our partner for KFC in multiple countries in Latin America. In just the past three years, the Serrano Group has opened over 100 net new units, quadrupling their store count from the past 10 years and building world-class assets that reflect how dynamic and tech-forward our brand is in this region. Building a network of growth-minded franchise partners is no easy task. It requires persistent effort to identify and engage with like-minded partners to consistently deliver on brand standards, growth ambitions, and mutually shared financial objectives, all of which add up to long-term profitable growth for all parties and a competitive advantage for our brands. While we focus on having the right partners, we also work to ensure we have the right restaurant formats and economic models in place. All of our brands are laser-focused on delivering industry-leading franchisee returns by continuously optimizing new store CapEx, as well as maintaining a flexible portfolio of formats that meet the unique needs of each trade zone in which we operate. Taco Bell's newest small box design, GoMobile 2.0, now open in El Paso, Texas, builds on the original GoMobile concept. This new design leverages digital capabilities to create more touch points for consumers to order and pick up in a seamless manner. Moving on to our unmatched operating capability growth driver, we continue to focus on delivering a seamless digital experience for our consumers, enabling easier operations for our team members and harnessing our expansive data to make fast and informed decisions. We frame up this approach through three lenses : easy experiences; easy operations; and easy insights. Within easy experiences, we successfully rolled out the Yum! Commerce platform to the Taco Bell system last quarter and are in the process of rolling the platform out to the Pizza Hut US system. Transitioning our brands onto Yum! own platforms allows us to scale new capabilities at a rapid pace and build out an ecosystem of proprietary platforms that are designed to work together in a secure and seamless fashion. Our primary focus is to deliver leading edge capabilities to our franchisees with advantaged economics. And our franchisees continue to co-invest with us as we develop and roll out our solutions. One exciting area of growth is the implementation of in-store kiosks. We now have kiosks in nearly 40% of KFC stores outside of China, all of our Taco Bell US locations, excluding licensed stores, and almost 70% of our Habit locations. Looking forward for our KFC stores outside of China, we expect to drive a 20-point increase in our kiosk penetration next year on the way to reaching the vast majority of stores by the end of 2026. Kiosks not only drive a higher check compared to our traditional front counter, but also drive higher margins through operational efficiencies and generate new opportunities to leverage customer data and create personalized ordering experiences. Within easy operations, we're on track to have our recommended ordering technology, which we're calling AIM, or Automated Inventory Management, rolled out across our KFC US system by year end. As a reminder, this is an in-house developed AI module that predicts and suggests the quantity of each product a restaurant general manager should order. We now have AIM in place at over 7,000 U.S. Restaurants, including 2,700 KFC US Restaurants added over the past quarter. There is also great momentum behind the Dragontail rollout. We have deployed Dragontail, an AI-driven production and delivery sequencing platform to nearly 1,400 Pizza Hut US stores as of the end of the quarter and are on track to have Dragontail deployed to around 8,000 restaurants globally by year end. Further proof of our unique ability to scale Yum! own technologies around the world. We have made significant progress in 2023, building, testing, and refining our proprietary technology platforms. In 2024, we will further scale these platforms and continue to realize the value of our owned tech ecosystem. Finally, we are excited about the new technologies. Our Red innovation team is in the early stages of piloting in restaurants to support our franchisees and free up team member time to allow them to focus even more on delivering world-class customer experiences. First, we are testing a voice-enabled AI drive-through platform in a couple of our restaurants in California that elevates the drive-through experience, increases speed, productivity and efficiencies, and generates automated upsell recommendations. Second, we have developed a proprietary automated drinks fulfillment system that frees up team member time and increases drive-through speed and accuracy. We've designed these technologies to integrate seamlessly with our proprietary Poseidon point of sale platform and we look forward to continuing to test, refine, and pilot these capabilities. Wrapping up with our easy insights pillar, I'm very excited by the progress we have made in building the infrastructure and engineering capabilities required to harness the power of our global data assets. We continue to expand the Yum! global data hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics. We believe this centralized hub is a key asset and differentiator for Yum! as we develop leading AI capabilities. In 2024, our easy Insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the global data hub and integrate into our own technology platforms. Some examples of these AI-driven capabilities include personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations, and dynamic restaurant routines for restaurant general managers. Finally, we will begin activating our US cross-brand customer data platform in Q4 and throughout 2024. This cross-brand platform gives us unprecedented visibility into the ordering behaviors of millions of customers across our four brands, and will also be a breakthrough source of learnings for Collider, the high-impact, boutique, insights consultancy that we acquired in 2015. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. As a reminder, our capital priorities remain unchanged. Invest in the business for the long term, maintain a resilient balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend, and maximize shareholder value by returning excess capital through debt paydowns and share repurchases. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, reflecting $57 million in gross CapEx and $26 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.4 times. Furthermore, our current outstanding debt has a weighted average maturity of six years, and our greater than 90% fixed debt ratio remains highly attractive in the current market environment. To wrap up, we're very proud of the results in this quarter. We are on a clear path to achieving double-digit core operating profit growth for the full year. We continue to strengthen our position as the global franchisor of choice, a testament to the success of our business strategies and industry-leading talent. We're proud of our incredible continued momentum on unit development and are excited as we further accelerate our tech deployments and AI initiatives to meet the demands of consumers both today and tomorrow. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is open. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. David, my question is on the broader consumer spending backdrop that you're seeing. I'm just wondering if you could maybe comment on some of your major markets and what you're seeing, I guess, exiting the third quarter as we've seen some signs that the environment is going to get a bit more challenging in places like the U.S. and in China? So just wondering if you could opine on what's happening with the consumer and also talk about what, if anything, you're changing in your strategy to address that? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, David. I guess, I would start by saying, if you haven't picked up on it, this is our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit system sales growth globally. So when you think about the consumer and what we're seeing in our business, obviously, it's a pretty good trading environment for us, and that momentum continued into Q3. And I'll also share that, that momentum is continuing into Q4. So now, part of that is the way that we're managing through some of the consumer pressures around the world. And certainly, you talked about China having their challenges. But there's challenges in every market. The UK, for example, we've got a lot of consumers faced with variable rate mortgages that's pressuring them. So our local UK team has put in place a program to have a Twister of the Day for GBP1.98, which is really resonating with consumers. And they're having in the midst of a good strong year in the UK. In Latin America and Caribbean, I was just down in that market with our great franchisee [Juan Carlo Serrano] (ph), visiting our stores in Colombia and Chile, looking at a new model that they've developed using a commissary which really improves the efficiency of our stores and the quality of product to allow us to provide even more value to customers in a pressured consumer environment. So certainly, there are pressures out there, but our franchisees, I think, do a better job than most by far, of navigating those pressures. I know what's on a lot of people's minds is what's going on in the US. It's well documented that there is more pressure on the US consumers doing loan payments coming due. And certainly, our industry has softened a little bit, but the industry is doing better than most industries, if you look at any of the industry-specific data. For us, though, the US is a much more favorable situation because Taco Bell is the majority of our sales and profits in the US. You saw the great results we put up for Taco Bell in the US this quarter. On a one and two year basis, sales accelerated in Q3. But really importantly, and this wasn't in the prepared remarks, I know you'll find it of interest, if we break down the Taco Bell stores in the United States by income demographic, we see really consistent 2% to 3% transaction growth across all income levels. So our stores in lower-income trade areas are performing well with good transaction growth, just like our stores in high-income trade areas. I think that speaks to the way Taco Bell can play value with things like the $5 box. And how also in a pressured consumer environment, we're probably benefiting a little bit from some trade down in those higher income trade areas. So, our lens on the consumer is obviously biased, but we're putting up strong results. We're seeing plenty of demand and we, once again, I think, are demonstrating we can thrive in any environment. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you very much. Obviously, you continue to talk about the Yum! owned proprietary technology platforms, which really are geared for making it easier for franchisees to run stores and, of course, more profitable as well. And over years, I mean, certainly, you're doing much more of that, not less. And the rollouts are continuing, and I imagine new programs will be developed in the future. Can you kind of talk about maybe the context of Yum! as a technology services provider. And should we, in our models, longer term, start to think something like percentage of franchise system sales that you can actually earn as this technology service provider for your franchisees? Christopher Turner : Yes. Hi, John. Look, our Yum! technology strategy, which we reengineered in 2018 and launched in 2019 has driven tremendous results in the system. We were at roughly $12 billion in digital sales in 2019. We'll be close to $30 billion this year, just tremendous growth. And we like everything about those digital sales dollars. Our customers, they have higher checks, higher frequency whenever we transition sales to digital, plus we get all of the benefits in terms of more efficient operations, which help our franchisees sustain strong unit economics. So the primary focus of all that is to drive profitable growth for Yum! and our franchisees. And of course, our top priority there is to give our franchisees leading-edge tech capabilities with advantaged economics. That's what we're focused on doing. Now we have invested ahead of that. I think we shared at the Investor Day in December that over the last three years, we've shifted an incremental 10 points of G&A toward digital and technology. So we've made investments. We've continued to do that. But as we implement, and you see this fast pace of implementations continuing to accelerate, franchisees do share in those investments in the form of fees tied to those technologies. Of course, they do that because they see benefits flow to their bottom line. The business case on these technologies are strong. As we collect more and more of those fees, that will alleviate some of the P&L burden of the technology investments. We're not going to provide forecasts on how we see that playing out, but that will be one dynamic in the P&L. Operator : The next question today comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. As maybe a follow-up to that, and then I have a primary question, maybe you could give a feeling of what from here you think will be the biggest lifts from perhaps a technology hub that you talked about, quantify perhaps some areas where you think in 2024 and beyond, we'll see the biggest help to comps or franchisee margins. And I just wonder also on Taco Bell, you mentioned a new loyalty relaunch. I think that, that brand, a lot of people would think would be in a great position to gain share and perhaps in accelerating degree in 2024. Do you agree with that? And then if that were to happen, what would be the biggest reasons for that? You mentioned loyalty, but perhaps there's some other things in the hopper. In the past, you talked about lunch being an area that you wanted to win in. So I just wanted to discuss a little bit about Taco Bell. Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes. Let me share some thoughts on technology to start, and then we'll shift over to Taco Bell. So on the broader technology program. As I mentioned, we like everything about those digital sales dollars as we continue to grow the digital business. We made tremendous progress. But as we've also said, I still feel like we're in the early innings of getting maximum impact out of the broader digital strategy. Of course, it goes across easy experiences, easy operations, easy insights, and we're still in the early days of bringing all of those elements together in common stores. And we really think there'll be a multiplicative effect as we implement more and more of these technologies together. If I just took, for example, the labor productivity benefits, helping our team members make their jobs easier in the stores, focus more of their time on customers and help our franchisees drive productivity, as you bring more of these elements together, you're able to take advantage of more of those productivity benefits. So as we start to layer the Poseidon POS, which makes running the front end easier, as we continue to take digital sales higher, which reduces the workload burden on taking orders and taking payments, you get higher accuracy on order taking, which reduces some of the rework and back of house. And then you bring on things that we mentioned earlier, voice AI at the drive-thru, fizz automation in terms of automated drink fulfillment, which works with the Poseidon POS, you really start to see a vision for the future where you've got a really great customer experience that you're delivering with high productivity for the franchisees. So we expect on this to continue to build and build. If we go to Taco Bell, you mentioned the loyalty program. Loyalty, more broadly, across our brands is a key focus area. We've been at north of 50% of all of our stores around the globe as part of a loyalty program, and that is continuing to grow. We've now implemented in the Middle East. KFC US is coming on later this year, and we continue to refine the way our loyalty programs work. You mentioned Taco Bell. They are now starting to really leverage the insights that we've generated from the early days of that program to refine the program over time. And we've implemented the Red 360, which is the first time we're bringing together insights across our brands in the US. So that will be a driver of Taco Bell growth. More broadly, on the strategy, as you mentioned, category entry points or use occasions is a big focus. We think there's a massive opportunity at lunch. We continue to focus on breakfast. You've probably seen the ads recently during sporting events. So all of those are part of the bright future ahead for Taco Bell. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Charles of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. Another Taco Bell question. Obviously, very encouraging 3Q performance and commentary about the start of 4Q. I was hoping you could elaborate on the Cantina menu coming in 2024. I recall this menu item driving success in 2012, but was more upscale compared to US consumer that you guys noted is increasingly seeking value today. So, can you help just us better understand the difference between the upcoming menu versus the one launched a decade ago? David Gibbs : Sure. Look, I think one thing Taco Bell does incredibly well in the industry is constantly change and evolve to consumers taste. I wouldn't draw an exact parallel to the past Cantina menu. This is more about the chicken Cantina menu or Cantina chicken in terms of what that protein can do for us and launching a different version of our chicken. So I think the team's excited about the impact they can have. But there's lots of reasons to be excited about what Taco Bell is doing in 2024. As Chris mentioned, all the impact that the tech can have, the insights we're going to glean from data. Taco Tuesday, now that we've established that in the way that we can leverage that going forward. The momentum we're getting in breakfast, what we can do with loyalty. The business is, obviously, somewhat on a roll. If you look at the results from the last quarter, and I mentioned those trends are continuing. And so much of that gets right back to the great talent that we have at Taco Bell. Sean Tresvant is taking over and he's got a great team in place and if you've seen the actual detailed plans for next year, you'd be as excited as I am. I obviously, not going to share a lot of the proprietary stuff. But things line up well for a strong 2024 for Taco Bell. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Mullan of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Mullan : Hi. Thanks. Another one on Taco Bell, but this one is just specific to the international business. At the Investor Day last year, you shared a goal to get to 2,500 locations as quickly as you can. Related to that, as we look out over the next year, what kind of annual case do you think you can get to from a gross openings perspective? And then if you could just comment on the opportunity for Taco Bell in China, specifically, may be your level of optimism there, that would be great to hear your current thinking. David Gibbs : Yes. Obviously, Taco Bell International is an exciting part of the growth equation for Yum!. We don't provide brand-by-brand development targets, and so we're not going to waver from that. But you know our overall development goals are incredibly ambitious, opening up a new unit every other hour around the world. And as you can see from this quarter that we set a record on development this quarter. As far as Taco Bell in the various markets around the world. Yes, I just got back from a trip to Spain, where I spent some time with our great franchisee in Spain, one of the early adopters of Taco Bell that got to scale quicker than other mark. And you can see, he's done an amazing job of building a moat around the business and creating a differentiated brand much like in the US and now they're reaping the benefits from that and have very aggressive expansion. But when any time you're taking a brand global that's been traditionally a US brand, you're going to -- it's not going to be an even path all the way to the top. There's going to be ups and downs, some market take off, other markets take a pause. So I think in aggregate, we're very excited about the opportunity for Taco Bell around the world. We think it can be a meaningful growth driver in our equation long term. But we're going to make sure that everywhere we go, we're helping our franchisees build the brand the right way, take whatever time that takes, like we did in Spain and the UK to establish the brand in a way that ensures its long-term success. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious, either David or Chris, perhaps you could shed some light on what you think could happen with the NLRB recent joint employer ruling? It's set to go into effect on 12/26 of this year. And curious to know what your thoughts are, whether or not it does go into effect and how it might impact the relationship between franchisee-franchisor in the US over time and potential impacts on your own P&L? David Gibbs : Yes. Sure. Yes. Look, I'd start big picture. We've been navigating regulatory environments in 160 countries around the world, and they're always constantly changing. And certainly, the NLRB recent ruling and whether or not that goes into effect, it will have an impact on us. But it's nothing that I don't think we can -- we'll have trouble navigating in the long term. Look, I've seen our business grow around the United States. I've known -- a lot of our franchisees are good friends of mine for decades. I've seen them start as team members and grow to become successful small business people. And I do think the franchising model is one that's great for our country. It's living the American dream. It's good for the communities that we serve. And we oppose anything that threatens that model, and I know that there is opposition to that ruling in terms of whether it will actually take effect at the end of the year. But it's really less of an issue for Yum!, if you think about the landscape that we operate in. Our franchisees tend to be much larger. We tend to run more of a decentralized model globally and even in the US because our franchisees have a lot more capability. So I have no doubt that whatever the rules are that we have to operate by, we will be able to, as we've proven all around the world over many, many decades. But this one, obviously, in the short term is something we oppose and we'll have to see how it plays out. Operator : Our next question today is from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Wondering if you could comment a little bit more on both KFC and Pizza Hut in the US. Solid gains in general over the years from the work the teams have done. But wondering if you could just frame up how to think about how the brands are positioned in the US right now within their respective categories? And where they can go given some of the opportunities that you've highlighted. Thank you. David Gibbs : Sure. Yes, obviously, we're really pleased with the progress we're making on both of those businesses. Pizza Hut US, for example, has been taking share in the category now for, I think, third consecutive clear. And that -- from all the things that we've talked about on these calls and that you're all seeing in the marketplace, the way that they play the aggregators versus their competition, the way they're launching new products and new forms like Melts, which brings in a new consumer. More recently, you probably saw the announcement about late night and how we're owning that part of the category. So, Aaron Powell and David Graves, their teams are really leaning in and they're on their front foot with Pizza Hut. It's a tough category, of course, but one we're really pleased with the progress we're making. Similarly, KFC, you've seen us do things like launch nuggets and lean in more on the boneless. That's a huge opportunity. It's no secret that chicken is a growing category. We've got the world's greatest chicken brand. We're set up for success there as we evolve our business. And the team that we've got in place there, also a relatively new team, I think, is doing an amazing job of rolling out those kinds of programs that will lead to incremental sales, incremental category entry points as we talked about earlier on the call. So both businesses, I think, poised for lots of growth. Matt Morris : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from Brian Harbour of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Brian. Brian Harbour : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I was going to ask about Pizza Hut as well. And if you could provide any comments on kind of delivery versus carryout performance, also how -- if a third party is still kind of a growing channel for you? And then I know there's disparities by market, which is growing faster. And what explains some of them do you think that in the US I think it's fair to say that competition is quite significant right now and will be into next year, but do you think that the US can grow on a same-store basis next year? David Gibbs : Yes, obviously, we believe Pizza Hut can and will grow sales. In terms of delivery, one aspect of this maybe is underappreciated is the fact that we now have delivery as a service where we can outsource some of our deliveries through our aggregator partners, that actually was one of the unlocks for us to go after late night when it may have been a little bit harder for us to staff with drivers, being able to hand off those deliveries to our aggregator partners allowed us to extend our hours. I think it's just another proof point in what a nice job the team is doing in thinking through the strategic benefits we can get from the various relationships we have in the category. But here, in a world where the consumer might be a little bit more pressure, obviously, carry out is playing a bigger role and lower price points will play a bigger role in the pizza category. That's one of the reasons why Melts, I think, has landed so well and will be a big part of the growth for Pizza Hut going forward. I appreciate everybody's time today. Obviously, this is a quarter that we're incredibly proud of, much like the last few quarters and never gets old, keep continuing to put up double-digit top line growth and strong bottom line growth. I'll just end with a few comments about what we saw as we went through our internal annual operating plan reviews in the last few weeks. It's something that you guys don't get a glimpse into. But I can tell you, the spirit in the rooms that -- when we met with the teams, the talent in the room that's displayed, and the way that everybody is sort of on their front foot now, we've got the -- all this work that we've done on technology over the last few years, firmly planted so that we now have something that we can leverage in a much bigger way to grow sales. I think our franchisee partnerships have never been better. And all of that adds up to what I thought were incredibly inspiring plans going forward to take market share, grow our businesses the right way for the long term and continue to put up results like you saw this quarter. So we're incredibly excited about the future. We look forward to talking to you on the next call about a little bit more detail about plans for 2024. Thanks, everybody, for your time today. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our results, I want to express our continued concern for those impacted by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our franchisees and employees in the region. Turning to 2023, it was a remarkable year for Yum! Brands as we crossed the $60 billion system sales threshold and exceeded all aspects of our long-term growth algorithm. Despite facing numerous challenges around the world, our incredible teams delivered another exceptional year of growth across our business. We set an industry development record for the third straight year. We made massive strides in scaling our proprietary digital and AI-driven ecosystem, and we continued to build a talent base that I believe is the best in the industry. We delivered 6% unit growth, 10% system sales growth, and 12% core operating profit growth. We entered 2024 having opened just shy of 10, 000 net new restaurants over the past three years and are well on our way to reaching 60, 000 restaurants this year. This growth would not be possible were not for our world-class franchise partners who continue to deploy their own capital based on their confidence to invest behind the long-term potential of our brand. Along with the record-breaking success we've had on development, our digital strategy has helped propel top-line results and improve bottom line profits. Digital sales approached $30 billion in 2023, up 22% year-over-year, with mix now exceeding 45%. At the same time, we have accelerated the deployment of our proprietary technologies to optimize back-of-house operations and make it easier to run our restaurants. In doing so, we are equipping our franchise partners with distinctive capabilities that differentiate them from the competition, especially in emerging markets. I'll now share some more details on the fourth quarter specifically. During the quarter, top line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. This represented a low single digit headwind to Yum!\u2019s overall fourth quarter same-store sales growth. This trend has continued into the first quarter and we expect the sales impact to decrease over the course of 2024. Key to our growth is the performance of our twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which account for approximately 70% of Yum! system sales and roughly 80% of Yum!\u2019s division operating profit. In 2023, KFC International opened nearly 2,700 new restaurants reaching 10% growth with restaurants opened across 96 countries. More than 80% of unit growth came from our 15 publicly traded franchisees. Entering 2024, I have strong confidence in the durability of KFC's global expansion, for which we continue to see an incremental 50, 000 restaurant opportunity over the long term. On a global basis, Taco Bell crossed the $15 billion system sales milestone this year, reflecting the growing scale of this powerhouse brand. Turning to Taco Bell U.S., which contributes more than 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit, the brand maintained its two year same-store sales trend in the fourth quarter, outperforming the QSR industry. Taco Bell continued to deliver industry-leading margins at 24% this year, while at the same time leading the QSR industry in several key value perception indicators. Now, I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or RED for short, followed by our unrivaled culture and talent and good growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our fourth quarter results and balance sheet position, followed by our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities. Starting with the KFC Division, which accounts for 50% of our divisional operating profit and will soon cross the incredible milestone of 30,000 units. For the year, system sales grew 12% with 8% unit growth and 7% same-store sales growth. For the quarter, KFC achieved 7% system sales growth, owing to 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. KFC China grew system sales by an impressive 20% during the quarter. We had several other standouts markets this quarter, including 16% system sales growth in Latin America and 13% system sales growth in both Africa and Thailand. In Latin America, we targeted new consumers and day parts using compelling value offers, and we expanded our KFC original nuggets. In Africa, the team boosted its breakfast day part with new beverages, including signature coffees at a great price. The Thailand market saw strong transaction growth driven by smart value offerings across all day parts. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were flat this quarter, with trends on a two year basis remaining consistent from the prior quarter. In Q1, the team has planned a range of exciting initiatives, including the Smash'd Potato Bowls, the first bowl innovation since 2019, and the rollout of KFC's first loyalty rewards program. Moving on to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 36% of our divisional operating profit. At Taco Bell U.S., fourth quarter same-store sales grew 3% and 15% on a two year basis, outperforming the QSR industry by three points. Taco Bell U.S. faced tough laps early in the quarter, but finished the year strong with comps up over 5% in the final period. The quarter included a record digital sales mix, which reached 31%, up 7 points year-over-year. Growth in kiosk sales was a large driver, with in-store kiosk sales mix increasing 15 points from Q4 last year. Optimizing our digital channels is also contributing to growth in Taco Bell's loyalty program, with active loyalty users growing 17% in 2023. The team plans to bring exciting enhancements to the loyalty program in the second half of 2024 to capitalize on digital engagement and provide an easier experience for customers to earn and redeem points. While not surprising, I'm always proud to see our incredible Taco Bell team's efforts being recognized, with Entrepreneur Magazine naming the brand the number one franchisor for the fourth year running, and with Nation\u2019s Restaurant News crowning Taco Bell the 2023 brand icon. With an unprecedented range of exciting innovations launching this year, including at least one new product every five weeks, twice the rate of 2023, I'm confident Taco Bell will remain a brand icon for years to come. At Taco Bell International, we delivered 14% unit growth this year. The majority of this growth was contributed by our big four scaled markets including Spain which opened 19 new units this year and is on track to reach 150 units in Q1. As we enter 2024, we will work with our franchise partners in these markets to build brand and category awareness with Mexican food, particularly in Europe and Asia, leaning into fan favorites and expanding protein offerings. Additionally, we are working on scaling and entering new markets that will enable a broader base from which to grow. Next at the Pizza Hut Division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit and will soon eclipse 20, 000 units. In Q4, system sales grew 1% with 4% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. For the full year, system sales grew 5%, including 4% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International, same-store sales were flat for the quarter. The team continues to roll out Melts across the globe to build the individual eater occasion. Strength in the aggregator channel continues to be a bright spot across several markets, including Canada and Latin America. Buy-one-get-one deals coupled with aggregator promotions drove transaction growth in Canada during the quarter. In Latin America, the promotion of our own digital channels in Brazil combined with the New York style pizza helped boost sales for that market. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 4% for the quarter while growing 1% for the full year. The Melts launch and the promotion of the Detroit-Style Pizza in the prior year contributed to a difficult lap this quarter. Pizza Hut U.S. will face another challenging lap in Q1 as same-store sales increased 8% last year, reflecting a full quarter of sales from the Melts platform and the Big New Yorker. However, we expect performance trends on a two year basis to improve in the first quarter. In Q1, the team will launch two limited time offers, including Hot Honey Pizza and Wings, a perfect pairing for fans to enjoy in the run-up to the Super Bowl. In the months ahead, the team will be announcing some exciting innovations to the melts platform. Lastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, for the full year, system sales grew 6%, led by 8% unit growth. Reflecting on 2023, Habit's new leadership team focused on improving all elements of Habit's operations, including expediting a robust kiosk rollout, implementing a sales-driven labor optimization model, and harnessing Yum!\u2019s Co-op purchasing group to lower procurement costs and rationalize SKUs. As a result of these efforts, the team achieved a 380 basis point increase in full year store level margins despite softness in sales. Now I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. We take great pride in developing our talent and ensuring we have a strong bench to drive performance and we were thrilled to be recognized in Time Magazine's inaugural list of the Best Companies for Future Leaders, with Yum! ranking an impressive 32nd among U.S. companies. The strength of our talent is evident through Sean Tresvant's official transition to Taco Bell Division CEO on January 1st. Sean joined Yum! in 2022 and is a visionary business leader with a proven track record of driving transformative brand building through his previous role as the Taco Bell Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. I'd like to again congratulate Sean as he takes the helm at Taco Bell and I'm confident he and the rest of the team will continue to successfully deliver the brand's long-term global growth strategy. I'd also be remiss if we didn't take another opportunity to recognize Mark King for everything he did as Taco Bell Division CEO to set the brand up for future success, including hand picking Sean as his successor and ensuring that Taco Bell would be in more than capable hands. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, I want to thank Mark for his people first leadership that drove strong results, inspired restless creativity and solidified Taco Bell's unique brand identity that makes it an undisputed global icon. Additionally, Pizza Global Chief Technology officer Joe Park will be moving into the Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer role currently held by Clay Johnson, who will continue as a Senior Advisor. I want to thank Clay for his incredible leadership since joining Yum! in 2019, including developing our digital and technology capabilities from the ground up and establishing Yum! as a clear leader in technology in global QSR. Since joining Yum! Joe formed our first ever long-range innovation team before moving on to Pizza Hut, our most digital brand, where he partnered with our global operations and technology leaders to deliver new levels of ease to our customers and improved unit economics for our franchisees. I'm confident he is the perfect person to lead us into the next chapter on our digital and technology journey. Moving on to the Planet pillar of our good growth strategy, in 2023 we remain focused on efforts under our priority areas of greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable packaging. We've made progress on our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 through investments in renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and through ongoing commitments with our food suppliers. In terms of packaging, we are increasing our global use of more widely recyclable plastics in our consumer packaging and we continue to remove plastic packaging in the form of bags and cutlery in addition to eliminating styrofoam. Our continued progress in sustainability has been underscored by several recent recognitions, including being named to the 2024 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the eighth consecutive year and being listed by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2024. Before I wrap, I want to pay tribute to our incredible partners at Yum! China. In December, my team and I traveled to Shanghai to meet with CEO Joey Wat and her executive team. That trip reinforced our view that Yum! China is without question the world's most capable restaurant operator. They enable rapid growth and structural cost efficiencies through their dynamic development capabilities and their robust in-house supply chain. Our team sampled amazing new menu items in their innovation kitchen, and we saw firsthand the digital capabilities that enable Yum! China to engage with an astounding 470 million members in its loyalty program. These advantages enable consistent paybacks of two to three years in KFC and Pizza Hut despite evolving market conditions, further testament to their clear competitive advantages in the market. As I look back over the last year, the unique advantages of our diversified system shone through, while the business faced persistent inflation across the globe and navigated shifts in consumer sentiment stemming from regional conflicts. We responded with a focused determination to execute our growth plan, including growing units in 110 countries, meaningfully scaling our technology systems, deepening collaboration across our brands, and delivering both sales and profits well above our long-term growth algorithms. We're confident 2024 will be another banner year with a number of exciting sales driving opportunities, such as enhancing the range of protein offerings at Taco Bell, expanding new category entry points, and significantly boosting the impact of our loyalty program. With a world class team, globally iconic brands, industry leading franchisees, and a relentless appetite for growth, the future is brighter than ever and I am confident that we will continue to maximize value for our shareholders. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2023 was an exceptional year with Yum! exceeding all components of our long-term growth algorithm. Full year, same-store sales grew a very robust 6%. We opened 4, 754 gross new units, the equivalent of 13 restaurants a day, or one restaurant roughly every two hours. KFC set a brand development record, opening over 2, 700 new units across 97 different countries. I also want to extend congratulations to the Yum! China team, who crossed 10, 000 KFC restaurants this quarter with nearly 40% of those restaurants built in the last three years. Turning to our results, full year system sales grew 10%, with fourth quarter system sales up 5%, led by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Yum!'s twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., grew system sales 12% this year. Fourth quarter, ex-special, general and administrative expenses were $344 million, down 4% year-over-year due to strict cost control. Reported G&A was $353 million for the quarter, including $9 million in special expense related to an ongoing resource optimization project. For the full year, ex-special, general and administrative expenses were $1.17 billion. Core profit grew 8% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Reported operating profit included a negligible impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation and a $49 million headwind for the full year. Our ex-special tax rate was 26% in the quarter and slightly under 21% for the full year. Fourth quarter, ex-special EPS was $1.26, a decline year-over-year stemming from a $0.23 headwind from fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate that drove our effective tax rate above our guided range in 2023 and below our guided range in 2022. Full year, ex-special EPS was $5.17, a 14% increase year-over-year. Now, let me share some greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our bold restaurant development growth driver. Yum! opened just shy of 1, 900 units in the fourth quarter, with approximately 87% of that growth coming from our international markets. The KFC Division was the largest driver, finishing the year with units up 8%. China, India, Thailand, South Africa, and Spain drove KFC's development this year and were part of a group of 15 countries that grew unit count by more than 25 restaurants. In December, we were pleased to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC restaurants from our largest franchisee in the UK. This is an exciting opportunity for us to purchase restaurants with average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins in a market where we have an exceptional local management team who run our existing KFC UK equity store base. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition, while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchise rights, which will be reflected in store level margins post-acquisition. We anticipate this transaction to close during the second quarter. At Pizza Hut, the division opened 575 units for the quarter and nearly 1, 600 units for the year, a record for the brand. There were 73 markets that contributed to the brand's development. China, India, Turkey, Japan, and Canada led Pizza Hut's growth internationally with more than 900 units opened across those countries. The Taco Bell division opened 201 units in Q4 and 417 units for the full year. In the U.S., unit development was also on fire with 244 gross new units. Our longer-term growth engines that include Habit and Taco Bell International opened 208 units on a combined basis and grew unit count by 12%. We finished 2023 with unit growth occurring in 110 countries. We now have units in 293 brand country combinations, providing an unmatched level of diversity geographically, as well as in consumer preference with leading brands in the chicken, pizza, and Mexican categories. Looking ahead, we expect development in 2024 to continue at a robust pace. In the first half, KFC will reach an incredible 30, 000 units and Pizza Hut will top 20, 000 units. At KFC, we enter 2024 with more development commitments than last year. We recently returned from an inspiring visit to China in December and were reminded of the incredible runway for KFC's growth in the market, where Yum! China has over 10, 000 KFC restaurants, yet serves only one-third of the population. Taco Bell International will continue to expand their footprint, though the growth rate will temporarily slow as the brand looks to stabilize same-store sales performance in emerging markets and partner with franchisees to optimize site selection, leveraging KFC and Pizza Hut market mapping data. Moving on to our unmatched operating capabilities growth driver, which I'll speak to through the lens of our digital strategy involving our easy experiences, easy operations, and easy insights pillars. 2023 was a landmark year for successfully scaling our suite of proprietary technologies across our global restaurant base. Beginning with our easy experiences pillar, we have successfully deployed our Yum! Commerce platform to KFC U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. and are continuing to onboard the Pizza Hut U.S. system. Looking ahead, we will start to deploy this platform to two Pizza Hut International markets in the first half of 2024. Kiosks remain an important priority in delivering a consistent customer experience, driving ticket uplift, and streamlining our restaurant operations. Globally, we've increased our kiosk penetration in KFC restaurants by 70% over the past year outside of China. We ended the year with kiosks in approximately 500 KFC U.S. restaurants, a huge step up from nearly zero only two quarters before. Our KFC Latin America markets also began the rollout of kiosks using our proprietary TicTuk platform this year and planned to triple the restaurant count in 2024. Within easy operations, this quarter, we continued to fire on all cylinders, significantly expanding the rollout of our world-class technology products and platforms. Poseidon, our proprietary point of sale system, which was expanded to an additional 1, 700 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, resulting in 5, 000 restaurants having been onboarded this year. We also ramped up the deployment of our Dragontail AI platform with an additional 1, 000 locations onboarded this quarter and over 4, 000 new restaurants added for the full year. We now have Dragontail in place in nearly 7, 000 restaurants across Pizza Hut and KFC. Our 2024 rollout will include launching Dragontail in nearly 6, 000 more restaurants. Further evidence of our ability to scale software globally at a rapid pace. Our AI-driven automated inventory management system is now being used in 90% of our KFC U.S. locations and roughly half of our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, driving more seamless and more accurate inventory ordering processes for our restaurant managers. More than 3, 000 additional restaurants across KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut will be onboarded to the automated inventory management system in 2024. Finally, our custom-built SuperApp, which provides smart, automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in over 8, 500 Pizza Hut restaurants globally, and KFC has plans to roll this out to approximately 6, 000 restaurants in 2024. For the third pillar of our easy strategy, Easy Insights, we are fully leveraging our unique global scale to bring new insights and enable even smarter and quicker decision making. This year, we expanded the reach of our Yum! GlobalData Hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics. In 2024, our Easy Insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the GlobalData Hub and integrate into our own technology platforms, including personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations, and dynamic restaurant routines for general managers. Stepping back, it's incredibly encouraging to see this digital ecosystem come to life in our restaurants. By the end of 2024, we are likely to have our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants operating substantially all of these key technologies through the Yum! ecosystem. From the Poseidon Point of Sale system to the Yum! Commerce Platform, our automated inventory management software, and the Tracks Restaurant Management application, truly a power brand powered by world-class technology. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.2x, down from 5x last year. As we had previously shared, we had planned for our net leverage ratio to drift lower during 2023 based on pausing new debt financing, paying our $279 million revolver balance in Q1, and retiring a $325 million bond maturity in Q4. Our capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $103 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $225 million, reflecting $60 million in refranchising proceeds, and $285 million in gross CapEx. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 400, 000 shares, totaling $50 million. With the November bond maturity behind us, and no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we will return to using our excess free cash flow to fund the share repurchases and any accretive investments we choose to make, for example, the UK KFC acquisition. In addition, we were pleased to recently announce an 11% increase to the dividend. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend, and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. Finally, let me shed some light on how 2024 is shaping up. Despite a more challenging operating environment, including the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, we expect to deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. This includes core operating profit growth to be at least 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. We have a strong unit development pipeline thanks to attractive and reliable paybacks and growth-minded franchisees, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong system sales growth. For the shape of the year, we expect top line trends in Q1 to be the most challenged, with same-store sales trends improving sequentially as laps ease and a range of sales driving initiatives take hold. We expect full year, Taco Bell company operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. We anticipate flat, ex-special G&A growth as we manage spend across the organization. Remember that G&A can vary due to the nature of our performance-based compensation plan. Lastly, we expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%. To close, I am incredibly proud of our performance this year. Sales trends became a little more challenging in the second half, and yet we delivered profit growth above our algorithm as our teams quickly adjusted marketing calendars to meet demand and kept a strict focus on managing costs. It is our team's relentless focus to stay vigilant on all areas of the business that gives me confidence, we will deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. The unbeatable combination of our iconic brands, best-in-class franchisees, and resilient business model will enable us to deliver growth and shareholder value creation for years to come. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregory Francfort of Guggenheim. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks for the question. I mean, the question I had as we look into 2024 there's obviously been some pockets of weak around the world, but in terms of your development, you touched a little bit the first half and some of the milestones you're going to reach. What do you think about the pace of development globally in 2024 and 2025? Do you expect that to kind of hold around this 6% range or any thoughts there would be helpful? David Gibbs : Yes, thank you for the question, Gregory. Obviously, in our prepared remarks, and I'll reiterate in my comments now, we are very confident in the pace of development. The pipeline has never looked better for us. Obviously, it varies country by country, but franchisees are getting great returns. You heard yesterday, Yum! China commit to continued strong growth and the great returns they're getting through development. Even Pizza Hut US is picking up the pace of development. We see lots of reasons to be hopeful, and we have a lot of good visibility into the pipeline, the development agreements that we've struck with franchisees and the way we're evolving our asset types, I think is another tailwind for us on development. Like we mentioned when we were in China, we've seen this new model that they've come up with, the satellite Pizza Hut Delco store, which we believe they can blow out and be a real growth driver for them. It's just one example. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. As it relates to 2024, Chris, you said you expected to be a year that you're going to perform in line with your algorithm, of course, meaning that you can grow your operating profits at least 8% excluding the extra week. I just want to dive a little more into this and your confidence around it. I know unit growth is a source of confidence. Clearly, you've outlined that on today's call. But what about the same store sales required to get to that algorithm? Just given the ongoing headwinds from the Middle East, potentially more challenging US environment, how do you think about what's required from the same source of sales perspective after the first quarter as it relates to the need for them to accelerate. Thanks. Chris Turner : Yes, thanks, Brian. If we talk about the algorithm this year and our confidence in delivering it, I'll start by reiterating our primary growth driver, which David just talked about on development. Obviously, one of our strongest pipelines in recent years, lots of reasons to be excited about development continuing at or above that 5% in the algorithm. We talked about from a same store sales standpoint, we expect sequential improvement through the year. Our two primary growth drivers, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S. continue to have strong positions in their markets around the globe. Obviously, we've got the Middle East headwind that we mentioned that we'll deal with. We expect sequential improvement throughout the year. And so we're confident in the trajectory on that piece. But then you get to the 8%, at least 8% core operating profit growth, which is really what the algorithm is intended to drive. And that's where we've got, even more levers at our disposal. So we mentioned that we expect flat G&A year-over-year which reflects, how we're managing that component of the P&L. And so we've got, confidence in the actions that we're taking there. There's a component of that around our digital and technology approach as our capabilities become more and more mature. We get more and more leverage out of those capabilities. And of course, we're doing all of that in service of our franchisees where we're building leading edge capabilities at the lowest cost for them and we've invested ahead. But we also mentioned the productivity programs that we continue to drive, which in the past few years have been used to fund those incremental investments in D&T. But we're going to continue to drive those productivity improvements. And then, finally, we're lapping some larger than normal incentive programs that will help from a G&A standpoint as well. So you add it all up. We're very confident in delivering that at least 8% core operating profit growth in our algorithm. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore. David Palmer : Thank you. And good morning. Lots of great stuff on this call. I don't know if this is going to be something you can answer this call, but maybe something for the future. Your digital sales growth and mix increased very strong at 22% growth this quarter you said. And I just wonder how incremental you think that growth is to sales or other benefits that you see in terms of loyalty and even labor efficiency. So I know we would all be very open to hearing how incremental that is. Obviously, a quarter like this when you have a lot of headwinds and noise, but maybe for a future call, even if you don't have that handy. But another separate question may be easier to answer. You talked about the two year trend accelerating for Pizza Hut U.S. in the first quarter. And even if we were to say that was a couple points of acceleration on a two year, that could imply a flat comp starting in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. I wonder if you think that that sort of stabilization in comps is a reasonable expectation for Pizza Hut starting in the second quarter. Thanks. Chris Turner : Yes, thanks so much. I'll start with digital. So yes, look, our digital capabilities continue to drive actually all elements of our algorithm. They support strong unit economics. As you heard, we continue to expand the easy operations capabilities which make our restaurants easier for our team members to operate. And it helps our franchisees drive productivity. And so that is helping us ensure that our franchisees continue to have strong unit economics which allows them to invest in building new stores. If you look at that 10% global system sales growth for the full year, we think digital played a big part of that, both on the unit side and on the same store sales side. And then, as I said, from a profitability standpoint for Yum!, as those capabilities continue to mature, we can get more and more leverage out of our digital technology teams and capabilities in-house. And so that's part of us bending the curve on those investments that I mentioned in our G&A plan for the year. So again, we're very pleased with the progress on the digital front and we still have, a lot of that journey ahead of us, and we described big plans this year to continue to accelerate the roll up. David Gibbs : Yes, I'll talk about pizza, but on the digital front, one thing I really want to emphasize is just the talent we've been able to attract to the digital space, both at Yum! and at the brands, is unbelievable. We are becoming a talent magnet in digital. It's a great place to work. We're investing behind this. Our franchisees are quickly adopting it. And even though we're at $30 billion of sales and growing fast, we're still in the early innings of what this can do to the business and the way it can transform us. So we could not be more excited about digital. And we will continue to report on the various metrics, loyalty, and things like that as we go forward and keep you guys informed on the journey. On Pizza Hut, yes, obviously, sometimes we forget. We look at one year numbers without really looking at the full picture. Q1 for Pizza Hut U.S., we have an enormous lap. And obviously, I have to take that into account as we launched melts last year, very successfully, and are now rolling that around the world. But we certainly are planned for Pizza Hut U.S. to be positive for the year. The team has a number of things planned for the calendar as we go forward. And we love the fact that Pizza Hut globally hit a new record on that new unit development and is becoming a bigger and bigger contributor to that part of our growth. And certainly Yum! China last night talked a lot about the great success and the wide runway they have for Pizza Hut in that market. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Citi. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Quick clarification on the question. On the G&A guidance for \u201824, is that just on a dollar basis? Can you maybe just level set us where that, what your expectation is? Is it flat on a 52-week basis or, obviously you've got an extra week in some of the divisions? And then the question itself is more along the lines of, how franchisees -- how are you are working with franchisees to probably approach pricing in 2024, I guess more focused on the U.S. there, given that's the market where I think there's some incremental pressure on the lower income consumer. But, how are you guiding them to think about it given some of the pressures on labor that are going to be manifesting themselves throughout the year? Thanks. Chris Turner : Yes. So the G&A, we ended the year ex-special at $1.17 billion. We expect to be flat on that in the 52 weeks. So there should be an apples-to-apples, comparison on that commentary run plan. David Gibbs : Yes. And as far as, the U.S. consumer and pricing, just some good news to share there at least from a Yum! perspective, as we think about the U.S. consumer, the best way for us to look at it is obviously through the lens of our Taco Bell business, which is a vast majority of our U.S. sales and profits. Throughout 2024, we saw a slight outperformance from our restaurants that were in low 2023, restaurants that were in low income trade areas versus the rest of the business. So with the low income consumer, I know there's been a lot of talk about, are they dropping out? Certainly for Taco Bell, that actually, looks, it looks like we're doing a great job of holding onto them. In fact, in both the entire year and in Q4, we saw the low income consumer trade areas outperform the rest of the business. And I think that speaks to the strength of Taco Bell in this environment. It is a value leader in so many ways. When you talk to consumers about value, they win on every value perception score. And they can do value with innovation, which is also a great combination. And they can do value while having industry leading margins. So you think about the room that we have to compete with everybody else in the category. I really, really like our position with Taco Bell. Obviously, as we move into Q1, we've got tougher laps, U.S. weather, really played havoc on sales early in the quarter. And as we've said, it's going to be the lowest quarter of the year. But we think this environment is one that obviously we can thrive in the U.S. and there will be less pricing to the point of your question. But it's not going to slow Taco Bell down in terms of being able to connect with consumers and grow transactions. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just following up on that, you did talk about a more challenging macro into \u201824. And I assume that's above and beyond the Middle East. So specific to the U.S. again, just any change in behavior you're seeing at any of your three core brands, consumer trading around the menu. Specifically, I know that from television advertising each of three big brands has what appears to be pretty compelling value offers. I'm just wondering how those value offers are performing the consumer demand for them, maybe the mix shift of value today, however, you define that versus where it's been in years past. Any color on that would be great. Thank you. David Gibbs : Sure. Yes, just to build on my comments about the Taco Bell business in the U.S. and how it's set up to thrive in this environment, the value menu that we've recently tweaked in the U.S. to be $3 and under is actually over indexing a little bit with consumers versus test and expectations, which isn't a bad thing because it's a real competitive advantage for us and it's designed to maintain franchisee profitability. So there may be some small shifts in consumer behaviors, but as I said on previous calls, we just are slowly returning to a more normal operating environment where value is always important in the category as is convenience. And food innovation and great ability. And we think we just win on all those fronts with Taco Bell and why we're excited about 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : Hi. Good morning. I just want to come back to your comp outlook for the year. And I know you mentioned it several times, some of the reasons you expect things to maybe get better as the year goes on. But I'm hoping that you can maybe elaborate on your view there, whether you think it's the macro getting better, or you think it's more what you have in your initiative pipeline. And then I guess a second part of the question would be if that doesn't materialize the way that you anticipate, do you have levers to pull to still deliver the profit growth you're expecting for the year? Thanks. David Gibbs : Well, in terms of the comp outlook, obviously the Middle East creates some uncertainty for the environment. And Chris just talked about one of the levers that we have to pull, which is improving our efficiency and holding G&A flat year-over-year. But the bigger picture is we're really excited about the initiative that each of the brands has going just to give you a glimpse. Taco Bell in 2024 is going to have twice the innovation on the calendar that they had in 2023. And I've obviously seen a lot of this innovation and have excited about the impact it's going to have with consumers. I mentioned the fact that in the US, it's a brand that thrives in a value environment. But around the world, just to give you some more color on Q4, we have positive transaction growth in Q4 despite the impact that the Middle East had on our overall business. So we think the year sets up where, obviously, the Middle East is a big variable, but putting that aside, we think the year sets up to be another great year for Yum! all around the world with sales growth. And a lot of it is driven by us leaning in more on what we call category entry points, opening up new lines of business for us. I'm excited in a couple of days to head to South Africa to see the great work that that team is doing in terms of launching breakfast and the beverage work that they're doing that's really having a positive impact on their sales. But we've got stories like that going on all around. Chris Turner : And then David, as you mentioned, we do have multiple levers to ensure that we land the ultimate component of the algorithm, which is at least 8% core operating profit growth. We've talked about the flat G&A plan, and we also referenced in the comments some of the productivity projects that we have going on. So we're laser focused on that component as well and have plenty of levers we can pull. Matt Morris : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question of today comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks, guys. Just another on Taco Bell, I guess, David, in light of the strength and the multiyear trends in December and then the initiatives that you highlight, I guess is it fair for Taco Bell given the fact that you're seeing pretty good strength across consumers for the brand plus the initiatives that you could see sort of a widening market share or traffic share outperformance gap at Taco Bell this year given the environment and given the plans you have in place, if anything, to share on that? David Gibbs : Yes. Thank you, Dennis. Yes. So look, Taco Bell in Q4 just to put a little bit more numbers around it, put up a two year number of a plus 15, again, going back to sometimes we forget what we were lapped and we were lapping massive Mexican pizza performance. They were able to lap that and grow on that in a challenging consumer environment. We think that favors them. And absolutely what you said is absolutely true. We're constantly looking to gain market share. And the Taco Bell business has been doing that for now for many years. And we think this is an environment that favors them. So it couldn't be more excited about the growth that Taco Bell has ahead of it in the U.S. And we've really just begun with that brand. And I'm excited about Sean and the team we've got in place to lead that. I'll wrap up by one of my fun facts that, we get hit with so many of them as we're preparing for these calls. But if you're not aware, in the last three years, 25% of all young restaurants have been built. And you're talking about brands that have been 50 to 70 years old and older, but yet in the last three years, nearly 25% of our restaurants were built in the last three years. It gives you a sense for, first of all, how the condition of our asset base around the world and how new it feels given the age of the brands, but also the commitment that our franchisees have to this business. They're investing their capital in building those stores. And we always talk about net new units. That's gross new units. A lot of those stores were placed, the stores that had reached the end of their useful life. So it shows their commitment to the next 20-30 years of the brand and they are fantastic partners. They've always been our competitive advantage. We're seeing that even just managing through the Middle East and how Americana has done such a good job of that. And we couldn't be more excited given the development pipeline, the commitment that our franchisees have and the strength of our brands as we head into 2024. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions].  I will now hand over to your host, Matt Morris, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Morris : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions. Before we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and the relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call. Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. On our last earnings call, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC franchise restaurants in U.K. and Ireland. The transaction closed on April 29. As a reminder, several of Yum! Brands business units report on a period calendar basis, including all U.S. and Canada brands, KFC U.K. and KFC Australia. For business units that report on a period basis, first quarter same-store sales growth excludes the benefit from the additional day of sales owing to Leap Day. When forecasting 2024, please keep in mind this year will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for those entities. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of the IR website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. We would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Our second quarter earnings will be released on August 6 with a conference call on the same day. Finally, please mark your calendars for an in-person Taco Bell Consumer Day on December 10 at the Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, California. Stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Yum! grew core operating profit 6% this quarter despite a challenging operating environment, demonstrating the resilience of our business. As we communicated last earnings, 1Q should represent our most challenging sales quarter this year as we work through tough year ago laps, return to a more normal inflationary environment and navigated discrete consumer demand pressures. While the impacts from the Middle East conflict have been scattered and difficult to measure, we've begun to see improvement in the most impacted markets. Taco Bell U.S. outperformed the industry on same-store sales and delivered industry-leading margins, while 1Q unit openings at KFC International set us up for a strong unit growth story in 2024. We continue to make significant progress scaling our proprietary digital and AI-powered platforms and are excited by plans to accelerate deployment. Digital sales continued an upward trajectory approaching $8 billion and were up 11% year-over-year. Through continued kiosk deployment, greater adoption of click-and-collect and stable third-party aggregator sales, digital mix improved 5 points and, for the first time ever, represented over 50% of system sales in Q1. We now have $30 billion in annualized digital sales, which by itself would represent one of the largest restaurant companies in the world. Overall, despite a more challenged operating environment, we have reached impressive new milestones and remain on track to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm target of at least 8% core operating profit growth for the full year. Now I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture and Talent and Good Growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our first quarter results, followed by our Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Operating Capabilities and balance sheet position. Starting with the KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our divisional operating profit. KFC grew system sales 4% this quarter, owing to an 8% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. The same-store sales pressure was partially attributable to impacts from the conflict in the Middle East, which have begun to ease, and we expect a 2-year trend for KFC International overall to accelerate in the same quarter. We saw strong top line growth in other parts of the world including Latin America, Africa and Greater Asia. System sales in Latin America grew 22% on the heels of a strong marketing calendar and continued success of the KFC original nugget. In Africa, system sales grew 11%, thanks to 5% same-store sales growth driven by product innovation and 6% net new unit growth. In Greater Asia where system sales grew 8%, we recently partnered with a new franchisee in Korea, who is driving transaction growth with a calendar focused on core, value and expanding consumer access, which resulted in a 26% growth in same-store sales. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were pressured from unfavorable weather events and chicken value promotions from QSR competitors. Moving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit and 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit. System sales at Taco Bell U.S. grew 4%, led by 2% same-store sales growth and a strong outcome on top of last year's 9% same sales growth. Sales improved throughout the quarter after difficult weather events in January. Taco Bell focused on key levers within its magic formula to drive growth, including building brand buzz, providing value to our consumers and expanding into new category entry points. We know that when we execute on this magic formula, Taco Bell puts itself at the center of the cultural conversation. There was no better example of this than the Live Mas live event Taco Bell held in Las Vegas to share its upcoming innovation calendar, an industry-first event. Of course, it was not surprising that Fast Company named Taco Bell the Most Innovative Company in Dining and #8 overall. Early in the quarter, the team launched a new cravings value menu and ended the quarter with a successful launch of the Chicken Cantina menu. The cravings value menu features industry-leading value with 10 items priced under dollars providing consumers with craveable everyday value offering. Nearly 1/3 of transactions contain an item off the cravings value menu and, when purchased, 80% have at least one other item added, translating to a nearly 10% check uplift compared to non-cravings value menu checks.  The impressive performance of such product launches is compounded by Taco Bell's ability to deliver industry-leading margins on top of a great consumer experience. At Taco Bell International, system sales grew 6% this quarter. The team is focused on building brand category awareness globally. This included markets such as Canada and Latin America where the team elevated the core menu and launched the Chicken Cantina menu to expand their consumer base. Next, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit. During the first quarter, system sales declined 4% with 5% unit growth and a 7% decline in same-store sales. The year-over-year growth rate in same-store sales was suppressed from difficult year ago lapse and the ongoing impact from the conflict in the Middle East. The team continued to focus on the individual meal occasion this quarter with the India market launching the Melts platform. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 6% as we lapped the launch of Melts and Big New Yorker Pizza. However, the 2-year trend was positive and improved from last quarter. Lastly, at The Habit Burger Grill, for the first quarter, system sales declined 2% with 6% unit growth. Margin trends improved throughout the quarter with a combination of initiatives leading to a 60 basis point improvement in store level margins year-over-year. Now I'll turn to our Good Growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. Effective June 1, Alex Barsk will join KFC Global as the new Chief Financial Officer. Alex is joining from Pizza Hut, where she most recently served as global CFO. Alex joined Pizza Hut in 2015 and has held several leadership roles across strategy, finance, development and supply chain. Alex's transition is another great example of Yum! leveraging its talent across brands to help share unique learnings and experiences. To round out our people pillar, I'd like to congratulate and thank Yum's! Senior Vice President of Finance, Corporate Controller and my friend, Dave Russell, who recently celebrated his 25th anniversary at Yum! with today marking his 100th quarterly earnings announcement. Dave has been with the company since 1999, always serving as a trusted leader who brings his deep knowledge and analytical perspective to our finance and accounting function. Thank you, Dave, for your dedication to our growth over the last 25 years, and I look forward to your continued partnership in the future. Before I hand it over to Chris, I would like to share a few thoughts on the future of our digital and technology strategy given we achieved an important milestone this quarter with more than half of our sales coming from digital. You'll recall that the first phase of our journey to become the leading global digital restaurant company began in earnest in 2019. That first phase focused on building or acquiring a comprehensive suite of owned platforms, spanning Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights and accelerating deployment of those platforms across our brands and markets. While we still have further to go in deploying these platforms, we have achieved critical mass in several areas. Taco Bell U.S., one of our twin growth engines, has achieved the most extensive deployment of key platforms, including the Poseidon POS system, the Yum! e-commerce platform and the AIM, inventory management platform. Our other primary growth engine, KFC International, has been accelerating the rollout of those same platforms and is our leader in deploying in-store kiosk technology. Pizza Hut, of course, has been our leader in deploying Dragontail to thousands of restaurants around the globe. Behind the scenes, our global data hub houses data generated from these platforms. The deployment of our capabilities in this first phase of our journey has driven the dramatic increase in our digital sales from approximately 20% in 2019 to over 50% now. The impact of this growth has been significant. To share just a couple of examples of impact, our consumers enjoy more convenient and frictionless experiences, leading to high frequency and check sizes. Our franchisees enjoy significant productivity benefits as their team members no longer spend time taking orders and payments for half of all transactions, leading to stronger unit economics. We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities. While the first phase of work in deploying our platforms will continue, given the critical mass we have achieved, we have initiated a second parallel phase in our technology journey. This second phase will focus on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through the acceleration of AI capabilities in combination with fully leveraging the immense data assets we now own. With our platform-driven approach, we can now more easily integrate AI capabilities across our digital ecosystem. We currently have more than 40 AI initiatives in progress across the company spanning marketing, operations, insights, engineering and our internal back-office functions. While many of these initiatives will remain confidential for now, one example that we have shared publicly is voice AI to enhance our consumer experience. We've been testing this capability at the drive-thru in 5 Taco Bell stores in California. We are expanding that test to 30 stores in Q2 based on positive consumer feedback. Another example is our piloting of AI-powered technology in our Super App restaurant general manager support tool, making it even easier and faster for managers to access critical operational information to make better decisions. Of course, our Dragontail platform was the first AI-enabled next-gen restaurant operational system to enhance the consumer and team member experience in a multichannel fulfillment environment. As an example of how we are elevating the use of our data assets, in Q1, we launched the R.E.D. 360 U.S. Consumer Data Insights system. As of Q1, both Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. have integrated into the system and KFC U.S. will integrate in the second quarter. This system allows us to leverage insights into consumer behavior across our brands in the U.S. After full deployment, R.E.D. 360 will be the first scaled cross-brand U.S. restaurant consumer data engine in the quick service industry and will pave the way for unique insights and personalization opportunities on digital and social channels. For those who may have missed it, Joe Park, our Chief Digital and Technology Officer, was recently interviewed in The Wall Street Journal, bringing to life many of these plans as we become more focused on pursuing AI and data-driven innovation. As we do all of this, we are also continually innovating how our technology teams work internally to better leverage our scale so that we can continue to bend the curve on the net investment impact of these digital and technology initiatives. To sum it up, we are excited about having ramped up this second phase in our journey and are doubling down and pursuing the ultimate goal of our digital and technology strategy, which is to better serve our franchisees, providing them with more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology while simultaneously delighting consumers and maximizing Yum! shareholders' returns. We will continue to provide updates on both phases of our journey on future calls, organized around our easy capability framework. In closing, as I look back over the quarter, I'm proud of our teams and their ability to navigate any environment as our brands stand for unmatched value and convenience, providing a range of products and price points to meet any consumers' needs. Our resilient business model, coupled with our strategy to leverage our technology platforms on a global scale, gives me confidence we will continue to improve both franchisee and Yum! economics. Looking ahead, our initiatives to become an even more nimble and data-driven organization are underway, and I'm excited for the shareholder value we will create. With that, Chris, over to you. Christopher Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. Starting with our results. First quarter system sales grew by 2% driven by 6% unit growth. As we communicated on our last call, we expected the first quarter to be our most challenged from a same-store sales perspective due to prior year lapse, a return to a more normal inflationary environment and discrete consumer demand pressures, including markets impacted by the Middle East conflict. We believe the markets most impacted by the conflict collectively created a low single-digit headwind on Yum!'s overall Q1 same-store sales. Despite these challenges, I'm pleased to report Yum! delivered 6% core operating profit growth exceeding our internal plan and demonstrating the resilience of our profit model. First quarter ex special general and administrative expenses were $265 million, down 4% year-over-year, a continuation of the G&A momentum we had in the fourth quarter. Reported G&A was $286 million and includes $21 million in special expense related to ongoing resource optimization, which we expect to generate additional savings in the second half. Reported operating profit included a 2-point impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation. First quarter ex special EPS was $1.15, which includes negative after-tax impacts of $0.08 from investment losses and $0.03 from foreign currency translation. As a reminder, we shared on our last call the intent to purchase 218 KFC U.K. and Ireland stores. We're excited to report we officially closed this acquisition at the end of April. These stores have average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchise rights. Now let me share greater detail on our first quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened over 800 units in the first quarter. We reached the incredible milestone of opening KFC's 30,000th restaurant globally. As the #1 brand on Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Global Franchise rankings, KFC continues to demonstrate strong desirability among global franchisees with a new store opening every 3 hours. We continue to see an incremental store opportunity of 50,000 KFCs over the long term. Across the global system, the outlook for development in 2024 is strong. We expect to continue to open units in a broad range of markets, which last year included over 100 markets, and to cross the 60,000 unit milestone. Further solidifying Yum!'s position as the world's leading multi-brand restaurant franchisor. There are several reasons we remain confident in these trends. First, we entered 2024 with broad-based development momentum. In Q1, we grew units across 81 brand-country combinations. Second, we have large, committed franchisees who have entered into more unit development commitments for 2024 than in each of the prior 2 years. Approximately 80% of 2024 exceeded new builds for KFC outside of China are part of development commitments. Third, the development white space remains massive. We have just 6% of the global QSR market. China is a prolific developer and serves only 1/3 of the China population. In India, which is the fastest-growing global economy, KFC and Pizza Hut have been the fastest and third fastest-growing QSR chains, respectively, since 2019. Finally, our brands unit economics remain attractive across key markets where scale and first-mover advantages put our franchisees in a position of strength. Scale leads to unique advantages including access to alternative financing solutions, dedicated development teams and in-depth market knowledge. Scale also offers operating advantages. For instance, our largest partner, Yum China, has AI-enabled digital tools to allow its restaurant general managers to oversee multiple restaurants, creating unmatched savings that can be passed to consumers. The Serrano Group based in Latin America and Ramcar based in the Philippines run their own poultry processing facilities in addition to distribution capabilities, giving them cost and reliability advantages. At a brand level, KFC has food innovation kitchens in Canada, the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean, United Kingdom, Thailand, Australia, South Africa, India and Singapore. Perhaps underappreciated, our global innovation capabilities are real sources of differentiation. Moving now to the digital and technology front. Recall that our vision is to empower our franchisees with leading-edge technology solutions with advantaged economics. As David put it, we want to deliver more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology to our franchise partners. We are advantaged by owning important foundational platforms such as our Poseidon POS system, Yum! e-commerce, Dragontail, Super App and our global data hub, and the impact of these platforms will grow exponentially as we deploy more of them to more stores. Data is becoming a crucial differentiator, enabling us and our franchisees to generate better insights and make better decisions. On this front, quick service restaurants will benefit disproportionately because of the high frequency nature of our consumer visits, which results in more data. Within quick service, a few characteristics will separate us from our competitors, including our multi-brand portfolio, our scale and global footprint, our ownership of key platforms and the increasing integration between our platforms. We will leverage our data for insights and to drive more effective marketing and loyalty engagement, and we will deploy advanced AI tools to all aspects of our business. As we leverage our scale more and more in these areas, we can be faster, cheaper and safer through consistency and standardization across our environment. Let me now discuss the digital and technology accomplishments for Q1 across our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars. Beginning with our Easy Experiences pillar. We continued to onboard Pizza Hut U.S. to the Yum! e-commerce platform with a full cutover planned by Q3, followed by 3 Pizza Hut international markets by year-end. For Taco Bell U.S., where the Yum! Commerce platform is fully operational, we have accelerated viral promotions and have seen Taco Bell's digital ordering capacity increase tenfold relative to the legacy system. Within Easy Operations, the expansion of our world-class technology products and platforms continued. We expanded Poseidon to 1,800 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, bringing our total to over 7,000 restaurants. We onboarded over 500 Pizza Hut restaurants onto the Dragontail AI platform, bringing our system total to over 7,000 restaurants. In the near future, we plan to nationally roll out Dragontail's kitchen display system and Poseidon to our KFC U.S. restaurants. Finally, our custom-built Super App, which provides smart, automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in nearly 9,500 Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants with significant expansion plans underway for KFC. For the third pillar of our Easy Strategy, Easy Insights, KFC and Pizza Hut have continued to scale a new experienced management program allowing the brands to draw insights from an expanded source of consumer reviews across digital channels, including third-party aggregators and social media in addition to guest survey responses. KFC is now live in 10,000 restaurants and has seen a fivefold increase in per-store data points. Pizza Hut expanded this service to 7,000 restaurants across more than 50 countries. Talking about all of the tremendous advancements underway excites me about the future. This work will be vital as we embark on further innovation behind voice AI, restaurant automation and better leveraging our loyalty programs. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, reflecting $49 million in gross CapEx and $11 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1x. In the quarter, we sold our minority investment in Devyani for $104 million, representing a $73 million increase in value since acquisition. Our cash balance ended at $652 million, reflecting proceeds from the Devyani investment sale and modest accumulation in cash to finance the KFC U.K. acquisition. With the KFC U.K. deal behind us, our cash balance will return to a normalized rate of around $400 million, excluding the unrepatriated Devyani proceeds. Thereafter, with no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we plan to use our excess free cash flow primarily to fund share repurchases, absent accretive investments we choose to make. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Subsequent to the quarter end, we renewed our pro rata credit facility, including our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. We were pleased to renew the $2 billion facility with the same pricing and terms that we achieved in 2021 while also increasing the revolver from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion. Now let me discuss our latest outlook on full year 2024. We are confident that 2024 will showcase a strong unit development story at or above 5% unit growth, led by KFC International as franchisees capitalize on our brand's attractive paybacks. In the U.S., Taco Bell continues to balance core everyday value to cater to a more discerning consumer across income groups with premium innovation to attract new consumers. We expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex special G&A to be flat to down slightly for the year, including incremental G&A associated with the KFC U.K. acquisition. Finally, we are confident we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. To close, I am incredibly proud of the progress we have made over the last few years in the areas to which we dedicated our focus and internal resources. Our team continues to manage through industry challenges to position us for a strong year and deliver our long-term operating profit plan, reinforcing the resilience of our business, strength of our talent and commitment to our shareholders. Going forward, we are moving to solidify ourselves as the multi-brand franchisor of choice through a more efficient adaptable, data-driven organization. We are only in the early innings of unlocking the value of our unmatched data, which will help power our aspirations and deliver sustained, above-market shareholder returns. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Jon Tower of Citigroup. Jon Tower : Encouraging to see the G&A curve bending. I was hoping you could maybe drill into some of the puts and takes there. Obviously, there were some offsets this quarter with some charges. But curious if you could give us a little bit of context around what's flowing through that line to help move it lower and maybe where you anticipate this moving over the long term for the business. I think historically you've talked about the idea of potentially reaching -- or at one point in time, having that sit at about 1.7% system-wide sales. Is that still a target that you think is reasonable? Or do you feel like you can even move that further as we continue to grow this digital business over time? Christopher Turner : Yes. Thanks, Jon. Good question. First, let me just reiterate a couple of details on the G&A guidance. So we expect that ex special G&A on a 52-week basis will be flat to slightly down. As we mentioned on the last call, that assumes a target level of incentive compensation. So that's one factor that could move as we go through the year. But on the factors and levers that help us to achieve that plan first, there are some onetime factors at play. Examples of that include lapping the cyber event last year, a couple of small remnants of the Russia overlap and some lapse of incentive-based compensation last year. Now on the other side, we do have some expenses related to the acquisition of the stores in the U.K. We expect that will add just under $10 million to our G&A in year. But those are the [ best ] set of factors. If we go to the longer-term levers that we're pulling, we continue to drive our resource optimization program, which has allowed us to find efficiencies in legacy parts of the business, part of which we've used to fund investments in the D&T strategy. You saw some special charges this quarter which included the impact of some of those moves that we make, but that helps to drive productivity in the business going forward. And finally, as you say, we continue to bend the curve on the impact of our D&T investments on the P&L. This happens as we deploy more and more of our technology through increased franchisee adoption. And of course, we're continuing to better leverage our scale and how we operate internally in digital and technology, which is allowing us to do more together across the business. All of that is in service, delivering more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology to our business, as David said earlier, but bending that curve is a part of the long-term plan. Operator : The next question goes to Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co. Brian Bittner : You reiterated your 2024 target to grow core operating profit in line with your long-term algorithm of at least 8%. And that's impressive given the first quarter where comps were negative and core operating profit growth was below the full year outlook. And I'm assuming this was always built in the plan because of the tough comparisons, and I realize you have a lot of G&A flexibility to hit your operating profit targets. But the question is what's the global same-store sales base case that you're thinking is required for the rest of the year to comfortably reach your operating profit goals. David Gibbs : Appreciate the question, Brian, and I agree. Hitting 8% in this choppy environment, we're proud of our ability to expect that kind of a result. And I think it speaks to the resilience of our business model and the talent of our leaders. As you know, we don't provide quarter-to-quarter same-store sales guidance, particularly in an environment like this. We're preparing for various scenarios to get to the 8% number. Obviously, one of the lever -- one of the strong levers we have to pull to get to the number is on the development front. And we feel really good about the pipeline that we have in place in development from our partners around the world, and that's something much more so than same-store sales because we can count on to get to the 8%. But as far as forecasting same-store sales growth in this environment, obviously, it's very difficult given the impact that we're seeing. Operator : The next question goes to David Palmer of Evercore ISI. David Palmer : I was just hoping to get some more color on international, KFC International, Pizza Hut International. What were some of the highlights and lowlights on same-store sales trends in terms of your brand geography combinations? And more importantly, I'm curious about your reality for 2024 given the exit rates of brand geography combinations. Has any of these changed for the better or worse? How are you feeling about things versus perhaps just a few months ago? David Gibbs : Thanks, David. Yes. Look, we feel great about our twin engines of growth, right? 80% of our profit comes from Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International. In the international business, to your question, 85% of our profit from KFC International. And if you look at the areas of the world that are less impacted by the Middle East, like Africa, for example, our system sales, you'll see in our release, was up 22%. Latin America, less impacted, really no impact, up 11% -- I'm sorry, Latin America, up 22%; Africa, up 11%. I recently actually made a trip to Africa this quarter with our team and was just blown away by the progress we're making on the ground there, where we're the leader in the industry, and we're widening our margin in terms of that leadership. Whether it's South Africa, which we visited, or Kenya where we've got franchisees that used to be part of our -- the company's system, who's building our brand the right way there, launching breakfast, the employer of choice in the country, leveraging menu innovation to take and actually inspiring some of our innovation around the world. So if you look at places like that, the business is real healthy and doing well. The other -- the impacted parts of the world are obviously much more challenged. But we still see impressive results for KFC International growing system sales 6% in this environment. And if you adjust for Middle East, that's 8%, 9% kind of system sales growth. And very importantly, we highlighted this in the earnings release, KFC International with net new unit growth up 10% shows the strength of the quality of the development pipeline that we have, which obviously bodes well for the future of the brand. But as far as the international consumer goes, it's probably more of an emphasis on value than there has been in past quarters. We're seeing the same thing in the U.S. That's one that we know with KFC, we're well equipped to navigate. Operator : The next question goes to John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : I was hoping to get maybe just a little bit more color on bending the curve on digital and technology spend, especially how it might influence '25 and '26 type of total G&A growth. I mean, I think this has been one of the more kind of debated topics of this -- on the Street as -- are we just talking about a lower rate of growth? Or might we actually see declines in dollars in '25 and '26 as you leverage the platform? And the follow-up to this, and I think it's very related, acquiring technology, building technology is one thing. But of course, maintaining technology with best-of-class technology talent, especially kind of at the leadership end, might be something different. So I just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of acquiring some of this tech talent and Yum!'s ability to both attract and retain this talent going forward as they may have other projects to work on in the future. Christopher Turner : Thanks, John. Look, if you go back over the last few years, we saw the importance of digital and technology to Yum's! future and we invested ahead on behalf of the system to build those capabilities and put them in place across Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. We thought that was the right thing to do for the business, and it did create some pressure on the G&A line as we did it. As we deploy our platforms to more and more markets and we get increased adoption, of course, that happens when our franchisees see the business cases coming to life and the improvements in their economics and the way the technology impacts their consumers and their team members. And we're, as we shared on the call, continuing to drive those deployments. In fact, we're now starting to bundle some of those deployments. At Taco Bell, for instance, we are driving both the AIM inventory management in addition to the Trax back-of-house system at KFC U.S. We'll be deploying the Dragontail kitchen display system along with the Poseidon POS system. So we're bundling those together. And as we create more and more examples and proof points of the impact, as we talk to franchisees in additional markets, it becomes easier to prove the business case that our technology is delivering. So that's what supports the long-term deployment path as we move forward. Obviously, we have to continue to make investments in things like AI, better leveraging our data, as David mentioned, and as you said, in continuing to enhance the existing platforms that we have. But as we bend the curve, that reduces the net P&L impact over time. And so in the long run, we expect us to get increasing leverage on our G&A and the G&A as a percent of system sales should come down over the long run. Operator : The next question goes to Brian Harbour of Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbour : Maybe just following up on that. You spent a lot of time discussing all of these tech initiatives. I think it's probably a little bit harder for us to sort of observe that in terms of comp impact, margin impact. Obviously, we don't kind of see franchisee profitability. But are there any examples you can give of, for example, e-commerce was deployed in certain restaurants and you saw a certain uplift in sales or franchisee profits, what happens to those when you deploy that tech bundle that you just mentioned? I think that would just sort of bring it to life more for us. Christopher Turner : Yes. Great question. Look, in all of these deployments, this is us partnering with our franchisees and, of course, they co-invest to bring these platforms to their businesses and they only do that when they see a strong business case. So if you take Taco Bell U.S., which is the one market where we deploy the most of our platforms in combination, I think the tremendous sales results there as they've gone from essentially no digital sales in 2018 to well into the 30% mix now demonstrates the power of the combination of those platforms. In every market around the globe, as we shift sales from nondigital to digital channels, we see increases in check size, we see increases in frequency. Now as you said, you don't see all of our franchisees' P&Ls. But on the productivity side for our franchisees, I think our development momentum is the best proof point that digital is adding to unit economics. That's the driver of us continuing to set records on unit development around the globe, and the digital and technology impacts on their P&L is an important part of that. So all of that is enhancing the business model. But as we said, we think we're just getting started on the value creation potential from these platforms and capabilities. David Gibbs : Yes. And just to get in, if you're looking for specifics, as you can imagine, when we move people to digital ordering, we see an uplift in check in almost every case, whether it's kiosk or online. When we move people to things like Dragontail, we know we get a -- for Pizza Hut, we know we get a 4-minute savings on delivery time of pizzas and we know we can get drivers to deliver more orders per hour by using it. So to the point of your question, the measures and the financial results from the rollout of these things, there are use cases all over the place for how this improves unit economics for franchisees, which ultimately is the heart of our business. The better their unit economics are, the more they build, the more they can afford to offer the right prices and value to customers and so on. Operator : The next question goes to Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : Specific to the U.S., I'm wondering if you could speak a bit more to how you think about the trajectory of the brands with some of those tougher comparisons and the weather headwinds behind you, even if it's at sort of a higher level. And sort of maybe how do you think about how the brands are positioned in the U.S. in a seemingly difficult environment and whether there's sort of any notable strategy shifts that you guys contemplate in an environment like this, be it on value or otherwise? David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, Dennis. I think we referred to this somewhere but I'll -- just for completeness, so in Q1, obviously we had a lot of impact by the weather during the quarter. Our business generally improved sequentially during the quarter. Taco Bell, as you know, is 75% of our U.S. operating profit. Taco Bell improved throughout the quarter. And into Q2, we are seeing an acceleration of same-store sales growth trends. So we're feeling good about how Taco Bell is positioned. Remember, they just launched the Cantina Chicken menu at the end of Q1. So we're excited to share the results of that. But suffice to say, it's been well received by consumers. And we think Taco Bell is incredibly well positioned for what I would describe as a more normal consumer environment today. Customers care more about value in the U.S.. Taco Bell, we know from the industry data that value is more important and that others are struggling with value and that Taco Bell is a value leader. You're seeing some low-income consumers fall off in the industry. We're not seeing that at Taco Bell. So a really favorable setup for Taco Bell, which you probably can say about any environment that they operate in given the strength of the brand. And for Pizza Hut, obviously, the lapse in the quarter were unusually large. We always intend to lap anything with positive sales. We didn't do that at Pizza Hut U.S. But we are positive on a 2-year basis and we actually did see an acceleration of Pizza Hut's 2-year trends in Q1 versus Q4. I'm excited about the calendar that Pizza Hut has for the balance of the year as well in the U.S. For KFC, it's a different story. The KFC brand in the U.S. has been struggling. And I think we're excited about some of the work that's going on behind the scenes to really boldly reset the brand in the U.S. We have a great playbook for KFC, which is our global business, our international business [ is on fire ], as I talked about before, the underlying business. We know how to bring that brand to life to connect with consumers around the world, and we have to do a better job of that in the U.S. It's a small part of our operating profit. Obviously, it doesn't really move the needle in the Yum! growth equation, but it is something that's a high priority for us as we move forward. Operator : The next question goes to Sara Senatore of Bank of America. Sara Senatore : First, a quick follow-up and then a question. Just about the impact from the Middle East, you said it was dissipating. I was just curious if you're doing anything specific to do that like brand marketing, that type of thing, or if it's just a matter of time? The question is about unit growth over time and sort of how that translates into system-wide sales maybe this year and beyond. As some of these AUVs are coming in lower as you think about your long-term algorithm, how should we think about that either this year kind of hitting the long-term algorithm from a top line perspective or over time? David Gibbs : Sure. Thank you, Sara. The first part of your question, no, I don't think we're doing anything special. We've obviously had a lot of experience in the past being -- with the global footprint we have of dealing with different issues around the world, and we have a sense for how these things recover. But everyone is different and time is usually the answer to most of those problems. As far as unit growth goes, yes, it is true that a lot of times when we're building, we're building particularly with our footprint and our emphasis on development. We're building in emerging markets which tend to have lower average unit volumes. That's how we built the powerhouse business in China back in the day and it's how we're building out markets like India, which tend to have lower volumes. But we're also excited about a lot of the development agreements and new franchise partners that we're getting in Western Europe, for example, and some other markets around the world, which are much higher volume markets. And I think it will always be a mix and it will probably always tend to be lower volume than our typical average volume. And that's fine because these are markets that tend to start out with lower volumes and grow faster than a traditional market, and we've seen that all around the world over the last few decades as Yum! has built out its footprint. Operator : The next question goes to David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : My question is on your results in the context of the sales performance. I think you mentioned that the operating profit in Q1 was slightly better than your expectations. I was curious to know how the sales are progressing relative to the expectations you might have had when you gave the guidance originally. And then in particular, I guess, was Q1 about what you expected, better than what you expected? And then secondly, David, if you could give us some sense of whether you have line of sight to global comps performance turning positive either in the second quarter or in the second half of the year? David Gibbs : Thanks, David. Obviously, we didn't anticipate the weather impacts in the U.S., for example, in Q1. So it generally was in line with what we expected, perhaps just a tad weaker. But to the point of your question, as we go into Q2, as I mentioned earlier, the Taco Bell business is picking up strength. We are generally on track with our projections for the year, which is why we feel comfortable with our operating profit commitment and the long-term algorithm. But it is going to be a challenging year, and we have a great team out there tackling the challenges. And in any one of these challenging years, it's always an opportunity to grab market share as well. We're doing that through development with the pace of development that you're seeing. And I'll just close with a few comments about the business. We talk about this a lot, but I think this was a quarter that really demonstrated how resilient this business is and how we can navigate just about anything thrown our way. The fact that we're sitting here in this first quarter in this choppy environment and we're able to put up 6% core operating profit growth and reconfirm that 8% plus target, I think, is a testament to the levers that we have to pull and the talent we have around the world. Our twin growth engines which are 80% plus of our operating profit, Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International, their underlying strength of their business is obvious when you look at the 10% unit growth at KFC or you look at Taco Bell's performance with low-income consumers in a value environment and the acceleration we're seeing in 2Q. Our development machine, we actually just put up the second highest quarter for gross development in Yum's! history, obviously on track to meet or exceed that 5% development target. And then very exciting, the digital inflection point. Passing 50% digital is something I don't think people thought was possible just a few years ago this quickly. It's a real testament to the quality of the teams that we put together. And as you can see from our prepared remarks, we are not at all resting on that as a key accomplishment as we lean in on things like AI and the use of our data to separate ourselves from the rest of the industry. I'll leave you with one final fact which I heard just the other day which really goes to the core of what we are and the strength of our business. Since January of 2021, 25% of all the Yum! units in the world have been built. That's how new our asset base is. That's how fast we're developing. Think about the impact that, that has on the consumer in terms of how fresh and modern our brands are. Since January '21, 25% of our store base has been built. We don't see that slowing down at any time soon. And in a choppy environment this year, we're very confident that we can get through it, strengthen our business and come out of it delivering that 8% core operating profit growth. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Thank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Our third quarter earnings will be released on November 5th with the conference call on same day. Finally, on our last call, we shared the timing for our talk about consumer date originally planned for December of this year. We are finalizing a revised date for early next year. Please stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs. David Gibbs : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Despite continued challenging operating environment, I'm pleased Yum! was able to deliver 10% growth in core operating profit this quarter, thanks to our team's strong execution and progress on the initiatives laid out on our last call. While we take comfort in improving global trends and still expect the first quarter warrant the low for same-store sales growth, significant volatility remains, and we recognize sales in some markets are not where we want them to be. The impacts from the Middle East conflict, in addition to a more cost-conscious consumer, have presented headwinds to same-store sales. Despite these tougher waters, we are confident we will deliver on profit growth in line with our long-term algorithm for 2024 and are set up for continued strong growth in 2025. Fortunately, we are well-positioned to navigate these consumer headwinds given the strength of our brands and reputations for value no matter the environment. Nonetheless, ensuring we provide consumer\u2019s affordable options has been an area of greater focus for us since last year with all of our brands having offered disruptive deals and introduced or reintroduced the track of everyday value with examples in the US such as KFC's Taste of KFC deals, Pizza Hut's $7 Deal Lovers, and Taco Bell's Cravings Value Menu. As a result, our brands experienced improving trends relative to the first quarter in the US market, and we continue to refine our offerings in international markets to recapture similar momentum. The second quarter offered signs of improving fundamentals. For example, at Taco Bell, we've begun to see sensitivities to check management stabilize to improve from Q1 into Q2, and have witnessed year-over-year check growth led by items per transaction. Internationally, KFC markets excluding China, that we believe were not impacted materially by the Middle East conflict, reported an encouraging mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales. Across our system, our 2024 commodity inflation has come in lower than we expected heading into the year, helping our franchise partners navigate recent sales volatility. Furthermore, momentum in the critical and strategic areas of our business remains strong. This includes robust increases in digital sales, progress leveraging our scale, continued deployment of our proprietary technology ecosystem and efficiency improvements in our cost structure from efforts underway in the next phase of our journey to be a leading global digital restaurant company. Our twin growth engines, Taco Bell US and KFC International, helped Yum! deliver 3% system sales growth driven by market share gains at Taco Bell US and strong unit growth at KFC International. Combined, these two powerful business units delivered 7% operating profit growth. At an individual level, unmatched innovation fueled Taco Bell US' 7% increase in system sales with Cantina Chicken performing above our expectations. Taco Bell is a clear standout in today's environment, not only achieving same-store sales growth well ahead of the QSR category, but delivering restaurant-level margins near a record high. In addition, Taco Bell's same-store sales grew mid-single digits across all income cohorts, proving that craveable innovation even at a higher price point wins with today's consumers. At KFC International, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, same-store sales showed strong improvement on a two-year trend, and unit growth in the quarter was an impressive 9% year-over-year as franchisees take advantage of strong paybacks. I know from experience, this powerful brand is not constrained by expansion opportunity, but rather its growth and success are tied closely with having the right franchise partner. This is why we are very intentional about who we choose to allow into our system. For example, our new franchise partner in South Korea took over in April 2023 and has drastically improved performance with same-store sales up 17% this quarter. In that vein, the KFC team is tirelessly working to give our franchisees the tools to succeed, including furthering the expansion of SuperApp and the KFC global loyalty program, which is now live in 14 markets. Now I'll discuss our relevant, easy and distinctive brands or RED for short, followed by our unrivaled culture and talent and good growth strategy. Chris will provide an update on our second quarter results, followed by our bold restaurant development, unmatched operating capabilities and balance sheet position and capital strategy. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit, we grew system sales 2% led by 8% unit growth. Our same-store sales were down 3%, largely on account of scattered pockets of weakness in a number of markets relating to the Middle East conflict and underperformance in the US market. This quarter, we did not see any improvement in the most directly impacted markets. If Q2 trends hold, the pressure on same-store sales growth for the set of directly impacted markets will begin to abate as we lap the prior year's sales impact beginning in November. Beyond the most significantly impacted markets of the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia, we've seen sales impacts from the Middle East conflict surface in several other markets based on store performance comparisons across neighborhoods. In other parts of the world, we witnessed trends improved from the first quarter, including Canada and Central and Eastern Europe, while South Africa's transactions began to improve during the quarter. Another exciting development in the quarter was Yum China celebrating its 200th KCOFFEE, which consists of an adjacent storefront that is part of an existing KFC, allowing a reduced investment and lower operating costs from sharing KFC kitchen facilities. The Yum China team has averaged one new KCOFFEE per day since the beginning of 2024. While these do not count as new units in our system, they are a driver of future same-store sales growth. This quarter, we acquired 216 KFC restaurants in the UK and Ireland, and we have started to optimize restaurant operations there. Lastly, KFC digital sales, excluding China grew nearly 20% with an impressive 40% growth in kiosk sales. Moving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 37% of our divisional operating profit. US same-store sales grew 5%, outpacing the US QSR industry by a wide margin. Taco Bell executed its winning formula this quarter through introducing a variety of compelling innovations such as the Cheez-It and Secret Aardvark fries. The second quarter also reflected sales contribution from the Cantina Chicken menu, our foray into an elevated chicken offering and a new platform to innovate around. Since the platform launch, Taco Bell's chicken sales mix has increased 10 points with nearly one in four orders, including a Chicken Cantina item. Another part of the team's winning formula is digital in, which digital sales continue to grow at a breakneck pace. In Q2, Taco Bell's loyalty sales were up over 30%. At Taco Bell International, the team is working on building brand relevance. It is still early days in many markets and trends remain volatile, but we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. A restored emphasis on value has forced our teams to be creative with a more limited national marketing budget. In more mature markets within Europe, which accounts for over 40% of Taco Bell International system sales, we saw encouraging signs of improvement with the introduction of value offers. Next, I'll discuss our Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 14% of our divisional operating profit. System sales were flat this quarter and units expanded 3% year-over-year. International same-store sales remained negative in part because of a stalled recovery in Malaysia and Indonesia. We're encouraged Pizza Hut same-store sales trends have improved four points from last quarter with progressing trends in the US and encouraging recoveries in Thailand and Hong Kong. Around the world, our team is actively expanding My Hut Box and introducing Melts, including most recently in India and Thailand. Both platforms lift underdeveloped day parts, expand individual meal occasions and provide attractive price points to our consumers. Since joining Pizza Hut as CEO in 2021, Aaron Powell has assembled an amazing team and is providing strong leadership to drive efficiency, increase accountability, reduce complexity and align the brand to consumer trends. In the US, momentum accelerated throughout quarter with an increase in weekly per restaurant average transactions attributable to a number of value-based promotions and the launch of My Hut Box. Lastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, second quarter system sales declined 1%. Habit's restaurant count increased 5% year-over-year as a result of new regulations in Habit's home market of California that have raised the cost to business, Habit's leadership team has been focused on protecting profitability to remain competitive. Those efforts led to a comprehensive store level labor optimization effort, which contributed to an impressive 520 basis point expansion of restaurant level margins from the first quarter, despite a double-digit increase in restaurant level labor rates in California stores. Same-store sales growth remained suppressed, but we're encouraged by the improvement from first quarter trends despite a more challenged regional backdrop. Subsequent to quarter end, I was pleased to learn Habit's Double Charred Burger, reigned supreme in USA TODAY's 10 Best Readers' Choice Award for Best Quick Service Burger, landing the number one spot and beating out all other QSR and better burger competitors. Now I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. One of Yum!'s hallmarks is our people-first culture, which drives recruitment of amazing talent and also builds a deep bench of leaders within the organization. I'm excited about the great work going on at Pizza Hut from a talent perspective, where we recently welcomed Carl Laredo, as the brand's US President. Carl is a seasoned marketing leader with deep experience in delivering impressive results at some of the world's largest and best-known brands. We also welcomed former PepsiCo Executive, Kalen Thornton, as Global Chief Brand Officer, leading the Pizza Hut division's global brand strategy and marketing, including harnessing the power of engaging consumer connections across physical and digital touch points. It is also rewarding to see leaders from Yum!'s deep bench of talent assume bigger roles. Melissa Friebe recently joined Pizza Hut US, as Chief Marketing Officer, after spending 27 years at Taco Bell in various finance, marketing, insights and brand strategy positions. In addition to recruiting and promoting talent and professionals, we're furthering our culture of collaboration and building capability across our company in powerful forums such as KFC's annual global marketing planning meeting. KFC gathered marketing leaders, franchise partners and vendors from around the world to share best practices and consumer insights to keep our iconic brand RED, discuss innovative strategies and sale of delicious products from various markets. Moving on to the planet pillar of our Good Growth strategy. We are making progress on our global goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and ongoing collaboration with our food suppliers. For example, KFC has reduced emissions by focusing on key areas such as cooking and holding systems, refrigeration and cooling and lighting while Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are collaborating with partners to reduce on-farm emission and encourage sustainable practices. In terms of packaging, we are making progress against our global goals with many markets eliminating unnecessary plastic items like straws, cup lids, stirrers and cutlery. And finally, we're also making a meaningful impact in the communities we serve by continuing to unlock opportunities. As an example, in Thailand, KFC partnered with non-profits and the Thai government to launch the country's first-ever flexible learning curriculum to help students who dropped out of school, gain critical job and entrepreneurial skills. To wrap up before handing over to Chris, we are pleased our second quarter built to a 10% growth in core operating profit despite system sales system sales pressures. While our teams work to improve system sales trends, we are confident the investments we are making in tandem to be more agile, resilient and stronger as part of the next phase in our technology journey will lead to a promising year in 2025. All these efforts underscore our commitment to be the franchisor of choice and deliver more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology services to our partners. I'm excited about our plans to harness the power of AI, including the expansion of drive-through Voice AI technology with plans to roll this capability out to hundreds of Taco Bell US stores by year-end in addition to testing with KFC in an international market. We are hard at work driving the next phase of our technology journey to unlock future growth by strengthening our business resilience and ensuring we deliver exceptional shareholder value in the years ahead. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, our balance sheet and capital strategy, and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our second quarter results. System sales grew 3%, driven by 5% unit growth. Consumer sentiment relating to the conflict in the Middle East continued to pressure system sales growth in the quarter. The recovery trajectory we observed in Q1 for the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia, flattened in Q2. And while hard to precisely quantify, we continue to observe conflict-related impacts in a broader set of markets. Despite these pressures, Yum! delivered an impressive 10% core operating profit growth, reflecting the resilience of our scale, global, multi-brand business model, increasing benefits of our digital and technology strategy and the expert management of the business by our leaders around the globe. A prime example of factors underpinning our resilience was profitability in our 488 company-owned Taco Bell stores in the US, our single largest estate of company-owned stores, representing approximately half of our total global company-owned store revenue. Store level margins were 25.6% with mature stores achieving over 27%, reflecting the strength of the Taco Bell business model and its magic formula, which enables the brand to simultaneously deliver an outstanding consumer experience, tremendous consumer value and exceptional store-level margins for our franchisees and Yum! Importantly, Taco Bell operations leaders are taking advantage of the continued growth in digital sales mix, which is now 35% to further digitally enable our operations in ways that not only improve consumer and team experiences, but also improve labor productivity. Another contributor to profit growth was improved expense leverage. As we shared in January, we expected throughout the year to see the benefits of our ongoing resource optimization program, which strategically leverages our scale to free up general and administrative expense for reinvestment in future growth drivers such as AI, which will benefit both Yum! and our franchisees in addition to some beneficial onetime G&A expense overlaps. Second quarter ex-special G&A expense was $256 million, down 9% year-over-year. Reported G&A was $281 million, reflecting $25 million of special expense related to our resource optimization program. We expect to generate additional savings on an ex-special basis from the resource optimization program in the second half of the year. Reported operating profit increased 6% as foreign currency translation continued to be a headwind with a $12 million negative impact in the quarter. Historically, given our global footprint, foreign currency translation has at times been a significant tailwind to our reported operating profit and at other times, a headwind. Since interest rates in the US began to rise in Q1 2022, our current annual operating profit reflects a headwind of nearly $180 million in foreign currency, equivalent to roughly one year of operating profit growth under our long-term growth algorithm during that period. Second quarter ex-special EPS was $1.35, reflecting a $0.20 negative impact from a higher year-over-year tax rate and lower year-over-year investment gains. Additionally, foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Q2 EPS by $0.03. Moving on to our bold restaurant development growth driver. Yum! opened 894 units, the second highest number of Q2 gross openings in Yum!'s history, leading to our unit count expanding 5% year-over-year, contributing 4 points to total system sales growth. In the quarter, we transferred certain rights related to the trademarks of the Gino's Pizza and Telepizza brands in Latin in Latin America to our local franchisee, enabling our teams and Latin America to focus exclusively on driving growth in the Pizza Hut brand. As a result, we removed 120 low volume and low royalty rate units associated with those brands from our store base in exchange for nominal compensation. Excluding the impact of this transfer, our unit growth was 6%. Our growth remains diversified across brands and countries with 195 brand country combinations contributing growth during the last 12 months. Moving to brand-specific development. In the KFC division, we opened 598 units across 57 countries. This brings our year-to-date gross openings in KFC to 1,107 units, a new all-time record for KFC for the first half of the year. China, India, Thailand and Japan led development. Over the last year, we've seen positive development trends in South Africa, the Philippines and Brazil. In the quarter, we closed on the transaction to purchase 216 stores in the UK and Ireland, one of our highest average annual unit volume markets. Our total equity estate at KFC is now 434 stores, the majority of which are located in the UK market. The Pizza Hut division opened 236 units across 30 countries. Pizza Hut's year-over-year unit growth is trending higher from this time last year for several of our largest markets, including China and Japan, which is offsetting closures in the US and the conflict-related slowing of development in Indonesia and Malaysia. At Taco Bell, we opened 56 units this quarter, including 17 new units in our international markets across 10 countries. Our US gross openings are running higher year-over-year for the first half, and we expect international store growth to pick up in the second half of the year. Excluding China, Taco Bell international unit count was up 7% year-over-year. Moving to our digital and technology initiatives. You will recall that on our last earnings call, David and I discussed our journey to become the leading global digital restaurant company. The first phase of this journey is focused on acquiring, building and scaling a comprehensive suite of owned platforms that enable ownership of our data, control the digital ecosystem, speed of innovation and cost advantages through scale leverage. Within this phase, we are accelerating deployment of our foundational platforms, such as the Poseidon POS system, Yum! e-commerce platform, Dragontail, SuperApp and our Global Data Hub. In the next phase, we are focused on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through AI and leveraging our extensive data assets. Data is becoming a crucial differentiator, enabling us and our franchisees to generate better insights and make better decisions. We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities. Let me now discuss additional digital and technology accomplishments for Q2 across our easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights pillars. I will begin with our easy experience pillar, focused on providing frictionless experiences to our consumers. As you recall, last quarter, we discussed plans to expand drive-through Voice AI technology to more Taco Bell stores. I'm excited to announce that given our encouraging early results, the team has accelerated the rollout. And as of today, we now have this technology operational in over 100 Taco Bell stores. We plan to scale the technology to several hundred stores by year-end, while the pilot test is underway in KFC Australia. In our tests, we have witnessed consistent consumer experiences and higher team member productivity. This technology leverages digital menu boards, which will be a Taco Bell brand standard in 2025 and Yum!'s proprietary point-of-sale system, Poseidon. On the e-commerce front, we have made significant progress in implementing the Yum! commerce platform at Pizza Hut US. We are currently transitioning to this platform at Pizza Hut in the UK, which will be the second international Pizza Hut market to operate on the Yum! commerce platform with Pizza Hut Canada next in line. Next, I'll discuss our easy operations pillar, where we continue to deploy our world-class technology to provide our franchisees and team members with the capabilities to operate their stores more effectively and efficiently. We have fully deployed our Poseidon point-of-sale system within Taco Bell US and are in the early stages of incorporating this system into the KFC US estate. With respect to Dragontail, our AI-enabled restaurant management system, we plan to have the system rolled out to nearly the entire Pizza Hut US system by year-end. As an example of Dragontail's impact, in the first 1,000 Pizza Hut US stores to implement the technology, we have measured a 7% increase in overall consumer satisfaction due to hotter and fresher pizzas leading to improved consumer frequency. Finally, we are in the process of scaling SuperApp, our restaurant General Manager support app at Pizza Hut US, and we plan to achieve the 10,000 store milestone across KFC globally by year-end. Lastly, I'll discuss our easy insights pillar. We deepened our AI pursuits this quarter, taking steps to unlock the benefits of our R.E.D 360 database and engage with an innovative start-up in the AI-driven personalization space to leverage our massive first-party data assets. This partnership covers the application and integration of a deep learning AI approach known as reinforcement learning, which we expect to be broadly and easily scalable across brands. This partnership will focus on our basic CRM channels and in the future, may extend to our other consumer sales and communications channels, for instance, paid media. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. As a reminder, our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value and include investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, reflecting $50 million in gross CapEx and $19 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1 times. We have a strong balance sheet and no debt maturities until 2026. During the second quarter, we are pleased to have resumed share repurchases by buying back $50 million in our stock, which for context is the same value of shares repurchased during the entire year of 2023. Going forward, absent any attractive investment opportunities like our recent acquisition of KFC UK restaurants, we plan to continue to return excess cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. Finally, I'll discuss our outlook on the balance of 2024. We remain on track to achieve 5% unit growth for the full year despite the extended impact the Middle East conflict. On a global basis, our planned number of gross unit openings for the full year is expected to be similar to our number of gross openings in 2023. We should also note some certainty on the future path in the Middle East markets. For example, there are approximately 210 restaurants currently temporarily closed across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. While there are plans in place to reopen some of those restaurants starting later this month and throughout the second half of the year, there is risk that some could close permanently pending the future trajectory the conflict impact. These stores have not been producing royalties while temporarily closed, but our reported unit count would be negatively impacted if these stores were to permanently close. With respect to company store profitability, we expect full year Taco Bell company-operated store margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Regarding G&A. Excluding 53rd week, we now expect ex-special G&A expense to be lower on a year-over-year basis by a low single-digit percentage. As for sequencing, Q3 G&A will be higher year-over-year as we lap last year's recovery of cyber-related insurance proceeds and as we incur costs relating to our Global Leadership Summit. Finally, despite updating our balance of year sales outlook to reflect the continued softness we're seeing tied to the Middle East conflict, we remain confident that we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth on a full year basis excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. I'm very proud of the work our teams continue to do to position Yum! as a resilient growth business going forward and to further cement Yum! as the global franchisor of choice. We are making incredible strides toward our distinctive digital and technology ambitions, our 50% plus digital sales mix and our continued rollout of distinctive digital and AI technologies are testaments to that pursuit. In markets around the world, we have the privilege of working with outstanding 3C that is capable, well-capitalized and committed franchisees who want to grow with our system and our iconic brands. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. David, your line is muted. Please proceed with your question. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. My question is on your outlook, given all the cross currents we're seeing in the macro environment. And I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on how you're thinking the same-store sales could progress with the second half plays out. And I know you have easing comparisons, but there's a lot of a lot of uncertainty in a lot of markets that you called out. So just wondering, if you could provide some context on how you're thinking about it within your 8% profit growth or core profit guidance for the year? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yeah. Thanks, David. I think our thinking hasn't changed, although we learn more, obviously, every week. As I think we said beginning of the year, as we progress through the year, we see sequential improvement every single quarter in same-store sales growth. Obviously, Q4 becomes a much easier lap as we start to lap the Middle East conflict. Q3 is actually a slightly harder lap for Taco Bell, but in general, an easier lap for Yum! And, therefore, we are -- we continue to forecast an improvement quarter-to-quarter in same-store sales growth, tough to forecast. But we know we have all the right levers to pull, and our brands are performing well despite some of these challenges. I mean, KFC International, for example, is up 11% on a two-year basis despite the Middle East impacts. You saw what Taco Bell did in Q2, I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic. But as you say, a choppy environment. We know we can get through it this year and then obviously get to much easier laps next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Tower from Citi. Jon, please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. I was hoping to dive a little bit in the G&A because obviously, that seems to be a mover on the core operating profit growth for the year. And I was hoping you can maybe provide a little bit more color on some of the puts and takes through the first half, and then what you see in the back half unfolding? And specifically, how we should think about this piece of the business growing into 2025, should we expect it to return back to normal cadence, especially if incentive comp resets again? Chris Turner : Yeah. Thanks, Jon. Look, I think what you're seeing happen this year is the plan that our management team has been driving is playing out as expected. If I were to kind of sum up what we're doing, we're reallocating and streamlining our G&A to drive faster and more efficient growth for Yum! and for our franchisees. And there's a few buckets of levers that are driving that. Of course, we've said that there are some one-time benefits this year on a net basis with the full year. The second, digital and technology is an important area here. So we talked about that this year, we're starting to bend the curve. And what we mean by that is, over the past few years, we invested ahead on behalf of our franchisees, which burdened the P&L a bit. But as we get more and more adoption of our platforms and we have fee income from that, it reduces that burden. We also acquired four companies, hired a lot of people in the last several years. Those capabilities are maturing. And as we mature, we find ways to operate more effectively internally to organize better, and that allows us to get more done at lower cost, which benefits Yum! and our franchisees. And we've got strong governance of tech spend in place. I think the third area is productivity in other parts of the business. We've been driving this resource optimization program. We're finding ways to operate more effectively in parts outside of D&T. Now in some cases, that's enabled by becoming a more digital company. And then finally, as we said in the remarks, our GMs are doing a really good job driving their plans as they see how the business is on pulling around the globe. So those are factors that are driving the G&A trends this year. Now it's important to note that we are reinvesting at the same time. We're putting investments into AI. We mentioned on the last call, 40-plus AI projects in motion. We're investing in areas like our marketing capabilities, supply chain and then culture and talent. So at the same time, we're driving the long-term health of the business. If you look to 2025 and beyond, we're going to continue to get leverage on the G&A line. You set aside year-over-year factors like changes in incentive comp, we expect to get good leverage on the G&A line, and I think you'll see a normal growth rate in terms of G&A for an asset like a company ours. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Andrew, please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. I have a two-part question on Taco Bell. I'm looking to understand how you retain Taco Bell's US 2Q same-store sales strength as you shift promotional -- to new menu items away from Cantina Chicken while the remainder of the drive-through segment intensified the focus on value. And the bigger question is that can you share your confidence in the ability to hold Taco Bell's 2Q to your trends in the back half of 2024? Thanks. David Gibbs : Sure. Obviously, Taco Bell is a lot of really positive results coming in, in Q2, and we feel good about we feel good about Taco Bell for the balance of the year. Why do we feel so good about the brand? First of all, in this environment where the consumer is probably pulling back a little bit, being the always on value brand. Remember, Taco Bell's Cravings Value menu is always on. It's got 10 items. They're unique items that nobody else in the industry has. And they're not like junior-sized versions of a core item. They're unique. They stand in their own right. They're incredibly craveable. That has served us well, and it really put a moat around when it comes to value. In addition, we have onetime offerings like the Luxe Box at a $7 price point, which is an incredible amount of great tasting food for that price. So we have a great way to play value that makes it hard for others to compete. And then when you couple that with things like the Cantina Chicken launch in Q2, which is really a platform that we'll continue to innovate off of as we move forward. You saw in Q3, we just launched the Cantina Chicken Cheesy Street Taco Chalupas that are off to a good start. That's an example of what we can do with that menu. We'll probably rehit Cantina Chicken in Q4. And then you've got all sorts of other great things going on at Taco Bell like speed of service, improving loyalty program launches. So hopefully, again in the sense of confidence we have in Taco Bell as we move forward. And in this environment, I think we're really seeing Taco Bell stand out from the crowd, outperforming the QSR industry by a wide margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Brian, please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on navigating a challenging backdrop. You delivered 8% core operating profit growth year-to-date, despite negative same-store sales year-to-date. And this operating profit growth in the first half is on par with the full year guidance, of course. And I know the environment is still challenged, but there reason to believe that overall, Yum! will have better sales trends in the second half versus the first half as comparison these as we've talked about on this call. And G&A is going to remain favorable in the second half. I know there's some timing differences between the third quarter and fourth quarter. But is there an opportunity for profit growth to accelerate in the second half? Is the guidance for 8% now that you've already had that in the bag in the first half, possibly conservative? Or is there anything maybe I'm not looking at in the second half versus first half that I should be more aware of? Chris Turner : Yeah, Brian, as we said on the call, we remain confident in delivering at least 8%. Of course, as you mentioned, it's a complex operating environment. There are lots of unknown still yet to unfold in the back part of the year. But as David said, we do have sequential improvement in the forecast quarter-to-quarter from a sales standpoint. And as we said, we expect full year G&A to be balanced. We're going into the back half of the year with a good starting point here at the midpoint. And it's our job to deliver as much profit growth as possible, while still investing in the long-term health of the business. And so that's what our management teams are focused on doing, driving the short-term and the long-term simultaneously. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Dennis, please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the strength of global unit development. Obviously, some macro pressures out there, but impressive growth, even still, particularly at KFC. Could you talk a little bit more about how the brands and the franchisees are effectively managing the challenges, continuing to open restaurants at a solid rate? And specifically, if there's anything else to offer on visibility that you've got into development looking ahead, including how that pipeline looks, et cetera? Thank you. David Gibbs : Yeah. Thanks, Dennis. The development picture is really one that is strongly encouraging. When you think about the impact of the conflict on sales in particular markets, we are still seeing quite widespread growth all around the world. I think I mentioned in my remarks, about two-thirds of our brand country combinations over the last 12 months have built a store. There's a lot of countries that are quite small that don't even have an opportunity to build a small store. So that is impressive right there that it's widespread. As we mentioned, our ability to open gross units looks like going to be very similar to what we did in 2022 and 2023. Now we would like that number to go up every year. So there's probably some small impact from the Middle East that's showing up in that gross unit line. And potential for some, as Chris mentioned in his remarks, potential for some additional closures, perhaps greater than normal the second half of the year. But any stores that would close, particularly in the Middle East markets would have been lower volume stores that people are just pruning their portfolio. We expect the full year impact from development in terms of the ability to drive additional system sales to be very similar this year to last year. So the development story is good. Why is that? Because I think the franchisees have a lot of long-term confidence in the strength of our brands and their businesses around the world and they're getting good paybacks. We meticulously track the paybacks in every market around the country to make sure that our franchisees are getting good returns on their investments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead. Brian Harbour : Yeah, thanks. Good morning guys. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks just some broader impacts of some of the Middle East issues. I was curious what markets you're referring to with that. And I guess, just more broadly, could you comment on like Europe or some of the other markets that you sometimes highlight has been stronger or weaker? And if there is anything to call out there? David Gibbs : Look, I think in general, we've highlighted, obviously, the Middle East markets have been impacted in addition to Indonesia and Malaysia in terms of significant markets for us. Beyond that, we're not going to -- first of all, it's very hard to pull out the impact because it can be trade area trade area by in a given market. But you can imagine the types of markets that would be further impacted. And it's not -- but it's not a precise science. We just know them from the stories that we're hearing from the field some of the data that we see trade area by trade area in markets that the impact is a little bit broader than just the Middle East and Indonesia and Malaysia, but very hard to measure. I think the important thing is, despite all that, I mentioned it at the start -- the Q&A, we've seen 11% two-year same-store sales growth for KFC around the world. If we back out and just take a look at some of the markets where we know there's very little impact from the Middle East, we're seeing mid-single-digit growth for KFC. And then places like LA&C, which really are a clean read on our business ex-Middle East, no impact at all, we're seeing -- they put the second -- KFC put up a second consecutive quarter of plus 13% same-store sales growth that's on top of 10% last year. So it's 23% same-store sales growth in Latin America for KFC. You can tell that the foundation of our business is really quite strong. And we're getting through this headwind from the Middle East really as best as could be imagined. Matt Morris : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. So our final question comes from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Danilo, please go ahead. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. I have a question on the sustainability of margins at Taco Bell. So the margins are quite impressive in the context of the labor pressures you're seeing in California, the value -- spend from consumers. So how sustainable do you think these margin improvements are at Taco Bell? And what incremental levers do you expect to deploy going forward? In other words, wouldn't be able to talk about maybe 26%, 27% margin in the next two to three years? Thank you. Chris Turner : Yeah. Thanks, Danilo. Look, I think the Taco Bell margin story is very impressive in the context of a value-oriented environment. The Taco Bell business is serving consumers, creating buzz in the market, bringing great innovation to bear and delivering value when consumers need it. And yet you're seeing us maintain these industry-leading margins. That comes from leveraging our scale on our food purchases and our franchisees take advantage of that scale. And I think in the long run, you'll see us continue to be more and more productive in terms of how we operate the restaurants. As we become more and more digital, 35% digital mix, you heard us talk about Voice AI, which is accelerating at a faster pace than we expected just three months ago. And that is just one more example of a digital lever that allows us to provide a great a great customer experience, team member experience and be more productive in back of house. Lots of other things happening on that front, I think it sets up well for us to continue to be able to provide strong value to consumers and great margins for -- for our franchisees and our company stores going forward. David Gibbs : Well, thank you, everyone, for your time today. I appreciate all the questions. Obviously, we're proud of the results we put up this quarter despite headwinds but we're even more proud and excited about the future as we go into the second half of this year and into 2025. Inflation is moderating, margins are getting stronger, our brands are getting stronger in this environment, Taco Bell putting up really good numbers. The work that we're doing behind the scenes to reinvent how we run the business, to reallocate G&A, to really lean in on our digital leadership and our investments in the AI, the laps are getting easier. We talk about our twin growth engines and how they performed this quarter. But also this quarter, I spent some time with our international Taco Bell franchisees at Taco Con, where we get everybody together from around the world to talk -- compare marketing calendars and the excitement at that convention about the future of Taco Bell was incredibly strong, the quality of the partners that we have for that brand, and although we're not calling that one of the growth -- the twin growth engine today, it's clear that the future for Taco Bell International is quite bright and another reason to be excited about the future. So a quarter that I think demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brands and excitement about the future as we go into Q3. Thank you, everybody, for your time.

Despite the complex consumer environment around the globe, our team managed to grow profits 3% year-over-year with the quarter bringing to light the real strengths of our twin growth engines, Taco Bell U.S., which meaningfully outperformed the industry on comp sales and KFC International, which meaningfully outperformed on unit growth. Although the U.S. QSR industry experienced negative traffic trends in Q3, Taco Bell U.S. posted an impressive 4% increase in same-store sales and led the industry in Q3 on value perception among all QSR users. Taco Bell delivered another quarter of significant market share gains driven by the execution of the brand's magic formula involving brand buzz, value, category entry points and digital engagement. Taco Bell's competitive advantages in innovation, value leadership at compelling price points and strong consumer connection are clear reasons why the brand remains a category of one when it comes to winning with consumers in any economic environment. Our other twin growth engine, KFC International, delivered 9% year-over-year unit growth, an incredible result that led all major competitors and that reflects the underlying power of the brand and the confidence of our franchise partners in the future of our business. KFC International's development was diverse, spanning 64 countries. Furthermore, gross unit openings year-to-date are up nearly 150 units over last year. Building on this momentum, KFC is enhancing its core capabilities to ensure growth over the long term by establishing 7 centers of excellence focused on restaurant design, customer insights, market planning, food innovation and more. These centers will drive operational and marketing excellence while leveraging the brand's scale, strengthening a competitive moat that has helped KFC grow successfully around the globe in 150 countries, an achievement that few global brands have ever accomplished. It is no secret that the global macroeconomic environment remains complex. In many parts of the world, our brands are delivering outstanding growth and outperforming the competition. We continue to see strong sales growth in KFC regions such as Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and parts of both Europe and Asia. In South Africa, where our KFC sales are up strongly, our teams have improved our value proposition, limiting recent price increases to 1% in comparison to nearly high single digits in affected local competitors. In some other geographies, our permits did not meet our expectations, and our teams are working with our franchise partners to reestablish strong value offerings, all while safeguarding franchisee profitability. The complex consumer environment that exists in many markets around the globe has contributed to pronounced regional sales variations, which has caused our system sales growth to fall short of our long-term algorithm this year. The most pronounced regional headwinds continue to be in the Middle East, Indonesia and Malaysia, stemming from the impact of the Middle East conflict. In these markets, KFC same-store sales declines have generally ranged between 15% and 45% throughout the year, including Q3. We are fortunate that the vast majority of our restaurants are in the hands of highly scaled and well-capitalized franchisees around the globe, including Americana, our largest partner in the Middle East, who can weather temporary headwinds like this over extended periods. However, in a few isolated cases, the scale and duration of these sales impacts are affecting the financial health of our less scaled or less well-capitalized partners, particularly those whose restaurants have been most heavily impacted by the Middle East conflict. We are working closely with those specific partners to help them navigate the challenges and implement tactical and strategic changes, including pricing studies, introducing new value offerings and adjusting development schedules to improve profitability and position business for healthy growth in the future. As we mentioned on the second quarter earnings call, the same geopolitical pressures have grown to meaningfully, but less severely impact certain markets beyond the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. As an example, we have seen in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand that KFC same-store sales performance in certain individual stores has been significantly impacted. Importantly, these specific pressures have been location specific and not indicative of broader global trends. Specifically, our KFC markets, excluding China that we believe were not materially impacted by the Middle East conflict, reported an encouraging low single-digit increase in same-store sales. As we shift to the U.S., the overall QSR industry is navigating a complex consumer environment. Of course, our scale and digital capabilities are an even bigger advantage right now and our powerhouse Taco Bell business, which represents 75% of our U.S. profit, is thriving. While our Pizza Hut and KFC businesses are more challenged in this environment, we have fantastic leaders in place in these businesses who are working through revised strategies to create a step change in the results. Overall, we achieved 5% unit growth year-over-year, an impressive outcome considering the obstacle faced by our teams. Closures have temporarily increased this year, primarily in markets dealing with impacts from the Middle East conflict and in China. Despite the strength in our gross unit openings in this tough environment, the risk of an increase in closures of lower volume units affected by the Middle East conflict could impact our Q4 net new unit growth and put at risk our ability to deliver our 5% unit growth target. Given the lower volume nature of these units, we would not expect a material financial impact from their closure. While 2024 unit growth will reflect a temporary reset on unit closures, we're encouraged at the pace of our gross unit openings that Chris will discuss in more depth and as we look at our 2025 pipeline, see no change in pace behind our gross opening momentum, giving us confidence in the strong fundamentals of our brands. Now let me highlight our relevant, easy and distinctive brands, or RED for short, in more detail followed by our unrivaled culture and talent and good growth strategy. I'll then turn it to Chris to provide further updates on our third quarter results, including our bold restaurant development, unmatched operating capabilities and balance sheet position and capital strategy. Starting with the KFC division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profit, system sales grew 1% as significant unit growth was offset by the aforementioned Middle East conflict impact and transaction softness in several regions navigating constrained consumer spending. Such challenges have led competitors to introduce incremental value offers, namely to capture low ticket transactions in markets such as the U.K., France and India. The good news is that despite category headwinds, we are gaining or holding share in several of our largest international markets as well as seeing positive transaction growth in markets like Mexico, Poland and Korea. We're also sustaining high system sales growth in larger regions like Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, where we benefited from product innovation and more stable consumer environment. Helping KFC to remain agile has been the focus of its robust digital strategy. Digital mix, now over 55%, grew 3 percentage points over the previous quarter on expanding kiosk and click-and-collect channels. In the U.S., limited time offers underperformed expectations due to a more intense competitive environment, particularly within the chicken QSR category. In Q4, the team will focus on strengthening its value proposition and has recently introduced boneless innovation like original recipe chicken tenders. Additionally, the team will capitalize on the success of the KFC Rewards membership growth, which has contributed to digital sales growth over 20% from last year. Moving on to Taco Bell, which contributes 37% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 5%, driven by a 4% increase in same-store sales. This quarter, Taco Bell gained momentum with the launch of the Cheesy Street Chalupas, marking the brand's first innovation on the canteen chicken platform. Further momentum came from the reintroduction of the Cheez-It and investing behind the $7 Lux cravings box. The team tapped into cheesy Street Chalupa innovation to drive delivery sales by offering exclusive access to an aggregates premium members, which led to 7 daily sales records for the aggregator during the quarter. Toward the end of the quarter, the team made the strategic move to make breakfast optional for our franchise partners, providing greater flexibility to spend our marketing dollars more effectively on growth drivers such as Cantina Chicken and our cravings value venue. These are platforms where our marketing spend has had significant success building new and very profitable sales layers. We expect the net impact from these changes to be less than a 1-point headwind to same-store sales growth. We intend to reintroduce breakfast in the future with a bolder, more distinctive Taco Bell approach. In another strategic priority involving growth through its loyalty program, Taco Bell drove impressive advancements with 90-day active loyalty users increasing by 50% year-over-year. On the digital front, where Taco Bell U. S. has implemented the majority of Yum!'s digital and technology platforms, digital sales grew an amazing 30% year-over-year. Internationally, Taco Bell focused on executing its 3 core pillars, brand, food and value, leading to positive same-store sales growth for the quarter. Very encouragingly, that momentum has continued into Q4. To strengthen brand relevance, the team is connecting more with local cultures, including most recently in the U.K. with the launch of encore hours, allowing stores to stay open late near music venues to serve fans after shows. We were also pleased to see our first equity store opened in the U.K. in late October with a very encouraging consumer response, giving us confidence in our accelerated investment in the brand internationally. Clearly, Taco Bell International has the potential to be a third growth engine for Yum! for many years to come. At Pizza Hut, which represents 13% of our divisional operating profit, system sales declined 1% as the same-store sales decline of 4% was partially offset by 2% unit growth. The third quarter started strong in the U.S. with momentum from my hot box and a robust marketing plan for the Chicago Tavern Style Pizza, which translated to positive traffic growth for the full quarter and ahead of the QSR industry. However, product news and bounce-back offers were not sufficient to compete against deep value offers in the market. Throughout the quarter, several markets became more intentional in pursuing value, including China, India and countries within the Middle East. As an example, in some of our pressured markets, we shifted towards a lower price point value over abundant value. At the same time, we are making progress in repositioning the brand over the long term, most recently hiring a new Chief Brand Officer, and have plans to improve and expand our consumer relationship management and loyalty platforms next year. Lastly, at Habit Burger Grill, while overall sales remained under pressure during the third quarter, there were encouraging signs of momentum as the quarter progressed. Same-store sales trends improved each period in the quarter as the team leveraged recent accolades, including being recognized as having the #1 grilled chicken sandwich by daily meal and the #1 fast food burger inside by USA TODAY. These accolades were impressive, given many of the other contenders have a broader national presence with larger store footprints. Clever marketing efforts, combined with refinements to have its media mix using Yum!'s proprietary marketing analytics platform, successfully ignited consumer excitement driving visits to the brand to experience the award-winning Double Char and tempura green beans. I'm pleased to see this positive momentum continue into the fourth quarter. Now I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. A hallmark of Yum! and a key driver of our performance is the strength of our talent base, including our deep bench of amazing leaders always ready to take on bigger roles. I'd like to start by congratulating Erica Burkhart, who was recently promoted to Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary for Yum!. Erica is a seasoned and respected leader throughout Yum!, who has been with the company for over 20 years. She leads by example and has earned the trust of her peers and teams alike, providing invaluable insight and counsel on key initiatives across Yum! and our brands. I would also like to recognize her predecessor, Scott Catlett, for his years of service and the tremendous impact he made at Yum! and our brands as he starts a new chapter outside of the company. Additionally, as we progress on our journey to becoming the leading global digital restaurant company, I'm pleased to announce Joe Park has been named President of Yum!'s Digital and Restaurant Technology Ecosystem in addition to his overall Chief Digital and Technology Officer role. He's doing a fantastic job bringing our vision to life for a fully collaborative digital and technology team across Yum! and is reinventing how the team works to drive increased consistency and efficiency in tools and processes as well as greater deployment of AI-driven capabilities, leveraging our global data assets and scaling our proprietary technology. Also during the quarter, for the first time in over 2 years, we brought nearly 200 of our most senior leaders from around the world together for our Global Leadership Summit. Our technology leaders at the Summit made up the largest functional group, demonstrating our focus on leaning into our digital leadership and our investments in AI. We showcased the progress we're making on our good growth journey and what we're doing behind the scenes to reinvent how we run the business by better exploiting our scale to drive future growth. Moving on to the planet pillar of our good growth strategy. Just last month, we published our annual global citizenship and sustainability report. This report highlights Yum!'s long-standing dedication and continued progress and investments in our 3 priority pillars of people, food and planet. We are on track to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% by 2030 and continue to make progress around sustainable packaging building upon our harmonized cross-brand packaging policy. In closing, in a difficult operating environment, we are encouraged by the underlying strength of the fundamentals of our business. Stepping back, our twin growth engines are demonstrating what makes them special through share gains at Taco Bell U.S. and strong franchisee investment in unit expansion in KFC International. Despite the numerous headwinds, we are proud of the resilience of our overall business model and our ability to deliver 6% core operating profit growth year-to-date. Importantly, our teams are making great progress in ushering our brands into the [indiscernible], leveraging Yum! scale and digital and technology capabilities to improve sales and operations, leading to improved franchisee profitability and value creation for our shareholders. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, our balance sheet and capital strategy, and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to our third quarter financial results. System sales grew 1%, driven by 5% unit growth. As the third quarter progressed, sales trended below our expectations due to a more challenged U.S. environment, soft trends in China and continued pressures from the Middle East conflict. Ex special G&A was $252 million for the quarter, less than anticipated due to lower performance-based compensation. Reported G&A was $263 million, including $11 million of special expense related to our ongoing resource optimization program. Restaurant-level margins were 15.8%, modestly below levels from last year, partially due to KFC U.K. and Ireland equity restaurants acquired in the second quarter. Core operating profit grew 3%. Third quarter ex special EPS was $1.37. Our ex special tax rate was higher year-over-year at 24%, translating to a $0.09 year-over-year EPS headwind. Now on to development. In the third quarter, we achieved a significant development milestone, surpassing 60,000 restaurants worldwide. Overall, we increased our unit count by 547 units, reflecting 1,029 gross openings and 482 closures. KFC drove Yum!'s unit growth with the team opening 685 gross units led by China, India, Thailand and Japan. Notably, we've seen an acceleration this past year in net new unit expansion in markets like Italy, the Philippines and South Africa. Most of our key KFC markets report paybacks less than 5 years, and as a result, we continue to see a strong appetite by franchisees for unit growth. In Saudi Arabia, for example, we expect our store count this year to grow by nearly 30 restaurants with paybacks still under 3 years despite conflict-related sales pressures. Turning to Pizza Hut. We added 63 units this quarter, driven by 292 gross unit openings offset by 229 closures. New unit openings were led by China, India and the United States. Taco Bell added nearly 50 gross units, led by the U.S., while 14 other countries contributed to growth. Recall, Yum! China went through a portfolio restructuring earlier this year, resulting in 60 closures in the first half of the year. Excluding China, Taco Bell International's unit count increased 7% year-over-year. Last month, we also opened our first store in Bosnia and our first equity store in the U.K. We expect to open several equity Taco Bell U.K. stores by year-end, providing a fantastic test bed to generate insights to guide the business model, including an innovation, pricing, technology and restaurant experience. Moving to our digital and technology initiatives. We continue to make great progress on both of the parallel phases of our journey. Recall, the first phase is focused on acquiring, building and scaling a comprehensive suite of platforms to enable ownership of our data, control of the digital ecosystem speed of innovation and cost advantages. These foundational platforms include aside, our young, cloud-first point-of-sale system, our e-commerce engine, our delivery optimization platform, Dragon Tail, Super App, an integrated restaurant management platform for team members, restaurant general managers and area coaches, and a scalable global data platform that houses over 80% of our transaction data. In the second phase, we are focused on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through AI and by leveraging our extensive data assets. We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities with exciting innovations, including One Touch labor scheduling and inventory management, consumer feedback dashboards, quality control monitoring and personalized AI-driven marketing, to name a few. Let me now discuss additional digital and technology accomplishments for Q3 across our easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights pillars. I'll begin with our easy experiences pillar, focused on providing frictionless experiences to our consumers. Taco Bell is currently working on 2 significant digital initiatives in the drive-through, voice AI and loyalty program enhancements. Drive-through voice AI continue to scale across our network with many franchisees eager to test this new innovation. To date, we have processed over 2 million successful orders with the system now in place in over 300 Taco Bell U.S. stores, making Taco Bell the largest QSR voice AI brand in the world. For loyalty, Taco Bell is using its connected ecosystem to allow loyalty consumers to identify themselves at the drive-through and kiosk, enabling personalization of their ordering experience and earning and redeeming of loyalty rewards. This was rolled to 160 stores in Q3, and we're encouraged with early results, which clearly show an increase in sign-ups and in daily loyalty transactions all without an impact to speed of service. As required enablers of these technologies, we have accelerated deployment of digital menu boards to now over 6,000 restaurants. Digital menu boards will be a Taco Bell brand standard in 2025, along with Yum!'s proprietary point-of-sale system side. Our other key initiative under this pillar is the rollout of Yum!'s e-commerce engine. We completed migration of a substantial portion of Pizza Hut's U.S. traffic in the quarter and are on track to complete migration by year-end. We also recently launched the Yum! e-commerce engine in Pizza Hut U.K., our second international Pizza Hut market, and will target 2 new Pizza Hut international markets before year-end. Next, I'll discuss our easy operations pillar, where we continue to deploy our world-class technology to provide our franchisees and team members with the capabilities to operate their stores more effectively and efficiently. This quarter, we started to expand Super App to KFC U.S. now having reached 50 countries and nearly 5,000 KFC and 8,000 Pizza Hut stores with the technology. We are planning to nearly double the KFC penetration by year-end. Recall, Super App is our modular restaurant management platform that offers a suite of products to managers and team members to simplify their jobs and improve operations. This quarter, we also reached significant scale for our AI-powered labor scheduler, now in use in over 5,000 Taco Bell U.S. stores, driving significant improvements in labor planning accuracy and labor efficiency. At Taco Bell, we now have AI-powered forecasts, driving both our labor scaling and inventory management processes. We expect to scale these solutions to our other brands throughout 2025. Lastly, I'll discuss our easy insights pillar. This quarter, we successfully launched personalized AI-driven marketing campaigns that relative to traditional digital marketing campaigns generated significant increases in consumer engagement, leading to increased purchases and a reduction in consumer churn. This innovation has the potential to greatly improve our marketing return on investment and allow us to extract the unique benefits of our proprietary global data hub, and we expect it to be broadly and easily scalable across brands. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $34 million, reflecting $52 million in gross CapEx and $18 million in refranchising proceeds. We repurchased 2.1 million shares totaling $277 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1x. As a reminder, we have no debt maturities until 2026. Our capital priorities remain unchanged : investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Before I close, let me touch on the outlook for the balance of 2024. We expect Q4 core operating profit growth to be mid- to high single digits, excluding contributions from the 53rd week, which we expect will add approximately $35 million. Of course, precise forecasting is difficult in this environment. To finish with guidance, we expect Taco Bell fourth quarter company-operated store margins to be in the range of 23% to 24% and lastly, our Q4 net interest expense to be just under $140 million. Taking into consideration the challenging environment, I am incredibly proud of our team's perseverance to open approximately 4,500 gross new restaurants or roughly 1 store every 2 hours, an envy at restaurant industry. Into next year, we'll continue our focus on capturing the global white space opportunity that offers significant runway for our iconic brands. I'm excited by our continued progress in transforming Yum! into a digital multi-brand powerhouse. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Taco Bell Consumer Day in January, where we'll further unpack many of these exciting digital and technology initiatives. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim Securities. Gregory Francfort : My question is going to be on operating profit growth, but thanks for the thoughts on the fourth quarter. I think that leaves you a little bit below the 8% growth for this year. I guess, as you look out to next year, how confident are you in getting that back up to 8%? And what's the bridge maybe from what the outlook looks like this year to what might be the contributors next year? Chris Turner : Yes, Greg. Hey, this year, year-to-date, we\u2019ve got 6% core operating profit growth in a really challenging environment. So when we step back and look at that, we think that demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business model. The main change from the last time we updated you on the last call is that our sales didn\u2019t meet expectations in a few key markets, including China and the Middle East, where we have outsized exposure. And as a result, we tempered our expectations in Q4. Of course, that on a full year basis, if you flow through, [indiscernible] about Q4, we likely will end the year below our operating profit algorithm for 2024. But of course, the main driver of that was this conflict situation. Without that, we would have had a very strong year and been on or above the algorithm. And of course, we delivered that while still investing in things that drive the long-term health of the business. Big investments in digital and AI. We talked about voice AI progressing rapidly, marketing-driven AI, 40 other AI-driven projects that are happening in the business. So that resilient business model and investing in the long-term growth of the business. We\u2019re still working through the plans for 2025. We\u2019ll share an update, as we always do, on the next call. But there\u2019s no major things that are unusual right now as we look at that 2025 plan. But when we think about the long-term trajectory of the business, our dual growth engines continue to perform and our digital capabilities continue to power the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Just a confirmation question and then a follow-up on Taco Bell, just on the guidance for the fourth quarter as it relate to mid- to high single-digit core operating profit growth. Are you able to talk about the base case for global same-store sales that does underpin that outlook by any chance? And just on Taco Bell, very strong relative performance, obviously, with your 4% same-store sales. And you mentioned that you were the best ranked by consumers in value within QSR during the quarter and it obviously happens at a time where the industry got way more aggressive. So just curious how you protected or even expanded your value positioning in this environment? And is there any new value ideas in the hopper as we move into 2025, particularly as a few large QSRs are eager to put more permanent value on their menu? David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, Brian. I\u2019m glad you pointed out the Taco Bell\u2019s strength, it\u2019s obviously something we\u2019re incredibly proud of. And you can see that strength is evident in the U.S. with the plus 4. We were also positive in international. And the other thing I\u2019ll share is that, that momentum has continued into Q4. A lot of it is what you said. It has to do with the unique way that Taco Bell can provide value with products that nobody else has. Really, if you think about it, Taco Bell can provide a product that is a value product, that\u2019s an innovative product and that can help our franchisees margins. That\u2019s an incredibly powerful set of tools that we have in our toolbox that our competitors don\u2019t. As we move forward, of course, Taco Bell has always got ways to bring in new value. Right now, you\u2019re seeing us launching the decades menu and then you can get some of those products within the $7 Lux Box, for example, which is a unique way to bring innovation and value to consumers. So I think we\u2019re very confident in Taco Bell\u2019s ability to win in this environment relative to our peers. As far as sales guidance and everything for the quarter, it\u2019s obviously a difficult environment to forecast sales globally. But as I said, the trends that we saw in Q3 are continuing into Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower from Citi. Jon Tower : Great. I appreciate all the color you provided in the gross unit openings for the brands across the globe. I was hoping maybe you could drill a little bit more into the net unit number. David, I think you mentioned that there's a potential risk of not hitting the 5% this year. And then maybe specifically drilling into, you do have pockets of weakness across the globe. And I think you had mentioned some of the smaller operators having a hard time keeping the lights on. How should that inform the thinking regarding '25? Is there an opportunity to perhaps consolidate some of those closures into '24, such '25 is a cleaner year? And/or are there opportunities to consolidate some of those stores into larger operators within markets such that your net unit number is not under too much pressure? David Gibbs : Yes. I have a couple of things on development, and then I'll let Chris give them a little more detail. If you think about it, 2024 is obviously a very challenged year in terms of the impact to our sales in certain parts of the world and some of the consumer pull back. So for us, we're incredibly proud that this year does showcase how resilient business model is and the capabilities of the vast majority of our franchisees to continue to grow and invest in the business in this challenged environment, like American, our franchisee in the Middle East, you would think that this business would have disrupted -- this situation would have disrupted them more than it has, but they just reported. They're positive operating profit in this environment, continuing to develop. That is a unique strength of Yum! in terms of the capability of our franchisees around the world. And 2024, as difficult as it is, really is allowing us to showcase that and let that part of our business model really shine. Americana has got about 2/3 of the stores of the Middle East, so most of our stores are in very good hands. As far as the risk that we signaled on net new units, just to clarify and give you a little more detail, that was risk to the 5%. Right now, the numbers that we're looking at roll up in the 4.5% to 5.0% range. So we would still round to 5% on algorithm. But closures are obviously a little elevated this year. If you're going to have a little bit of a shortfall, you'd rather have see this strong gross development mostly continuing and then closure of some lower volume stores. If you think about the closure rate, it's probably about another 0.5% of our store base. So this is not some widespread issue to your points about struggling -- other struggling franchisees. It really isn't a widespread issue. It's just a few stores, lower volume that might have closed in the future where those closures were pulled up. I'll let Chris give you a little more color on it. Chris Turner : Yes, John, let me give you a little more color on the change in net new unit trajectory first through a couple of lenses. First, if we just look at the deceleration in net new unit growth from last year to this year on a geographic perspective, we see that about 40% of the change in trajectory comes from countries and markets in our business that are directly impacted by this conflict situation. There\u2019s another 25% that are markets that have some impact from the conflict, not as much as those core markets, but that gives you about 2/3 of the change in net new unit trajectory that is in some way tied to the conflict situation. So that gives you a little bit of bound on it. And of course, history would say we typically work through these situations over the long term. Another way to look at it, David mentioned a little bit higher closures this year. As we said before, when units closed in our system, they tend to be lower volume units. And we see that again this year. The average unit volume of the units that are closing this year is about 60% of our global average unit volume. And so when you actually look at the system sales contribution of our net new unit growth this year, it\u2019s going to be basically the same as the system sales growth contribution from our higher net new unit rate last year. So the economic implications of this aren\u2019t that big on our business. So that gives you a couple of additional ways to just think about this change in net new unit trajectory. The other thing I'll add, you asked about specific franchisee situations. As David said, our global franchise base is strong. Americana in the Middle East region has \u2013 the majority of our stores is navigating this very well. In fact, in the 22 countries in the specific Middle East geography, we only have 2 countries right now where we\u2019re working with franchisees to transition the business into better hands. One of those processes is pretty far along. Another one, we\u2019re working with the franchisee to either address some challenges in the business or to get it into the hands of another owner. There\u2019s some complexity always in the beginning of those situations, we might have some unit closures might have some onetime accounting adjustments that come with it. But our history would say that we typically end up getting the business into 3C franchisee hands, and that sets the business up for long-term growth and health. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Recognizing it's too early to talk about '25 specifically. Wondering if you could just comment high level about how you think about managing profitability as well as the team has in '24 if macro pressures continue? Maybe specifically, can you talk a little bit about G&A growth and how you think about that generally looking ahead and perhaps the ability of the divisions to continue managing cost and profitability? Chris Turner : Yes. As I said earlier, we\u2019ll give more of an update on the 2025 plan when we get to the next call. As I mentioned, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s significantly unusual right now as we\u2019re tumbling that plan. As we think about the puts and takes, our twin growth engines continue to perform in a strong way. We\u2019ve shared that our gross unit outlook for next year is similar to this year. On the G&A front, we\u2019ve made productivity moves this year. We\u2019ll continue to get some benefit from those. Of course, we will have a reset of our incentive comp. So those are a couple of factors that we\u2019ll look at there. But if I think about the long-term trajectory of our business, there\u2019s a lot to be excited about, in particular, with those 2 primary growth engines. Taco Bell continues to outperform in any sort of economic environment in the U.S. KFC International 9% unit growth in Q3 continues to build units outpacing its competitors, and our digital story continues to strengthen. So if you look over the long term, there\u2019s a lot of reasons to be excited and confident in our business model. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. David Palmer : I wanted to maybe double-click on a couple of the digital initiatives. You highlighted the AI-enabled digital marketing that you talked about, Chris, and David mentioned the AI-enabled drive-throughs in the release. On the digital AI marketing, is that hyper personalized push marketing in the app and other? You mentioned it was a nice lift where you're rolling that out. Could you maybe give some more color about what that lift was and where the rollout is across your brands? And on the AI voice drive-thrus in the U.S. I'm wondering if that could be a nice profit driver for Yum! Brands. Any reason that would not scale quickly in 2025 and any offsets to the fees that you'll collect there? Chris Turner : Yes. Great. These are 2 initiatives that we\u2019re very excited about. I\u2019ll provide a little more color on the AI-driven marketing. This is something we\u2019re doing in a coordinated way across our 3 large brands in the U.S. We\u2019ve run pilots in each of the brands. I\u2019m not going to share any specific numbers on it. But I can tell you what enables it is our digital ecosystem. And it\u2019s really what we call the AI factory within that ecosystem that leverages our massive data assets that we\u2019ve built, which enable us to know our consumers. If you think about in the Taco Bell environment, it leverages the fact that we have the POS in the store, the digital menu boards and the ability to actually bring these to life at the store and through our loyalty programs and through our connections with customers in the app. So we\u2019ve got many ways to bring it to life, but it essentially allows us to do more personalized tailoring of offers and to learn and refine much more rapidly than we could before. So we\u2019re excited about the potential of this. We\u2019ll continue to bring it to life across the brands and across markets as we progress. On the voice AI side, really, we\u2019re driven by how do we enhance the consumer and customer experience in our restaurants and how do we enhance the team member experience. And so far, the results in Taco Bell with voice AI have been outstanding on both fronts. The customer response has been very positive, and our team members really enjoy having what they call an extra pair of hands in the restaurant to help them operate the store. Our rollout pace this year has been much faster than we originally envisioned going into the year, and I think that speaks to how our operators are seeing the capability and how our franchisees are seeing the capability. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : In your prepared remarks, you really did touch on many digital initiatives, many of which have yet to get to the hands of franchisees fully, especially on a global basis. So the question is on the previous Yum! language bending the curve on G&A. If there's not further opportunity in '25, you talked about it there is, longer term, how much of an opportunity do we have to use fee collection from franchisees that will significantly drive their own profitability and ease of running their own businesses to kind of think about fee recapture, if you will, on a basis points of franchisee sales basis. I mean your sales base is so big, collecting even 50 or 100 basis points of franchise sales would obviously be very significant in terms of your total G&A spend. So I wanted to see if we could have an opportunity today to kind of think about the longer-term potential of that? David Gibbs : Yes. Thanks, John. Just a couple of high-level comments on that. I know you and David asked a similar question in that regard. Our goal with technology is to give our franchisees the absolute best technology in the industry, better than any of our peers at the lowest possible cost, better than they can get anywhere else. That is our north star when it comes to tech. We know that if they get that tech in their restaurants and it drives sales and drives improvement in their business models, like voice AI is doing improving their margins by cutting labor, they\u2019ll build more stores, top line will grow more. And that\u2019s the best way for us to leverage technology to drive profitability in the business. Of course, we\u2019re making investments. We will recover those investments. But voice AI is a great example. We\u2019re providing that to our franchisees at what we believe is a much lower cost than our competitors in the industry are having to pay for other third-party solutions. And we will continue to do that, and that is our mission. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. David Tarantino : My question, David, I think you mentioned that as part of your response to a question, that the comp trend you saw in the third quarter carried over into Q4. I just wanted to make sure that, that comment was directly related to Taco Bell and not the global business. And I guess, secondly, I was wondering if you could comment on the KFC segment, and the comparison does get quite a bit better or easier in the fourth quarter, but I know you still have some macro pressures you're dealing with. So any sort of directional commentary on the KFC business and how we should think about that for the fourth quarter would be great. David Gibbs : Yes. On Taco, if the comment was on Taco Bell in terms of sales trends where we sit in the quarter, we feel good about being able to continue the momentum from Q3, but in the U.S. and internationally. Now of course, Taco Bell is a little bit easier to forecast because Taco Bell\u2019s global store footprint is really unaffected by the conflict. It\u2019s a lot harder to forecast KFC. What I will say is we haven\u2019t really gotten to the point where even though we\u2019re past the 1-year anniversary of the conflict, we haven\u2019t gotten to the point where it really started to impact sales. So we don\u2019t know how sales will behave once we get to that lap. But certainly, the lap will get better, and that should lead to a change in the trajectory of the KFC sales. Operator : That is the end of the Q&A session. So I'll now hand over to David Gibbs for closing remarks. David Gibbs : Great. I appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. We\u2019re excited about the upcoming January 28 Taco Bell Investor Day. So if you don\u2019t have that circled on your calendar, please do, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing you out in Irvine, in California and L.A. then for that meeting. We\u2019ve got a lot of exciting stuff to share about Taco Bell. Thanks for everybody\u2019s time today. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining, everybody. You may now disconnect your lines.",

David Gibbs : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm incredibly proud of what Yum! brands accomplished this past year. Despite industry-wide challenges, we continue to deliver strong results, underscoring the resilience of our business model, the power of our iconic brands, and the strength of our world-class franchise partners. Our momentum is clear. We achieved remarkable milestones, generating over 50% of our system sales through digital channels, surpassing 60,000 total units globally, with more than 30,000 at KFC alone, and generating more than $1 billion in core operating profit from the Taco Bell Division for the first time ever. Taco Bell US delivered an incredibly strong year and one that significantly outperformed the industry, showing clearly that Taco Bell is a category of one brand. Our financial results reflect the strength of our business with full year core operating profit growth of 8%, reinforcing the power of our growth strategy and the durability of our business. One of the biggest drivers of our success, and a major unlock for our future, is our proprietary technology platform. In 2024, we accelerated our technology transformation by integrating our digital and technology teams into a unified global team. Additionally, we are thrilled today to introduce Byte by Yum!, our comprehensive collection of proprietary software-as-a-service products that enables our restaurant to deliver faster, more seamless experiences for consumers, while streamlining operations and empowering teams. Integrating our best-in-class, yet previously disparate solutions into a comprehensive, easy-to-deploy solution will help accelerate platform adoption. KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, US, all currently operate on our Byte digital ordering platform, and 25,000 Yum! restaurants across the world are using at least one Byte by Yum! product. As we continue to raise the bar on digital convenience and engagement, we are seeing clear results. Our digital sales grew approximately 15% in 2024, and we're just getting started. With the strength of our brands, the power of our technology, and the dedication of our franchisees and teams, we are well-positioned for another year of strong growth ahead. I'll now discuss the strategic drivers that underline our commitment to being the most loved, deeply connected, and always trusted brands for consumers around the world. Afterwards, Chris will provide a deep dive on our fourth quarter results, balance sheet position, and capital strategy, followed by our outlook for 2025. Starting with our loved pillar and our brands that champion consumer experiences, we're pleased to report that our twin growth engines, Taco Bell US and KFC International, delivered 7% system sales growth and 14% core operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. These two businesses, which represent approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit, continue to be powerful drivers of our long-term success. At KFC, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit, units grew 7% driving system sales growth of 3% for the full year, despite a 2% decline in same-store sales. In the fourth quarter, same-store sales were flat year-over-year, with international same-store sales improving to plus 1% and sequential momentum building throughout the quarter. We're especially encouraged by strong recoveries in the Middle East, where same-store sales experienced significant growth and robust performance in Africa, Latin America, and Canada, all of which saw mid- to high-single-digit same-store sales growth. In Africa, comps rose 9%, driven primarily by increased traffic as the team successfully executed a multi-pronged marketing approach, emphasizing boneless and core abundant value offerings while also expanding beverage sales. Latin America's strategy, leaning into everyday value and disruptive promotions, broadens its consumer reach and increased frequency, driving a 6% year-over-year same-store sales increase in Q4. We also saw notable quarter-over-quarter momentum in several key markets, including a five-point improvement across our Asia business, excluding China. Looking ahead to 2025, we remain focused on deepening market penetration by expanding relevant product offerings, including tenders, nuggets, twisters, and sandwiches, while enhancing our value perception. This will involve refining pricing strategies and identifying key category pricing thresholds to ensure we remain at the top of the consumer's consideration. Turning to Taco Bell, which accounts for 37% of our divisional operating profit, the brand continued its strong momentum in 2024, with full year system sales up 6% fueled by exceptional same-store sales growth. Taco Bell not only gained dollar share of total industry spend, but also increased consumer frequency across all income segments, reinforcing its broad consumer appeal. This momentum carried into the fourth quarter, with same-store sales rising 5% year-over-year, outpacing the U.S. industry by five percentage points, driven by the successful execution of Taco Bell's magic formula. The Decades platform, which brought back five of the brand's most in-demand nostalgic menu items, generated strong product innovation, brand excitement, and exclusive merchandise for loyalty members. The team also underscored value leadership with the $7 Luxe Box, one of the most compelling value offerings in the industry. At Taco Bell International, same-store sales grew 3% in Q4, marking the strongest quarter of the year. Several key markets, including the U.K., Spain, and India, saw notable sales lifts after successfully refocusing on brand buzz and disruptive value promotions to drive transactions. Taco Bell's consistent market outperformance, innovative product pipeline, and strategic value positioning set the stage for continued strong growth in 2025. Turning to Pizza Hut, which represents 13% of our divisional operating profit, full year system sales declined 1%, including 2% net new unit growth. In the fourth quarter, same-store sales growth improved 300 basis points sequentially. We saw standout performance in India from successfully driving brand buzz and consumer engagement with innovative limited-time offerings like the Momo Mia Pizza, while also leveraging aggressive value deals to boost frequency in trial. In the US, sales remained under pressure due to more value competition across both the QSR industry and the pizza category. We've seen that everyday value offerings, such as the $7 deal lovers, effectively drive repeat visits from existing consumers. However, to attract lighter-lapse consumers, we must lean further into disruptive and distinctive value promotions. Looking ahead to 2025, our focus will be on striking the right balance between everyday value and disruptive campaigns to engage a broader consumer base. Additionally, we are committed to enhancing the digital experience with improvements to our app platform that will elevate engagement and bring value to the forefront of the consumer journey with Pizza Hut. With the right mix of innovation, value, and digital improvements, we are confident in our ability to strengthen Pizza Hut's relative brand positioning and reinvigorate top-line momentum. At Habit Burger & Grill Division, full year system sales grew 1% driven by unit growth. Encouragingly, same-store sales trends improved in the fourth quarter, fueled by a successful marketing campaign highlighting Habit's recognition as the number-one burger in America by USA Today Reader's Choice. The team will continue to leverage this momentum, emphasizing its suite of award-winning menu items, including the Double Char burger and number-one ranked side, Tempura Green Beans. Beyond top-line growth, we are pleased to see operational efficiencies, translating it to improved profitability. The ongoing labor productivity initiatives launched in 2024 have driven notable improvements in labor throughput, allowing us to reduce restaurant labor expense as a percentage of sales by 150 basis points, despite higher labor rates in California. As a result, restaurant-level margins reached 10% in 2024, 150 basis points higher year-over-year. This progress underscores our commitment to enhancing operational efficiency, strengthening brand equity, and positioning Habit Burger for sustained growth in the year ahead. As we embrace a bolder, more creative approach to innovation, we are taking decisive steps to elevate the consumer experience and meet the evolving preferences of the next-generation consumer. At KFC in December, we opened Saucy by KFC, a flavor-forward test-concept restaurant in Orlando designed for the next generation of boneless chicken lovers. The menu features tenders and sandwiches paired with 11 irresistible sauces complemented by a diverse 11 beverage lineup, including teas, freezes, and refreshers. Early engagement has been promising, reinforcing our belief in Saucy's potential to drive sales and enhance brand relevance. At Taco Bell, we are testing Live M\u00e1s Cafe, an in-store beverage-focused cafe featuring specialty drinks like chillers, Agua Refrescas, coffees, and more. Consumer response has been strong, with the cafe concept driving meaningful incremental sales. These innovations reflect our commitment to staying ahead of consumer trends, enhancing brand differentiation, and creating new avenues for growth. While these are only one-unit pilots today, we plan to expand both test concepts this year to better understand their long-term growth potential and role in our portfolio. Moving to our connected pillar, we're advancing our ability to serve every consumer everywhere at any time. The strong momentum in digital sales in 2024 is a testament to targeted brand initiatives, loyalty conversion strategies, and continued deployment of our proprietary tech platform. Yum! Digital Sales grew approximately 15% to over $30 billion, underscoring the impact of our digital-first approach. At KFC, excluding China, digital sales surged more than 20%, driven by expanded kiosk adoption. With more than 50% of stores outside China equipped with kiosks at yearend 2024, our teams are focused on reaching 70% penetration by 2026. As digital engagement grows, so does our loyalty opportunity. At KFC, we are scaling our global loyalty program, now live in 14 markets, and early data is promising. Loyalty members show a 12% increase in visit frequency after joining. Loyalty remains a high potential growth area, and in 2025, we will sharpen our focus on optimizing program effectiveness. This includes expanding the adoption of loyalty technology across our portfolio, ensuring we continue to deepen consumer engagement and drive repeat visits through personalized, data-driven experiences. At Yum! we take great pride in our unrivaled culture and talent, including our deep bench of amazing leaders. I'd like to start by congratulating Scott Mezvinsky who will assume the role of KFC division CEO on March 1st. Scott started 20 years ago as an analyst at KFC US and has had multiple positions at both KFC and Yum! including key market leadership roles with KFC around the globe and is currently the President of Taco Bell. Scott's innovative approach and strategic vision have significantly contributed to the success of Taco Bell and I have full confidence that his leadership will drive KFC to new heights. I would also like to recognize and thank Sabir Sami for his years of service and the tremendous impact he made at KFC. Sabir exemplifies what it means to lead with heart, smart, and courage and how these qualities can drive performance. Under his leadership, KFC experienced remarkable growth. As part of our commitment to fostering trust with consumers, communities, and partners, we continue to look for new ways to make our packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable. KFC US, Taco Bell, and Habit recently participated in the Petaluma reusable cup pilot, which was a strategic opportunity for Yum! to better understand the feasibility of reusables. In addition, Pizza Hut completed the first two of three phases of its initiative to increase pizza box recycling. This project aims to educate consumers about recycling pizza boxes and encourage positive changes in their behavior. Although the pilot is currently limited to one market, we hope that proactive communication about recycling will inspire positive consumer action. Before handing it over to Chris, I want to emphasize that delivering 8% core operating profit growth in a challenging year for the QSR industry while navigating discrete sales headwinds in select global markets is a testament to the resilience of our business model, the power of our brands, and the world-class talent we have leading our businesses around the globe. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we are more confident than ever in our ability to create long-term value leveraging these core competencies. We are taking bold, decisive actions to evolve our organization, positioning ourselves to capitalize on next generation growth opportunities. At the same time, our investments in 2024 involving technology innovation and operational effectiveness will make us more agile and resilient to ensure we emerge even stronger in the next phase of our journey. Everything we do at Yum! is anchored in our mission to grow iconic restaurant brands loved by consumers, connected through teamwork, technology, and our global scale, and trusted everywhere we operate. We are privileged to steward a portfolio of world-class, globally recognized brands backed by a high margin, recurring free cash flow business model operated by best-in-class franchisees that fuels long-term growth and delivers compounding shareholder value. With that, Chris, over to you. Chris Turner : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our 2024 financial results, our balance sheet and capital strategy, and our outlook for the upcoming year. Starting with the fourth quarter, system-wide sales grew 5%, driven by 5% net new unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Our topline trends strengthened in the fourth quarter, fueled by our twin growth engines as well as improvements in Taco Bell International and Pizza Hut International. Taco Bell's very impressive performance in the U.S. outpaced the market significantly. At KFC International, a sharper focus on digital engagement, everyday value platforms, and disruptive value offers led to a two-point sequential acceleration in same-store sales growth in markets outside of the Middle East, Indonesia, and Malaysia. In the Middle East, KFC saw a strong recovery in transactions, with traffic showing strong growth and same-store sales increasing by a notable percentage. By December, transactions had largely rebounded to pre-conflict levels. In China, KFC continued to expand its market share, with these gains further accelerating in the fourth quarter. We remain highly confident in our long-term potential in China, supported by our strong partnership with Yum! China, the largest and most capable restaurant operator in the world. Turning to our cost-line items, ex-special G&A expenses were $319 million, reflecting a 7% year-over-year decline. Reported G&A included a $27 million special expense related to our resource optimization project and costs for our German acquisition and Turkey termination. Restaurant-level margins improved by 20 basis points year-over-year to 17.6%, reflecting strong gains at both Habit and Taco Bell. As a result, core operating profit grew 12% due to higher restaurant-level margins and lower G&A spend. Ex-special EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.52. Moving to our full year results, we achieved 5% net new unit growth in line with our long-term aspirations. Same-store sales declined 1% for the year, impacted by broader global consumer sentiment, particularly in markets affected by the Middle East conflict. Ex-special G&A was $1.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Through our resource optimization program, we aim to drive greater efficiencies, enhance collaboration across the organization, and eliminate duplicative work across brands. As a result, we removed approximately $25 million in G&A expenditures in 2024, translating to $50 million on an annual basis, some of which we flowed to the bottom line, and some we reinvested into organizational capabilities that drive future growth. As we transition to a more streamlined, digital and technology organization with increased productivity, and as we continue to deploy our capabilities across our system, we're bending the curve on the net P&L impact of our digital and technology investments. Shifting to restaurant profitability, total restaurant-level margins stood at 16.8%, with Taco Bell achieving 24.3%, its second highest full year margin rate behind 2020. Habit restaurant-level margins improved to 10%, rising at 150 basis points year-over-year and over 500 basis points relative to 2022. Notably, despite higher labor rates in California, Habit's labor costs as a percentage of company sales decreased 150 basis points year-over-year, thanks to strategic labor model enhancements and process optimization. As a result of these moves and the hard work of our teams, we achieved core operating profit growth of 8%, a strong result given the macroeconomic challenges. This reflects the resilience of our multi-brand global franchise business model. Our effective tax rate ended the year at 23.5% outside of our previously communicated range of 21% to 23% due to higher tax expense on the gain realized when we sold our investment in Devyani in 2024. This profit growth drove a 4% increase in EPS to $5.39, excluding special items and the 53rd week impact, but including a higher year-over-year tax rate impact of $0.19, as well as an additional $0.18 headwind due to the combined impacts of year-over-year Devyani net investment losses and current year foreign currency translation headwinds. Moving on to our robust development engine, we opened over 1,800 new units in Q4 and more than 4,500 for the year, reinforcing the strong investment appeal of our brands and the high confidence of our franchise partners and the long-term growth potential of our brands. KFC led the way, opening a record nearly 2,900 new units this year across 97 countries, with 16 markets opening 25 or more stores. This year, the brand saw its highest ever store openings with record builds in China, South Africa, Japan, the Philippines, Italy, and Chile. At Pizza Hut, the team opened 512 units in Q4 and 1,280 for the year, driven by expansion in China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. In line with our modernization efforts, Pizza Hut introduced a new US restaurant design concept in November, replicating elements of its successful digital forward model from international markets. This format aligns with evolving consumer expectations by featuring an open kitchen, self-access pickup cabinets, and a digital drive-through with a streamlined menu of high demand items. Taco Bell continued its expansion, adding 347 new units, including 234 in the US and 113 internationally. Turning to the Middle East specifically, the resilience of our business in the region is evidenced by the fact that we opened 171 new stores in 2024 across our KFC and Pizza Hut brands, excluding Turkey. Thanks primarily to our largest partner in that region, Americana. On a net new unit basis globally, in total, we delivered 1,301 net new units in the quarter and 2,757 for the year, reflecting the strength of our gross openings, partly offset by an uptick in closures of primarily low volume, low royalty stores tied to underperforming markets. Nothing is more important than maintaining high standards and protecting the reputation of our brands. In this regard, last month, we terminated our franchise agreements in Turkey and reacquired the master franchise rights for Germany, which will result in the removal of 284 KFC and 254 Pizza Hut stores in Turkey from our unit count in Q1. From time to time, we remove franchisees from our system when they cannot meet our standards. In those situations, the closing units are typically well below our system average AUVs. As a result, and as was the case with Turkey, the financial impact is typically not significant to our ongoing financial performance from such terminations. These transitions create long-term opportunities for new growth-minded franchise partners, and we are actively searching for the right 3C franchise partner to reopen the Turkey market and drive future success. As a reminder, we had a similar situation in Saudi Arabia in 2020, and that market is now seeing strong growth. I'll now discuss our connected brand strategy that continues to revolutionize digital and technology across our system, strengthening operations, enhancing consumer experiences and unlocking new insights. Through Byte, we are making significant strides across our easy experiences, easy operations, and easy insights pillars, paving the way for a more connected, data-driven, and efficient future. We continue to focus on delivering frictionless consumer experiences under our easy experiences pillar. In 2024, we made excellent progress deploying our Byte digital ordering platform, formerly the Yum! Commerce platform. Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut in the US are all now powered by our Byte digital ordering products with Pizza Hut US substantially completing its transition in Q4. We also migrated three Pizza Hut international markets, including the UK, onto the Byte digital ordering platform in 2024. In the UK, the platform facilitated over 50% digital transaction growth on the app channel and drove faster processing times than the previous system. In 2025, we plan to expand our Byte digital ordering platform to five additional markets while introducing AI-driven personalization and our omni-channel loyalty software. The Byte digital ordering platform and its seamless connection with our Byte restaurant technologies make it easier for consumers to place digital orders while reducing complexity for our team members. Within easy operations, we empower franchisees with our best-in-class Byte restaurant management platform to enhance efficiency and optimize operations. In 2024, we more than doubled the number of stores using Byte's restaurant coach mobile app, formerly SuperApp, to over 20,000 KFC and Pizza Hut locations across 120 countries. This mobile app simplifies routine audits and operations and is the scale platform we will use to deliver AI-driven recommendations to our team members. Meanwhile, our Byte kitchen and delivery system, formerly Dragontail, is now live in over 8,000 restaurants across multiple markets with full implementation planned for KFC US and Pizza Hut US in 2025 and continued expansion globally. At Taco Bell US, we continue to launch our Byte back-of-house technology, formerly Trax restaurant management system, and reached over 1,500 restaurants in 2024 with plans to scale it across the entire system in 2025. Lastly, I'll discuss our easy insights pillar. Our AI and data-driven approach is redefining how we engage with consumers. Our rich hub of transactional detail is combined with operations data, guest experience data, and consumer data to power our AI strategies. One area we continue to be excited about is AI-driven marketing to enable hyper-personalized messaging and experiences. Already, our US brands are leveraging AI to execute targeted campaigns with early tests on email promotions resulting in a doubling of consumer engagement compared to traditional approaches. This breakthrough is just the beginning. We expect to scale AI-driven personalization across all brands and digital channels, creating more relevant and engaging consumer interactions. With Byte\u2019s rapidly expanding capabilities, we are building an intelligent, integrated digital platform that strengthens our brands, enhances consumer experiences, and empowers our franchisees. As we scale these innovations, we are confident they will drive long-term growth, deeper consumer connections, and a more efficient operating model across our global system. The future is digital, and we are leading the way. Next, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for 2024 totaled $208 million, reflecting $49 million in re-franchising proceeds and $257 million in gross capital expenditures. In line with our commitment to deliver shareholder value, today we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.71 per share. Throughout the year, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares for a total of $440 million. Combining dividends and share buybacks, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2024. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.0x, with our debt balance remaining largely unchanged. Given our continued confidence in Yum!\u2019s future trajectory and that our leverage has drifted lower by a full turn, we plan to deliver materially higher capital returns going forward than in the past two years. Specifically, in subject to market conditions, we expect to stop deleveraging and maintain our net leverage ratio at approximately 4x over the medium term by issuing incremental debt as our business grows. Overall, our capital priorities remain unchanged and focus on maximizing shareholder value through strategic investments in the business, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend, and returning excess cash to shareholders. Looking ahead to 2025, we remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory while acknowledging some near-term headwinds. Our Q1 unit growth will reflect the 538 units exited in Turkey. We will also, in Q1, move forward with expediting closures of a number of Pizza Hut restaurants in a few markets, resulting in an incremental 200 closures. Despite the resulting decline in our unit count during the first quarter relative to the end of 2024, we expect full-year unit growth in 2025 to reach at least 4% or 5% when excluding the one-time Turkey-related closures. As always, our unit growth is more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We anticipate same-store sales performance will improve in many markets, supported by stronger value perception scores and an ongoing sales recovery in markets affected by the Middle East conflict, and we anticipate another strong year of sales performance at Taco Bell U.S. We expect G&A to increase by a low single-digit percentage, excluding the headwind from the reset of below target incentive compensation experienced in 2024. Including this one-time headwind and assuming an on-target bonus expense, we expect G&A to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2025. We are pleased to share that this G&A profile, coupled with the previously mentioned unit and sales growth drivers, leads us to plan another very strong year of core operating profit growth, delivering on our long-term algorithm target of 8%. Turning to items impacting net income, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned potential incremental debt issuances, we expect interest expense to fall between $500 million and $520 million. Regarding our expected tax rate, we, like other multinationals, are seeing ongoing increases in foreign income tax rates and are increasing our forecasted range for taxes to 22% to 24%. In summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead, with strong brand momentum across our portfolio as we enter 2025. As Matt mentioned, we are thrilled to host Taco Bell's Consumer Day in New York City on March 4, where we will showcase Taco Bell Live M\u00e1s Live and unveil the brand's ambitious growth plans. Originally scheduled for an earlier date, we decided to reschedule this event to prioritize the safety and well-being of Los Angeles residents affected by the devastating California wildfires and to avoid distracting from the ongoing recovery and rebuilding efforts in that community. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS, Dennis Geiger : Great, thank you. I wanted to ask a bit more about international and sort of the solid results and improvement that you saw through 4Q. If you could touch to some extent on the health of international franchisees, perhaps how that impacts your growth trajectory expected through \u201825, and maybe just any kind of characterization of international conditions, the markets you're in. Are they improving? Is it stabilization? And you're just kind of taking share. Any commentary on that would be helpful. Thanks, guys. David Gibbs : Yes, hi, Dennis. Thank you for the question. Obviously, international is a complex environment for us in the last year, but the good news is things are improving and we feel a lot of confidence going into 2025. I would break, let's take KFC since it's one of our twin growth engines and their international business, I would break it down into three parts. The first is those markets that had a high impact from the conflict in the Middle East. That would be the Middle East markets plus Malaysia and Indonesia. You can see for the full year, our sales, system sales were down 12% in those markets. But in Q4, we were up 11%. We're regaining momentum, we're getting the lapse that are obviously much more favorable. But that obviously had a fairly significant impact on our full year numbers. The flip side of that is there's a number of markets we're tracking where we believe there was no impact. If you look at all those no impact markets in aggregate, the full year system sales growth was 9%. That is very encouraging that within unimpacted markets, our business is performing very strongly at KFC. Now if you look at the performance in Q4, it actually accelerated. It's up to 10% system sales growth. So those two things sort of offset each other, and then you've got all the markets in the middle. And just a comment or two on the markets in the middle, there are a lot of markets where we are seeing where we saw some impact on a trade area by trade area basis, not market-wide, but just trade areas depending on the communities they serve. Those markets are also recovering. An example of that would be a market like India that in Q4 saw a five point swing in same-store sales growth to the better. So we're seeing the improvements in the trade area by trade area impacted markets we're seeing them in the fully impacted markets from last year and we, as you added all up for last year was 4% system sales growth but as we go into next year obviously that creates easier lapse and momentum in the business. Chris, I know you'll maybe you can talk a little bit to franchisee health. Chris Turner : Yes, Dennis on Franchisee Health, you step back we obviously aspire to be and we believe we are the best franchisor in the world in the restaurant industry. Top three spots in the entrepreneur franchise ranking last year, Taco Bell many years in a row being the head of the Franchise 500 and the number one indicator of global franchise health is the gross unit trajectory that we have 4,500 units this year even when we lost a little bit of the gross unit upside from the Middle East situation that's the ultimate test. Always a few situations that we're working you saw a couple of those have good resolution, Americana acquiring the Pizza Oman business and so we're continuing to stay close to our franchisees around the globe but feel good about the overall health of the franchise base. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about 2025 being in an on algorithm year for core operating profit growth of at least 8% and you also mentioned or hinted that unit growth may be a bit below the 5% algorithm because of the Turkey closings in 1Q. So just curious how are you modeling the makeup of that small gap? Do you anticipate same-store sales to be a bit above the algorithm maybe as KFC International recovers? It seems like G&A based on your commentary is not going to be a big tailwind like it was in 2024. So just any additional details on the 2025 algo that you are willing to give would be appreciated. David Gibbs : Yes, as far as the algorithm goes, as you can imagine, you can get to the outcome of the algorithm, 8% core operating profit in a number of different ways as we have varying royalty rates around the world. The Turkey closures, for example, aren't much of a headwind because that entire Turkey business in aggregate was a $200 million sales business and with non-material royalty income. So I think the parts of the business that we feel really good about are going to drive our growth this year. And those are our twin growth engines, the recovery in KFC International, that I talked about just a second ago. And then Taco Bell US, a strong fourth quarter, far out distancing the category, a lot of momentum in the business. I don't want to steal our thunder from the Consumer Day that's coming up in just a couple of weeks, March 4th in New York City. But when you take a look at those two twin growth engines and what they're able to do, I think we feel quite confident in our ability to hit that 8% core operating profit number. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. David Tarantino : Hi, good morning. My question's on your G&A outlook longer term. Chris, I was hoping maybe you could frame up where you think that could go as a persona of system sales now that you, I think you mentioned bending the arc on some of the impact from the tech investment. So should we expect that to move lower over time or I guess any way to frame that up would be helpful. Chris Turner : Yes, thanks, David, but we're proud of the results that we've achieved with our resource optimization program, coupled with the progress with Byte by Yum! on bending the curve of the net P&L impact of those digital and technology investments. And you saw the result and how that played out in G&A this year. Of course, that was coupled with our incentive comp because of the Middle East trends being below plan. So as we look to this year, you're going to see, as we said in the comments, low single digit percentage increase, which I think is in the ballpark of a normal increase for a scaled asset light franchise or and then on top of that, we've got about a $35 million year-over-year lap on the reset of that incentive comp. But I think if we go long term, we're going to continue to get leverage on our G&A as we grow the top line. And so to your point, over the long haul, G&A, as a percent of system sales should continue to come down. We of course are going to make investments in things that drive the long-term health of the business. We're doing that in AI right now, organizational capabilities around supply chain. So we're always thinking about long-term health, but yes, in general, we're going to get leverage over the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Frankfurt from Guggenheim. Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks for the question. My question's just maybe going back to what you want Scott to do with the KFC US business and how you envision him maybe making his stamp and improvements there. Is this a new product, a new cycle kind of calendar? Is it asset upgrades? Is it kind of a bolder rethink of the box and the format? Just any thoughts on what he can do and what you're envisioning that sort of improvement to look like. Thanks. David Gibbs : Thanks Gregory. Yes, as far as Scott coming in and taking leadership with the KFC brand globally, there's a lot of excitement. Scott's worked all around the world for KFC, knows the business from the inside out, worked at multiple functions. Fantastic leader, has built a great resume of experiences and success at Taco Bell. And we couldn't be more excited about him assuming leadership of KFC. As far as his fascinating part about all this is he started at KFC US 20 years ago. So he sees the brand in all these countries around the world and grounded in the KFC US business going back as far as 20 years. I think he's got a lot of thoughts about ways to strengthen that business, which will let him describe to you as we get further into this journey. But the big issues are just more modernizing the experience for consumers, leading into digital, which that work has already started. You've seen what we're doing and you saw some of the press around our saucy concept, which certainly the initial results from that, to put it mildly, have been very encouraging. So we're going to expand that test pretty dramatically this year to try to get a better read on how elements of that or how that solution would play for the KFC US long-term business. So there's a number of things working between digital and concepting and menu innovation that I think Scott will be perfectly positioned to help lead and help refine. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks and agree on those comments on Scott. Congrats to him on that promotion. Wanted to ask one about the technology stuff and Byte. I think Yum! brand is a little different than that fast food franchise or peers and the level of vertical and internal build-out of tech capabilities. And obviously it might be different in terms of tech fees for the service. So maybe I'm wrong in drawing that distinction between Yum! and the peer group, but it's obviously a different strategy for the company and it's one that's exciting going forward. Could you just talk a bit about the arguments for and against this type of thing for the franchisees versus an outsourced model? And then what Byte can do for you and your profit growth in \u201825 in long-term? Thanks. David Gibbs : Yes, thanks for the question, David. And it's one of the aspects of the business that we are really excited about. We just issued the press release this morning about Byte. So it's a little bit of a coming out party in terms of how we talk about it. My experience working in this business for 35 years is when you're beholden to third party platforms on technology. It's very difficult and it creates a lot of friction in the business. So we go back 10 years. This strategy was started back then as I came into the CFO role and wanted to make sure that we controlled our destiny with the belief that the largest restaurant company in the world, we should have the best technology in the world for our franchise partners at the lowest possible cost. And that we've been on a mission to bring that to life over the last few years. We've done that through acquisitions of world-class technology. We've done that through some in-house development. And one of the really important aspects of this, which is in the release, but I just want to highlight, is the way that we have now built a tech stack that works together. There are a lot of people that operate restaurants where you might have dozens of different tech vendors that you're trying to coordinate with to get to your restaurant to work every day. Think about the complexities of that and trying to get those different disparate platforms to all work together. It's very difficult. We've experienced that firsthand. By building our own tech stack and making that investment, we're giving our franchisees a much more turnkey solution that gives us more capability in terms of how we can grow sales, make the experience easier for the employees in the restaurant. And that is what's behind putting everything under the Byte umbrella and making sure it all works seamlessly together. We now have all the components to do that. It's been rolled out in parts of the world, as you saw from the numbers. Taco Bell US is the head of the rest of the world in terms of rolling it out, you're seeing the results we're getting there, but the rest of the world is going to catch up. So we're very excited about it. When Chris Turner joined us, he brought in a lot of expertise in this area too, and has been the architect along with Joe Park. And then prior to Joe, Clay Johnson on all of this. So I'll let Chris say a few words as well. Chris Turner : Yes, David, just building on your point that this is a natural milestone on our journey. Keep in mind that the overall purpose of the journey is to deliver advantage capabilities with advantage economics to our franchisees that will drive faster top line and bottom line growth for both the franchisees and for Yum! That's what's driving all of this. And of course, Byte, as David said, just indicates the underlying spirit and increasingly the reality of the seamless integration between the elements and the ecosystem. Plus it makes it easier for us to communicate that integrated ecosystem. I'll give you a couple of examples of how that speed comes to life. You heard us talk about on the last call and on this call, our AI-driven marketing personalization efforts that we were able to stand up very quickly across all three brands in the US because they all have Byte digital ordering in place. Historically, that would have taken us a lot longer to do. And we would have done it at different places across each of those brands because of all the integration work with third parties that would have been required. And so that's enabling speed on bringing new capabilities to market. That integration between elements of the Byte ecosystem is also one we were able to move so fast with voice AI at Taco Bell as an example. So we will continue to drive the strategy. We still got a long way to go in deploying Byte across markets around the globe, but we started with our largest brand country combinations in the US. So as we continue to get adoption, that helps us to reduce the impact on the P&L of our investments, but it was the right thing for us to do the last few years to invest ahead on behalf of our franchisees to build and acquire this ecosystem. As David mentioned, Taco Bell US is the place where we have the most of the elements in place today. And I think it's undeniable that it is adding to Taco Bell's top line success and the bottom line success for our franchisees. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbour : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about that topic, too. Is sort of bringing under one umbrella, are you suggesting that there's a pretty significant acceleration and roll out of that this year? Have you sort of accounted for the net impact of that in the guidance that you provided? And I guess you point to Taco Bell US, which is doing very well. Is there any other kind of like illustration in the other brands that you can point to for this is where these technologies are really driving sales or if you sort of separate out some of the markets, have you seen that visible impact? David Gibbs : Yes, so we do think that bringing together under the Byte umbrella, again, reflecting the underlying integration that we're building will help us to accelerate over the long term and how we deploy. It makes the deployment faster and it makes it easier to communicate to our franchise partners, the benefits of the overall ecosystem. So, yes, we will continue to drive deployments. Of course, at the same time, we think that those deployments will turn into acceleration and top line growth and acceleration and improvements in unit economics, which supports the unit development story. KFC International, as an example, has had tremendous growth in digital ordering and part driven by kiosks. Every time we convert to digital sales, we hit higher check size, we get increase in frequency, and we get productivity benefits in the restaurant. We talked about KFC loyalty now in 14 markets. France, as an example, we had loyalty sales increase by 40%. So, elements of the overall strategy are coming to life and helping us to drive improvements in the business around the globe, but there's more to come as we do that. Of course, at the same time, as we flow this into the economics. We will need to continue to make investments in the next generation of capabilities to stay at the leading edge. Operator, we\u2019ve time for one more question. Operator : Our final question today comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. The question is on the unique challenges and opportunities you may have of attracting and retaining technologists, best-in-class leading edge technologists, and Byte by Yum! Obviously, being a restaurant analyst, we haven't quite lived through the gold rush of people searching for AI talent and what have you, but it does certainly appear that that's ongoing in many different companies around the U.S. and around the world. So talk about maybe something special or unique you can do to attract and retain the best, not just kind of today, but as this technology and the demand for talent evolves. Thank you. David Gibbs : I'm glad you asked that question, John. It's probably something that I was a little bit concerned about myself early on in this journey. But the great news is if you think about Yum! known for being one of the great developers of talent in industry, our culture, the growth that our businesses are experiencing and will be experiencing, this is a very attractive place to work. And we are seeing that we are able to attract great talent. Obviously, Joe Park is already becoming an industry icon and leading our technology work. We're not seeing very high turnover in technology, and I can tell you that team is pumped. This announcement today is the result of a lot of their hard work put by together, and we have people looking to come into Yum! all the time and join the technology team. They've got a really exciting journey and they've got the best case scenario wide open space, lots of funding and backing and all of our 60,000 plus restaurants to roll this technology out to and it is one of our competitive franchises in every part of the business, so we could attract the best talent in the industry and that is true in technology. I want to thank everybody for the time on the call today. As we talked to investors, one of them had a great way to describe Yum! which I\u2019ll just sort of quote. You are a quality compounding investment with diversified global exposure in the more resilient, less discretionary consumer space. And I think that is really well put and what you saw in 2024 is exactly that. We delivered our 8% core operating profit goal despite some massive headwinds and we did that because we\u2019ve talented leaders around the world. We\u2019ve some amazing iconic brands and amazing franchise partners. And that will not change. That is our strength and as we go into 2025, as we mentioned, all of that is adding up to momentum at the end of Q4, moving into 2025. And tremendous confidence in our twin growth engines, the ability of those growth engines coupled with Byte and some of the other things we talked about to drive accelerated growth. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing everybody in New York City on March 4th, so if you haven\u2019t reached out to our IR team and if you want to attend, please do so, we love to see there. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining everyone. You may now disconnect your lines.",
