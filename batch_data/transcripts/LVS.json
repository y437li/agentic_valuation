With that let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We could be more pleased with our record financial results which reflect continued execution of our principal strategic objectives. I would like to take you through some of the highlights of the quarter. We delivered outstanding growth in revenue, cash flow, net income and earnings per share again this quarter, with our adjusted diluted earnings per share increasing 37% to reach a record $0.97 per share. We\u2019re also meaningfully increased the return of capital to shareholders. We produced another record quarter in Macau where adjusted property EBITDA grew 49% to reach a record US$940 million. We continue to grow faster than the Macau market in mass table games, the most important and profitable segment. Our mass table wins for the company increased (indiscernible) to reach a record US$1.34 billion. Our growth trade was 40% faster than the Macau mass market as a whole. We\u2019ve consistently grown past within the Macau market as table games (indiscernible). The first quarter of 2014 generated approximately $867 million in mass table revenue and we grew that in each successive quarter to $930 million, $1.06 billion, $1.22 billion and finally $1.34 billion in the first quarter of 2014. Our annualized departmental profit in this segment has increased to approximately US$2.44 billion from approximately $1.46 billion over the last year. That growth has allowed us to bring nearly $900 million additional dollars annually to our departmental profit and EBITDA. We\u2019re confident about our growth in the (indiscernible). First we intend to increase the utilization of our market leading 9,000 suites and hotel room inventory on the Cotai Strip which represents 56 of room inventory owned by gaming operators - 56% room inventory owned by gaming operators. For our most valuable mass gaming customers that hotel inventory will expand to an nearly 13,000 suites and rooms with the opening of the Parisian and the addition of the St. Regis Tower at Sands Cotai Central which are both targeted for opening in late 2015. As our database of valuable gaming customers continues to grow and the hotel suite (enrollment to survey) expands by over 36% with the St. Regis and Parisian openings, our programs to our gaming customers will allow us to further optimize our mass table productivity across our property portfolio. Second, more people in (Brazilian) Macau on our property portfolio on the Cotai Strip. During January and February of this year robust visitation trends mainly in China continued. Chinese visitation from outside Guangdong province increased 19.2% in the first two months of 2014 compared to the first two months of 2013. We believe future growth will be enhanced by governmental infrastructure investments in Macau this Special Economic Zone of Hengqin Island and throughout Eastern China. These investments will enable more people to more usefully reach Macau and will completely to Macau\u2019s evolution as the leading business and leads the destination behinds them. Third, as visitors come from further away, they stay longer and they spend more dining, retail and entertainment. The 2.19 average length of stay for overnight visitors to Macau has increased but it is still far below Hong Kong\u2019s average of 3.7 nights. We believe increasing length of stay in the years ahead and while also contributing to growth. Also when people travel from further away they bring larger gaming budgets. Turning to our VIP business in Macau. It is also exhibiting strong growth with our rolling win increasing 18.2% to reach a record US$1.45 billion. That represents lowering rolling win per table in excess of US$39,000 per day which was another record for the company and up 49.1% compared to the quarter one year ago. An another (price) for the quarter we were in the number one position in Macau growth gaming revenue was at 23.2% revenue share. Far more important to us of course is growth in EBITDA which expanded 45% in the quarter. The strong performances with the Venetian and Sands Cotai Central for the quarter demonstrate the positive impact of the substantially increased critical mass of our Cotai Strip. Our market leading Cotai Strip investments including over 9,000 hotel suites and rooms together with our dining, retail, entertainment, convention and exhibition offerings and elevated the overall tourism appeal of the Cotai Strip. Our property portfolio is now attracting a more valuable set of customers who are staying longer and spending more which in turn is driving growth of both presence. This increases the returns across our entire property portfolio. We couldn\u2019t be more about the future benefits that the additional suites and hotel rooms, dining, retail and entertainment attractions of the Parisian will bring to the Venetian, Sands Cotai Central and our Cotai Strip. Now, turning to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, I want to say the hold finally came back. We generated US$435 million of EBITDA in Marina Bay Sands during the quarter. Importantly Marina Bay Sands proven success in delivering the economic benefits of our convention based integrated resort business model are allowing it to serve as the most important reference site for merchant jurisdictions that are considering integrated resort development. We\u2019re proud of our contribution to Singapore and look forward to future developments that leverage the convention based IR business model. Now turning to development investments in our current markets. Construction continues at the Parisian and Macau. We remain both on budget and on schedule and of course subject to timely government approvals that maybe required, we continue to target a fourth quarter 2015 opening. In addition we\u2019re continuing construction on the St. Regis Tower, the fourth and last tower of Sands Cotai Central. We\u2019re also targeting the fourth quarter of 2015 for the completion of that project which will add over 700 additional hotel and a private hotel units to our portfolio in the Cotai Strip. Now moving on to the pursuit of opportunities for integrated resort development in new markets and geographic areas. In Asia activity levels in Japan remain robust and we\u2019re pursuing the potential for integrated resort development in this promising market with great enthusiasm and optimism. Korea has also shown increased activity levels and we\u2019re looking forward to the potential development opportunities there. We created the convention based integrated resort business model, a model that benefits those markets through increased employment, business and leisure tourism and visitor spending. Combined with our track record of demonstrated results in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau where we have broadened and strengthened the business in leisure tourism appeal of each market. We feel we\u2019re exceptionally well positioned to compete with these development opportunities. One particular area of focus for our company is our commitment to lead the industry in appliance. We have invested meaningfully and made great efforts to create a culture of compliance throughout our organization. It is important to all our constituencies including our customers, suppliers, gaming promoter partners, regulators, lenders, investors and team members that would lead the industry in compliance. Compliance must be ingrained in the way we do business. We\u2019re proud to lead the industry in this vital area. Finally let\u2019s address the return of capital of shareholders. The confidence we have in the strength of our business and the reliability and predictability of our cash flows had allowed us to regularly increase the return of capital to shareholders. As we\u2019ve said in the past as our EBITDA and free cash flow continue to grow, the cash not needed for capital expenditures and investments in new markets will be returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Because of the long development cycle for investments in new markets there will not be a requirement for significant capital expenditures in new markets in the intermediate period. Over the last nine quarters through March 31, 2014 we have returned more than US$7.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases including over $6 billion to Las Vegas Sands shareholders and nearly $1.3 billion to the known LVS shareholders of Sands China. During the first quarter of 2014 we create a recurring dividend of $406 million or $0.50 per share, an increase of 42.9% compared to the $0.35 per share we paid in the first quarter of 2013. In addition to raising the LVS recurring dividend we increased the Sands China Limited interim dividend for 2014 by 30% to HKD0.87 per share. SCL also paid a special dividend of HKD0.77 in February of 2014. We have every intention of increasing the dividends in LVS and SCL in the years ahead as our business and cash flows continue to grow. In addition to dividend growth we\u2019ve returned US$810 million of capital to LVS shareholders during this quarter through our stock repurchase program leaving approximately $620 million remaining under our current LVS stock repurchase authorization at March 31. We expect to keep repurchasing at least $75 million of LVS stock per month. We saw the opportunity in the first quarter of this year of what we\u2019re reporting to buy more shares so we spend a total of $810 million. We look forward to continuing to utilize this stock repurchase program to its current capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns. Regarding leverage we remain comfortable with a gross leverage debt to EBITDA ratio of between two times where we\u2019re today and around three times before additional debt related to the future development of integrated resorts in new markets. We do not have specific plans to issue additional debt, we\u2019re just thinking that there is a possibility we could go up, the three but I don\u2019t think we go more than three. I don\u2019t want to guarantee that but this way we\u2019re looking at it now. We\u2019re pleased to complete the refinancing of our Macau credit facility there in the quarter and to have extended the tenure of that debt on favorable terms through the end of the decade. We intend to maintain the strongest balance sheet in the industry which we believe provides another competitive advantage as we pursue global growth opportunities. In conclusion we\u2019re successfully executing our business plan and I couldn\u2019t be more confident about our future success. It\u2019s my job together with our outstanding management team to make sure we stay disciplined and continue to execute the strategies that will both extend our industry leadership in current and new markets and generate strong growth in outstanding returns for our shareholders in the year ahead. You know my motto, yay dividends. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Good afternoon everybody. Sheldon, your stock and other Macau operator stock have been highly volatile over the last two months over investor perceptions, investor concerns that the VIP player, VIP type of behavior maybe different or less robust than late weather related China macro factors or geopolitical ones? I was hoping maybe you can share with us and Rob as well your observations have laid into the VIP segment, are you seeing any change in behavior, obviously the math keeps calming and you are doing a great job and is that we are now performing in the market, but if you can talk about the VIP, which I don\u2019t matter is less for you than others? That would be great. Sheldon Adelson : I will give you validation about this concept for Chinese people. From the time of Confucius which was 3,000 to 4,000 years ago, I don\u2019t really know, I never met Confucius. Nobody here is unable to suggest that Chinese and other Asian peoples don\u2019t want to challenge look, they have been running a challenge like for 3,000 years and nothing to thick or thin, tall or short, slim or fat, nothing has stopped them and I don\u2019t think anything will. If there is a momentary blip in the road, it\u2019s like a speed bump in a private housing development, where people don\u2019t want you to drive fast. So any \u2013 look at the number that we increased VIP over last year. I mean, that\u2019s a number that\u2019s more than what the market itself has grown. I don\u2019t want to understand where people, I wish somebody could tell me beliefs that go on for 3,000 years of pretty hard to break. And I don\u2019t know if anybody has tried for 3,000 years, but the fact is that\u2019s sustained itself for such a long period. I was talking to somebody yesterday about how long with the potential for supply and demand to clash, I don\u2019t know. And I think I am a pretty smart guy. I can\u2019t tell you, I don\u2019t think anybody could tell anybody with any degree of certainty where that line is going to cross. In any event, I don\u2019t see even during the result of this last great recession that we had. The market, it didn\u2019t lose. I think the worst that it got was even from year-to-year in one year. And then it go up again. Bob, what do you want to say? Robert Goldstein : Joe, I think you referenced it well the geopolitical issues and macroeconomic issues in China clearly are more impactful as it relates to VIP segment. As you referenced, we are not VIP dependent as much as other people are. Our primary driver is going to be the 9,000, 1,500 non-rolling table games assuming 1,200 non-rolling table games were moving towards. And my way of thinking that\u2019s our future. VIP will be what VIP will be. We will participate in that segment. I think we will do just fine competitively, but the real driver of our success as you can see for these numbers is our staggering advantage in the premium mass segments. That has been the driver of almost $600 million of EBITDA this quarter, up from $394 million amazing year-on-year returns in same-store sales. So we believe that is less affected by those issues. And that\u2019s our powerhouse of our strength. So we will watch the VIP and like everybody else hope it goes the right way, but the real driver for SCL is going to be in those segments, and that\u2019s so much in the VIP segment in the future. Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Great, thank you Rob. And my follow-up question to you all with regard to the buyback activity in one quarter, in 1Q, that was 1.2% of your market capital, that\u2019s a sizable amount. And you talked about being more opportunistic with the share price levels here, but the $80.80 average price in the 1Q and April being well below that, have you \u2013 can you talk about how much stock you repurchased thus far in the current quarter? And that was my\u2026. Sheldon Adelson : How much stock do we intend to purchase in the current quarter? Joe Greff - JPMorgan: No. What you bought quarter, the April to-date? Robert Goldstein : Joe, we are not going to act on a quarterly basis how much we are actually buying. I think what\u2019s fair to say is that we see value on the stock. And if we saw value at an average of $80.80, we still see value in the stock and you guys will hear from us about how much we bought when we get to the next time we get together on the\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : I don\u2019t think anybody was expecting us to buy over $800 million in one quarter, because we said we are going to buy at least $75 million a month. It was an opportunity. And I hope we don\u2019t get too many downtrend opportunities, but we are looking at with the future where our stock is going to go. Some and other analysts just increased our price to $97 just before we started this call and I think I haven\u2019t done a study, but I think the majority of our 28 to 30 analysts covering the company are all advised and I think mostly outperformed and that our growth we have such confidence in the growth of the company. Again, we are referring back to the conversation I had with a good friend yesterday about like where is this line going to cross of supply and demand? I don\u2019t think in my lifetime it\u2019s going to cross. And the youngest guy sitting at our table is about 30 and am I correct, Ian, give or take? Ian Feldman : 28. Sheldon Adelson : 28, oh, well, I missed that. And it is like that. And there is just not going to be a turnaround. There has never been a turnaround in the behavioral practices of Asian people. And I don\u2019t think that will ever be. So yes, one day supply and demand may cross, I don\u2019t know, but even when the other five concessionaires, the three basic and the other two sub-concessionaires, of which we are one of the three sub-concessionaires. What they opened was still going to be dramatically ahead in Cotai Strip. Cotai Strip was our vision. We did it. We are going to have 12,000 rooms all under one roof. We are having \u2013 we have got a pedestrian, air-conditioned moving sidewalk pedestrian walkway going, connecting the Cotai Central and the Venetian/Plaza casino and hotel at Four Seasons Hotel. We are going to have everything under one roof. And there will be nothing like it anywhere in the world. So as Macau continues to grow, we still hold a dominant position. Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Okay, good enough. Thank you guys. Good results. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Joe. Sheldon Adelson : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America : Hey, good afternoon guys. Maybe to just stay on the buyback theme for a little bit longer, because I certainly agree, Sheldon that, that number was much higher than anyone we spoke with was expecting. Could you just help us think a little bit about just how you are trying to kind of value your stock or think about future growth potential here? I mean, I think what would be helpful is just knowing, given that there is only $600 million remaining on the authorization and the stock price is actually below where you bought back last quarter, just I mean how much more can there be, you should have a lot of firepower and a lot of room ahead of you to increase this if you want to? Sheldon Adelson : The cash flow, the free cash flow that we will have in 2014 is significant, so significant that we could repeat our buyback program probably at another $2 billion. We have frankly \u2013 we haven\u2019t talked about it in the serious vain. I\u2019d like Mike to throw his $0.02 in on this issue, but whatever is good. I want to tell you that this is a very unique company. There was an article the other day that said that we were largest gaming, we were the largest market Cad company not to be in the S&P 500. Why is that, because they have a habit of not bringing in a company that is controlled by one person or family, as is the case too with LVS. That means that our interest, your interest and my interest, are aligned. I want stock buyback, I want dividend, I just joking you gave you my \u2013 repeated my motto, dividends and that\u2019s what I want. And then is you noticed I haven\u2019t sold any shares and to \u2013 unless one of my foundations had to sell some shares over the last five years, I haven\u2019t sold shares for eight years. And it certainly expresses my optimism in the companies look at the quarters that I have resided that we grew from first quarter \u201813 to first quarter \u201814. What does that tell you, it tells you that our growth is consistent, it\u2019s sustainable and we have the components that will keep it sustainable for years to come. Michael Alan Leven : Okay, Shaun. Its Michael, Sheldon asked me the comment, I would just say we said before we continue to say that our cash flow indicates that we can distribute shareholders in both ways. That\u2019s buying back stock and paying dividends and we continue to do that and making the decision as to how much stock, how much dividend we will make those decisions as the year goes on. They support our capital needs, but you can project as you already have \u2013 what our cash flow is and we are going use \u2013 we are using that to keep our properties where they have to be and make reimbursements. And then we paid more dividends and we buyback more stock and that combination will continue. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America : Thanks guys. And then I guess my follow-up question would be kind of just to return to fundamentals. It\u2019s very clear that in Macao you guys have been shifting more and more tables to the mass market segment and I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit some of the initiatives you are taking to continue to driven. Not just the number of tables higher but the yield per table higher. I think you guys have some good views on how do that, how to use the rooms and possibly what you are doing on premium asset Sands Cotai Central, so can you just talk a little bit more about that? Robert Goldstein : Sure. As you well know, the Chinese population visitation to Macao just is under 2%. So as those infrastructure improvements continue to happen\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : 2% of the Chinese\u2026 Robert Goldstein : Chinese population, so as a result of that the market there keeps growing, that\u2019s our growth engine and what that\u2019s segment about it\u2019s about table room capacities you well know. We can drive more customers into our hotels who are high value casino guests, EBITDA will grow, margins will follow, obviously SCC and Venetian are the targeted places because of the room capacity there. We are thrilled with $13,210 per table right now, Shaun, but we think we can get a lot stronger. We grew 181 tables year-on-year and that increased to 13.2. Our target is 15000, 16,000 per table in the future. Our target is keep converting as always you can get those kind of numbers out of our non-rolling segment. We think the key to our performance clearly is \u2013 resides in the amount of tables we have, the amount of rooms we have to put people and that say amazing competitive advantage that is deep root and structural. That\u2019s the key of our business. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that complicated to understand, coupled with significant retail and F and B offerings. We have the most desirable property in Macao and Venetian as well as this quarter for 70 I believe as we keep converting higher value customers that property keeps running. And we think the SCC although it performed well, has a long way to move as we get more the dragon palace opens up we get more rooms occupied that hotel is still not performing where it could get to 5600 rooms. The basic fundamentals are there for us to improve dramatically at SCC and Venetian it\u2019s simply execution. We are not say we won\u2019t be in other businesses or segments. But obviously the big driver Macao, the most unique thing about that market is the non-rolling market and that is our focus. And our belief is we can dominate that market with our room supply, our table supply, the good management team and execution. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America : Great, thanks a lot. I appreciate guys. Sheldon Adelson : Yes. Shaun, wait a minute this year\u2019s bonus is predicated upon projecting how much money we are going to make per a table increased over the last quarter. Robert Goldstein : Okay. Sheldon Adelson : I believe in providing incentives. Besides that you can access my frozen yogurt machine. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from John Oh with CLSA. John Oh - CLSA: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Thanks for correcting that Sheldon. How are you? I only have one question today and that relates to I guess Sands China. When I look at your aggressive share buybacks at LVS how do we think about your buying back stock at Sands China. And I guess the question I really want to know is there a need you still have a listing status at Sands China do you still need to have that listed, can you take that private, is that something that you are technically considering the long run given the free cash flows? Sheldon Adelson : I have been trying to get three enlisted in Hong Kong for a long time and we looked at it and it would have taken I don\u2019t know what today\u2019s price, $63, $50 I think it is, they closed today. John Oh - CLSA: $1 million last year. Sheldon Adelson : Yes, it\u2019s somewhere between 15 billion and 20 billion. Frankly, given my motto, I would rather take that cash and pay it out to shareholders both in (SCL) and LVS and continue to buyback shares because our bosses are the shareholders. Now, I am very large shareholder, but I got a boss too, called Dr. Miriam Adelson. And so I go to \u2013 we all have bosses. But I consider all of our shareholders the boss. So you guys are the guys that we are reporting to. We hope \u2013 we are trying hard to satisfy you. And although I would like to buyback the \u2013 what we went public listing in \u201809 of SCL and it fold it back into where we are 100%. I think I would rather take that 15 or 20 bidding and give it out through stock buybacks and dividends. John Oh - CLSA: Okay, thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank : Hi, guys, how are you. Thanks for taking my question. Rob, may be you could help here with the some Macao stuff. If I start to think about obviously your VIP rolling chip volume and obviously as you made a point, not really a focus but the mix between direct and junket. In light of some of the comments that were made a few weeks ago about but some of the junket relationships, etcetera. Do you guys feel maybe you will start to use the direct program a little bit more? Robert Goldstein : Not necessarily, we have a good relationship with our junkets. I think you are referencing I am not sure what you are referencing. But we had a good relationship with our junket partners. We do VIP premium direct obviously as part of our business. The only thing I think you recognized Carlo than anybody is that we are just in a unique position vis-\u00e0-vis the mass markets to perform because we have the sleeping rooms and the capacity. We are not putting a back seat to the junket segment nor to the VIP direct. Now, we value those businesses and those segments and we will operate them aggressively and competitively. It\u2019s just that the towering opportunity we see as the non- Guangdong visitation keeps evolving through the infrastructure improvements puts us in unique position, Sheldon referenced how far they come. They bring more money with gambler they stay longer its right in our power house where we want to be. So the opportunities are so unique to grow from $600 million, $700 million to $1 billion a quarter in that segment that we simply have to don\u2019t keep more resource to that mass segment. We won\u2019t ignore the junkets nor we be difficult partners. We are very \u2013 as long as we all have where you make money together and it works in the compliance perspective, we are happy to participate in that segment. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great. Sheldon Adelson : Point out that everyone of our customers in Singapore and they are big playing customers are all premium direct. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Sure. Sheldon Adelson :  All of them, we don\u2019t go through any middleman whatsoever. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great. And then if I may just one follow-up I know obviously given some of the RevPAR metrics out of Macao this is probably a strange time to ask. But have you guys done any thinking as it pertains to your mass business and using that hotel room base a little bit more for the casino customer? Robert Goldstein : Unequivocally, our business plan, our team there is very focused on converting from cash ADR to a high value casino customer. Clearly that\u2019s the upside that this was growing from \u2013 Venetian was a nice performing property a year ago making I think it was $350 million or so for the quarter and now its $470 million and $348 million versus $470 million, margin is about the same 39.7 versus 40. But the conversion there, the growth there hasn\u2019t come out of necessarily junkets or slots in ETG, the driver of that property and the driver of our fundamental business is that mass conversion. And to your point, using those hotel rooms to sleep the right kind of people that gamble. I think we all know we got running room here to grow our business materially versus SCC and Venetian. I made a comment last year somebody Venetian could be a $2 billion building people thought I was kidding at. I think we realized that that\u2019s the goal is to get $2 billion and beyond. The growth in Macau certainly has not been as strong in other segments. The growth in Macau resides in that mass segment and that\u2019s our strength that\u2019s who we are. And there is 9000 rooms we built years ago coupled with those 1100, 1200 gaming tables just puts us in a very unique position to grow. So obviously SCC, Venetian we think had a lot of running room to grow and perform beyond the current levels. As good as they are, they can get a whole lot better. Sheldon Adelson : I just want to call to your attention Carlo. I want to repeat my prepared remarks. In the first quarter of 2013 we generated approximately $867 million in mass table revenue and we grew that in each successive quarters to $930 million, $1.06 billion and $1.22 billion and finally $1.34 billion. I don\u2019t have my calculator in front of me, somebody took it. But it looks like at least it looks like a very substantial growth in just four quarters, very substantial. Robert Goldstein : And more to go, the point is as good as that is Carlo we think there is lot more room to run. I mean. Sheldon Adelson : It\u2019s 54.2%. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much guys, very helpful. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : That\u2019s where we looked in the future, continue to grow that. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : Hi guys. So congrats on winning the market share base this past quarter. As we think about \u2013 as we think longer term as Macau type properties open and your percentage of the room footprint shrinks below the current 66% do you think you have the ability to maintain your current market share? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : I think we \u2013 if we maintain our current market share\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : What we do think about maintaining current\u2026 Robert Goldstein : Referencing these new properties. Sheldon Adelson : We are not going to make and we are going to increase it. Robert Goldstein : We actually believe we can grow materially. I think we \u2013 with new properties coming on board and we welcome the competition, we will be one of those new properties. So our current room count will grow to 12,000 keys, far beyond anybody else on Cotai. And Cotai is the growth engine of Macau. If we continue our current performance and improve our use of rooms and our retail, we expect to grow significantly our share against the market and as good as this quarter is we think there is lot of room to grow as we keep our strategy going. And again I think the next two years we are virtually alone until sometime in \u201916 in this area. So with a mass market is ours to dominate next two years I think beyond that 12,000 keys we will still be dominant player on Cotai for long time to come. Sheldon Adelson : In terms of all the expansion we are the only one that\u2019s adding 3,000 rooms. The others are adding less than 2,000 rooms each, so we will maintain over 50% of the overall room mark. So we are not going to lose our plus 50% room advantage. Look years I created, it was my vision I created the Cotai Strip. And now today everybody will cut of their right arm to get a piece of land in Cotai when everybody thought in the past that it wasn\u2019t going to succeed. Well, today I have a warehouse full of right arms. There may be a few left arms in there. And from the south paws and when \u2013 so it was my vision to create the footprint that I thought was necessary and achieved critical mass, we have done that. And as everybody else is building property and under 2,000 rooms, we are building 3,000 rooms and we are looking for another one, another possibility of another 2,500 to 3,000 room property. That will provide the room nights for to bring in the patrons that are traveling longer distances. And in less than two years, hopefully less than two years, when the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge opens we will be 20 minutes from the Hong Kong International Airport. That is expected to significantly grow the MICE market, meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions, and the FIT market and individual visitor scheme additional cities opening up those cities. So Macau will end up with another Airport besides the airport it has that services 100 carriers that service 180 cities. So we are looking at another significant major infrastructure improvement that will essentially be part of Macau. Michael Alan Leven :  Thomas, I want to just add one thing that clarifies the numbers behind Mr. Adelson\u2019s comments. We have a slide in our slide deck, in the appendix, its Slide 31. I made the comment about market share of EBITDA. We really do focus on that. And if you look at the last year in 2013 we are at 32% market share again EBITDA. And if you look at where we were a year ago in 2012 it was 28%. So we actually gained 4 points of share of EBITDA in the market and our growth in EBITDA over the last couple of quarters looking at the 40 at the TTM of the first quarter of \u201914, we are growing at 48%. So clearly, if we are growing at 48% we would like to keep growing it. The revenue thing is not the driver. Everything Rob\u2019s focused on is driving EBITDA per table and EBITDA per room and that\u2019s really where we are going focus all the attention. Robert Goldstein : And Thomas, one more thing I think we should be clear we are obviously raising those in the Macau market in general and we believe that for our competitors as well. Well capitalized comp competitors with great business strategy will be coming to Macau to Cotai and not diminish their efforts or their capabilities are huge. But I think the good news is the market is huge. Sheldon referenced the bridge, the trains, all the infrastructure improvements to grow this market. We believe there is going to be a much more important market than even it is today. So there is plenty of room for everybody to make money. The only difference is, we have a strategic initiative which is to focus on rooms and our gaming opportunities. So it\u2019s a little different in terms of our capacity ability to, especially during peak periods sort of during Chinese New Year\u2019s, you saw that in February. We simply dominated that during those periods. Its capacity constrained market a lot of time and that\u2019s where our advantage \u2013 our competitive advantage kicks in there. But I think there is plenty of room for the entire group to do very, very well in next three or four years. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : And Rob just thinking about yielding out those rooms better if your average ADR at Venetian is around $250 and average stay is two nights, how much more valuable, can you quantity at all how much more value those casino customers are? Robert Goldstein : Sure. The range is as low as 1500 size 5000 plus a night. So you do the math, I mean the people at the Venetian and comment about success in this quarter 470 I think it must be a record quarter for the Venetian and probably for gaming property. But do your math we are still underutilizing it\u2019s the most coveted room nights in Cotai is to sleep at Venetian. We have more people in the floor now talking to customers. That is the number one desired complementary room on Cotai. As we use that demand and convert to your reference of 250, cash ADR, the spread can be $1500 to $2000 -- $3000 a night, especially on weekends and peak periods. So to me there is hundreds of millions dollars of EBITDA that could be converted at the Venetian. In particular SCC could be a second place behind that. But the beauty of our building is we can put people who are sold out at Venetian over to SCC. But you referenced it well, it\u2019s \u2013 the conversion is amazing and spread there could be yield hundreds of millions dollars Venetian and SEC leading properties are really infancy in terms of EBITDA creation. And the competitive advantage we have with sleeping rooms and table opportunities places to gamble at capacity constrain market especially during high peak demand periods, is where our star really shines. So yes, we see it loud and clear, that\u2019s our charge over there and most of the time thinking about how to convert. And as you know it\u2019s only market in the world with tables, mass tables on those important thing in the building. It\u2019s the opposite in Las Vegas where mass tables are very challenging. So that\u2019s our advantage. It\u2019s strong, it\u2019s loud and our direction, management\u2019s direction is very clear and focused on that opportunity. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Sheldon, you gave some color in your prepared remarks on the company\u2019s leverage. And when you talked about the debt ceiling, the level that you would go up to, you mentioned three times, that\u2019s about half a turn lower than the 3.5 you mentioned on your last call. So I was wondering what, if anything has changed? And then also, since you do have the capacity and you have mentioned before that using leverage isn\u2019t something you prefer to do, we still continually get asked by investors why you don\u2019t use your balance sheet more? So, I was wondering if you could address that also. Sheldon Adelson : You are right. I did mention 3.5, so it is nothing that made me change it to 3.0 it\u2019s my natural aversion, my debt aversion. So it\u2019s not significant, it just came out of 3, it could 3.5, but our earnings and our cash are so plentiful and it\u2019s going to be number several years before we need large amounts of money. So the short to intermediate term outlook for stock repurchases and dividend increases is much more likely than the fact that we will need a significant amount of cash to build something else. We are just in the cat bird seat here. I looked as Bob was answering the question a moment ago, I\u2019d look at $867 million to $1.34 billion. It\u2019s over 50%. If we do that again between now and next year and we just think of where we should be. Yes, we will be sweet too and not to mention delicious. So, just you don\u2019t see that and only is that I have been involved in this industry which is 26, 27 years. Robert Goldstein : Never existed, Sheldon. Sheldon Adelson : It\u2019s never happened before, never happened. So you could in one year you go 50% when the growth rates are down in low double-digits. And that\u2019s considered high in the current pace, in the current environment. I remember when 55% was sold low, somebody was projecting a 72% and the entire sector fell, because we were undergoing 50 some odd percent. Look where we are going over here. And it just shows that our multiple advantages with the rooms, the casino footprint, the number of games, the utilization to the rooms to house premium mass customers and on and on and all these advantages that we have just results in this incredible growth plan. And I don\u2019t see anything as I said in my conversation with a friend yesterday, I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to been that growth curve. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Thank you for that color. You also have recently applied for land to expand your hotel capacity in Singapore, so I was wondering what the status of that is? And then you also just mentioned that you are looking for land to build more hotel rooms in Macau, so I was wondering if you could talk about the most likely place those would go? Thanks. Sheldon Adelson : That \u2013 okay, I will answer the last \u2013 first question first. Singapore, they don\u2019t work as fast as other cities. They go to a lot of \u2013 they have a lot of different ministries and agencies participate in growth. I don\u2019t see getting an approval for expansion. They are, however, they have come to us and say what can we do to help you maintain Singapore\u2019s competitive advantage throughout the Pacific region? We just got another award yesterday, what, best hotel, best leisure hotel in Singapore. We came in ahead of our competitor, RWS. Of course, on the property like MBS, it\u2019s had not to. So, in Macau, I had mentioned this during our last call, we are looking at the landowners the tropical guidance. I proposed a vehicle that we could share a piece of that land with our neighbor provided we got compensated for some of that land out of lot 7. And I don\u2019t know that Macau is a lot faster than Singapore, but it\u2019s still not a decision it is like. It\u2019s not an entrepreneurial decision. It\u2019s a government decision bureaucratically involved. So I don\u2019t really know when we get that, but as soon as we get that, we will let you know. Robert Goldstein : It was one of the best full service hotel by Asia One readers. The Marina Bay Sands was yesterday. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Congratulations. Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : We have well over 100 awards like that. The MBS is a very extraordinary, very unique building not only physical building, but service. People love working there. We have sent expats down there. Normally, we would keep expats for two to three years to train local people, but none of them want to come home. They want to keep staying there. Operator : Your next question is from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Hi, good afternoon. I was struck, Rob and Sheldon and team by Slide 34 and Slide 40 of your deck, which shows the improved productivity of the tables, mass versus VIP. And then when you go to Slide 40 and you see the profitability tables, just see what\u2019s going on there, and I mean you mentioned a little bit of some of the things you are trying to do, but Rob and Mike and team, is it as simple as just moving tables here and there or what else you are doing to get the up into the ride? It\u2019s so rare to see that in both metrics. How are you doing that is, I guess, my question and how do you continue to do it over the next couple of years? Robert Goldstein : Steve, it\u2019s Rob. It\u2019s not easy as you referenced, nothing is that easy. It\u2019s first we are recognizing opportunity and the markets uniquely playing into our favor. Very honestly, they are coming from further, the non-Guangdong visitation has accelerated significantly. That\u2019s the big positive. That necessitates a sleeping room opportunity. We have those rooms far beyond anybody else in the market. We have the table capacity. It\u2019s encouraging our team to sell those rooms to or comp those rooms to high value casino customers. It\u2019s \u2013 but uniquely, you are correct, it\u2019s the only market much different than the U.S. where mass tables are not as profitable as segment. They are the most profitable segment. And so the goal is to recognize them, acknowledge them, convert them from other properties and to encourage them become SCL customers. And so that\u2019s the game. It\u2019s not as simple as it sounds. We are unique in that the Venetian that\u2019s mass visitation to the roof that is presently unique retail opportunity there, the sleeping opportunity, the retail mall, the theming of the property, it does attract huge visitation. We were slow and our neighbors were fast than us to recognize the premium mass market, but the unique thing about is we catch up very quickly. We also held one advantage that no else has. And that is the pure mass play on peak periods. We have a unique opportunity to either sell or comp rooms to people and we have a place to gamble. So if you are seeing on Cotai with only a couple of hundred game positions on the mass side, you cannot compete because you drive limits so high, you chase more than pure mass play. So it\u2019s a lot of things in place here to make this happen. It\u2019s not simple. Our team has done an exemplary job of recognizing converting. We have a lot of people on floor now. We are very aggressive talking to customer base. And as you know, it\u2019s difficult because of multiple dialects etcetera, but I think you are seeing in other slide you referenced Steve that our efforts are paying off. We are converting both top and margin numbers that are extraordinary. And the thing we really believe though, as good as they are, it\u2019s how much stronger they can get if we continue to get a higher percentage of our hotel rooms occupied by high value casino guests versus other segments. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : And just a quick follow-up, Sheldon you talked so much else about capital allocation and the opportunities, the one area you haven\u2019t mentioned is selling assets and in the past you have talked about your thought process, in particular, on the malls. And I just wanted to know if you could give us an update on that? Obviously, they are doing very well, but the market is also doing well for selling assets. So I just wanted an update on how you are thinking about that? Sheldon Adelson : It\u2019s the same as it\u2019s always been. As long as we are growing in moderate double-digits, 20% some odd. We are not selling assets, because nobody is going to pay us what we think it\u2019s really worth. When the growth curve ends up at give or take single digits up to 10%, then we would consider seriously selling, but it\u2019s good news and bad news. The bad news is we can\u2019t sell it right now. The good news is the reason is we are doing so well, oh, you don\u2019t want to sell it, because we could sell it into a 4% or better cap rate environment with significantly improved results. And by the way, I\u2019d like to say on our EBITDA number. The beginning of the year you don\u2019t get our increase in rental revenue occurs because of this percentage of sales. That\u2019s standard in the industry, but you don\u2019t have that percentage of sales until the last half of the year because the first half of the year is your basic rent. So if we have taken a $50 million additional number that might come in the last half of last quarter into this quarter, we would be pushing somewhere between $950 million and $1 billion a quarter, now because the income coming from percentage of sales isn\u2019t going to come until the second half of the year. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Thanks Sheldon. Michael Alan Leven : We have that laid out on Page 32 in the appendix, though. So you can see we have $57.4 million of percentage rent revenue in the fourth quarter of \u201813 versus only two, so it\u2019s another $55 million in revenue you need to sell. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you. Operator : At this time, we have reached the allotted time for Q&A. Thank you for joining, ladies and gentlemen. This now concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, Mike. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today\u2019s press release under the caption forward-looking statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results. In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income and hold-normalized adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and hold-normalized adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted property EBITDA and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA, all of which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of those measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are also included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. We also want to inform you that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for your use. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. With that let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our financial results which reflect continued execution of our principal strategic objectives. We delivered strong growth in revenue, cash flow, net income and earnings per share again this quarter, with our adjusted diluted earnings per share increasing 31% from the prior year\u2019s quarter to reach a second quarter record of $0.85 per share. When we started bonus program on Macau this quarter it impacted our EBITDA by approximately $29 million, and our adjusted earnings for diluted share by $0.03. That means I don\u2019t want to make this clear. Our EBITDA would have been $29 million higher which is $1.34 billion, and we now initiated the bonus program. We also meaningfully increased the return of capital to shareholders. And our $0.85 earnings per share would have been $0.88. Let me take you through some of the highlights of our results in Macau through the quarter. I suspect there are a number of common questions that you want to ask in Q&A. So I will take this opportunity to give you my perspective on the issues and drivers that impacted the quarter. Macau adjusted property EBITDA grew by 22% to $801 million in quarter two. Had we not made the adjustment I mentioned previously, our Macau EBITDA would have been $830 million and the growth would have been 27%. During the quarter we again outpaced the market in terms of gaming revenue growth. Our growth gaming revenue was up 12% versus the market that was up 5%. Two points to note here, firstly, our mass table and club revenues continue to grow ahead in the market. Secondly, during the period when VIP is experiencing a slowdown, our business makes us clearly more defensive than the overall market. As we have a much higher proportion of our growth gaming revenue on mass market revenue. For the second quarter our gaming revenue mix was 44% VIP and 56% non-VIP whereas the Macau market, the overall Macau market was 60% VIP and 40% non-VIP. The VIP segment represents just 17% of our departmental profit in Macau [ph]. Now let me give you some gun material [ph] in each segment. With respect to VIP gaming, the fact is being on a slowdown of well documented. One, kind of liquidity conditions above the Chinese economy and the junket system. Two, the slowdown in the Chinese real estate market. And three, a general backdrop of uncertainty and caution in the economy. The latter has affected not just VIP gaming but also other sectors of luxury spending. The press has extensively reported a crackdown of corruption in the PLC, not in Macau. As in the past as I have experienced, that type of criton creates uncertainty, and that uncertainty temporarily slows the VIP market in Macau. Let me emphasize \u2013 it\u2019s temporary and it\u2019s cyclical. I\u2019ve seen that happen several times in the past in last 10 years. Clearly the World Cup had a negative impact on overall GGR in June, and particularly in the VIP segment. June VIP revenues are down by 20% versus May this year. I had somebody check this out and what we found was that the same thing happened in 2010, the previous World Cup. The client then was 24% whereas in 2011 to 2013 the average decline month-on-month is only 11%. So there was a 24% drop during the World Cup four years ago, and whereas the traditional May to June drop for intervening this was only 11%. We aim to get our fair share of the VIP market which albeit low margin is still a $30 billion a year market. Now we continue to invest in our premium direct segment where we deal directly with VIP customers which expands to lower level of rolling volume decline in quarter two than our junket volumes. At the same time we will continue to reallocate resources between VIP and mass in order to optimize our profits. You will notice that compared to a year ago we have reduced VIP table capacity by 28% and increased mass table capacity by 14%. As a result our win per unit in VIP segment is actually up 32% year-over-year while our mass win per unit is up 17%. With respect to mass table games, the market growth obviously continue to be very healthy with 33% growth. Suffice to say that even with the World Cup effect, the mass table revenue per day attune for all of Macau was only 1% lower than last October, the best month of 2013 \u2013 that was also the best month in Macau\u2019s history up until the end of 2013, this is really worth noting. In terms of our own performance, we retracted by low hold in segment. We estimate that factor contributed about $32 million negative impact on our revenue for the quarter. If we adjusted for this mass slot, as well as the 14-month bonus, our Macau EBITDA would have been $850 million, not being under $1 million [ph] that we reported. So it\u2019s a further adjustment that would bring it up $49 million more to $850 million. Clearly we have experienced very strong growth in premium mass. And as the segment becomes a greater proportion of our non-rolling table win, the volatility and expansion becomes more of a factor, especially over the three months period. Now we will comment on business mix on non-rolling. As most of you will appreciate, we have a dominant position in the core market, core mass segment, given the sheer scale and breadth of our gaming and non-gaming capacity and product. Q2 is typically a bit slower in terms of the base mass business and the non-gaming segments. As the second half progresses, with the summer holidaying months and then the seasonally strong October and December months, the full extent of our competitive advantage in the mass market will become much more pronounced. I highlighted in the Q1 call our strategy of fully utilizing our room inventory for our high value mass gaming customers. We continue to execute very successfully on this strategy. Our database continues to growth rapidly, our revenue per room might remain stable despite a rapid increase in room usage. Now we continue to build customer loyalty. This is clearly evident in the continued success in the mass business in Sands Cotai Central. I now want to make a few comments on margin. Sands China enjoys industry leading operating margins. This quarter we achieved 34% margin, up almost 200 basis points against the prior year. There are many factors contributing to our superior profitability versus the competition; business mix, operating efficiency, and the ability of our properties to attract an outsize share of Macau visitation. For example, in 2013 with just under 30 million visitors to Macau, we had 63 million visitations to our properties, that is outpacing the market. For every person that came in to Macau, we had two visitations in our combined properties. With growth of property \u2013 portfolio properties that position us as the destination of choice, virtually every type of visitor coming to Macau. With that being said, there are number of factors affecting the margin for the quarter. Firstly there is the accrual for the 14-month bonus for our employees which totaled $29 million in the quarter. Secondly there is the impact on low non-rolling hold in premium mass. And thirdly the business makes it somewhat less favorable to margin. Rob can elaborate on these drivers in more detail during the Q&A but let me emphasize one point. We\u2019re committed to judiciously reinvesting in our business in Macau, this includes unthreading [ph] our physical product and nurturing and retaining our influence. We also have every intention of continuing to promote local talent in Macau. In business, there is strategy and there are tactics. The growth of success today to arise from having the right strategy from the outset. Today everyone likes to talk about Macau\u2019s diversification from pure gaming, whereas we are actually delivering on all aspects of diversification. I want to point out that our competitors curl their properties into greater resorts but not one as to nice facilities that we have which is the most important characteristic of an IR. We are the creator of the integrated resorts, and therefore we are the very first, and only two presenter of the convention-based integrated resort business model. Let me highlight three truly unique differentials. First, the scale of our hotel room inventory covering every price point in every customer segment. Second, a retail mall portfolio which with the completion of The Parisian mall encompass four distinctly positioned but complimentary retail shopping experiences, all under one roof, you won\u2019t have to walk outside and experience the weather to connect to all of our properties when they are completed. The utilization of our raised pedestrian connection over the Cotai Strip has increased commuting here \u2013 and I watch it every day, about 60%. And the end result of the retail mall on both sides of the pedestrian walkover \u2013 by the way, safe condition and with moving sidewalks, and \u2013 has significantly increased. So the point where the Four Seasons Mall is the highest grossing mall of sales per square foot anywhere in the world. Let me highlight three truly unique differentials. First, the scale of our hotel room inventory covering every price point in every customer segment. Second, a retail mall portfolio which with the completion of The Parisian mall encompass four distinctly positioned but complimentary retail shopping experiences, all under one roof. Third, our unique and ambitious events and entertainment strategy, fully utilizing our advantages and having multiple performance venues, including the Cotai arena. We are the only property in all of Cotai that has an arena. Again, like so much of what we do \u2013 we have been pioneers in entertainment, and we now have a track record of bringing world-class events to Macau. I don\u2019t believe any of these unique competitive advantages can be matched by our competition even after the completion of the next wave of their developments. Let me end my opening remarks on Macau by looking back and looking forward. I have [ph] as my head. I was in Macau in May to join the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the opening of Sands Macau. That year we opened, 2004, the mass table and slot revenues in the entire Macau market were less than $1.5 billion. In 2007, the year we opened Venetian, mass market revenues were $3.4 billion. In 2012, the year we opened Sands Cotai Central, mass revenues were $11.7 billion. The run rate for the past 12 months has reached $17.5 billion. Although then it will continue to be cyclical bonds along this path of cyclical growth. I have every confidence on our ability to continue to grow \u2013 and more than confidence, I\u2019m absolutely certain we will continue to grow. We have a still underpenetrated market. We are improving transport infrastructure, and we, Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, offer uniquely differentiated portfolio of properties and product offerings in Macau. When I created migration for the Cotai Strip I was widely criticized and bellowed. Today the market now knows that the cream [ph] for Macau is the Cotai Strip. So that completes my opening remarks on Macau operations. Now I\u2019m turning to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We generated $418 million of EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands during the quarter. Despite a 27% decline in rolling volumes, our EBITDA is up 18% year-on-year, and our hold-normalized EBITDA is only marginally down. I think this demonstrates the quality of the cash flow generation at Marina Bay Sands. As I\u2019m feeling many of you are aware the sharp swings in rolling volumes from quarter-to-quarter are attributable in part to ultra high-end patrons. This segment contributes significantly to volumes, overall utility, and accounts receivables, but not nearly as much to profits and margin. We are maintaining this current base of highly profitable rolling customers as we continue to make significant progress in our receivables, the company via very clean reserve ration. At the same time we continue to invest in our foreign premium mass growth initiatives. Of course, the value of Marina Bay Sands to our shareholders is much more than its operating results and financial success, impressive as these maybe, Marina Bay Sands serves as the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions anywhere in world but considering large-scale integrated resort developments, particularly convention based. On that note, let\u2019s move onto our potential environment into new jurisdictions. In Japan, we are pleased to see the progress that has been made in the last 10 months. That I had recently began discussing the proposed IR legislation. We are pursuing the potential plan on development in Japan with great enthusiasm and believe our convention-based integrated resort development model will bring meaningful benefits to Japan in terms of business and raise the tourism, employment, and economic growth. We have also been spending time apparently to be aware as in Japan we believe integrated resort developments can deliver significant economic benefits with local return [ph]. In both, Japan and Korea, we are willing to commit substantial capital investment to developing large-scale iconic resources. Remember, we are the pioneers in the industry, and we took risks when others hesitated. Our track record speaks for itself. Our development capabilities, our operating know-how in every business segment of the integrated resort and our financial strength are unmatched. We believe we are exceptionally well positioned to compete with these developments [ph]. Finally, let\u2019s address the internal capital to shareholders. The confidence we have in the strength of our business and the reliability and predictability of our cash flows have allowed us to progressively increase the return of capital to shareholders. Ours is a uniquely privileged business model. We can continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, while retaining more than sufficient financial plethora, to pursue both organic growth and new development opportunities. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard my model, yay dividends. Over the last 10 quarters through June 30, 2014, we have returned $8.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, including over $6.7 billion to Las Vegas Sands shareholders, and then Hong Kong Dollars, the equivalent of overall $1.5 billion to the non-LVS shareholders of Sands channel. Also we increased the annual dividend by 42.9% this year. In addition of raised in the LVS recurring dividend, we increased to Sands channel limited into a dividend for 2014 by 30% to 87 Hong Kong cents per share. SCL also paid a special dividend of 70 Hong Kong cents in February 24. We had every intention of increasing the dividends at LVS and SCL in the years ahead as our business in cash flows continue to grow. I\u2019ll repeat, yay dividends. In addition to dividend growth, we returned $320 million of capital through LVS shareholders this quarter to our stock repurchase program leaving approximately $300 million remaining under our current LVS stock repurchase authorization. We look forward to continuing to utilize the stock repurchase program to return capital to shareholders, and to enhance long-term shareholder returns. In conclusion, we are continuing to successfully execute our business plan, and I\u2019m more confident than ever about our future success. It\u2019s my job together with our outstanding management team to make sure we stay disciplined and continue to execute the strategies that will both extend our industry leadership in current and new markets to generate strong growth in outstanding returns for our shareholders in years ahead. With that, let me thank you and let me turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : (Operator Instructions). The first question is from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan: Good afternoon, guys. Sheldon you touched on the reasons for the VIP performance in the second quarter for the market as whole, and you mentioned liquidity and credit tightening. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing on the VIP side and nearly as important as mass, but what you\u2019re seeing on the VIP side with respect to either credit extended to players on the direct side or to the junkets? Sheldon Adelson : I\u2019ll turn that over to Rob who will comment on that. Robert Goldstein : Hi Joe. Hi \u2013 the softness in the junket segment has been well documented, the explanations have been explored by a lot of people. Our Macau business, as you know, is not dependant on that. As Sheldon referenced, it\u2019s about 17% of our EBITDA makeup. We\u2019ll keep monitoring the progress in the segment and we\u2019ll use our 1,500 tables and 9,000 rooms to make the best of our profitability. But again, our core driver is the mass business, it\u2019s hard to sit here with the complete \u2013 all the answers, what\u2019s happening in the VIP segment. And with so many diverse explanations out there, I\u2019m not sure we get a whole lot of value, I just believe its back end consumer demand is soft and soft industry-wide, and I think it\u2019s foolish for us to guess when that demand will return. And I think that\u2019s as much that I want to say about that segment. Sheldon Adelson : I\u2019d like to add that that data applies to Macau and not to Singapore. Robert Goldstein : Yes. Sheldon Adelson : I think that the uncertainty created in the market by the correct \u2013 in the PLC always \u2013 it\u2019s cyclical by the way and that always creates uncertainty and people \u2013 that\u2019s reflected by fewer people coming to Macau. So even though none of it applies to Macau but it doesn\u2019t affect people coming to Singapore, and we\u2019ve seen an increase in Chinese customers, all those [ph] coming to VIP market, coming to Las Vegas. Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan: And with respect to the VIP customer in Macau, are you seeing extended timetables to repay credit? Are you altering reserves or reserving more as a percentage of the credit that\u2019s outstanding \u2013 that itself is more that the heart of my question. Robert Goldstein : Sure. We are definitely monitoring credit extension, actually we\u2019re pulling back with some of the credit but that I don\u2019t think is the issue in Macau for us, it\u2019s just backend demand, we\u2019re very comfortable with our reserves, we think we\u2019re in the right place vis-\u00e0-vis our junket partners, we\u2019re not that concerned about credit from a risk perspective. I just continue to believe that the absolute\u2019s are no one is completely clear in what is all the reasons for the pullback, and when that pullback reverses, we better take advantage of it, until that time we\u2019ll monitor closely. Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan: Great. And then on top of it, my follow-up \u2013 Sheldon Adelson : It\u2019s like you said Joe, it\u2019s not a major part of our business \u2013 not the major part and it\u2019s decreasing as a percentage of our total GGR. Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan: Great. So, as my follow-up, do you spend a decent amount of time talking about capital return and what you\u2019ve done historically, maybe \u2013 since we\u2019re getting a lot of emailed questions on this, maybe you can revisit with us, how are you thinking over a period of time about increasing the dividend growth policy is from here? And that\u2019s all for me, thanks. Sheldon Adelson : We are \u2013 we had a Board meeting yesterday and I discussed with the Board that \u2013 I wanted them to think about the dividend policy and about stock repurchase, and then we would bring it up. We have enough money for the stock repurchase to go through on our regular program to go to this current quarter. And I expect that we will have some dividend news and stock repurchase news on the next earnings call for the third quarter. Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan: Great. Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : You\u2019re welcome Joe. Operator : Next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America : Great, good afternoon guys. Sheldon or Rob, in the prepared remarks you also mentioned some of the reasons for where you guys performed on your Macau EBITDA margins, I think the third thing that you said was a less favorable business mix and I was wondering if you could actually elaborate on that a little bit just because I think we would have expected with mass being \u2013 with VIP being down and mass being up, the business mix would have been in your favor a little bit. So what did you mean by that comment and anything you call out of there would be helpful. Robert Goldstein : I\u2019ll take that. Let\u2019s begin with the second quarter seasonality issue. We had a stellar first quarter, the result is well [ph]. We weren\u2019t expecting that material growth seasonality, so that didn\u2019t happen. Sheldon referenced the World Cup, I think that goes off saying that impact \u2013 we can\u2019t quantify to the dollar amount but clearly it impacted our mass business, especially in the June period. The mix changed unfavorably, so a higher share of our business came out of premium mass which is a little bit lower margin, a few points lower. So the mix was definitely unfavorable in terms of the premium mass performed fine, we took some beating in terms of the whole percentage, a few points low, probably crosses $30 million plus of revenue, higher risk business as you know. Our strength, the LVS advantage resides in all those rooms and games [ph], and it really blossoms in performance of very, very well when the market blossoms. When the market softer, we don\u2019t get that pure mass customer with the highest margins, and frankly we don\u2019t get the fill up over our table positions in all of our sleeping. So I think we have been is inauguration, I\u2019m total confident this summer reversal will happen, we believe the summer has been stellar for us, we have a lot of confidence in the ability to fill those rooms, all those gaming flush at weekends with more mass customers. We don\u2019t want to see a fall off or premium mass, we\u2019re spending a lot of dollars to drive that premium mass business as we\u2019re compelled off, and again that\u2019s our advantage but the truth is, with the \u2013 when the market is not as strong as it was in the first quarter we suffered there as weekend rooms were not as filled up and the table positions are not as filled up. So I think the mix absolutely played again this quarter. I still \u2013 I showed the reference of the October period, we realized the demand in this market and the expectations are so huge but few months later it was a very good October, looks like a very soft June, it\u2019s kind of ironic how the expectations declined measurably. But again, when you add it in the $32 million of hold-related revenue miss with $30 million, the 14-month issue, the World Cup issue, and the seasonality, I think it starts to explain some of the discipline that we have in terms of the mix and some of the margin, and what happened and \u2013 I fully believe it\u2019s aberrational, I fully believe this time will be very, very gratifying for us and for shareholders. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America : And then Rob, maybe not to beat the dead horse on this but \u2013 is the second part of this, so your overall mass table share then kind of dipped down sequentially, right. And you\u2019ve opened up \u2013 you\u2019ve dedicated more tables to this segment. So the question is, was that expected and do you expect that to then sequentially bounce back as some of these factors probably will out? Robert Goldstein : As we have said Shaun, in previous calls, we\u2019re agnostic about the use of tables. We have 1,500 gaming positions, tables rather; we have 9,000 plus sleeping rooms, we have 4,800 slot ETG positions, it\u2019s a massive advantage of this market and as the summer months kick in, we will continue to deploy those assets based on market demand and market interest in them. Obviously junket segment is not where we\u2019re focusing right now in terms of growth, the market will have to wait and see when that returns. Our focus remains \u2013 our driver of our core EBITDA remains mass, be it mass tables, mass slots, ETGs, premium mass, that\u2019s our focus, that\u2019s our core ability to grow this market. Do we believe? I couldn\u2019t be more raging bull on Macau had it near this weekend, it is still the greatest gaming market in the world. I guess when we opened up, one thing I can\u2019t help to think about 10 years ago, we opened up Sands Macau, there was questions about could Macau equal or surpass Las Vegas in terms of gaming revenues, I think we all know how that turned out. Cotai will continue to drive Macau beyond Hong Kong and Guangdong, into the provinces of China. The infrastructural improvements coupled with cultural fancy gamble makes Macau the most important market in the world and a very, very safe bet to grow and grow. And finally the penetration in mainland China is still 2% [ph]. So we think Macau is going to bloom, we sure do. We think $100 billion of GGR is reasonable to expect. This last month has been disappointing, but it\u2019s a month in a very, very long race and I think when you see the summer quarter, you\u2019ll feel a lot better about our performance. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America : I think that\u2019s very clear. Thanks, Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thanks Shaun, I appreciate it. Sheldon Adelson : I want to emphasize that one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, and nothing is going to change in Macau, nothing is going to change into to come to Macau and play. It has not changed in thousands of years and it isn\u2019t because there is no catalyst to make a change. Operator : The next question is from John Oh with CLSA. John Oh \u2013 CLSA: Hi, good afternoon guys. Could we talk a little bit about your mass business, especially in the premium mass. Are you seeing customer behavior or the demographics of the very high end of premium mass to be similar to the VIP segment and if this is the case, do you think this segment will be at risk of slowing down like what we are seeing in VIP today? Robert Goldstein : John, its Rob. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case at all. It\u2019s a different customer, there might be some overlap, there certainly is some overlap but the great majority of mass customers, and even premium mass, are not coming out of junket segment, I think it\u2019s a very different audience. And again, although we are flattish sequentially our year-on-year performance 34% plus indicates all the junkets have come down quite a bit year-on-year unfortunately, the mass business has boomed 34% out of the many businesses that grow 34% year-on-year and yet are worried about future growth. I think it\u2019s clear the growth is there. This second quarter \u2013 while Sheldon referenced World Cup etcetera, I think there is a valid variables as the impact of our mass business and the business in the industry but I think it\u2019s very myopic to think that\u2019s going to be an issue for the future. And no, I don\u2019t believe as the junket business is in decline \u2013 I believe we all resurrect, the mass business continues to do very well and I don\u2019t believe there is risk of that deterioration, no, I really don\u2019t believe that at all. Sheldon Adelson : John I think it\u2019s not as close a customer as you think it is because the VIP customer is used to going in the rolling program and the premium mass players are \u2013 they are not all from VIP coming downwards, they are playing in the non-rolling segment and it\u2019s just a different kind of person. The player is not just coming from the VIP, coming down to say $100,000 and under, if they are coming up from the $1,000 to $2,000 and above that. So that\u2019s what the premium mass is. We\u2019ve got a $5,000 daily theoretical win from a premium mass customer. That\u2019s not a settling down of VIP customers. And again, one is rolling, one is non-rolling. John Oh \u2013 CLSA: Okay, thank you. And if I can follow-up with a question on hotel rooms. Would you talk to us on how would you think about your comping strategy in Macau? Do you think there is an opportunity to do things a lot more differently now versus from what you\u2019ve done before, maybe get more aggressive with comping rules to take market share in mass? That\u2019s it for me, thanks. Robert Goldstein : I think it\u2019s very simple. The biggest \u2013 let\u2019s be clear, our biggest asset beyond gaming capacity is sleeping room capacity. And for those of you who watched this industry as I have for 35 years, the ability to put someone in a room above that casino is a number one driver where that person gambles. We have that ridiculous advantage of having 9,000 keys in our portfolio and growing shortly. So I think the answer as you know, that\u2019s a huge advantage our approach has been simple, we\u2019ve proven over and over again as we give away complimentary rooms the return is breathtaking. And as long as it continues the team in Macau can continue to deliver those kind of numbers. We are earning $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 per occupied room, that\u2019s a huge advantage to us. So think about it, as that premium mass customer comes in further and further away with a larger budget, has to sleep at some place, can\u2019t go back and forth in a day or two, we\u2019ll be the place of choice in my opinion, for not just this year but for years to come in Cotai. And that relationship between where you sleep and where you gamble is unequivocal, it\u2019s a hugely important. Now that decision years ago to build those rooms puts us in the poll position today, we\u2019ll continue to deploy that resource as long as we get a $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 per night return on that complimentary room. So to me while others are running out of capacity, that becomes a wild advantage of this company as this market swings back to huge growth, and which it will. John Oh \u2013 CLSA: So Rob, do you think you have \u2013 sorry, Rob, if I can follow-up, do you think you have the right room comp ratio today? And what do you think of widen mix? Robert Goldstein : No, we want to be more comps drawn, we want to keep driving, we want to get to $5, $6, $7, $8 billion of mass table wins and the way to get there is to keep giving away rooms to wide customer base. So no, we don\u2019t have \u2013 more complimentary towards the right customer mix, there is no place like in the world, it\u2019s not like down in Las Vegas or any place in the US or any place anywhere where you can comp a room to a customer and get a $2,000 or $3,000 yield that night in the casino. No, the mix is keep comping as long as you maintain that margin and maintain that profitability we\u2019ll be aggressively pursuing that customer. That is the strategy along with our mass customer who marches even 10 or 12 points higher. We\u2019re in a very, very privileged place, this has been a disciplined month in June but look forward to the future because it will turn to growth year-on-year 33%, 34%, 35%. Those numbers \u2013 there is no place in the world like it, no place like it, and we\u2019re in the right place with the right strategy at the right time. John Oh \u2013 CLSA: Awesome, I like the sound of it. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thanks John. Operator : The next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hey everyone, good afternoon. I just had a question, it\u2019s kind of a two pronged question on the premium segment. Rob, you mentioned and Sheldon mentioned in the prepared remarks as well about the margin drags, slight margin drag on that premium mass segment and when that\u2019s a higher portion of the mix. I was hoping you guys could clarify that, and maybe in the same breath if you could talk a little bit about why we\u2019re seeing mass hold percentages come down? In my understanding, and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but the premium mass customer would be a customer who is more prone to buy at the window and I know you guys do a little bit of different accounting but does that premium mass mix because of the way that you guys calculated have a negative effect, does that premium mass customer becomes a bigger overall customer as a percentage of the total? Robert Goldstein : No, not at all. I think it remains just the opposite. Here is where we look at the market. We\u2019re lucky that still the majority of our mass business is non-incented \u2013 business that comes without a complimentary room, without promo chips, without gifts, etcetera. So I think the point is that customer when we are trying to reference was the mix change when it swings to the premium mass customer who is more highly incented because of the marketplace. So we\u2019re getting high stories, let\u2019s say $36, $37, $38 [ph] due to promo chips, complimentary rooms, complimentary meals, and we all know these things in the gaming world are part of that better premium mass customer. We\u2019re very happy to take 38% of billions of dollars. However, when you marry that to our \u2013 what\u2019s made our businesses spectacular in the first quarter in 2013 was, we are when capacities constrained, we have a guy who get the great lion share of the mass customer show $60 million plus visitations, who is that guy, who is that person? They are high frequent that comes in and has been gambling at our places, our ETGs because of the capacity. They can\u2019t go to major stores because the rates are too high when the gaming norms. So we have a very, very fortunate place. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 to the whole percentage issue, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of changing, it\u2019s not changing, it\u2019s simply more volatile \u2013 the more you let go that larger sums of money, some of these folks are betting huge amounts of money on table, that volatility will translate into whole percentage, same thing in Las Vegas where we hold 25% of lot [ph] and 10 point south of that in mass mass, it\u2019s no different. The geography hasn\u2019t changed the mathematics from the tables. So our volatility \u2013 this quarter how we held a few points higher and gotten more mass mass, we had $900 million quarter which we\u2019re going to see in the future. We\u2019re not concerned about volatility, it\u2019s part of the game; we\u2019re not concerned about margins, we\u2019ll take 38% or so on the premium mass. But again, our stellar advantage comes in that mass customer, although people do not have the capacity to service. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : That\u2019s helpful Rob and then if I just could one follow-up on Singapore. It appears again, every time we see a big roll quarter it seems like hold and suppressed, and every time we see a big hold it looks like roll is suppressed. Are you guys still pretty confident that there is not a relationship between that just from a peer gamblers perspective who would happen to play more if they happen to be winning, so we would expect that inverse correlation between the two variables? Robert Goldstein : Yes, sure. The bigger the percentage, the lower the roll because people \u2013 the players lose earlier on in the present, in their visit, and if they lose later that means this small roll, so we have a lower percentage of hope. I mean that\u2019s dogma in the industry, that\u2019s the love [ph]. I think \u2013 also, in Mr. Sheldon\u2019s comment the idea that we can stimulate very honestly, I would be blown I always look at Singapore, it\u2019s \u2013 the role is disappointing but it\u2019s not disappointing relative to what we\u2019re doing in Singapore. We made a very conscious decision, management in Singapore and the team here in Las Vegas, there is an incenting situation among over there which will not be part of, it\u2019s over incenting in some segments. And frankly, we\u2019re not going to play that business, we\u2019re also being more judicious in quite extension because we see some of the concerns we have with \u2013 our policies are very strict about how we give credit and how we collect credit. So we are somewhat \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say disadvantage but we\u2019re just more compliant if you will, and again, what we\u2019ve learned is that sometimes driving the role of $14 billion, $15 billion is not vintage [ph] because you\u2019re giving away huge commissions and huge amounts of credit extension. So we have made a constant decision to take customers that we feel we can collect from, we can extend to get that margin from, a fair margin. And this is a highly constituent segment, if we took, we can grow a rolling business anytime we want, it means giving away a lot more credit, a lot of things we think are not a good long-term decision. We\u2019re very pleased if we end up with $50 billion annualized roll, that\u2019s acceptable to us, and the whole percentage \u2013 I mean, we spend it all last year when we were suffering with inadequate hold, we told you we\u2019d come back, it\u2019s just mathematics, the chips don\u2019t know who is playing and frankly, the people who won last year are losing this year. It\u2019s a very simple mathematical equation, so we\u2019ve had a very strong hold and we\u2019re gratified by it but in the end of the day, the math always prevails and we always fall to 2.85 [ph] and beyond, there is nothing structurally wrong. What\u2019s more pleasing to watch is our growth and our mass business over there are non-rolling slot ETG business is accelerating, we\u2019re 4.07 a day, 63 point margins, so we can get Macau Singapore to be a 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 store [ph], we\u2019ll accept that. Sheldon Adelson : Carlo, this is Sheldon. What I want to say is that, if we had zero rolling, $1 and rolling, and a $1 billion in profit, on a quarter I think I\u2019d take the profit, I\u2019d take the EBITDA rather than the rolling. I\u2019m shocked, I can\u2019t put the rolling in the bank, I was going to only put the EBITDA in the bank. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Understood. Robert Goldstein : Carlo, we came back to Sheldon and Mike, we\u2019re very clear it\u2019s our last meeting over there and said, look, we\u2019re going to sacrifice some roll but we\u2019re going to get you a better margin and long-term better business and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Singapore. We\u2019re very gratified, we like to roll $15 billion, hold 5% but we\u2019re going to take what we can get and so this quarter we\u2019re very accepting of a very flat quarter. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks, everyone. Sheldon Adelson : You\u2019re welcome. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Carlo. Operator : The next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Hi, thanks and good afternoon. Sheldon, on the buyback, given the magnitude of the buybacks in the first quarter and then what you repurchased in April, the $175 million, I always thought that the buyback level would have been higher in the quarter, especially given where the stock was so. I\u2019m just wondering was there anything legal or structural or anything in the quarter that prohibited you from buying more shares. Sheldon Adelson : Nothing, just the way it went. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Okay. So \u2013 and then you \u2013 Sheldon Adelson : There was no other consideration whatsoever. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Okay. And then obviously you said that you think you\u2019ll get the further authorization which a lot of folks have been asking us about, so that\u2019s a positive there. And then Rob, you recently opened the new premium mass area, Sands Cotai Central, Dragon\u2019s Palace, I\u2019m just wondering can you give us an update on the ramp of that area and when do you expect to see that running at a full run rate? Robert Goldstein : It opened up you know, and successfully it\u2019s not running the level we want to run at but the ramp is continuing. I think you\u2019ll see it this fall, we wait \u2013we believe it would take about three months to get there. Very confident of its performance, a slower start we anticipated, great candidly opened up in a wrong time in terms of these seasonality, opened up into the World Cup, opened up lot of things but we\u2019re meeting \u2013 we\u2019ll be there this weekend, have a look at it, the team there is high confident of its growth, and although we had a disappointing quarter from my perspective in terms of growth in general, and as Sands Cotai Central, those rooms sitting above it will start to get very, very busy this summer and so will the Dragon\u2019s Palace. We\u2019re completely confident of its performance. Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays: Okay, great, helpful. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS Securities. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS Securities : Great, thanks. On the mass market things in Macau, I know you\u2019ve talked about\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : Could you speak up a little bit please. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS Securities : Sure. On the mass market side of things in Macau, I know you\u2019ve talked about hold, and mix, and the World Cup, but you haven\u2019t talked that much about the competitive environment. Can you talk about what other operators are doing in the math market particularly as VIP has declined and kind of changed the competitive environment and maybe others focusing more on math? Hopefully you could hear that okay? Sheldon Adelson : I\u2019ll give you my overlook. They can\u2019t focus on that because they don\u2019t have enough tables. They don\u2019t have a fraction, small fraction of the number of tables that we do, and the mass requires a lot of tables. So there is nobody who has got that number of tables or we have anything close to it. You could say that SGM has a lot of tables but they\u2019ve got 20 sub-licensed casinos and a whole bunch of maybe 50 or so VIP rooms, if they still have, I\u2019m not sure. But how can they do this. In other, they have the number of hotel rooms, they have the much seen properties, and they have the number of tables, number of hotel rooms, number of tables, they just don\u2019t have. So it\u2019s not as though our competitor could say, SCL is doing very well with the mass market, lets compete with them, we\u2019ll go into the rest market. It\u2019s like shell the needles [ph] 5.7 say, hey basketball is a great game, I\u2019d like to get into it. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS Securities : Okay, great. My follow-up question is on Singapore and let me just preface it with \u2013 I totally understand about hold affects your volumes, so that\u2019s not the question. Sheldon Adelson : I have my basketball but I don\u2019t have the way, and it\u2019s \u2013 our competitors may have the will but they don\u2019t have the way. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS Securities : Okay. So just shifting to Singapore for my follow-up question. I understand how hold affects your volume, so that\u2019s not the question, the question is you mentioned that you felt that Singapore is not seeing the same slow down in VIP that you\u2019re seeing in Macau, so first I guess, how do you know \u2013 what do you see next year comfortable if that\u2019s the case, that it once just to hold the issue in the quarter? Sheldon Adelson : If it\u2019s uncertainty that the Chinese people are concerned about, they want to lie low to things recycle, I think they would lie \u2013 it\u2019s clear they would lie low and we have the Chinese Government could see that if they were looking for them. And that the Chinese Government can go \u2013 they are not in Singapore, it\u2019s not Chinese soil, so they can go to Australia, they can go to Singapore, they can go to Philippines, they come to Vegas, but they are most popular places. Since we offer more to the high rollers like much higher gaming bets, we offer credit of large amounts to big players, we get bet in Singapore and we\u2019re starting to get some of that here in Vegas. Robert Goldstein : Robin we\u2019re back for second, that Macau is one of the \u2013 you\u2019re comment, we\u2019re just \u2013 you\u2019re question is, Sheldon talked about \u2013 first of all, we\u2019re dealing some of the most focused, intelligent, seasoned operators in the world, our competition there is very, very good, and we work very competitively but we \u2013 you just have to do what they do every day. However, to Sheldon\u2019s point they are disadvantaged physically in terms of capacity and the market gets back this summer and this fall, that will be \u2013 from the overcome despite their intellect. The second piece is, I have not seen margin erosion at all in the \u2013 as the junket business becomes more challenging, I\u2019ve not seen erosion at all in the margins in the premium mass. The aggressive behavior of the market has been there for the last couple of years, be it Nalco, Win, MGM, Galaxy, in terms of those margins, I have not seen erosion at all, in fact if anything I think it\u2019s been maintained but that focus will get intense in the premium mass and we expect it. In the Singapore issue, we commented we\u2019re not seeing necessarily a slowdown but we\u2019re seeing a \u2013 we\u2019re thinking differently about how to incent, how to give credit to the foreign customer coming into Singapore, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s market driven much as our own initiatives that may have impacted our decline in the rolling segment in the first quarter. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS Securities : Okay, that\u2019s great, thanks. And just the last question is on the preason [ph]. Is there any change at all by a month or two or that is going full speed ahead exactly at the pace that you want it? Michael Alan Leven : Robin, this is Mike. The construction at the moment has stopped depending when we see certain approvals from Macau Government that we hope to obtain shortly. We\u2019re positioning ourselves right now to be able to resume full activity once those necessarily approvals are received. And we have no plans to change the anticipated opening at the end of 15th at this point. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS Securities : Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Robin. Operator : The next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi guys. As we think out throughout the year, there are a couple of [indiscernible] in market, you have the smoking ban going in October. Can you talk about how you expect to deal with that, I don\u2019t know just on same in Four Seasons, haven\u2019t heard any update there. So can you talk about how those are coming along and how do you think those could better up in the year? Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : I got distracted. The smoking \u2013 well, we\u2019re building smoking rooms that we\u2019re going to drop down in the middle of the vast gaming floor. And the rules are still being clarified as to how much of the gaming floor is VIPed, and what is the VIP \u2013 what\u2019s the definition of VIP. It appears as though premium mass if it\u2019s in a separate room and it\u2019s enclosed, it will be considered VIP. So that\u2019s where we stand out. We have a much greater premium mass business than our competitors. So with the combination of VIP rooms are going to be allowed to be smoking and as a matter of fact the ramping up of the Dragon Palace is \u2013 that was the subject of question few questions ago. We\u2019re waiting for the arcades [ph] to smoke in there, and we have an open entrance to that property and we put a strong sense of urgency on the design and construction of an enclosure to make it a fully enclosed room, essentially fully enclosed. So, you know \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t smoked since I was a teenager and that\u2019s at least 10-12 years ago. And so \u2013 I don\u2019t know about how people are smoking but I could tell you that the press is saying that they don\u2019t expect, and you guys, you analysts know this better than I do, that people are not expecting more than 2% or 3% impact on the smoking issues. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, I hope that that\u2019s all that is, I thought that we might be able to deal with these cigarettes but I understand these cigarettes have been outlawed in Macau, so they can\u2019t use these cigarettes in Macau. Listen, many years ago when the no smoking ban first came in, I used to be a frequent visitor to the Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles, and I loved smoking the cigar bar because I was then a cigar smoker. And I said to myself, it will kill the cigar bar, nobody will ever go in there again, they might have to close it down and turn it into a coffee shop or something. Then next time I went, there were as many people as there were not smoking at all than they used to be with people with big fat cigars and small pen cigars. So, I don\u2019t know \u2013 people have a tendency to roll out the punches and they evolve with the rules \u2013 with the governmental rules on the smoking issue, and listen it\u2019s good that they don\u2019t smoke. So \u2013 but we don\u2019t know, your guess is as good as us, at least it\u2019s as good as mine, there could be other people in my company who \u2013 after all we have 50,000 employees, it could be a lot of people that think differently than I do and they may agree with you but I\u2019d be honest enough to say I\u2019m not that smart and I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m not giving up being smart on other things. I\u2019m not saying doing that. Robert Goldstein : I think there was a second part of that question regarding saying we just\u2026 Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Sorry, I\u2019m on a train. So the second part of the question was, can you give us an update on the same in the Four Seasons. And then might \u2013 that\u2019s it, thanks [ph]. Robert Goldstein : [Indiscernible]. There are no delays at the present time. Openings are always subject to government approvals but if we \u2013 if they maintain that construction schedule at this point, you should be able to open that building in next summer\u2019s period. Four Seasons, we\u2019ve completed 40 of the apartments and we are now waiting inspections in terms of being able to put those in the market, as the product will tell the situations that licensing process is with the government as we speak. And one last thing on the smoking, I had the capital committee of SCL, as well as LVS approve yesterday of $33 million of expenditure to put the no smoking facilities in which was suppose to be due by October 6 \u2013 the smoking facilities by October 6, and that construction will begin as we speak. So we should be ready. Some of the hotels \u2013 the older hotels have significant disadvantages in doing that, we are in pretty good shape for that. Sheldon Adelson : You better speak fast or we\u2019ll have them faster. Robert Goldstein : Okay, I hope that answers your question. Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions. One, Singapore, you\u2019re now running and have been running a very, very high occupancies for a while, you\u2019ve talked in the past about building something there or trying to build something, could you give us an update on that. And then second, just on the real estate side, at different points you\u2019ve talked about selling the malls and getting some asset value at Macau. Can you just talk about if there are any limitations on your ability to do that and how we should think about it? Sheldon Adelson : We have to \u2013 although they did say in the past that it will be okay for us to have stranded title [ph] on the malls and that there was no objection to that. We still are growing at a very healthy rate and as I said in my prepared remarks that the mall at the Four Seasons, the shops at the Four Seasons is the highest sales per square foot of any mall in the world, $7,000 a square foot, for the first level and the second level, I think the average for the entire mall, first, second, third or mezzanine level is $5,500 per square foot, and the next highest for the best of my knowledge, that I have been told is the Bell Harbor shops in Bell Harbor in Florida, Miami at $3,500 a foot. So we\u2019re very proud of that and it continues to grow significantly. I don\u2019t know why \u2013 we don\u2019t need the money, and I got to wait until we finish apprehension and if we are able to build the tropical garden mall across and next to the second Sheldon Tower on the border of lot six and lot seven. I don\u2019t know \u2013 we can either sell the existing retail properties. We have made Macau the second shopping \u2013 Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, is there a restriction on your ability to sell them or is there \u2013 just you\u2019re waiting for value? Sheldon Adelson : Say again? Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : I said is there a restriction on your ability to sell or is it that you\u2019re simply waiting for greater value, if I have heard both sides? Sheldon Adelson : It\u2019s not just waiting for good \u2013 no, there is no restrictions in Macau. There is a restructuring \u2013 Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : You can sell the malls? Sheldon Adelson : We can sell the malls. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. Sheldon Adelson : If we don\u2019t sell condominium title, we could sell the cash flows from the malls just like we sell stock in the company. There are no restrictions. And \u2013 Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then building a hotel room in Singapore? Sheldon Adelson : It happens all the time to every husband in the world. Robert Goldstein : Do you have something else to follow-up? Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Sir, my question was in the original question which was, did you build a hotel in Singapore \u2013 or the idea at different points of building something in Singapore? Sheldon Adelson : Right, we\u2019d love to build another extension of our hotel. We\u2019re running at 99.4% occupancy. And it\u2019s probably the most occupied and greatest income per earning [ph] hotel in the world and with a 2,563 keys. But there is some land adjacent to it but we haven\u2019t got any approvals from the Singapore Government yet. We are in very, very dire need of more hotel rooms and we\u2019ve got that demand, we could sell it out handedly. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. Great, thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : This will be the last question as we have reached the end of the allotted time for Q&A. The last question is from Eric Curtis with Nomura [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. Two quick questions. Sheldon Adelson : Hi. Unidentified Analyst : Hi Sheldon, can you give us an update on your CFO search and what are the features that you\u2019re looking for in the individual you want to put in that chair? Sheldon Adelson : We have the capability of the CFO in-house and we\u2019re extremely pleased with it. We have both Corporate Finance and Accounting, and I \u2013 it\u2019s simply just allocating the title which we haven\u2019t gotten to because we\u2019re happy with the functions. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So you\u2019re not going to bring anyone in from the \u2013 externally then? Sheldon Adelson : There is no need to bring somebody in externally. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then the second goes back to the VIPP\u2019s of it, and recognizing it\u2019s not an enormous part of your business but to the extent that Beijing has increased the scrutiny on VIP players or VIP players just are feeling indirectly. Do you have any sense of what\u2019s behind that and how long it might last? Sheldon Adelson : This has happened several times in last several years. I remember at least three, four other times. And it doesn\u2019t last more than a few months, three or four months. When the press starts to reduce their print about the crackdown on corruption in the PLC then it seems to go away. That seems to create a sense of uncertainty and I have looked into this at late, and that the Chinese people say that if once the government starts enquiring about things, it creates a sense of uncertainty. As much as the Chinese Government, it doesn\u2019t want social instability, they \u2013 the population of the country doesn\u2019t want uncertainty, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that people are targeting them or targeting their category \u2013 it just means there is some uncertainty, and they don\u2019t like uncertainty. Unidentified Analyst : But as a quick follow-up, doesn\u2019t this new administration strike you as being a bit more hawkish on the issue than the prior one? Sheldon Adelson : I don\u2019t know, I try as hard as I can not to get involved in foreign governments political affairs, and what their choices are. It\u2019s not my business and I don\u2019t want to be involved there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Harry [ph]. Operator : That was our final question. And this concludes the Las Vegas Sands Corporation second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest to participate. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we continued to execute our strategic objectives during this quarter. Despite some obvious challenges in the VIP gaming segment in the nation, we delivered a solid set of financial results, increasing our companywide EBITDA to $1.284 billion, but who is counting. In Macao, we achieved the third quarter record of $809 million in adjusted property EBITDA. In addition, we continued to return excess capital to shareholders, mainly dividends. Notwithstanding the recent cyclicality in Macao, I am as confident today as I have ever been in the long-term future of our company. This confidence is not based on whimsical fancy, but is founded on the company's sustainable strategic advantages. Before I take you through some of the highlights for the quarter, allow me to spend a moment to reflect on our company's strategic position. First, we are the creators of the large-scale convention-based integrated resort. As a result, we enjoy the benefit of revenue diversification and we are able to cater to virtually every type of business and leisure due to that. Today, well over 80% of operating profit in both our Macao and Singapore operations comes from mass gaming and non-gaming segments, with less than 20% of profits coming from VIP gaming. I built these resorts in Asia to capture long-term growth of consumer spending in Asia. Scale, diversity and critical mass should position us well for future growth. With these advantages already allow us to outpace our competitors as we always have on the bottom line where it really counts. In the first half of 2014, we secured 34% share of overall EBITDA in Macao's six player [ph] market. Let me point out to you that the highest of the also-ran was 18.4, just under twice the next one. The next one was 13.7. The one below that was 11.2. The one next to that was 15.4 and 9.4 was the last. We were at through second quarter 2014, we are at 33.9, but in the third quarter, we 34%, substantially in excess of both our fair share of table capacity and at 23% share in gross gaming residents. Going after EBITDA as opposed to revenue is thing that matters most. I have been saying this for years. Likewise in Singapore, we generate around 60% of the total EBITDA in a duopoly market. Second, the share size of our cash flows. With annual consolidated EBITDA of over $5 billion allows us to pursue development opportunities in new jurisdiction and aggressively return capital to shareholders, again, pay dividends. Whether our growth is a bit faster or slower in any given quarter does not alter this unique strategic advantage. When others hesitated or counseled otherwise, I pursued development opportunities in both Macao and Singapore concurrently. As a result, I am happy to say that the company today can simultaneously reinvest capital in the existing operations and future projects. Say growing the generous dividends and continue with the judicious share repurchase program. Now let me take you through some of the highlights of our results in Macao for this quarter. Macao adjusted property EBITDA grew by 3.2% to $808 million in quarter three. Our gross gaming revenues declined by 5% year-over-year versus the Macao market decline of 7%. So we out bested the market again. Clearly Macao's VIP market weakened further during the quarter. The reasons for this ongoing VIP decline are well documented, and I don't think I need to repeat them here. Everyone is talking about China reducing its growth from 7.5% to 7.4%. That's a reduction in growth of one-tenth of 1%, which continues to be a rounding error or a meaningless move. I don't think anyone can perceive an economic slowdown by GDP changing one-tenth of 1%. I think when it turns from 7.5% to 7.6% growth, I guess it will be happy days are here again. The important point is that growth in China continues. The mass business in Macao is still growing at 15% per year, the envy of a lot of industries. 15% growth is still very solid top line growth, and we believe the mass business in Macao will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, in particular, as new supply comes online in Macao, which very clearly remains a supply driven market. I have been saying this for years and my words will continue to come to pass. Also, as I have said in the past, all things in life are cyclical. We have experienced cyclicality in Macao in the past, and we believe that the current softness in the environment in Macao today is also cyclical. And that is only a matter of time before the cycle reverses itself. No one has ever suggested that the behavior of Chinese and Asian people, which has been established over a 3,000 year history, is going to change. The important point is that our strategy hasn't changed. Our business will continue to be anchored around the mass market and the secular growth of Chinese tourist. We have a unique portfolio that is designed to appeal to virtually every type of visitor to Macao. Our property visitation in quarter three reached a new record of 18.2 million, (inaudible), up 8% year-over-year. Our mass table revenue grew by 15% in the quarter, while our ETG revenues grew by 33%. Our hotel room optimization strategy continues to yield successful results. Sands Cotai Central achieved a new quarter record in mass table revenues growing by 27% year-over-year. Well, I would say that's some ramping up and supported by 24% increase in hotel rooms allocated to the last percent. Retail sales at our malls grew by 9% year-over-year against the backdrop of declining retail sales. The sales in our malls now account for nearly 40% of Macao's retail goods in categories in which we have a presence. Overall non-gaming revenues grew by 15% during the quarter. Sands China accounts for over half of the total non-gaming revenues of the six gaming operators in Macao. Out of the six, the average fair share would be 16% and a fraction, we have over half, which demonstrates our clear leadership in this important and profitable segment. Everyone likes to talk about Macao's diversification from pure gaming, whereas we are the only ones actually delivering on all aspects of that diversification. From the outset, my commitment to the government of bringing diversification of Macao has been unwavering. I believe diversification is important for Macao, and I believe diversification is important for our business. The financial success of our business in Macao has also allowed us to share the financial benefits out of our growth with our employees and team members in Macao. We are, by far, the largest employer in Macao, and we have provided generous wage and benefit growth for our team members throughout the years, as well as unrivaled opportunities for their professional development and career progression. There has been a great deal of noise slightly from certain critics in certain circles about the negative impact of rising labor costs in Macao. Let me share with you that we are more than happy to increase the salaries of our employees there. And while our employee compensation and benefit costs have increased in dollars terms meaningfully, as we have grown in Macao from about $450 million in 2010 or 10.9% of SCL's net revenue to what will be slightly over $1 billion in the 2014 year, approximately 11% of net revenue. So how does that make a difference to us, when over four years our increase in revenue has outpaced the increase in wage and benefit dollars. Clearly, our labor cost have remained very stable over the last four years, when measured as a percentage of revenue and our rate of growth in net revenue has kept up with the growth in labor costs, in fact, in some cases exceeded it. To come back to our three unique differentiators. First, the scale of our hotel room inventory caters to the broadest range of offerings and customer segments. Second, our retail mall portfolio. By the way, we have secured commitments by retailers for 85% of the retail mall at the Parisian and we are more than a year away from opening there. Our fourth mall. The Parisian is our fourth mall in Macao. Third, our unique and ambitious events and entertainment strategy, fully utilizing our advantage in having multiple performance venues, particularly the Cotai arena. We now have a track record of bringing world-class events to Macao. I don't believe any of these unique competitive advantages can remotely be matched by our competition, even after the completion of the next phase of their developments. While there have been and will continue to be cyclical bumps along the path of secular growth, I have every confidence in our ability to clearly grow over the long term. We have a still under-penetrated Chinese market. We have improving transportation infrastructure. And we, Las Vegas Sands, through Sands China have a uniquely differentiated portfolio of properties and product offerings in Macao. So that completes my opening remarks on Macao operations. Now let me turn to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We generated $352 million of EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands during the quarter, while hold-normalized EBITDA was $15 million higher at $367 million. Despite a 34% decline in rolling volumes, our hold-normalized EBITDA is down by only 2% year-on-year.. I think this again demonstrates the quality and resilience of the cash flow generation at MBS. Mass win per day reached, and this is a number we have been reporting to you for the last year or two, it reached an all-time quarterly record of $4.8 million, up 7% year-on-year, principally driven by our successful efforts in bringing in the foreign premium mass customers to Singapore. In the VIP rolling segment, we have chosen to seek some lower volume revenue and have focused our efforts on long-term profitability. We would much rather take in a lower cost, high-end of the market and let somebody else take the much higher cost lower margin end of the market. We maintained a very prudent reserve ratio during the quarter and will continue to maintain the highest compliance standards in the industry. At the same time, Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large-scale integrated resort development. It is obvious that that would put us in an advantageous competitive position as a candidate for emerging market opportunities when the first thing they are saying is, they want a Marina Bay Sands, nice based iconic structure, and that's what we specialize in. Both Japan and Korea have extensively mentioned MBS, Marina Bay Sands, as their model for integrated resort development. Marina Bay Sands is the most iconic integrated resort in the world. That iconic appeal has driven strong growth and valuation from residents of Japan, Korea and the world to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We have prepared and presented in Korea, one of the most iconic buildings ever, will turn out to be the most iconic building in the world and we hope and we believe that its received a very, very strong reception, a positive reception. Again, we are the creators of the convention based integrated resorts. Our meetings, incentive, convention and exhibition facilities in Singapore have contributed meaningfully to Singapore's appeal in Asia as a nice destination. Our mall at Marina Bay Sands is the most important shopping destination in Singapore, which by itself is among the most important shopping destinations in Asia. On that note, let's move onto our potential development opportunities in new jurisdictions to which I am dabbling in a minute. In Japan we are pleased to see that progress is being made. Earlier this year the Diet began discussion of proposed integrated resort legislation. The legislative process there continues. We are pursuing the potential for an IR development in Japan, with great enthusiasm and believe our unique convention-based integrated resort development model will bring meaningful benefits to Japan in terms of business and leisure tourism, employment and economic growth. We have also been spending extensive time on the ground in Korea, to which I am also going. We have been doing so for some time. As in Japan, we believe integrated resort developments can deliver significant economic benefits to the local and national governments. In both Japan and Korea, we are willing to commit substantial capital investment to develop large-scale, truly iconic integrated resorts. There is also the potential for Vietnam to move to allow domestic entry with social safeguards in the context of an IR development. It could also very well be that Vietnam emerges as the jurisdiction suitable for an appropriately scaled integrated resort. And we are assertively exploring opportunities in that market. Financially, we have the wherewithal to pursue developments in all three of these jurisdictions concurrently, if the opportunity to do so arises. Our track record speaks for itself. Our development capabilities, our operating know-how in every business segment of the integrated resort and our financial strength are unmatched. We believe we are exceptionally well positioned to compete for these development opportunities. Finally, let's address the return of capital to shareholders. The confidence we have in the strength of our business and the reliability and predictability of our cash flows have allowed us to progressively increase the return of capital to shareholders. Ours remains a uniquely privileged business model. We can continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, while retaining more than sufficient financial firepower to pursue both organic growth and new development opportunities for the periods that it will take to plan and develop these and at the same time to generate significant cash flow that gives us plenty of extra money. Over the last 11 quarters through September 30, 2014, we have returned over $8.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, including nearly $7 billion to Las Vegas Sands shareholders and at Hong Kong dollars, the equivalent of over $1.5 billion to shareholders of Sands China. Also last year we increased the annual dividend for LVS 42.9% for the 2014 calendar year. For 2015, I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has recently increased the dividend by 30% to $2.60 per year or $0.65 per quarter, yay dividends. The increase in the dividend will take place beginning in the first quarter of 2015. We have every intention of increasing the dividends in the years ahead as our business and cash flows continue to grow. In addition to dividend growth, we returned $300 million of capital to LVS shareholders this quarter through a stock repurchase program which I believe completed the previously authorized $2 billion. This completed the execution of our initial $2 billion LVS stock repurchase authorization. I am now pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has also authorized an additional $2 billion for further stock repurchases. We look forward to continue to utilize the stock repurchase program to return capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns. In conclusion, we will continue to stay disciplined and execute our business plan. With the right strategy and the right management team in place, I am more confident than ever about our future success. Before I turn the call over to the operator to the Q&A session, I wanted to take a moment to thank Mike Leven for the meaningful contributions he has made to the company over the more than five years he has served as its President and Chief Operating Officer. His ability to execute my vision for the company will always be appreciated. While this will be Mike's final quarterly conference call, as he will retire from this position as President and COO at the end of this year, we look forward to his continuing contributions as a member of the Board of Directors for both Las Vegas Sands Corporation and Sands China Limited. On behalf of the 50,000 worldwide employees of Las Vegas Sands, as well as our Board of Directors and management team, and particularly from me personally, thank you Mike for the efforts you have made on behalf of both our companies. All of us here at Las Vegas Sands wish you all the best in the future. Now I am turning it over to Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Good afternoon everybody. Question for you all in Macao on the base mass and premium mass departmental profit margin assumption specifically referring to your slide 21 in supplemental earnings slide deck. The assumptions are lowered for both base and premium mass relative to three months ago. I kind of understand, I think I understand what's going on in the premium mass. Can you talk about what's actually going on in both segments relative to three months ago? And specifically when you look at the third quarter results, are those the profit margins that you experienced or are you making further lowered assumptions going forward? And then on a follow topic, if you can talk about the smoking ban impact? That's something, obviously, we all are curious about to hear your experiences. Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : I will tell you, Joe, I will start with the easy one. Smoking, we don't think has been impactful. It's difficult with all things going Hong Kong, and obviously, the other pressures in Macau, all the headwinds we have been facing, it is really hard to segregate the smoking issue directly, but our anecdotal feedback is pretty positive that it doesn't appear to be impactful in any segment. The smoking areas are being utilized and business appears to be unaffected by the smoking issue. As for the margin issue, I think we are all aware that there is competitive pressures in the premium mass segment. I think you will hear that one, anybody who has been in Macau recently. We have the wonderful structural advantage of having a lot more control, a lot stronger position in mass mass or base mass segment. We remain steadfast and I believe we can get a 45% plus margin there. That's somewhere we think today and tomorrow the decisions made by this company 10 years ago will resonate for years to come in terms of having more gaming positions, more sleeping rooms, more retail and simply more control over that segment. So we are very much a big believer of these standalone tables and more tables and more gaming capacity, more retail, et cetera. So we are very secure that we can run the highest margins at 45% plus in the base mass or mass mass segment. Competitive pressures are unavoidable right now in premium mass. I think you will see by other, the competitors versus our numbers that win per unit is one metric but flow through is another. Our margins have dipped a bit. I think they will, with the declining junket situation, I think there will be more pressure in premium mass. Having said that, our blended flow through is going to stay around 40%, and we believe it will rise with the market getting stronger. Again, our strength, the breakdown of our mass revenues is still leaning heavily towards the pure mass side than mass mass side which gives a very strong advantage to maintain margin and we think the other competitors are going to have a different situation because we have obviously structurally a better place to build. On the premium mass side, I think there has been escalating pressure and that will continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon guys. Just two questions from me. My first would be, on the buyback I think previously you guys have given some kind of general target around maybe $75 million or so a month. Just any guidance you could give us folks in terms of being more opportunistic on that, given the recent dip in the share price? And then my follow up would be, on the capital expenditures, it looks like things were pushed out a little bit on the Parisian and maybe some of your other projects as well. I am referring to one of the slides laid in your slide deck. If you could just give us a little bit more color on some of these changes in the capital expenditure expectations, that would be great. Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Hi Shaun, it's Patrick Dumont. How are you? Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I am great, Patrick. Thanks. Patrick Dumont : In terms of the buyback, the focus of the Board has been that it will be programmatic in nature. The levels haven't been exactly set as of yet, but it is something that we will identify over the next couple of weeks. Sheldon Adelson : We just got the okay. This is Sheldon. We just got the okay from the Board. I think it was Monday and we are having a board meeting coming up next week in Macau. We are having two separate board meetings, LVS and SCL, and we will attempt to come out with the details of the program. It will probably be somewhat similar to what we have done so that we could spread it over a period of time. But then again, as any opportunism arises we should take another look at it then. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And with respect to Parisian targeted opening date? Sheldon Adelson : Parisian targeted opening date. We have two categories of opening date, partial opening and complete opening. The last I am going to look at it next week. As I said earlier, I am going to Japan, Korea and I am also going to Macau. The last thing I have been told is that a full opening will occur in March, but we can still achieve a partial opening of the casino and some number of rooms if the government will allow us to do that in November or December. So it's not a minor issue. It's maybe we have a partial opening, which has occurred in the past to us and everybody else. So I hope we can open partially in November, December of 2015. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Shaun. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good afternoon. Two questions on Macao. First one, just following up on the earlier commentary regarding premium mass competition, and also just on slide 21 you are showing that there is slower growth there versus base mass. You have continued to shift tables to the premium mass segment over the past couple of quarters. Are you going to slow that down at all? Or are you going to shift back to mass mass? And then the second question is just around the Macau market in general, visitation continues to be quite strong, up high single digits but gaming revenue growth has obviously decelerated. Can you just talk a little bit more about the shift in the customer mix? Are really customers coming fewer times or just any interesting dynamic you can add? Thanks. Unidentified Company Representative : The first thing, Thomas, we will move tables based on market demand obviously. We have moved away, as you know, last couple of years from the junket segment into premium mass as well as pure mass and that will be the continuing mantra for the team over there as time tells what to do. It's very simply a managerial position to take that wherever the most money is made at the table, that's where we will deploy it. And there is no magic to when we have done it in the past. There is no magic in the future. The market will dictate that. At this point, you know, there is excessive supply on the junket side than probably on the premium mass side. So my guess, we would be more focused on mass mass where our biggest advantage resides. As for the new growth in new visitor, first thing it is very positive that we are seeing more growth in Macau. I think it bodes well for future in Macau. I think it bodes well for the story. China, we believe, has continued to be very supportive of Macau. The President will be there this December. The infrastructural improvements continue at a massive scale and given the more settled environment, meaning Hong Kong becomes calmer, smoking is absorbed, we believe the Macau story will continue quite nicely and future supply will grow demand and Macau will offer the Chinese growing middle-class a first-class destination. Having said that, as you noted, there is not the same amount of growth in the GGRs commensurate with the growth in the pure visitors to Macau. I think that will change in time. We believe very much so that as new markets open up and the transportation matures, that problem will solve itself. It's a much better situation than having less demand for the city in terms of visitors shift. So clearly we want to see more GGR growth coming out of new visitors but the numbers are what they are. We remain very confident that the mass mass business, which is our strength and the backbone of our strategy will yield a great profit in the future, and those future people coming to Macau, they won't just sleep there and eat there and go see shows and shop. They will in fact gamble. Sheldon Adelson : This red herring of the smoking issue, which I talk to the people in Macau every day, seems to have no impact. The few people grumble a little bit about going into the smoking lounge, but they are an obedient society, and they do what the government says. And they go to the smoking rooms and they seem to enjoy and come back out. It reminds me of what the colloquial title was of the year 2000. There is no nature, God and nature must have known whether it was Eastern Standard Time or Central or Mountain or Pacific Standard Time or maybe Hawaii Time, that will maybe the first reporting of midnight Australia Time, I don't know, but it was all a big hullabaloo about nothing. So to quote, I think it was Shakespeare, \"It's all a tempest in a teapot.\" Was that Shakespeare? Unidentified Company Representative : I am not sure. Sheldon Adelson : We have a Brit here. Is that, you said Shakespeare? Unidentified Company Representative : Almost, you were paraphrasing him. Sheldon Adelson : Paraphrasing, okay. Well, he is not really a Brit. He is Scottish. Almost, not a Brit. Unidentified Company Representative : Anything else, Thomas? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank : Hi, everyone. Good morning or good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the VIP side in Macau, it appears as if there is a little bit of a difference in the incremental margin for the addbacks. And I am wondering if maybe there was a delta in your direct hold this time that's causing it to look a little bit different? Unidentified Company Representative : I don't think so. Daniel Briggs : Carlo, you are asking about the mix issue? I guess you guys get all the lead data that doesn't include our specific hold on our non-junket business. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank : Yes, I was just wondering -- Daniel Briggs : I can tell you that the margins in VIP in Macau are healthy. Commission rates are not going up. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank : That's what I was looking for. Thanks, Dan. Daniel Briggs : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. With the new buyback authorization, can you just discuss for a moment how you are planning on funding that? Will that be continued from free cash flow? Are you planning on increasing leverage? How are you thinking about that? And then I have a follow-up about Singapore. Sheldon Adelson : Money. According to the song, it's burning a hole in our pocket. We haven't addressed that yet, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Okay, and -- Sheldon Adelson : We know that we have plenty of money and we are contemplating, we been using all cash for the development and construction of the Parisian Macao, and we are now going to go out and get a separate project financing that will recover a lot of the cash that we put in there. So earnings at the rate of 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 6.5% that I see some of you analysts come out with, I think per year, I think we are going to have plenty of cash flow. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Yes. That's helpful color. Thank you. And then just on Singapore. Rob, we have seen it in the numbers. You are sacrificing some of your roll for profitability, which is a great strategy. Just trying to think about, for those of us who are modeling this, what is the optimal level of roll you are trying to get to as you maximize the profitability there? Robert Goldstein : It's a hard question to answer, Felicia, because -- Sheldon Adelson : That's saying how high is up? Robert Goldstein : We would love to be rolling $60 billion a year. We just have some headwinds we just can't overcome. One is the commissions. We remain steadfast in our belief that to pay too much commission makes no sense in terms of margin and profitability. Second, as we are very cognizant of the atmosphere in China and lending exorbitantly in China. So call us too conservative for today but as you can see with this quarter's results, we are bearish in terms of that segment right now. We love to see return to days of $15 billion a quarter, with appropriate margins. It's tough to model because as you know it is highly concentrated. It is driven by not as many players as we like it to be. We are also in a very competitive environment vis-\u00e0-vis our competitor there plus, the Philippines. I wish I can give you color that I could believe myself, but the team and I are working through it. In fact, we are meeting next week to talk that very issue through. We are trying very hard to remain focused on profitability and for right now, I think you can model up more growth in our $4.8 million a day and 60 plus point margin. I am not as confidence to give you any kind of forecast how we see the rolling business. It really depends on the environment. Sheldon Adelson : Unfortunately, we have a competitor that has never worked in a competitive market before. Genting Berhad didn't have any competition and exclusive in Malaysia. So apparently they are still trying to get used to having competition. But when they have competition, it appears as though their only response to that is to what we call quote, \"buy the business.\" They are paying up to 1.7 and 1.8, anecdotally above for the junket -- not the junket, but they are paying the same thing to the premium direct VIP players, and we are still down a much lower reasonable number. No more than what we pay in Macau to the junket reps. So that's why we have grown to take over in excess of 55% of the market GGR compared to their 45% of the market and who knows, maybe one day, they will get used to competing on the basis of a quality product. If they ever build one and they won't have to buy the business. Robert Goldstein : I wouldn't say we are out of that business. The one thing I would caution is that, it's a very thin and concentrated business. I would like to say we are back in it in a big way. We have the product. We have the demand. And we also have the headwinds of the fact that we are very, very careful and trying really hard to be the most compliant people in the industry. So moving money for us is also a challenge. But having said that, we are hoping to have a stronger day in that segment in Singapore in 2015. Sheldon Adelson : Let me give you an idea. I wanted to discuss this about where we stand competitively, what kind of advantage we have in the emerging markets. For instance, when we plan an integrated resort, our competitors, for instance Genting in Sentosa. When we say we have nice facilities, we have Asia's largest ballroom at 90,000 square feet column free, while our competitor has a 60,000 foot volume which doubles up as an exhibition space and event center. We have over 400,000 square feet of additional exhibition space when our competitive downtown Suntec has only 200,000. So when we plan, we don't say Genting has only 17 meeting rooms, we have 250 which can be combined into smaller ballrooms that will hold 600, 700, 800 people for dinners. And out ballroom is sold out six months in advance. So when we go into Japan or Korea and we say we have an integrated resort, we will go in with somewhere, maybe 500 meeting rooms and somebody else will come in and say, oh, we are an integrated resort. We have some of the components that LVS or SCL has and they will come out with 20 or 30 meeting rooms. We based our meeting rooms on a formula that's calculated on so many square feet per sleeping room and the allocation of total room supply towards the MICE business. So we say we have meeting rooms, we have meeting rooms. When we talk about having the mall, we have up to and in excess of a million square feet of mall and our competitors come along and say, oh, we have a mall as part of our IR and see we have got 50,000 square feet and about a dozen retailers. So we can talk about 300, 400, 500 retailers in the mall and that gives us the critical mass and takes us to where we are in Macao. My original vision was, is and will be critical mass. But it's based on an educated and informed calculation of how many MICE meeting room, how much MICE space we have based upon the number of sleeping rooms, we allocate to MICE based upon the entertainment. Look, we are the only place that has a museum and we have arenas and we plan arenas in our future development. So that differentiates us between competitive slate. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley - UBS: Thanks. I wonder if you can talk about your interest in Japan? There is some discussion that locals may not be allowed. And does that change the scope of what you think you could do there or what you would be willing to invest since locals would have been a significant part of a project there. Sheldon Adelson : From our standpoint, I will say that we will not be interested in Japan or any other country on a foreigners only basis. We can't do that. Our business model won't allow it. I could point out to you that in Korea there are 17 casinos. One, Kangwon Land is the direct with domestic entry. The other 16 foreigners only casino don't do as much combined as the single domestic entry casino does and it's different people have different the estimates. And depending on what time of the year, Korea is in the snow belt and so is the North Korea -- I am sorry, north of South Korea is in the snow belt as is Japan and I spent a lot of time in both places. But it takes anywhere from two-and-half to four hours to drive depending upon weather and traffic. But the foreigners only casinos in Korea cannot anticipate getting large amounts of business and therefore they can't build a true integrated resort with all of its components that need the casino to subsidize the loss making components. So, from our standpoint, we are not interested in developing a multi-billion dollar resort and nobody else can. If somebody just wants to open a small casino box and try to get people of foreign countries, say from China to come to Korea or Japan, all we have to do is look at South Korea and Jeju Island has got half of the foreigners only casinos and ask ourselves whether or not a plain casino with one or two restaurants can compete with the humongous and big integrated resorts in Macau and in Singapore. We only have to look at Australia and Philippines to see that they don't have the components of a true integrated resort. But they do a good job. They are well regulated. We went out there and don't anticipate going there. And we are not interested in foreigners only resorts. Robin Farley - UBS: Okay, great. That's helpful, and for my follow-up question, I wonder if you can comment on, with Golden Week, whether the players that had not been to Macau in a while come back, did id help collections? Is it your sense from the junkets, did that help at all with liquidity in the system? Robert Goldstein : Dan will take that. Well, I am not going to talk about Golden Week in the middle of October in this call. I can't do it. Sheldon Adelson : But reported in the third quarter, not on when Golden Week is. Robin Farley - UBS: Okay. Sheldon Adelson : That's in the fourth quarter. Robin Farley - UBS: Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : Sorry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Hi. Sheldon, when I looked at slide 28 of your deck, I saw how well once again the mall is doing. And I just wanted to once again ask your thoughts on selling it and then to combine that with the ability to use that cash, basically sell the mall at pretty high profitability, pretty big multiples we are still seeing out there and then use that cash to buy back stock at an even faster pace and just create that arbitrage. I just wanted to see what your reaction was to that and whether that's something, whether those are two separate decisions? Or whether they can be combined? Sheldon Adelson : You wanted to know whether or not we are interested in selling the malls? Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Yes. Sheldon Adelson : I did give out the number to you above the dark long arrow spanning all the bars. It says 19.1%. You think that this is an appropriate prudent time to sell while we are still growing and that includes a little slow down to 9% in the last quarter or last two quarters. Part of our properties can go up 20%, 30%. We have expanded and improved significantly. The mall at the Four Seasons which is running on average about $5,500 per square foot per annum and we have the DFS boutique shops that are running at $7,000 a square foot. I was talking to somebody with authoritative data points in Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City and I think it is only running at $1,000 a foot. And I look at the Four Seasons mall which does $7,000 per square foot compared to other like Neiman Marcus and other top U.S. brands, they don't come within shouting distance where the malls are. We don't yet see if we have ever come down to under 10% growth, we would consider that, I would never sell this mall at approximately 20% growth with the likelihood of more. We are redoing a lot of the slower malls and slow retailers in Macau. We are adding on 330,000 net rentable square feet and we have submitted four other projections, including an 800,000 square foot retail mall on the Tropical Gardens and I hope to see the government when I go there next week. We are the leading IR developers in shopping by far. Actually as a matter of fact, one of the problems is that, say you look at $536 million, there is no mall having $536 million in the third quarter of 2014, when we continue our tweaking of MBS and Four Seasons and when we add on more space at the Parisian, we are bigger than any of the REITs in Asia. So there is no single REIT that's in a position to buy us. As a matter of fact, we would be more in a position to buy them. But as long as we keep growing, I could see that number going up significantly over the next handful of years. And I don't know. We are going to have to -- the original plan was to monetize it and at a 4% cap rate, which we think is achievable, we should be looking at it, but it's tough to want to sell when you are growing at 20%, 30% a year. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Okay, so that's really, because the valuations were already there and it's really that you are just continuing to see growth and still see some more opportunity there. Could I then just ask, how are the discounts in Macau manifesting themselves? What are the things that your competitors are doing to eat away at this? Is it giveaways? Is it discounts on losses? What are they doing that allows them to effectively do this, especially when you look at your own properties, which are so iconic, so attractive? It's hard for me to imagine what they could be giving to get people to come to their place rather than your place. Sheldon Adelson : You mean on the gaming side? Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Yes. Sheldon Adelson : They are not discounts there. Discounts that take place here in Vegas, in the U.S. We always take all discounts, but it is the rolling chip by commission. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : So that's where -- Robert Goldstein : You mean the mass, Steve? You mean the mass, I assume, right? Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Yes, I am talking about the mass. What is going on there? Robert Goldstein : Steve, two things. Mass is obviously multi-segment. Our margins have maintained the highest levels in the pure mass. And again, that's our strength. It resides there today, tomorrow and forever because they are structurally managed due to asset class in our portfolio. On the premium mass, it is lot more competitive. We compete in that segment as well, and pressure there were comes from labor costs, which Sheldon alluded to in his opening remarks, as well as promotional chips as well as complimentary rooms as well as lucky chips. There is multitude of ways you can incent customers to gamble. And think of it as when there are only so many tables in the market and the junket business is eroding, people are more focused on that segment. So I think you will see, across the board, margins in that area are going to be difficult. We are doing that at all and our strength, which is over $2 billion of EBITDA, emanates from the pure mass side, and that's where we steadfastly maintained that. As the market is healthier, we would like to grow our margin back into the 42%, 43%, 44% range combined. But for now, we are in the 30s in the premium mass and then the mid-40s in the pure mass. Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs : Thanks for the color. Robert Goldstein : Sure. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open. Harry Curtis - Nomura: Hi. Sheldon, I had a quick question on a comment that you made a couple of weeks ago about your, I don't know if it was a hope or a belief that you could see an improvement in the VIP business over the coming few months. My first question is, do you have confidence behind that? Or what might you be looking at to see that kind of improvement? Then the second question that I had is, if you guys could talk about the expected number of tables that the Parisian is going to get? What are the formulas that if you were the Macau government, you would espouse? Thanks. Sheldon Adelson : I will answer the last part first. The Macau government has said repeatedly that it will give favoritism to the operator that puts in more non-gaming space than gaming. And they said, nobody will get any tables if the gaming space represents more than 10% of the total amount of space to be built. This is our business model. I heard that one of our competitors was enlarging their lobby significantly so they can have a greater of non-gaming to gaming. I suppose, counting lobbies might be part of that trick. I did say that it would be a few months, I was quoted as saying two months and thank you, Harry, for asking that question. I forgot, but I did want to try to find a place to correct that. It was that day or the day before that the Chinese government had said that the investigation of the corruption was complete. I have since heard that the investigation in corruption has been narrowed to a certain segment of this society, and it's not the impression that the press gave based upon that day's or the day before statement that they were stopping the investigation on the high profile people who are on the government, people that were gaming. So I would have to rethink. I don't really know. I said that honestly and with good information at that time, but I think it will then have to get greater clarification on what the central government means about the narrow portion. I saw a couple of days ago that they enumerated the number of cases they were investigating. It was somewhere around 6,000 or 7,000 individual cases. I don't know what that means. They said there were party members, the communist party members that amounted to about 7,000. They were investigating. I have no idea whether that's a complete number, an incomplete number. I am sure the government is pointing out the right numbers, but what that represents in terms of how much they anticipated investigating. So if I were asked the same question again today, I would say that it's tough to say. It could be anywhere from three or four months. And most of the analysts are projecting that by the second quarter of 2015 that it should either already be on the growth track or will accelerate being on the growth track by the second quarter. But one thing I will say for sure, it's not going away. It's going to come back. Again, nobody's changing the culture of 1.4 billion people. It simply does not happen.. It is not if, it's when. Does that answer your question, Harry? Harry Curtis - Nomura: It does. If I could just ask one other quick question, Rob. Rob, on a hold-adjusted basis in Macau, and I think I have got these numbers right, but I am not sure, it looks like your margins, your EBITDA margin, was roughly flat year-over-year which I think in this competitive environment and the decline in VIP is pretty exceptional. But the question is, given your more cautious comments about margins on the premium mass side, is it going to be tough to hold those margins flat? Or do you think that there are things you guys can do on the expense side to at least keep those margins flat? Robert Goldstein : Two thoughts, Harry. One is, there are certain things we can do and I think the team there is addressing the expense part of the ledger. But honestly, we believe is that the mass business maintains and maybe even exceeds and the margin as you get stronger in, hope, this quarter in 2015. So again the great majority of our business comes out of is on mass. These are margin and our EBITDA is so strong in Macau is because we have a mass-driven model over there. And so I think maintaining the margin is very, very possible, if not growing the margin. The question is the competitive set, what they do in premium mass segment. That's the one thing I can't understand will happen there. Hopefully that remains an environment where you can work in the current structure and not losing more margin in the premium mass side. Mass mass feels very good and we can control expense and perhaps even get some better cost control over our numbers. But, in essence, our story is so much different than anybody else because of the fact that mass segment is our strength and that's where we reside primarily and that's the biggest part of our composite of our EBITDA. Daniel Briggs : And Harry, to be clear, on page 10 of the slide deck, we actually had a 100 bip increase in margins on a hold-normalized basis from 34% to 35%. So margins increased by 100 bips on hold-adjusted basis, despite the fact that we are seeing pressure in premium mass. Harry Curtis - Nomura: Very good. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we continue to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter. Despite some obvious challenges in the Macao market, we delivered a strong set of financial results, with companywide adjusted property EBITDA reaching $1.35 billion U.S. dollars, a 11% higher than prior year in a fourth quarter record. Did I hear anybody talk about things slowing down? At the same time we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. It also gives me great pleasure to report to shareholders that 10 years after we listed as a public company, we achieved an all time fiscal year record of $5.42 billion U.S. dollars in adjusted property EBITDA, a metric that surely sets a new benchmark for our industry. The foundation of our success is having the right strategy at the outset. Today, I am as confident as to I have ever been in a long-term prospects for our company. Before I go through the highlights for the quarter, allow me to highlight a few packs that support our Company\u2019s unique strategic position. Slide one, mainly in Chinese visitation to Macao is accelerating. Visitation for from Mainland China reached 21.2 million visitors, in 2014 an increase of 14%. Mainly in Chinese visitors from outside the neighboring Guangdong province, increased more than 17% for the year. Mainland Chinese visitors to Macau were up over 20% and both October and November while non-Guangdong, Mainland Chinese visitation was up 28% in October and just under 30% in November. Slide 2, these are the visitors from outside Guangdong Province have traveled to reach Macao and need hotel rooms when they arrive. We spent over $10 billion in investment to cater to these visitors. That investment includes 9,300 sleeping rooms, which is 56% of the total inventory of hotel rooms developed by concessionaires or sub-concessionaires in Macao. Daniel Briggs : What time is the call? Sheldon Adelson : Pardon me. Daniel Briggs : Operator this is someone on our lines. Operator : No sir. Sheldon Adelson : Okay and with the completion of the Parisian and the St. Regis Tower at Sands Cotai Central, we will have invested an excess of $13 billion U.S. dollars. An investment that reflects our unrivaled commitment to Macao's diversification, and to its future success as the world\u2019s leading business and leisure tours in destinations. Upon completion of the Parisian, our sleeping room supply will increase to nearly 13,000 rooms, which will represent approximately 45% of the total sleeping room inventory built by us and our competitors in Macao. And that\u2019s after five new competitors put up new property. Five of our competitors, put up new properties.  Macao\u2019s retail business is developing into a world-class shopping destination. The investment that we have made in Macao includes over 1.4 million square feet of retail mall offerings on the Cotai Strip. I\u2019m not talking about gross, I\u2019m talking about net. In the states it's called YOA, but it should be NLA. That represents over 70% of the total retail mall developments in Macao. So we naturally generate far more retail sales Macao, than others. After the completion of the Parisian and additional retail expansion plans, we expect to virtually double our retail offerings in the years ahead. Slide 4. Our investments in Macao include the development and operation of over 1.5 million square feet of MICE, meetings, incentive, convention and exhibitions space, which is almost five times larger than the combined total MICE space of the other Macao operators, five times larger than the combined total MICE space. We will increase our MICE capacity to nearly two million square feet as Sands Cotai Central is completed. That will continue to represent approximately 75% in the MICE capacity that will exist at the end of Macao\u2019s next date of development. The point here is that we made all these investments when others didn\u2019t. Everything we have invested in Macao to date, the sleeping rooms, the retail shopping malls, the MICE space, the entertainment offerings and the Cotai Arena. And everything we will invest in the future is predicated on delivering on our promise to help Macao in its economic diversification and its evolution as the world\u2019s leading business and leisure tours in destinations. One of our competitors said to me in 19 - sorry, 2007, said he was a going to build his building until he saw whether or not we were going to succeed or fail, that he don\u2019t want to take the risk. And they didn\u2019t start construction after we opened in 2007, they didn\u2019t start construction on their property till 2011. And in terms of entertainment a show room which we also have is good. There is a good show in a City of Dreams - COD the City of Dreams. And it\u2019s a very good show and they get good attendance. However, it doesn\u2019t bring back repeat customers. Once they see a show which is good show, The Dancing Waters, they won\u2019t come back a second time to see the show.  Now, let\u2019s compare our, arena a 15,000 seat arena. One week we can have an all martial arts exhibition, the next week we can have Selin Deon, the next week we can have a basketball game, the next week we can have a cultural event like a ballet or whatever. So the sort of unheralded arena is a major element to bringing back repeat customers. There\u2019s enough diversity we had 54 events in the arena last year 2014. There\u2019s enough diversity in the arena to bring somebody back repeatedly, just over one month. So the arena is - and we also have a show, an 1,800 seat show. This is natural as we are the pioneers and creators of the large scale, convention-based international resort. As a result, we have diversity product offering and the scale and critical mass to cater to every type of business and leisure visitor. This clearly positions just well for future long-term growth. But these attributes already allow us to out-earn our competitors. And I want to emphasize as we always have on the bottom line. Indeed the gap between our company and our peers has been widening for the first nine months of 2014. We had a 35% EBITDA share in a six-operator market in Macao, up from 32% for the same period in 2013. That is double, more than double of this year. And far in excess of our fair share of table capacity and gross gaming revenue. In Singapore, we have around 60% EBITDA share in a duopoly market, 50% more than the other guy. Not only are we unique and being licensed in the two largest gaming markets in Asia, but we are also by very wide margin the profit leader in both markets. Not only are we more profitable, revenue diversification means that, our earnings are more defensive and predictable and of higher quality. Today well over 80% of operating profit in both our Macao and Singapore operations comes from mass gaming and non-gaming segments, with less than 20% of profit coming from VIP gaming. Our non-gaming profits continue to grow in scale. Our combined retail mall operations in Asia achieved an operating profit just shy of US$0.05 billion dollars in 2014. That makes us one of the largest and most valuable mall developers and operators in the world. In addition to being more profitable and enjoying superior diversity of earnings, our integrated resort business model also allows us to contribute more meaningfully to the longer term economic success of our host jurisdictions. Something we are both eager and uniquely well positioned to replicate in new markets, tar more than what our competitors say that they will put up one of this and one of that, the one thing that is a gift that keeps giving beside the arena is MICE business. It's a feeder and a breeding ground for new tourism. Not withstanding the prevailing skepticism at the time. I made this strategic decision to pursue opportunities in both Macao and Singapore concurrently. As a result, I\u2019m happy to say that the company today can simultaneously reinvest capital in existing operations and future projects. Growing generous dividends, pay dividends and continue with the judicious share buyback program. Now let me take it through some of the highlights of our results in Macau for the quarter and for the year 2014. For quarter four, Macau adjusted property EBITDA was $711 million U.S. dollars. Our mass and non-gaming revenue streams which comprised more than 80% of our departmental profit in Macau naturally make our business far more defensive than the Macau gaming market as a whole. It is also important to remember again, that our business in Macau for the year produced $3.3 billion in EBITDA, an increase of 12% over 2013. Again did somebody say things had slowdown? The important point is that our strategy remains unchanged. Our business will continue to be anchored around the mass market and the long-term structural growth of tourism from China and the wider Asian region. Even amidst all the headwinds in this quarter, we saw resilience and revenues in many of the core mass segments during the quarter. Our ETG revenues were up 20%. Our non-gaming revenues as a whole grew by 7%. Within which retail mall revenues expanded 10%. And in our most important segment, mass table games, base market segment revenues were down by only 2% year-on-year. Visitation of Macao remains strong. Hong Kong just announced its full year tourist numbers for 2014. Mainland Chinese visitations to Hong Kong grew by 16% year-on-year, to 47 million visitor arrivals. That is more than twice what Macao receives. In my view there really is no reason to doubt a long-term growth potential in Macao\u2019s development as a tourism destination for China, especially as transportation infrastructure continues to improve over the next few years. Just look at what has happened in the past few years. The development of large scale resorts in Cotai fundamentally changed the profit composition of Macao. Macao\u2019s VIP jump [ph] volumes in quarter four of 2014 are the lowest for any quarters since quarter four of 2010. In other words over the past four years, the VIP component of GGR has hardly grown. If I had told you that was going to happen four years ago, you probably would have predicted doom and gloom for the market. Yet what\u2019s happen to our EBITDA over this period, it has more than doubled. It is more than doubled. The reason, the power of our mass gaming and non-gaming revenues has produced outstanding growth. We expect the market to continue to deliver growth in non-gaming and to naturally return the growth in mass gaming in the future. I\u2019m proud of the fact that we produced more non-gaming revenue than the other five gaming operators combined. Again we produced more non-gaming revenues than the other five gaming operators combined. High margin non-gaming revenues increased by 18% to reach a record $1.6 billion U.S. dollars this year and our share of those Macao wide non-gaming revenue was over a 55% from first nine months of 2014.  While it has become fashionable for everyone to talk about Macau\u2019s diversification from gaming, we have consistently been delivering on all aspects of diversification over the past decade. In summary, let me mention again that we have made pioneering contributions to Macau\u2019s diversification in MICE, retail, sleeping rooms, entertainment and employment opportunities from Macau\u2019s resorts. We saw the opportunity for this significant contribution for the MICE industry to Macau and we invested greatly to contribute to its future success. In 2013, our facilities received 1.7 million MICE participants as we hosted 52 exhibitions and over 600 conferences and meetings. According to published government statistics, our total MICE attendance represented over 80% of the total MICE attendance in Macau for 2013. I believe what the future completion of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge and the additional 3,000 hotel rooms at the Parisian, the MICE industry in Macau will develop even more successfully in the years to come. In retail our three retail malls generated US$2.5 billion of retail sales in 2014, up 12% year-on-year and more than three times what they were in 2010. To put this amazing statistic in context, in 2007 the total retail sales of Macau were less than US$1.8 billion. And we didn\u2019t just build for the high and luxury brands. Although, we do have one of the most successful, if not the most successful luxury retail malls in the world at the four seasons as measured by sales per square foot. We built an interconnected retail destination of more than 600 shops that would appeal the visitors across the whole spectrum of spending purchase. In addition, our retail tenants collectively employ more than 6,000 people, comparable to the number of staff that the largest casino hotels in Macau Peninsula would employ. Our retail mall sales accounted for 42% of total retail sales in Macau in quarter three of 2014. In the retail categories in which our malls have a presence. But the rollout of more retail in Sands Cotai Central and a complimentary portfolio of tenants at the Parisian which is now 95% leased, we look forward to further supporting the growth of Macau\u2019s retail industry as we drive more visitation by leveraging our unique portfolio of interconnected retail malls. Sleeping room inventory we discussed extensively a moment ago. Entertainment is another key differentiator. We have an ambitious events and entertainment strategy which uses our multiple performance venues including the Cotai Arena. We now have an established track record of bringing world-class entertainment events to Macao, including performances by The Rolling Stones, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, and Chan, as well as boxing events including world championship fights by Manny Pacquiao and Chinese Olympic champion and WBO fly weight world champion Zou Shiming.  For our employees, the breadth and scale of our non-gaming operations offer numerous opportunities for training, promotions, and career development. In 2014, we conducted over 160,000 training hours for more than 22,000 employees. We promoted just under 2,500 employees, 90% of whom were Macao locals. As one of the largest employers in Macao, if not the largest, we take our responsibilities to the [indiscernible] very seriously. Our integrated resort business model gives our employees a multitude of career advancement opportunities and we\u2019ll continue to encourage them to take advantage of what we have to offer.  We have, unlike our competitors, built sort of a school within our property with several classrooms to teach and to encourage our employees to be able to learn enough to advance in their employment. I don't believe any of these unique competitive advantage can be matched by our competition. Even after the completion of the next phase of their developments. I have every confidence in our ability to continue to grow over the long-term. We have a still underpenetrated market. We have improving transportation infrastructure, and we, Las Vegas Sands and Sands China have a uniquely differentiated portfolio of properties and product offering in Macao.  Now moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, we generated an all-time property record US$518 million of EBITDA in Marina Bay Sands during the quarter, while hold-normalized EBITDA was $461 million. Despite a 27% decline in rolling volumes, our whole normalized EBITDA was up by 35.1% including the property tax refund and up by 9% if we eliminate the benefit of that refund. I think this again demonstrates the quality and resilience of the cash flow generation in Marina Bay Sands. I'm extremely please to say that our strong financial results confirm that we have an outstanding business there. To quote Mark Twain, the rumors of Singapore's demice as a world-class resort destination are both premature and greatly exaggerated. [indiscernible] reached US$4.8 million, a 4% year-on-year, principally driven by our successful efforts and bringing in forward premium mass customers to Singapore. In addition, we have maintained a prudent reserve ratio during the quarter and we will continue to maintain the highest compliance standards in the industry, not only in Singapore, but locally. Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large scale integrated resort developments. The iconic appeal of Marina Bay Sands has driven strong growth in visitation from residents of China Japan, Korea, the wider Asian region and around the world to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.  We remain focused on potential to opportunities in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. We believe our unique convention-based integrated resort development model could bring meaningful benefits to these countries in terms of business and [indiscernible] tourism, employment, and economic growth. Before we address return of capital to shareholders, let me mention that after recent meeting agency upgrades, both S&P and Fitch now have an investment grade rating on Las Vegas Sands. We're happy to be recognized in this fashion and we intend to continue to follow the financial policies that contribute to their view of our financial strength.  The confidence we have in the strength of our business and the reliability and predictability of our cash flows have allowed us to progressively increase the return of capital to shareholders. Ours remains a uniquely privileged business model. We continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, while retaining more sufficient financial strength to pursue both organic growth and new development opportunities. Over the last three years to December 31, 2014, we have returned over $9.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends in stock buybacks. Including $8.1 billion to Las Vegas Sands shareholders and in Hong Kong dollars the equivalent of over $1.5 billion to the shareholders of Sands China. Also last year we increased the annual dividend for LVS shareholders by 42.9% for the 2014 calendar year, yay, dividends. For 2015, we previously - as previously announced the board of directors has increased the LVS dividend by 30% to $2.60 per year or $0.65 per quarter. The increase in the dividend will take place with the next quarterly dividend payment, which will be made on March 31, Yay, dividends. We have every intention when increasing the dividends in the years ahead as our business and cash flows continued to grow. In addition to dividend growth, we\u2019ve returned $235 million of capital to all the shareholders this quarter to a stock buyback program. We have approximately $1.76 billion remaining under our current stock buyback authorization. We look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buyback program to return capital to shareholders on an opportunistic basis and advance long-term shareholder returns.  In conclusion, we will continue to stay disciplined and execute our business plan. With the right strategy and the right management team in place, I'm more confident than ever about our future success. Now, before I turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session, I wanted to thank take the opportunity to thank Ed Tracy for his contributions to the company and to Sands China. We wish him the very best as he returns to United States to focus on his health and family. As we conduct the search for a permanent President and Chief Operating Officer for Sands China, we have every confidence that we will continue to execute successfully. While continuing to support the Macao government and itself it\u2019s to maximize Macao\u2019s tourism opportunities to the development of additional non-gaming attractions and amenities. We remain deeply committed to both the future of Macao and a future success of the more than 28,000 Sands China team members are an important part of the Sands family. Now, let\u2019s take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff from J.P. Morgan. Joe Greff : Good afternoon everybody. My question is just easier to call out Slide number 13, on your earnings slide presentation. What I'm surprised is in this presentation is that given the relative performance of the base mass, versus the premium mass then given the relative margin profile. And I know these are average table count numbers, but that the base mass table count shrunk sequentially and the premium mass table count, average count increased sequentially. And I guess why is that the case? Why are you trying to develop more table game capacity to the relatively more stable and higher margin business, and is that an opportunity? And then I have a quick follow-up related to Singapore. Robert Goldstein : Hey Joe, it\u2019s Rob, I\u2019ll take that. Obviously this is the market flux, there is lot of tables in the market that are under utilized, at this point it\u2019s an opportunity but the market with the junket business, flying so rapidly, and market were pretty masses in flux, I think its too early to tell where all these tables land. I don\u2019t think there is huge opportunity at this point, because the vision we have so many tables in the market that a base mass, versus premium mass table isn\u2019t a major issue from my perspective. The margins remain under pressure, I think, in Macao we\u2019re still doing very well relative to the market, I think. And we have sufficient tables to move that often shows that most growth and most opportunity. Joe Greff : Okay. And my follow-up related to Singapore. You were just under that five million mass table and slot per day metric a little bit ahead of what we were estimating for the quarter. What\u2019s driving that, what geographies or what you are doing there for at least relative to our forecast a nice little up tick? Robert Goldstein : Right, we recognized, we [indiscernible] few years ago the need to pursue a mass outside of Singapore. We've done that. We've executed well. The team there deserves a lot of respect for what they have accomplished. We still are south of $5 million [indiscernible] but I think the growth engine there is pretty massed outside of Singaporeans. We still have Singaporean business, but Indonesia, Malaysia, et cetera have been huge contributors to that growth and we are very proud, a short reference to earn $1.7 billion in that building. I remember years ago, we built that place peoples got that [ph] the notion of the $1 billion EBITDA, so now we\u2019re $1.7 billion, a spectacular year for us. A little help at the end obviously with the tax issue, but we\u2019re very happy with our growth there. As you, Chris, identified, the beauty of Singapore remains resides in the very powerful mass business, about $1.8 billion with the 63 % margin. Pretty strong results. No place like it with those kind of numbers. So the focus there remains mass, premium mass and doing the job correctly. Joe Greff : Great, thanks Robert. Sheldon Adelson : So, most profitable building in the world given bigger than the I think the growth building in New York. Operator : And your next question comes from Jon Oh from CLSA. Jon Oh : Hi, thanks for taking my question. If I can just start with may be your cost structure and also your margins, could you give us a sense of how much flexibility do you have as you think about your OpEx or your carrying cost in running both VIP and mass market in Macao today. And could give us a sense of how you\u2019re hoping with some of the flexibilities around the cost as we see business volumes especially in VIP not at high perform. What do you think margins are right now in VIP given that some of the cost structures are perhaps a lot more fix, could you may be give us comments on that please? Sheldon Adelson : Jon you\u2019re referencing VIP junket or VIP premium mass, when you say VIP? Jon Oh : Let\u2019s talk about VIP junket first and maybe you can also touch in premium mass too that will be great. Sheldon Adelson : Yes we haven\u2019t changed a lot of VIP junket, what's changed is the volume. The margins in VIP remain pretty much tied to whole percentage and they didn\u2019t not oscillate [ph] that much. The bigger move I think for the market, obviously is in the mass, premium mass aggregation, because whenever you have a decline in both base mass and premium mass as rapidly as you do in the fourth, clear margins, you can adjust quick enough on the payroll and the building cost, the operational cost of the building do not adjust that quickly. What does adjust is incentives and promotions against the customer. We continue to examine those costs. The labor issue is not what folks are now, we focus our incentives, our labor costs are not on the table at this point. What is on the table though is overhead general and the building entertainment also on the table is discussing our overhead corporately, as being as opportunity there. So we are charge with it\u2019s been very clear the direction in this trials and that where charge is growing our business more efficiently, examining any all layers of cost, against the customer promotionally, against the cost to run the business overall and make sure being efficient. But this has been a sea change as you know a very short period of time. We\u2019re still very pleased with our overall margin, but there\u2019s room to improve a lot of different places. So we\u2019re very focused on it. The team there will be looking at those issues very closely in the months ahead. Jon Oh : Okay and I can follow-up very quickly again on capacity. I think you briefly mentioned earlier Rob that perhaps there\u2019s some underutilized capacity in Macau today. As you assess to put in more capacity [indiscernible] in the market, do you think that there\u2019s strength of capacity today and how does that change your perception on the perhaps the number of tables that you guys have requested for the Parisian? Do you still need the think number of tables going forward in order to do some of the ROIC hurdles given the assessment of how much capacity there is today? Robert Goldstein : Well, George, keep in mind. This is the greatest game market in the world. And although, there has been a lot talking last three, four months about the changing dynamic of the market, we still earn more money there than any place by far. It doesn't even to compare to Las Vegas or it\u2019s an extraordinary market even with the downturn we\u2019re earning lots of money for table both mass premium mass. So the answer is yes. We do hope to double on our request for the tables of Parisian. We are not earning, I mean, we were doing as much as 13,000, 14,000 table, but there\u2019s nothing on the $11,000, $12,000 a table still very, very flat, huge margin. So yes and yes, we want the tables and we\u2019re hoping we can get them. I think Sheldon when he opened the conversation and talked about his achievements there, clearly, what we have done, while other people started to build the neighborhood, we\u2019re in the neighborhood, we built it ten years ago. We built where I think the government respects to be the future of Macao. I think the decision was started back in 2005 when the Venetian began, being put together is coming full circle now. And so I believe based on that we had a darn good chance getting our fair share tables because we delivering the promise and then some. So yes, we want the tables and yes, we believe we deserve the tables, and yes, they're still very, very profitable. You earn more per table Macao by double than what you to gross in Las Vegas per table. So it\u2019s a pretty astounding market even though it\u2019s under pressured, this is still the best king market in the world. We want these over represented to the table dynamic. Jon Oh : Excellent, thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, John. Sheldon Adelson : Thanks, John. Operator : And your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Bit of a higher level of question, but I guess as we look back at the fourth quarter, it seems like there were a lot of discussions around on broader policies FBA anti-corruption or anti-money laundering kind of in the market in Macao. And I\u2019m just curious as a concession year and obviously, a huge player, there have you guys had any I guess more concrete discussions with either the Government Macao or the Government of China about sort of what at a high level, you think you are trying to accomplish with their message around diversifying the market just I think any color for that would be helpful as people are trying to adjust to a new normal. Sheldon Adelson : This is Sheldon we are the leaders in the non-gaming direction development. The other guys say they are going to catch up to us. When you look at the fact that we do 80% of all the non-gaming income out of 35 Casinos in Macau, it\u2019s clear the way, the ones that have set the pace on developing non-gaming amenities. And we think that our business model that is made of primarily of mice is the one business final that is a gift that keeps giving. The people come it\u2019s a breeding ground for new tourism. So they\u2019re using our business our accomplishments as a model for the other gaming operators to follow. Shaun Kelley : Okay, thanks for that. And then\u2026 Robert Goldstein : So other color we lead that just want to make sure you understand. We have the last number of years and currently agree with the direction of compliance, we embrace compliance, we think it\u2019s the future of industry growth in Nevada, and Pennsylvania, and Singapore, and Macau. There is no reason to fight against it. So where we\u2019ve not had conversation with government we simply wait for the direction of the government to follow accordingly. But we\u2019re big believers in all I the things we\u2019re doing in terms of the corruption issues and AML. And the new Macau is a little different, the old Macau, the story wonderful Macau. Shaun Kelley : That\u2019s helpful, thanks guys. And then I guess as a follow-up other big area we\u2019ve got some questions on was the kind of election or choice not to pay special dividend at Sands China this quarter. So could you talk a little bit about that decision and then your, I guess, it sounds like you\u2019re very committed to the recurring dividends at both the Sands China subsidiary and the parent, but how you might fund those between the different subsidiaries, just a little color on that would be useful. Thanks. Sheldon Adelson : That one I read about that, I thought I was kind of curious. Special dividend is a special dividend a special dividend is not a regular repeat dividend. So when some body said why don\u2019t you give me a regular repeat dividend? Another one in the form of the special dividend, I scratch my head. And I\u2019m still scratching. I just think that suggestion is kind of silly. When there is an opportunity to pay special dividend, we lean more on the direction of regular dividends because that\u2019s predictable and reliable with special dividends and not. So as far as we\u2019re concerned we rather assure our investors including LVS that there\u2019s going to be a reliable and predictable regular dividend. And if we do a special dividend for whatever reason that will be because for a special reason and it\u2019s not going to be regular. Robert Goldstein : Shaun, we actually added a page in the slide deck to specifically deal with that SCL is on Page 8 in that deck, which emphasize this [indiscernible] points that the recurring dividend is paid in two pieces we expect that to grow over time, and are committed to growing it over time. But and the special, it is special. Shaun Kelley : Perfect. Thank you guys. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hi guys, can you give us an update on the competitive environment in Macao, both on the mass and VIP side. Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Competitive environment, what\u2019s happening competitively? So we see the environment there, Sheldon Adelson : We can earn more money than anything. Robert Goldstein : Okay, well answered. We think the environment obviously, Thomas, is changing, people are changing their priorities again we are very confident on our business model lends its self to this, it\u2019s called the New Macao which is mass based, which is not game based, We believe we get a lot of money in Macao, will adjust our business plan accordingly. We are not seeing promotional cost being out of control what you are seeing is a downsize near the base mass and the premium mass business which of course will adversely impact margins. That\u2019s a fact of any place Macao or any other. I don\u2019t see operators losing their sense of balance or prioritization of how they spend the money, their margins will come down a bit though because there is less top line obviously, most probably at the top. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a situation where it\u2019s veering out of control, our operators being unrealistic or there\u2019s panic in the streets of Macao, we have a reasonable quarter, we expect to keep earning well in Macao, a lot of disciplined, very smart people lots of capital in Macao. So at this point we see the environment that mimics the better half of the year, first half of the year, which was exceptional for all of us. Thomas Allen : That\u2019s helpful. And then just following-up on the previous question about capital returns, I find interesting that you talked about 1.7 billion stock last year, and you have a similar authorization today. Do you think there's a chance that you would [indiscernible] the share, and if you\u2019re not returning, if you\u2019re not doing the special dividend on Macao, are you, can you fund it out of and Singapore without having to raise debt? Thanks. Sheldon Adelson : I didn't understand the question. He talked too fast. Do, Raphaelson you\u2019re taking can you take it? Ira Raphaelson : Yes, sure. Hi, I think where we\u2019re on the buyback is I think it\u2019s going to be something the board only determines, and the management determines over time, how would like to return capital opportunistically to the repurchase program, that will come as the quarter progresses. So I don\u2019t know we can answer that question now. Without the special dividend could we fund that amounts without raising debt capital, it depends on our trajectory for the year. So I can\u2019t really give you an answer because we\u2019re not there yet. But you can look at our current capital structure or liquidity profile. And we have the needs to fund return of capital more aggressively, increase dividends or new development opportunities as we see said. So a lot of it depends on how the year progresses and use of management over time. But we\u2019ve made no determination yet. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Daniel Briggs : Carlo, that must be you. Carlo Santarelli : Well, that was a good one. I actually forgot what I was going to ask after that introduction. But, it just a really quickly guys I know it\u2019s not a huge issue for you guys, but wondering if you did anything differently in Las Vegas as it pertains to your room strategy notice occupancy was a little different than expected, which is necessarily surprising, but based on what we\u2019ve seen from the Las Vegas Strip revPAR statistics it kind of stood out a little bit. Is there anything you know that that maybe we missed from a comp perspective or strategy change? Sheldon Adelson : Not really. Can you give us an insight, what do you are talking, why are you\u2026 Carlo Santarelli : Just the Las Vegas revPAR down 2.5% solid rate growth at plus 7, but the occupancy down almost 800 basis points. Sheldon Adelson : No change in strategy, no change in complementary policy. Dan, may be you can give more color on that? I don\u2019t have any color. Carlo Santarelli : We think we have the opportunity probably in Las Vegas, we think we look at our competitors and passed of some other folks on our competitors said we can do better. We have some programs in place to grow our EBITDA here in Las Vegas. We continue to be a dominant player along with Wynn and Bellagio [indiscernible] side but we think we can do better. With all the 7,000 keys first year building we like to better both in room occupancy entry and continue to grow our game business as well. That having said, there\u2019s been no change in strategy, no change in direction we remain pretty much constant onour approach. Carlo Santarelli : Understood and then Rob, if I could, one followup, obviously there has been I think as of this morning I\u2019ve read in article about some of the labor unions in Macao calling for a full smoking deck. Could you guys talk a little bit now having digested that for a little over three months, what you\u2019ve seen, what kind of the experience has been and where, if any, you think it\u2019s having a material impact if there is one? Robert Goldstein : It\u2019s not a positive, that\u2019s sure. I can\u2019t tell you the extent Carlo, because candidly knows how big smoking has been. There\u2019s many factors in Macao that are changing currently. It\u2019s hard to ascertain is it smoking, is it anti-corruption, it this a lot of factors in play here. Having said that, we remain behind government\u2019s direction whatever maybe, we have recent being with the government about this smoking issue. They appear to be making their final decision. Whatever it is, it is. If it ends up being a being a ban or ends up being smoking rooms like the airport, we\u2019ll abide by it and we\u2019ll follow it. I don\u2019t think - it\u2019s obviously no markets are benefiting, no gain market anyone in the world, be it Europe or the U.S. is benefiting from a smoking ban. Having said that, we\u2019re of the belief that Macao is a unique destination, unique to mainland China and Hong Kong. It will prosper in spite of smoking ban or smoking restriction. Is it better with smoking? Sure it is. Is it going to happen where smoking is restricted? Yes, we know that. The extent restriction we don\u2019t know government advise. Whatever the government tells us to do we\u2019ll comply happily. Carlo Santarelli : That\u2019s helpful, Rob. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, thank you. Hopefully, you can hear me there is something wrong with my head set so I have to be on speaker. Is that okay? Robert Goldstein : We can hear you Felicia. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, great. Thank you. First question, Sheldon or for Patrick, just going back to the subject of capital return, I did notice that the regarding, I did notice that the blurb regarding dividends and the debt no longer has that comment about increasing the recurring dividend 10% annually. Certainly have a strong commitments to returning cash to shareholders and growing the dividends. I\u2019m trying to understand the change in the language. Sheldon Adelson : Probably whoever wrote it then think of this? There was nothing intentional about that. Felicia Hendrix : Okay so you\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : You want us to say we intend to grow at least 10%. Robert Goldstein : 10% forever is impossible, 10% forever is impossible. Sheldon Adelson : Well that also depicts how market\u2026 Robert Goldstein : [Indiscernible] Sheldon Adelson : We intend to continue dividends. It was nothing intentional if that wasn\u2019t put in there. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Because I was just checking because you guys have been pretty clear for a while saying that you\u2019re committed to growing 10%. So it sounds like that hasn\u2019t changed. Sheldon Adelson : That has not changed. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. great. And then Rob, some of your comments underscore this point, you are a well known [indiscernible] on Macau, looking near term, it does seem the south side is forecasting Macau\u2019s gaming revenue to decline in 2015 anywhere form high single-digits to low double-digits certainly it\u2019s anybody\u2019s best guess for sure. But I\u2019m just wondering does that correlate with what your internal folks are projecting in it. So strategically how are you approaching this year particularly in the first half where most of the market declines are likely to occur. Robert Goldstein : Thanks for calling me hover boy, I like that. We\u2019ve seen this for also the market generated by a concentrated group of super-premium mass customers are relent somewhat and clearly that\u2019s hurt the uber bull market. No question about that. I believe it will see a renewed growth in base mass business across the underlying positive drivers are so compelling with visitation growth, transportation and destruction improvements, unmatched inventory rooms, game mix, retail entertainment that speak to that mass segment. As simply stated, yes, we believe very much in this market it is still - people seem to forget what this market means relative to the rest of the world because the last three months, four months have been unsettling. But this is the greatest game market in the world and the LVS is in the perfect place to take advantage of the new Macao environment.  Our assets are unique to this incredible market and I believe this time we\u2019ll prove that the sustainable growth of our business Macao will be evident to all. We remain very focused on margins and focused on overhead. We look at all overhead, not just Macao but the company and look to grow this company's return to shareholders. So yes, we're very much a believer. Are we concerned what happened in the last three or four months, everyone is concerned of what happened in the junket space, the smoking issue. There's so many issues, it doesn't need to be repeated in the call conversant with those issues. But I think Sheldon a decade ago built the strategy that today is being talked about. He built the Venetian. He built 3,000 rooms. He built the MICE space. He built the retail space. Everybody else is building vertical buildings on the peninsula and Sheldon over a decade ago called the shot. And I think that shot is happening today from both the competitor and government perspective. We\u2019re just ahead of the curve by a mere 10 years. So our business remains very steadfast as base mass resets and premium mass resets, we'll reset. Margins will return and we'll remain uber-bulls in Macao. Felicia Hendrix : You increased your slot and ETG account combined by 5%. Is that just tweaking or is that like to read into that you\u2019re gearing more towards the base mass? RobertGoldstein: Now, we\u2019re gearing towards - I guess the point is there is plenty of gaming capacity right now in Macao and we believe very strongly the size of our building, the size of our real estate enables us to grow. I am big believer of ETGs will be very, very - very happy place to be for next couple of years. We\u2019ll keep growing that business. Slots have not been as bullish frankly, but love ETG business and we'll keep banging away at that, that\u2019s a big advantage to us. When you sleep in our room, you pay us 120 bucks to sleep in the hotel, gamble little bit, go on to our retail shops, it's an amazing environment for us to survive, I was there a couple of weeks ago and despite all the talk [indiscernible] had it right. This is a great market we have to be there. We will keep drive ETG business, while it\u2019s not growing business. Felicia Hendrix : Great, thanks so much. RobertGoldstein: Okay. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about - I was looking at the RevPAR decline, a slight decline at the Venetian Macao. And I wonder if you could talk to us a little bit about your room strategy kind of what percent of cash paying versus room comps and kind of how we should think about the hotel supply that\u2019s going to be entering the market. I didn\u2019t see in the release your slides an opening date for the Parisian. There\u2019s no reference for the opening dates and I don\u2019t if you can address that, as well. And I do have a follow-up question. Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Okay. Rob, I'll take the Venetian Macao question. We're going through a change of thinking there how we use that product, obviously it\u2019s the most desirable product when Cotai 3,000, keys et cetera. The cash we\u2019ve always been very focused on a certain threshold gaming customer in the pretty mass, mass are revisiting that strategy as we move forward. We want to run a higher occupancy, because we firmly believe that the more people sleep in the Venetian, the more people shop at the Venetian, mall which we\u2019ve owned, eat in our restaurant, of course gamble in our facility. So e think that asset has more growth potential to users who use more aggressively on the data base. And as Macao move towards, more base mass segment as opposed to junket, or as opposed to premium mass, that facility has got to rethink its room strategy in my opinion to get more out of the rooms. If the most desirable room comp there is in Cotai, the building continues to be huge driver of visitation, we think we\u2019ve got to rethink and do better to drive more opportunity how the room side of our Venetian product. As for Parisian, Sheldon, do you want to address that issue? The Parisian\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : The opening date, Robert Goldstein : Opening days for the Parisian. Sheldon Adelson : We don\u2019t have an opening date yet. It will be sometime in 2016. The question also comes up as to whether or not there will be a partial opening, rooms and casino and some restaurants, and maybe entertainment. But there\u2019s a new government that distanced on about a month ago. And I'm going over there this coming week to talk to the new government and find out what their intentions are vis-a-vis the components that we need to open such as construction labor and we're shuffling around our construction labor once we finish the St. Regis building we'll move some labor over to the Parisian. And we're also looking where we can pickup other delay other CapEx to existing properties so we could use those blue cards, the equivalent of U.S. green cards. It's something different. It's a temporary situation for current labor. We are going to make every effort to get it done as soon as possible. We don't have an exact date yet. I'll have more information on our next call. Do we have any firm distributable information in between, I'll put it out. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Robert Goldstein : There are people looking for more labor. And the government wants us open because we\u2019re the - we have the largest number of rooms. I said we have 58% of all the concessionaires rooms, that\u2019s a very big number. And we don\u2019t give out 100% of the rooms like our competitors do for the casino. We leave them open for people who come in for other purposes. And they want to increase tourism, they want MICE. And I'm going to point out it to them that we can't expand on those areas that they really want as opposed to the gaming, when everybody else - when we don't have enough labor. We do have the permits to complete all the property. And we're going to do our best to finish it as quickly as possible. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, great. Thank you. For my follow-up question, I wonder if you could just give us a little bit of your thinking around you\u2019re taking the CEO role at Sands China and kind of why not use it as an opportunity to strengthen the bench by having - I don't know if you look at internal and external candidates and kind of what led to that decision? Robert Goldstein : Well, it's sort of an internal political issue. The CEO title has carried with it and a separation of Sands China from its major shareholder in the last several CEOs that we've had there. So rather than risk that happening again, I\u2019m taking the title of CEO and I'll take the responsibility of the CEO and we'll have a President and COO. And I think listen, I haven't done too bad [Multiple Speakers] in the last two years - like a lot of shareholders I\u2019ve done very well. If I'm doing as good as Rob said, I\u2019m going to go to the board and ask for a raise. Felicia Hendrix : Thanks for that perspective. Sheldon Adelson : Thanks Rob. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : Hi [Multiple Speakers]\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : I read your report recently. Steven Kent : Well, let me ask a question then, the $90 million tax rebate. I didn't have that in at all. Could you just explain that a little bit in Singapore, then also? Robert Goldstein : We\u2019ve been telling that for the last five years and Patrick when and there, and justified a return on that. And we got the $91 million back. So as we had to invenatize it, over the last five years, we took it in as income. Now you could invenatize the return of the income over the next five years, but we're not going to go backwards and restate earnings. Steven Kent : Okay. So that was\u2026 Ira Raphaelson : Even the $90 million amount is relates to five-year period, it would have a $0.09 impact on EPS in aftertax if we had to pull that out again. If it\u2019s something that going forward we\u2019ll have a slightly smaller income tax or property tax event, but it was over a five-year period, not a just Steven Kent : Okay, it was a property tax issue it was not other type. Ira Raphaelson : Correct. Steven Kent : Okay and then the other thing is, and again only because capital allocation is so critical to your story on share buyback, I think, you noted you\u2019re going be opportunistic and is that different from the $75 million per month. That you talked about, before it goes to sort of the other question about dividend and 10% increase every year, I think that\u2019s what people are trying to figure out is are you becoming more or selective about some of these capital allocation issues, or is there some consistency here that may be you are missing in the comments. Ira Raphaelson : I think, the one that are more selective are you guys, was - we\u2019re not more selective about this. We\u2019re not changing any strategy to put into the press release to put in my prepared remarks of the earnings call, whether we\u2019re going to do 10% a year. Don\u2019t look into that. If we are going to have a significant change of policy, we would disclose it. The fact that somebody else wrote it to pay attention to that issue, forget about that. Whether or not we\u2019re not opportunistic, when this thought [ph] goes down far more it\u2019s down a lot more than what we think it deserves. And this earnings report gives us a little bit of indication that we\u2019re still doing well, can you imagine $5.44 billion, I know I said $5.42 billion and until this morning it\u2019s $5.44 billion EBITDA. How many companies will do that? We\u2019re certainly in the top 100 and if not in the world at least in the United States. And we\u2019re very proud of making that kind of money. So trying to guess whether we're going to be opportunistic or we wake up one morning and somebody says the stock is down 5 points, maybe we ought to buyback two or three points [indiscernible]. Listen, all we know is I'm sending a message. You want to get my message. I haven't sold any stock. I got 432 million shares and I haven't sold one share of stock since 2006 when I did a secondary to create some diversification. I haven't sold any. I have no intention of selling any. And I believe in the long-term improvement of this company and we will one day, whether it's sooner or later, I can't tell you for sure, we hope it\u2019s sooner that we're going to get additional emerging market opportunities. Nobody can go out there and present. The bona fide is that we can do. There is not a city in the world that doesn't want more MICE. Everybody wants MICE. I know one of our competitors - and was it a third phase, the galaxy, fourth phase, or fifth phase, or sixth phase, or seventh phase, or eighth phase or ninth phase or tenth phase, I don't know what city is going to put some MICE space in. But I\u2019ve got 40 years of experience in the MICE industry. I sold my company in 1995 and the largest amount of money ever in the 1200 year history of agricultural and trade fairs. I sold my company for the largest amount of money. Nobody understands and knows the MICE market better than this company and we have a lot of people in this company that have been with me for over 20 years. There are people that work with me in the interface group when I had Comdex and other shows. So nobody can compete with us on that score. And what we've done in Macao, 80% of all the MICE business in Macao, the other guys are just making noise. We walked the\u2026 Steven Kent : Okay, thanks very much. I got the message. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Steve. Sheldon Adelson : I hope so. If not I will have stronger words tomorrow. Steven Kent : I look forward to that Sheldon. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura. Harry Curtis : Hi, guys. Sheldon Adelson : What you said to Harry? Harry Curtis : Well, I will continue. So Rob, you talk about the new Macao. And my question is given the various policy changes that we\u2019ve seen come out of either Macao or Beijing, do you guys have any sense of whether or not the policy changes that Macao has had to really suffer through, is that it or do you have any sense that others are being considered? Robert Goldstein : Harry, I think that's far beyond our ability to comment, the Government of Macao makes that decision, impossible to sit here and make a prediction about what may or may not happen. I mean I think six months ago, there is - some of things we\u2019ve seen happen no one would have believed. So I think it's foolish to speculate and I won't do that. Harry Curtis : In that case, the only other question that I had was just a clarification on the page 5 of the slide deck. Maybe, Dan, you can answer it. The hold-adjusted property EBITDA the 1.273 billion, is that before the 90 million tax adjustment and corporate? Robert Goldstein : Yes. Harry Curtis : Okay, just wanted to clarify. Thanks a lot. Robert Goldstein : Okay. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Daniel Briggs, you may begin your conference. Daniel Briggs : Thank you. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results. In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income and hold-normalized adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and hold-normalized adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted property EBITDA and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA, all of which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release.  Please note that this presentation is being recorded.  We also want to inform you that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for your use. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thanks a lot, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  I'm pleased to report that we continued to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter. And despite the continuing challenges in the Macao market, we delivered a solid set of financial results, with company-wide adjusted property EBITDA reaching USD 1,051,000,000. At the same time, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders.  I know you're waiting for me to predict whether we have reached the bottom in Macao and whether the next quarter will get better. But it's very hard to do so right now because we are sailing in uncharted territory, at least for the short term. It reminds me of a fellow that had a joke that said, \"It's very difficult to make predictions, particularly about the future.\" Our job is to set the right strategy so that we can grow and prospect for the long term in spite of the current challenges, contiguous to the economic development of our host jurisdictions, and at the same time, ensure the company can weather any cyclical storm across the business cycle. But I want to tell you that I am today as confident as I've ever been in the long-term outlook for the Macao market. Our unmatched financial strength enables us to stay fully committed to our markets and our development plans while continuing to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders.  To put it plainly, we will invest in our existing portfolio. We will search for new development opportunities very aggressively, and we will pay generous recurring dividends, which we have every intention of growing over the next several years as our business and cash flows continue to grow. I can say that we're targeting at least a 10% growth in each of the next 3 years. Today, our company -- that's in regular dividends. Today, our company enjoys a strategic position in our industry. First, we alone have the true business diversification, which derives from our convention-based Integrated Resort business model. Second, we are unique in having the critical mass of Integrated Resort assets that can capture the long-term tourism and consumption growth in Asia. And third, only our company has the privilege of operating in the 2 biggest gaming markets in Asia.  Talk to anyone who is familiar with the markets in Asia. We are in the pole position to be selected as the preferred developer of new integrated resorts as and when other markets in Asia open up. My commitment to invest in Macao's long-term future has been and will continue to be unwavering.  Let me be specific. First, not only will we work to complete our St. Regis and Parisian projects in Macao as expeditiously as we can. We are also as eager as ever to develop additional resort and non-gaming facilities beyond the completion of these 2 projects.  Second, we will continue to lead the charts in the economic diversification in Macao. In particular, we will continue to be the pioneer in developing the MICE, retail, hotel and entertainment industries.  Remember, we were the first ones to develop an integrated resort on Cotai when everyone else was wildly [ph] ridiculing us and telling us they couldn't even spell integrated resort. Our business model has since been validated as each and every one of our competitors has tended to emulate us. I say attempt because they all say if they put in a hotel and a casino, and a couple of restaurants, they have an integrated resort. We have 8 or 10 different major entertainment and attraction components that are unmatched by anybody in Macao, unmatched. And everybody says, \"Oh, I'm going to put in some more shopping. I'm going to launch my lobby, and I'll put a couple of stores in there, a couple of gift shops. And then I'll be an integrated resort.\" I'd like to say that the description of it is going to be sort of somewhat different than us. Third, we will continue to invest in the training and development of our employees. I would like to elaborate on each of these commitments. With respect to development projects in our master plan for Cotai Strip, I believe these remain critical in supporting Macao's goal of becoming a world-class leisure and tourism destination. There's been a lot of debate recently, both in Macao and Hong Kong, concerning the ability of these cities to accommodate the growing number of tourists and the impact of tourist growth on local residents.  I believe our MICE-based Integrated Resort model provides a winning formula for accommodating long-term tourism growth for Macao while minimizing disruptions to local residents. With the completion of St. Regis and Parisian, we will have almost 13,000 hotel rooms in interconnected resorts, interconnected, you don't have to leave the building to go from one to the other. With the potential of -- and there's over 840 stores across 4 shopping malls; with the potential to add several hundred more in new development subject to government approval; 2 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space; and 4 performance venues, including our Venetian Cotai arena, which can be utilized either for our MICE business or major entertainment events, all of this and more under one roof.  No one else in Asia can you step out of your hotel room and walk down the hallway to a door and into an arena. The visitor to any of our resorts can enjoy the full spectrum of non-gaming additional [ph] amenities without ever stepping outside of our buildings. In quarter 1 this year, our hotel occupancy in Macao was 83%, which meant we had around 7,600 occupied rooms per day and more accurately per night. With completion of the St. Regis and Parisian, we will have nearly 13,000 keys. So we will have capacity to grow our occupied room nights by another 5,000 per night. That, of course, represents very substantial growth in tourism capacity. The key is to attract and grow the number of overnight visitors and accommodate and entertain them in our Cotai Strip Integrated Resort complex. That for me is a triple win. Good for us, good for Macao and good for our customers.  As you're probably aware, there will be a midterm review of the gaming concessions this year, and it's important to recognize what we have accomplished in each of the key categories of the review over the past decade.  So let me now talk about our commitment to promote economic diversification in Macao. I've tried to find a more modest label for our role, but I think nothing describes it better than pioneer. Developing the non-gaming industry isn't just about building the hardware, although that is unquestionably essential. It requires strategic planning, operating know-how and the commitment to invest in the human resources to grow and operate these businesses.  While it's become fashionable for everyone to talk about Macao's diversification in gaming, we have [indiscernible] been delivering on all aspects of diversification over the past decade. I'd just like to say that if you calculate our -- the ratio of non-gaming to gaming, it's about 97% non-gaming space and about 3% entertainment [ph] space. Take MICE for instance. The overall Macao industry grew from 1.2 million attendees in 2009 to 2 point [indiscernible] The Sands China subsidiary accounted for 80% of that growth, as we increased from 614,000 attendees in 2009 to 1.8 million in 2014. We are the global experts in MICE, and we look forward to help take the MICE industry in Macao to the next level over the coming years.  In the hotel segment, most of you know that we have more hotel rooms than all our competitors put together. But more than that, we actually sell our hotel rooms to drive new and more diverse group of visitors to Macao rather than simply assigning them to casino patrons. We estimate we accounted for over 80% of the cash rooms sold on Cotai in 2014.  Based on our recent customer research surveys, around half of our cash paying hotel guests at Venetian are first-time visitors to Macao. To me, that is a very healthy demand indicator for Macao as a destination, and furthermore, the enduring attraction of The Venetian. And this has always been a key part of our strategy to help Macao become a world-class tourism destination, build iconic integrated resort destinations to attract new visitors to Macao.  In retail, our 3 retail malls generated USD 2.5 billion of retail sales in 2014. That's almost as much as on the lives [ph] our key executives spend, up 12% year-on-year versus an overall Macao market that was up by only 1% and more than 3x what they were in 2010. To put this amazing statistic in context, at 2007, the total retail sales in Macao were less than USD 1.8 billion. And we didn't just build for the high-end luxury brands, although we do have one of the most successful luxury retail malls in the world at the Four Seasons. I think that's a little misnomer. I think we have the most successful luxury retail mall as measured by sales per square foot, over USD 7,000 sales per square foot, US dollars. We built an interconnected retail destination that would appeal to visitors across the whole spectrum. Our retail mall sales accounted for about 40% of total retail sales in Macao in 2014 in the retail categories of which our malls have a presence. With the rollout of mall retail in Sands Cotai Central, and a complementary portfolio of tenants at The Parisian, which is now 95% committed, we look forward to further supporting the growth of Macao's retail industry as we drive more visitation by leveraging our unique portfolio of integrated retail malls.  In entertainment, we have established a real track record in bringing and delivering world-class entertainment events to Macao. This quarter, in addition to [indiscernible] concerts and the Zou Shiming world title fight, we ran the famous West End musical, Cats, with 13 shows in the Venetian Theatre. The show achieved 84% occupancy. And we will be bringing in another Broadway hit, Beauty and the Beast, for the summer.  Again, this is an area where we have made a pioneering contribution to Macao's diversification. First, we built the hardware, the multiple performance venues that allow for staging a whole variety of events. But then we also followed through with a strategy and invested in the expertise to bring the entertainment content to Macao. Look at our workforce today. More than half of our team members, around 15,000 of them, work in the various non-gaming business lines. That's more than the combined total number of gaming and non-gaming employees of 2 of our major competitors.  That leads me on to our commitment of training and promotion of our employees. Last week, I was in Macao to preside over the launch of the Sands China Academy. Representatives from various higher education institutions in Macao were also present at the event. The Sands China Academy brings together under one umbrella all the various education, training and development initiatives and programs that we have pursued over the past decade.  In 2008, we established the Adelson Advanced Education Centre located within The Venetian Macao. This has served not only as the primary training center for our employees but also as an off-site campus for the University of Macau. Over the past 3 years, we have had over 88,000 participants in training courses in the Adelson Centre, and we are the only property in all of Macao that has an opportunity training center for its team members, the only one. In 2013, we also set up the Sands Retail Academy with the aim of providing service training for retail professionals. And retailers, including Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Bvlgari, have participating in the program. This is not a program for our team members. This is to develop the local employees of our retail mall tenants to attain service levels that are consistent with global best practices.  This again demonstrates that we [ph] support to development of the non-gaming industries in Macao. Not only have we invested heavily in the hardware, we've also invested heavily in human resources. And we are committed to continue to do so. Not only will we continue to invest in local talent development, we will also continue to support local businesses. Last year, the USD 1.6 billion spent on procurement, around 83 [ph] was spent on local suppliers.  As the originator of the Cotai Strip development, now is not the time to pull back on any of these critical commitments. We will stay fully invested in Macao for the long term. We're committed to playing the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into the world's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Our track record in being transformative pioneers in multiple jurisdictions speaks for itself. But don't forget also our track record in staying the course. We have been tested by much stormier weather in our company's history. You can say that. You want to say it again? Robert Goldstein : Say it again, yes. Sheldon Adelson : Today, our company is financially stronger than it has ever been. Remember, we're the pioneers and creators of the large-scale MICE-based Integrated Resort. As a result, we have the diversity of product offering and the scale and critical mass to cater to every type of business and leisure visitor. This clearly positions us well for future long-term growth. But these attitudes already allow us to out-earn our competitors, as we always have, where it means something, on the bottom line.  Indeed, the gap between our company and our peers has been widening for 2014. We had a 35% EBITDA share in a 6-operator market in Macao, up from 32% in 2013, reflecting the strength of our MICE and retail-driven Integrated Resort model. In my quick calculation, it looks like we've doubled our fair market share. In Singapore, we have around 60% EBITDA share in a duopoly market. Not only are we unique in being licensed in the 2 largest gaming markets in Asia, we are also, by a very wide margin, the profit leader in both markets. In addition to bringing [ph] more profitable and enjoying superior diversity of earnings, our Integrated Resort business model also allows us to contribute more meaningfully to the long-term economic success of our host jurisdictions, something we are both eager and uniquely well positioned to replicate in new markets.  Now let me take you through some of the highlights of our results in Macao for the quarter. For quarter 1, Sands China adjusted property EBITDA was USD 531 million. The significant year-over-year decline in gaming revenue, especially for VIP and premium mass segments, were obviously the primary driver of year-on-year decline in EBITDA.  When compared to quarter 4 of 2014, the rate of sequential decline in our Non-Rolling win per day in Q1 has narrowed to 6%, within which the base mass win per day declined by only 4%.  Moreover, our operating margin in mass gaming was sequentially flat in quarter 1, as our effort to reduce casino reinvestment costs was able to offset the margin impact of declining programs [ph].  While I have talked at length about our commitment to stay fully invested in Macao as it relates to human resources, our capital expenditure and also our commitment to market and grow new visitors to Macao, I'm mindful that we also need to ensure that we maintain a keen focus on cost and efficiency. Rob will address this area in a more detail later. But one example whereby we have adjusted our structure given the changes in the marketplace is to reduce our casino patron reinvestment costs.  The decline in gaming does also, of course, start to impact some of our non-gaming segments. Our non-gaming revenues for the quarter declined by 4% year-over-year, as did our overall property visitations. Instead of saying the glass is half empty, why don't we say we kept 96% of the business that we had? It sounds like a good number to me. Our non-gaming revenue for the quarter declined by 12% year-over-year, as did our overall property visitations. Based on the latest published government statistics, overall Macao market hotel occupancy declined by 11 percentage points in February compared to the prior year to around 80%. And overall number of hotel guests in Macao declined by about 10% compared to February of the prior year. Our hotel portfolio was at 88% in February compared to 80% for the overall Macao market, up about 10%. Looks good to me.  The scale of our hotel room inventory remains one of our key strategic advantages. It allows us to target higher-value overnight visitors from Greater China and the rest of Asia and to grow the base of high-value visitors for the hotel [ph]. While the mix between casino and cash customers has changed somewhat due to a decline in high-end gaming, we alone have the inventory, the resort content and the operating experience in selling the rooms and grow the market significantly. We know from our recent customer research surveys that the majority of our cash-paying hotel guests do engage in some gaming activity, and an overwhelming majority of them spends significantly on shopping.  I'm proud of the fact that we produce more non-gaming revenue than the other 5 gaming operators combined. Our share of growth in Macao-wide non-gaming revenue was 57% for 2014. Of course, it's more than they have combined. They only have 43%.  The important point is that as our strategy remains unchanged. Our business will continue to be anchored around the mass market and the long-term structural growth of tourism from China and the wider Asian region. I have every confidence in our ability to continue to grow over the long term. We have a still underpenetrated market. We have improving transportation infrastructure. And we, Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, have a uniquely differentiated portfolio of properties and product offering in Macao.  Now moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We had another strong quarter at Marina Bay Sands, but to the surprise of some analysts who [indiscernible] last night that said we were going to earn only $333 million, we had another strong quarter, with adjusted property EBITDA of $415 million, while hold-normalized EBITDA was USD 371 million. Despite a 22% decline in rolling volumes, our hold-normalized EBITDA was down by only 2% year-on-year. On a constant currency basis, our hold-normalized EBITDA was up 3%. I think this again just demonstrates the quality and resilience of the cash flow generation at Marina Bay Sands.  I'm extremely pleased to say that our strong financial results confirm that we have an outstanding business there. To quote Mark Twain, \"The rumors of Singapore's demise as a world-class integrated resort destination are both greatly exaggerated and certainly premature.\" Mass win per day was USD 4.7 million, up 1% year-on-year. Again, when adjusted for the currency effect, our mass win per day in Singapore dollar terms was actually up by 6%, principally driven by our successful efforts in bringing in foreign premium mass customers to Singapore, particularly in the Non-Rolling tables segment. Q1 was, in fact, the all-time quarterly record in mass win per day in Singapore dollars.  In addition, we have maintained a prudent reserve ratio during the quarter, and we will continue to maintain the highest compliance standards in the industry not only in Singapore but globally.  Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large-scale integrated resort developments. The iconic appeal of Marina Bay Sands has driven strong growth in visitation from residents of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, the wider Asian region and around the world to Marina Bay Sands and Singapore. We remain focused on potential development opportunities in Japan, also Korea and Vietnam. We believe our unique convention-based Integrated Resort development model could bring meaningful benefits to those countries in terms of business and leisure tourism, employment and economic growth.  Let me also touch on Las Vegas. I want to welcome George Markantonis as our new Property President for The Venetian and Palazzo as well as the Sands Expo in Las Vegas. We believe there is significant opportunity to improve our performance here in Las Vegas, and George is going to be an integral part of that effort. Now on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders. The confidence we have in the strength of our business and the reliability and predictability of our cash flows have allowed us to progressively increase the return of capital to shareholders. Ours remains a uniquely privileged business model. We can continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks while retaining more than sufficient financial strength to pursue both organic growth and new development opportunities.  Over the last 13 quarters through March 31, 2015, we've returned nearly USD 10.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, including USD 8.6 billion to Las Vegas Sands shareholders and in Hong Kong dollars the equivalent of over USD 1.85 billion to the shareholders of Sands China. For 2015, as previously announced, the Board of Directors has increased the LVS dividend by 30% to $2.60 per year or $0.65 per quarter. The increase in the dividend will take place with the next quarterly dividend payment, which will be made on June 30. We have every intention of increasing the dividend in the years ahead as our business and cash flows grow.  We have approximately USD 1.76 billion remaining under our current stock buyback authorization. While we did not repurchase any stock in the most recent quarter, we most certainly look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buyback program to return capital to shareholders as we have excess capital to return in the future and to enhance long-term shareholder value returns. In conclusion, we will continue to stay disciplined and execute our business plan. With the right strategy and the right management team in place, I'm more confident than ever on our future success.  Now -- let's now take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : The margins -- I have a question for you on the margins in Macao, so it's a couple of one-part questions. If the margin in Macao were below what we were forecasting, and we completely get and understand that Macao is presently very challenging. Were there any onetime expenses such as a large bump in the provision for doubtful accounts or maybe expenses that you would describe as yield experimenting where you were trying to optimize revenue mix that maybe didn't work out that maybe aren't there going forward? In other words, do you think margins are sustainable for here -- from here? And what can you do to manage or reduce controllable expenses in this environment? Robert Goldstein : George, it's Rob. I think, as you know, market changes in Macao have been sudden and dramatic. I mean, 6 months because this was a high-growth market, and now, obviously, it's down as much as 40%. And our business in Macao is not just the biggest in the market in terms of financial profit and number of employees but also the most complex and multidimensional. We are strong believers in the long-term outlook in Macao. We welcome some of the structural changes taking place that will help make it a more sustainable, healthier market over time. And we are going to stay invested in Macao for the long term, and therefore, make some adjustments to our business and there's a cost and efficiencies. We have to balance multiple constituencies, be fair to our employees, support to government of Macao and making Macao into a world-class destination, also satisfy the shareholders. Now we've invested so much in human resources and operating capability in many business lines, not just gaming but hotel, entertainment, retail, F&B, MICE. So we're trying not to have a quick short-term knee-jerk reaction and make a careful assessment of what's right for the business long term. So when you invest and develop all these non-gaming businesses on a large scale, you do incur more fixed costs than our competitors, and we believe this is the right thing to do in the long term. And that being said, we have to assume, for the time being, that we know we're covering gaming for the balance of this year and we have to make some tough decisions in the next 6 to 12 months to improve margins. That being said, there's nothing in particular for this quarter. We're somewhat hoping for a little more recovery in the top line. We continue to assess the opportunities on the cost side and to improve our business. We did, as you know -- we will single out on the junket situation. We don't -- we're the only people in town not doing phone betting, which did hurt us somewhat, I think, in the junket segment. Otherwise, it was business as usual, and we're trying to navigate our way towards a very different market than 6 months ago. Joseph Greff : Okay. And then my second question -- go ahead, Sheldon. Sheldon Adelson : It looks to me like in the first 3 months of the year, like the figure 39% sticks out. And if it's consistent over 3 months and it continues another couple of months, it would not be unreasonable for somebody to conclude that a bottom has been reached. Now I can't say that, that's the case because, as I said, we're sailing in unchartered waters. And I hope we don't sink like that boat off in the Mediterranean. Robert Goldstein : We're not sinking. Sheldon Adelson : I just got a new boat. I don't want to... Daniel Briggs : The final -- the comment on that -- the margin... Sheldon Adelson : It kind of looks to me like we've hit bottom. I mean, it's not so erratic that it goes like from 30% down to 50% down. It's staying within the 39%, 40% range. So it gives me a more comfortable feeling that this is -- this should be the turnaround point. But then again, I'm not the analyst. Daniel Briggs : And your mass business also, between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, had consistent margins just below 40%. Robert Goldstein : The quarter-on-quarter, George, just to clarify, had 2 big -- we have percentage rent, obviously, in the fourth quarter that was impactful [ph], about $40 million and [indiscernible] adjusts about $40 million. So Q-on-Q, we're down about 15%, 16% Q1 '15 to Q4 '14. Daniel Briggs : In EBITDA. Robert Goldstein : Yes. Joseph Greff : Got it. And then my follow-up question relates to the dividend in the U.S. If we're at this level of quarterly Macao EBITDA generation of $530 million or something lower, do you have any qualms levering up your balance sheet because [indiscernible] outside Macao, obviously, to sustain [ph] the current U.S. dividend of $2.60? And what will be the next net leverage level that you would be comfortable living with for some period of time? And that's it for me. Sheldon Adelson : It all depends on who you're asking. Joseph Greff : I'm asking you, Sheldon. Sheldon Adelson : My level of confidence tends to about 0.1%, but I know that, that's not according to all the financial engineers listening to me that I would probably feel comfortable at 2.5, 2.5x. But I think -- I just have a feeling that perhaps we might see an emerging market pop though the clouds and during a time of weather when we could use it. So I'd rather not go out and borrow money now because if in the near future, which could be 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, we could use a few billion dollars, I'd rather keep our powder dry for that. If, however, it seems that interest rates are going to jump through the roof, in one quantum leap, we may reconsider and do something before the rates go up too high. So it's -- that's an answer, and that's not an answer, but that's what's thinking in my mind. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Oh from CLSA. Jon Oh : A question on the cost again and I guess the margins in Macao. As you think about this cost restrain or this curtailing effort that you guys are embarking on for the remainder of this year, could you help us understand the priority of cost that you'd be taking out, especially as it relates to fixed costs versus variable costs? And how should I be thinking and how should I be modeling the priorities of taking out player reinvestment? How much can you curtail that? How do we think about labor? And how do we think about just general OpEx? And what headroom have you got? Just for me to better understand how much cost can really be extracted to be in tandem with how fast revenue is going to fall in. Sheldon Adelson : Jon, if we're going to tell you how to do your figuring. I'm going to make a claim for your pay, including bonus. Robert Goldstein : All right, Jon. So Jon, obviously, we -- the biggest number in Macao which no one can impact these taxes paid on gaming revenues off the table, clearly. Second thing will be direct incentives paid to customers. That's where there's opportunity, I think, across the market, to be more judicious not just in our stores but across the market. As you know, they're -- we're very protective of our Macanese labor force and very respectful of our employees. We've built a great employee base, and we don't want to hurt that. If people leave us on their own volition, that's one thing, but we're going to work very hard to ensure our employees are well taken care of and well cared for. So that's off the table. What's on the table is our other costs, not direct against the employee but perhaps other structural costs as well as costs in the marketing side. As you know, we've been the leaders, and we've run more entertainment, more boxing, more everything than everyone else combined in Macao, everyone. As Sheldon alluded to, it's very popular to talk about the non-gaming spend. Well, this company has spent more than anybody and more than everybody combined. So we're reexamining that and trying to figure out how do we put our best foot forward, maintain the importance of having headline entertainment, having boxing, having all these important events we've spearheaded and we've led in the Cotai Strip, our CotaiArena, and balance that with the margins you allude to. We're very keen to do 2 things : run our business intelligently for the short and long term. So we're reexamining every nickel and dime we spend, both on direct incentives to customers, marketing incentives to the market itself. CapEx is on the table. We've actually pulled back some of our expenses on things that we weren't -- were not critical to our growth. And so everything's on the table. We'd love to see a return to a better day in Macao on the top line, but we don't see that short term. And so short term, we're thinking about expense control. But as you know, probably the biggest controllable expense would be reinvest in the customer and reinvest in the general market in terms of the arena and the advertising spend, et cetera. We're running a very, very multifaceted, diverse business in Macao, much more so than other people. And so it's more complex to control this -- curtail and control the spending. Again, we don't -- we believe in long-term Macao very, very much. We don't want to do something foolish in the short term to make an extra point or 2. Our balance sheet is stellar. Our ability to run our business is stellar. Our confidence level in Macao is very high, and we believe we're resurrecting the top line. So while we'd like to report better numbers this quarter and next and beyond that. We have a long-term commitment to this market and a long-term belief that we'll resurrect. Jon Oh : Okay, that's helpful. And if I can follow up with a broader question and maybe something that is more positive. As you look at the policies that we've seen in China, this is a more broader macro point of view that I'd like to get from you guys. We've seen several key measures coming out of Beijing that kind of speaks to easing and one that is looking to stimulate China, both monetary and also fiscal policies. And we've seen that even as recent as a couple of weeks ago where the stock exchange restrictions in Hong Kong and China have been kind of eased. Do you think that with this sustained economic stimulus and also the fiscal stimulus that China is embarking, how do you think that plays out to your business? Are you sensing that perhaps there will be a translation effect? And how would you think about what it means to the outlook for maybe the rest of this year and also for next year? Sheldon Adelson : He's Chinese, he ought to tell us? Last time I looked, Jon, you look Chinese. I'd looked at Goldstein, he looked like a Philadelphia [indiscernible]. Robert Goldstein : Well, I'll tell you, Jon, we do believe there's a lot of demand -- pent-up demand that wants to come to Macao, once the external factors are decided by the government, that demand will resurrect. I'm a firm believer, being there last week and seeing the amount of people in The Venetian, the body count and visitation, there is pent-up demand. People want to gamble and come to Macao and shop and eat and sleep overnight. I just believe this market has demand. It has lots of demand. It just needs a few things to turn our way, to turn the faucet back on a bit. But that's beyond our control. And we support the government in their attitude, in their measures, and we'll wait respectfully for a better day. Sheldon Adelson : I was there with Rob and Patrick last week, almost for the whole week. We left on Sunday. And I have to tell you, I started to walk through 2 quadrants of The Venetian casino, it was unbelievable. I'd never seen it so crowded since we built it in 2007, in 8 years. I haven't seen any of our properties crowded as it was. Frankly, I had to have my security guys push a way through, so that I could get through. It was the busiest and most crowded I've ever seen. Of course, that was in the mass market [ph]. Robert Goldstein : Yes, pure mass, yes. Sheldon Adelson : Pure mass. Robert Goldstein : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Maybe to build on the last question about policies. One thing that seems like popped up more recently was some discussion around a possible visitation cap. And I think, Sheldon, you referred to that in some of your prepared remarks. So I guess my question is twofold. First of all, do you think that Macao will actually look to cap visitors to the market overall? And how do you think that would be enforced? And second of all, why do you think that they would do this if it actually is going to be put in place or you thinking it might? Because we've had a lot of investor kind of curiosity as to why this would make sense with the backdrop of so much of supply coming online here. Sheldon Adelson : Well, I'd like to give you my own personal opinion. I think the chances of that happening are that I wake up tomorrow morning and all my hair will be grown back by 9 :00. There's no chance in my mind whatsoever. I've talked to various members of the government, and they have said that, that's the opinion of one man who sincerely and with very good intentions believed that something like that may be good. When I discussed with him and his staff about how it could be done, there is no indication that any of it could be done. For instance, I said, \"You could do it very easily. Just put a time limit on the opening hours of the Gonbei gate and then refer everybody to the Lotus gate, the Lotus Bridge and Lotus gate coming in.\" In that way, you take them off of the Peninsula, where the vast majority of the local population is, and you shift them to the Adelson-created Cotai Strip that you put them in one hotel and they're -- I mean, they'll go with our soon-to-be 13,000 hotel rooms, they'll never -- and close to 1,000 retail shops, they'll never have to leave, with probably 100-plus restaurants and very good ones, too. The -- every time I come back, I got to go on a diet for the good food in Macao. There's no question. So everybody will go into -- if you leave them off in Cotai, they'll stay in Cotai, and that's the whole purpose. It will eliminate a lot of the buses. It'll eliminate a lot of the traffic, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And when the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge opens, and I am told from my conversations with some people who know better than I do last week, that it's not going to delay until 2020, that it opens sometime between '16 and '17. I don't know. I don't know that for sure, just what somebody's opinion was. So on the issue of capping, I have been told that it is not a decision by the government. It's only a suggestion by one of the ministers with very good intentions, but it had been thought out. And I told him that with my 42 years of experience in the MICE industry, that it's my opinion that if -- that I would never, as an organizer, book an event in Macao if I knew there was a possibility that the guy who came through the gate before me was the last guy, the 21,000,000th person to go through, and too bad, I was one extra guy, and I couldn't get in. So that can't be an exhibitor, an exhibitor staff, the President of an exhibiting company or a big buyer that wants to come in and buy something from the trade show or the group. So I think although it comes with good intentions, and there may even be -- I also told him, \"There may be some rationale, but it's not doable. It's just not doable.\" So you'd have to take -- let's see, would you run from January 1 and let everybody in until you hit 21 million people? Or why don't we take 21 million, divide it by 365, and it comes out to 57,000. So every day, at 57,000, we just shut the gate. I mean, it's just impossible. So I am surprised that some people that are listening to this, although, I mean, it comes from a very reliable source. It is not the position of the Macao government at this time. It's a suggestion of an individual minister, again, I say, with good intentions and trying to do a good job. But from my standpoint as a MICE operator, all the MICE in Macao will collapse, and they won't let that happen. Shaun Kelley : That's very clear and appreciate that. And I guess, my follow-up on a slightly different subject would just be I think, Rob, you alluded to possibly some CapEx shifting and changing of priorities. It looked like in the schedule that you guys gave in the slide deck, that you had pushed out some of the timing around The Parisian CapEx. So can you just elaborate on that a little bit? Does that -- are you planning on changing the opening timeline there? Or what's just the latest update on when you think The Parisian is going to open. Robert Goldstein : Two things, Shaun. One is we are examining all our CapEx, non-Parisian, Parisian, just reconsider what makes sense in this environment, be it room renovations, what type of renovations, retail, restaurants. Everything is under consideration because we are trying to be more prudent and think about the market as it's changing. As far as The Parisian, we're still looking at that being late 2016, but it depends on labor and allocations. That could increase depending [indiscernible]. When we were there last week, we were under consideration for additional labor. And they could move up depending on the government's decision on labor allocation to us. I get the sense we may get a boost in terms of labor allocation. It hasn't been confirmed yet, but that would change. The date could move between late summer of '16 all the way to the Thanksgiving period in November of '16, depending on the government's decision on labor allocation. Sheldon Adelson : It could be as early as late spring, early summer. Robert Goldstein : We requested more labor, and we seemed to get a favorable response. Though [ph] no final determination has been made as of today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : A couple of questions on occupancy. So it was down significantly in the quarter in Macao, and you highlighted that it was better than the market. But I noticed that I got some promotions for retail visitors to come. And depending on their spend at the mall, they could get a free room. Is that an opportunity that you guys can assess -- or access going forward? Is this something that occupancy has gone down for the past 2 quarters, but it could -- you could start to do more and get some traction there? And then also, just in Singapore, I noticed there was a significant decline in occupancy. Can you just talk about what was going on there, too? Sheldon Adelson : Sure. I -- the -- I don't think that's a hotel promotion. It sounds to me like it's a promotion from the retail mall. We don't market the mall that way. We've never done it since we opened here in 1999. We don't say, \"You buy a lot in the retail mall and we'll give you a free room.\" It doesn't -- that's like a bank getting frequent flyer points from somebody else and then -- other than airlines. So if you ride buses, you get frequent flyer points on one of the airlines. We don't do that, and I suspect that, as I said, that, that is a promotion from the mall itself. Robert Goldstein : A couple of thoughts on your comments. First of all, we agree that the occupancy has fallen a bit in Macao. And so when you think about Macao, we were the only people in that market selling cash rooms for the last couple of years. The rest of the market, basically comped off 90% because of the demand for casino guests who gave you a high enough return on that room. Now that's changed dramatically. The market's now selling rooms. A lot of people are selling rooms due to the junket, rate reduction, and obviously, the premium mass reduction. So -- whereas some companies were, including us, were comping aggressively to people with theoretical losses at 3x and 4x and 5x the price of the room, that's changed. So there's more competition for the cash dollar on the room side. Having said that, we still think structurally, our room advantage is huge. If we can get back in the 90s, which is our goal, we -- to your point about retail, we are trying to marry more of our retail advertising to the room customer. The thinking there is that we focused a lot on other parts of the resort, yet we find out that shopping ranks very, very high in the consumers' things they want to do when they reach Macao. We have, as Sheldon alluded to, hundreds and hundreds of stores of all price points, ranging from the lowest to the Chanels of the world. And so our range is huge. The shopping advantage, we think, under one roof with our food, our shopping, our gaming, and of course, our sleeping rooms, it's a unique opportunity to blend them all together and to promote -- get more occupancy. So one, the business has fallen in Macao because there's more people chasing the cash customer. We're not alone in that space anymore. Two, we think the opportunity to blend retail to the overall offering of the resort is wonderful because in -- we find that when people sleep in our hotel, they do shop more in our hotels, and of course, gamble more in our hotels. Sheldon Adelson : And eat more. Robert Goldstein : And eat more, yes, stuff like that, well, especially us. I'm not sure of the customers. They look awful thin. We don't look so thin. On the Singapore side -- well, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it. Singapore, you're right. Our occupancy fell a bit, and it's a combination of 2 things. One, there's a currency issue there. You'll note that we mentioned the $4.7 million a day casino win on the Non-Rolling slot ETG, our best quarter ever. But its currency effect is more like $5 million or $5 million a day. We had a really great quarter. Same thing happened, though, on the rooms side. We got hurt somewhat by the currency impact. That hurt us on the rate. As far as occupancy, we had fall off a bit. As you can tell about our diminished rolling numbers, Tom, as we were off in the rolling business, I think, 22%. And so our ADR is driven somewhat. Like all high-end casinos, we sell rooms to our casino at very high rates. The suites go for up to $10,000 a night in Singapore. They're massive suites. When that customer doesn't come, we lose some rate and some occupancy at the very top tier of the market. As you know, our hotel is still the exemplary hotel probably in all of Asia as far as iconic architecture, et cetera. The place still does tremendous well. We did have an off, I think, quarter in terms of occupancy and rate. I think that will resurrect in terms of the -- as things get healthier with the high-end Chinese business. But you're absolutely right in those comments, and that's an issue for us to deal with in Singapore, along with the currency issue that continues to be weak against the U.S. dollar. Sheldon Adelson : [indiscernible] and because the Singapore dollar was up at $1.37 plus, almost $1.38, I just look at my calculator, my smartphone here, which is clearly smarter than I am. I just looked at it. It's at $1.34. So some of the articles in the business section of The Straits Times, and the local newspapers say that it's the -- some of the Malaysian and Indonesian visitors have slowed down a little bit because the Singapore dollar in relation to the Malaysian and Indonesian currency is a little discouraging for them. But I think it's going to turn around. Everything is cyclical. Everything is cyclical. And I never hedge because I'm quite certain. And it's been going that way for me most of my life, except when I was in grammar school, that currency, if it goes one way, it's going the other way. So we don't -- I don't take -- I don't get nervous or depressed or upset about currency volatility because -- and at least in Singapore, it's a very, very stable currency. Robert Goldstein : So [indiscernible], do we still have the highest ADR in the Singapore market, I think, by far. Thomas Allen : Okay. And then just as my follow-up, just on capital returns. I mean, you have almost $2.5 billion of cash. I guess just bigger picture, why didn't you buy back any stock during the quarter? And in the past, you said you were going to do about $75 million a month. Is that -- has that gone away? Daniel Briggs : I think we're going to be opportunistic in the way that we repurchase shares in the future. I think we're looking to protect the dividend in such a way we view it as a permanent obligation. So it's something we want to be able to grow substantially in the future. You heard the Chairman earlier in the call saying that in his view we'll grow it at least 10% per annum for the next 3 years. So as a goal, we'd like to do more than that. I think we're accumulating cash and evaluating the market to make sure that we have the capital to do what we want to do. So I think we'll continue to use share repurchases as a way to return capital to shareholders in the future. This quarter, we chose not to. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Sheldon, you provided some color earlier in terms of what the floor looked like at Venetian. And now when looking at the industry data and seeing kind of the last 3 months of occupied room nights or hotel guests being down mid to high single digits, and obviously, some months are distorted given comps. But when you think about what was once a VIP issue trickling down and apparently showing up in the mass business a little bit more, how do you guys get comfortable with adding hotel room supply? And how do you kind of view the amount of hotel rooms that are coming to Cotai over the next several years? Sheldon Adelson : Well, first, I'll say that none of the hotels are even approaching where we are. Most of the hotels are somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000. The 1,500 to 1,700 or 1,800, we're doing over 3,000. And we've asked the government, as you might have read some of the press clippings lately, I've asked the government for another 2,500 non-gaming hotel. Look, this has been my philosophy right from the beginning. If you build critical mass, they will come. You could take a spot in the middle of a desert or on the seashore, and you build a city and people are going to come. The validation of that belief is something called Cotai Strip. Everybody said, \"You're crazy. All of the activity is on the Peninsula in Macao, and nobody's going to go out there.\" I'm of the conviction. Now look, everybody is building every -- each one of the concessionaires are building. And the small, sublicensed operators that were sublicenses from Stanley Ho and -- which is now operated under SJM, they're not building. They don't have any land, and they won't build in Cotai. And Cotai will be like I said right from the beginning. I compared the Las Vegas Strip to the downtown Las Vegas, and that's what it's turning out to be, the Cotai Strip versus The Peninsula. And so they're not going to move out to where we are. And our critical mass is going to carry the day. I don't know about it. I never heard people say, \"It's a must-see to go to StarWorld, or to go to the Waldo, or to go to any one of our competitors.\" What I do hear everybody say, \"When you go to Macao, you've got to go see The Venetian.\" And that [indiscernible] because it's the critical mass of hotel rooms, of tables, of restaurants, of MICE facilities, of shopping, et cetera, et cetera. If there are 2 words would ever apply to Sheldon Adelson, it won't be hey you. It'll be critical mass. Operator : As we have reached the allotted time for today's call, we will be taking one final question, which comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. I know you commented a little bit on why you didn't do share repurchase in the quarter. But I wonder if you could just give a little bit more forward-looking color in terms of in your commitment to raise the dividend, does that mean we shouldn't expect share repurchase maybe for the next couple of quarters? Sheldon Adelson : No, no. It has nothing to do with anything. We have an enormous amount of cash flow, probably, I don't know, as much as the other U.S. companies combined. And I think that in Macao, we bottomed out, as you've heard my own opinion. But I can't guarantee that, of course. And I just have a -- it's not a dream, but I just have a good feeling. I've got the vibes, let's say, that I think one of these emerging markets are going to open up soon. So I want to make sure that we have enough money. And as you've heard me say before, I'm risk averse. And I don't want to [indiscernible]. I'd rather keep our powder dry for the time being, but it may be opportunistic to go in tomorrow. We are not excluding any of this. It depends what signs we see. And my interests are in line with yours, and I own 54% of the company. Your interests are aligned with mine. I love dividends. That's my yay dividends statement. It's yay stock buyback as well. But we can't do all of it. We can't do special dividends, regular dividends constantly increasing and stock buybacks. And we could throw money out the window. We could do that. But I -- we'll try to do everything because when I'm sitting in the board meeting and having a discussion about it, although I don't take a vote, that's only from an ethical viewpoint, ethical and moral viewpoint. Everybody else knows how I feel. They're looking at me and say, \"This guy at the end of the table owns 54% of the company. You think he wants an increased dividend or he wants us to buy some stock back.\" Okay. I think that it's been fun. It's been good to answer all of your questions and to talk to you and to think about where our company is going. I just want to point something out to you. I haven't sold a share, not since the last time I said that. And there is nothing in my thinking that has changed at all, and I have no intention of selling any shares in the foreseeable future. Okay. And at my age, I've got a long view forward. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Jon Oh - CLSA Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good afternoon.

Finally, for those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone the opportunity to participate. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased we continue to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter and despite the continuing challenges in the Macao market, we delivered a solid set of financial results with companywide adjusted property EBITDA reaching $1.02 billion. At the same time we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. It has always been clear to me that our unique MICE-based integrated resort business model positively differentiates us from our competitors. In terms of both financial performance and economic contribution to our host jurisdiction, during the quarter was not surprising to see our company weather the cyclical downturn in Macao better than the industry overall. Our EBITDA in Macao grew sequentially by 6%. Against a backup of double-digit market revenue decline new competition in general wage inflation. Our Macao operations managed to improve the EBITDA and profit margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In addition, our gaming revenue market share in Macao reached 24.6 for the quarter, our highest market share in any quarter since quarter one of 2009. In Singapore, our Marina Bay Sands delivered another record quarter in mass gaming win-per-day when measured in Singapore dollar.  At the heart of our company's success, is having the right strategy at the outset. We have the courage of our convictions to build early and aggressively. We developed critical mass to scale and diversification and we offer products and amenities that are best positioned to capture long-term tourism and consumption growth in Asia.  I remained steadfast to my belief that we will grow and prosper in the long-term, while continuing to contribute to the economic development of our host jurisdictions. Our industry leading financial strength enables us to stay fully committed to our markets, our development plans and the return of capital to shareholders. We remain confident that our recurring dividends will increase in the years ahead as the Macao market and our cash flow grows. Now let me take you through some of the operating highlights of our results for Macao for the quarter. In quarter two, Sands China EBITDA was $564 million. This represents a decline of 29% over the prior year, but a 6% sequential increase over the prior quarter. Sorry, you guys who projected we would come in 50 million less than consensus.  Furthermore, our EBITDA margin at our Macao properties improved by 200 basis points sequentially to 32.2%, primarily reflecting strong gains and cost efficiencies, which more than offset the impact of wage inflation. Hold-normalized EBITDA margin also improved sequentially by 150 basis points to 31.7%. In the base mass segment we continued to benefit from the scale of our hotel room inventory, the diversity of our product offering and the attraction of the Venetian as Macao\u2019s must see destination. I'm also pleased that we managed to achieve market share gains while being disciplined and judicious in our casino reinvestment expenses. Rob will get into more details in the discussion later.  In VIP gaming the strength of our premium direct business has offset some -- a lot of the weakness in the junket segment and enabled us to outperform the Macao VIP market. Our premium direct growing volumes were 3% quarter-on-quarter resulting in our overall growing volumes declining by 10% sequentially versus the 15% decline in Macao's VIP junket volumes.  We also experienced strong growth in retail on revenues. Based on the latest published customers statistics overall Macao market hotel occupancy the period January to May of 2015 was 79% a decline of 8 percentage points compared to 2014. This decline in occupancy was principally related to the decrease in casino room occupancy across the market particularly in the junket segment. Sands China's hotel occupancy for the same period was 4 percentage points higher than that at the Macao market at 83% and our occupancy decline of 6 percentage points also outperformed the market.  The scale of our hotel room inventory remains one of our key strategic advantages. It allows us to target higher value overnight visitors from Greater China and the rest of Asia and to grow the base of high value visitors from Macao.  With the completion of the St. Regis and the Parisian, we will have almost 13,000 hotel rooms in four interconnected resorts. Over 840 stores plus four shopping malls with the potential to add several hundreds more stores in future development phases, subject to government approval. 2 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space and four performance and event venues including our Venetian Cotai Arena which can be utilized as for our MICE business or major entertainment events.  We have the room inventory, the resort content, the iconic must-see destination and the operating experience in growing overnight visitor market in Macao. We remained fully committed to playing the pioneering role in Macao transforming and to the world's leading business leisure tourism destination. Our track record in being transformative pioneers in MICE, retail, and entertainment speaks for itself. Now moving on Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We delivered another solid quarter in Marina Bay Sands which despite the impact of the strong U.S. dollar generated adjusted property EBITDA of US$363 million, despite a 9% decline in enrolling volumes our hold-normalized EBITDA was down by only 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis our hold-normalized EBITDA was up 6%. I think this again demonstrates the quality and resilience of the cash flow generations at Marina Bay Sands. Mass win in Singapore -- mass win for us in Singapore, per day was US$4.7 million, up 1% year on year. Again when adjusted for the currency effect our mass win-per-day in Singapore dollar terms was actually up by 9%, principally driven by our successful efforts and bringing in foreign premium mass customers to Singapore.  We set another all-time quarterly record in mass win-per-day in Singapore dollars. In addition, we have maintained a prudent reserve ratio during the quarter and we will continue to maintain the highest compliant standards in the industry not only in Singapore but globally. Marina Bay Sands continues to service as the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large scale MICE-based integrated resort developments. On our MICE-based integrated reserve business model allows us to meaningfully contribute to the long term economic success of our host jurisdictions. Something we are both eager and uniquely well positioned to replicate in new markets. Las Vegas enjoyed strong gaming volumes, but low hold impacted our reported result. Bethlehem continue for growing delivered a second calendar quarter record EBITDA performance. Now on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders. Let me be clear, we remain committed to the maintenance of our generously recurring dividend programs and we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flow grows. Our industry leading cash flows and balance sheet strength enable us to continue our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China while retaining more than sufficient financial resources to invest for future growth and pursue new development opportunities. We brought back 65 million of stocks in the most recent quarter. We have approximately US$1.7 billion remaining under our current stock buyback authorization and we look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buyback program to return excess capital to the shareholders and to enhance long term shareholder value. In conclusion we will continue to stay discipline and execute our business plan I am today more confidence than ever about our future success. Now let's take some questions. Daniel Briggs : Operator we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions. Sheldon in your prepared remarks and also in the press release you refer to efficiencies that you guys have been able to take advantage to help your margins and some of the flow through. Question is both for your Sheldon and for you Rob you talked in the past about some of the financial flexibility that you had to on cut cost. Can you just talk about some of the things that you did in the quarter and as you kind of look at the different scenarios for the market going forward, what kind of programs can you employ to continue to cut cost and basically to offset some of the cost pressures that you're seeing in the market, particularly in labor. Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Yes Felicia, its Rob, our team at Macao I think has done a really good job of addressing cost across the board. And of course there is always an opportunity to cut more cost but we have the balance that with our employees merit development and our long term plans to excel at Macao. We don\u2019t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. So a lot of cost related to marketing spend, cost against customer spend and then general cost, as we have the labor -- non-macanese labor for most part and keep mind that we are burden somewhat with having a very, very strong team in place already for the opening of the Parisian which will be very beneficial. Next year we open the Parisian and we care a lot of -- especially casino side most of our teams in place has been in place so well. So, the majority of the cost of this quarter related to promotional spend, marketing spend, some labor cost. I don\u2019t expect to see this continue in terms of cutting additional cost in any kind of material way, we\u2019ll just remain disciplined. I would add also fortunately the markets remained disciplined does how it spends money against the customers promotionally. We\u2019re very pleased with the quarter, we want to maintain the margins we did I think for the quarterly which came in just under 32%, which is very acceptable to us especially in this very difficult time in the Macao, We\u2019re was hoping for a GGR increase and even better margins in the future. Felicia Hendrix : Thanks. And then just as a follow up question Sheldon gave dividends and you just talked about your commitment to that returns to shareholders and also potentially raising the dividend. Just as you think about the difficult environment and you look at you different scenarios, what kind of scenarios are you using to underwrite your current decision or your current commitment to raising the dividends? Sheldon Adelson : Before we announced in the last and this call that we are going to -- we intend it to raise the dividend in the future. We did a very thorough cash flow and we looked at all the sensitivities that could affect it. What they market I think is missing, didn\u2019t miss to miss it, but we haven\u2019t heard very much about it lately, is that we have built -- we created the integrated resort, MICE-based business model and the critical of the components that make up an integrated resorts is something that the competitors don\u2019t have and we will say that, well I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there were several instances in which we outperformed the market. I was tempted to interrupt, but I knew somebody would ask this question while I was reading and but what I'm saying is that the critical mass, the -- our perception and not just to call this words and say we are an integrated resort, I remember when we put all the components of attraction and entertainment together on the strip everybody called themselves the Mega-Resorts because they were big. But people were forgetting that critical mass must see interactions. The very broad mixture of the various and in the debts of each of the integrated resort components is what assures us that we are going to continue. Why all of a sudden have we jumped in the whole quarter into first place? SJM has got 25 to 30 somewhat gaming licenses out there, brining money into them and why is it that we've always been number one in EBITDA and that is not going to change. The other guys can\u2019t catch up to us, that train has left the station. When I first in vision the idea of Cotai Strip other people criticized me and said it\u2019s never going to work and now everybody is cutting off their arms to get into Cotai. So my answer to you is, we are different we originally envision the difference, we built the difference, we continue to maintain and improve that difference. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon everybody. My first question relates to Macao margins obviously better than expected 150 basis points of sequential improvement on a normalized basis. You mentioned in earnings release that\u2019s a function strong cost discipline, Rob can you help us understand what specific cost you are taking out or is it really just a more favorable mix that's spitting out a better margin, and if it is the function of taking out to specific hart, how much did you get out on sort of run rate basis in the 2Q that we can actually tangibly see going forward from here? And then I have a follow up. Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Well Joe across to all -- you can\u2019t get these kind of cost out in one specific area, there is labor cost in there, mostly non-macanese. There is some direct marketing cost against the customer, there is cost against general marketing spend. We are looking at every aspect of our business and again just trying to be disciplined and not cut out the muscles, just cut out the fat, and were also being -- trying to look forward, the fact we planned in Macao for many years to come, and we want to maintain a great approach with a great environment for the employees and for the customers. So, It\u2019s really is not one specific area, it\u2019s general marketing, direct marketing cost, labor cost, anywhere and everywhere we see excess spend that we thing is irrelevant and it will continue to be that way. We\u2019re not done, but I think we've done very good, the team there has been very disciplined, very focused, we understand it\u2019s a harsh new environment we're operating in, we have to maintain margin and to grow EBITDA we have to do this. You see this in the first quarter, obviously, our spend is just improving, our spend against the customer, our spend against the employee, everything. So there is not one specific area, it\u2019s across the board Joe and it won't stop here. We'll just keep looking at it, but again the bigger term picture you have to think long-term to maintain our leadership position specifically vis-\u00e0-vis the employee and the customer. We can't be short sighted and just cut cost to the cut cost. Joe Greff : Thanks Rob, and then one of the things I found interesting in your earning slide deck on Slide 14 was that, the base mass revenue was down sequentially more than the premium mass revenue was in a sequential basis. I would have otherwise thought it would have been the reserve, can you help understand that and I know you talked a little bit about success on the direct side of things under VIP, does that impacting the premium there? Rob Goldstein : Yes, we actually had some junket space that -- physically we convert some junket space in the plaza, for example, over to the premium mass. We\u2019ve had some success going direct to the customer in the premium mass side, the Plaza has had its very good quarter, and we'll continue that, make that transition. As the junket we can softened in some cases, leave us. We're making that transition. So we're getting more revenues out of that premium mass side and premium direct side that we had in the past and I think it is a positive to this, hoping some strength in the junket space but hasn't been there. So I think our success bared and also we've controlled the margin against that premium mass and premium direct customer and that's been part of the reason why the Plaza performed so well this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Oh from CLSA. Your line is open. Jon Oh : I'll start with a follow-up on Rob's point on cost earlier, as you think about the cost cut and I think you've alluded to a sustained -- or least a sustainable cost that going forward in the future, how do we think about the new competition that has come up, we had galaxy opening in May, we've got couple of more properties opening maybe over the next 9 months or so, how much of the cost have you taken out specially as it relates to general marketing, do you think it could be something that you may want to maybe exercise some restrain to stay competitive, due to your point about you want to be relevant in the long run. I\u2019m just trying to map out how do we think about the sustainability of what you've taken out in the second quarter and how do we extrapolate that over next four quarters or so? Sheldon Adelson : I would like to point out to you the number of years of experience between Rob and myself and others in this industry and the number of years of experience of other people actually sitting in the hot seat and making hot decisions. Galaxy made an enormous mistake. The other companies will make big mistakes. They're already making big mistakes. Now don't ask me what they are because I don't want to create another Houdini. Houdini doesn't tell his secretes and LVS' and SCL [ph] are not going to tell its secretes. Now they can't -- they're going to throw properties onto the markets. But if you look at the fact that -- take for instance galaxy one, they would never end the business before at all. So they have little experience -- cumulative experience in their executive ranks, and two, to back up their strategic judgments. SGM has been a -- [indiscernible] has been a monopolist for decades. I don't see that they have the ability, they're not used to living in a competitive environment all over, and it\u2019s the same thing by the way with [indiscernible] in Singapore. They never worked in the competitive environment. We never worked in anything but a competitive environment. So you take Lawrence Fo [ph] very bright guy, very nice man, he's done a good job starting off slow, picked up so then Galaxy\u2019s standing outflow picked up, but at one point you got to something besides opening the doors. And Whin [ph] is used to competing but he is specialized as we all know, he has specialized and done an excellent job in the high end of the market. And what's the last one MGM, MGM the only thing they have ever developed was City Center and for those of us in the United States, particularly those of us who live here in Vegas it doesn't need any further comments. So from our standpoint, we are very pleased we've worked in competitive environments all of our life. We have been never, not worked in a competitive environment. So we know what it takes and I can tell you the mistakes that have been made, as I don't want to go into them and make it public because I don't want to stop them from making mistakes in the future, after all we are competitors. But other people are making mistakes we're not making the same mistakes. We're sticking -- we\u2019re staying the course, we're sticking to our critical mass. A very broad, a very in-depth entertainment and consumer attraction component of the Integrated Resort model which we claim we have started, we\u2019re the pioneer if it. Rob Goldstein : The diversity of the room product we have and the price points we have and the manors we have that given us a terrific advantage in this market. We have 9,000 keys and the Parisian will bring 3,000 more and then the Saint Regis, one thing is happening is this is becoming much more of traditional resort market. I mean weekends, high demand periods, special event periods, holidays is when a lot the casino win is coming out of those high demand for room time periods. And have 9,000 keys representing all types of accommodation rates, the diversity here is critical and in peak periods it helps in earning power terrifically on our margins frankly. So this market looks lot more like it used to be in Las Vegas where more resort markets, where you had a lot demand on weekend, lot of demand when there is special events, we\u2019re very fortunate to have diversity of product and pricing.  So our room product more than ever is performing and big part of our success. Sheldon Adelson : What I would like to say here Jon is that notwithstanding my previous comments about our competitors, we do want to work together with them because collectively we can work together and bring a lot of visitation to our grounds, to Macao. We could fight over the customer and our claim to be able to do a better job fighting over the customer when they get off the plane they get off the boat or they get off the bus. We could do that, that\u2019s legitimate, we could fight but we got to work together to help Macao, to improve it and to improve the visitation. Jon Oh : If I can follow-up with the question on policing. There was a recent transit visa relaxation that came into effect in early July and I think a lot of us saw that that\u2019s a positive signal. Many investors have asked if this particular reversal is an indicator of maybe the government's willingness to take a softer stands on Macao, on any future policy decisions. Do you think that\u2019s a fair statement? Do you think that this is an at least signal that things are going to be better going forward? Would you read it that way? Rob Goldstein : John there is just no way for any of us to forecast the government's position in terms of this smoking -- I think we should just wait to see, I think it would be silly for us to pretending that we don't know. We hope for the best, we wait patiently the government's direction, be it smoking, be it visas. But for us to even pretending that we just don't know. We have respect for the government, we\u2019re hopeful that they\u2019ll support Macao, the citizens there are our employees, our future resides there. So we\u2019re hoping for the best and waiting for further direction. No forecast though. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : I was just wondering if you guys could give a little bit more color on some of the trends that you are seeing on a customer basis, because within Macao if we look at RevPAR you guys are obviously seeing a numbers that are down in the mid-teens right now although I think as was mentioned in the prepared remarks the numbers are pretty good relative to the market but I was curious on the decline in RevPAR versus you are actually seeing some continued sequential growth and year-on-year growth for sure in the retail business. Can you help us understand what you think you are seeing, reading between the lines on customer behavior at the stage at least on the mass market? Sheldon Adelson : I think that the other hotels really -- the operators are really having difficulty and challenges confronting the situation being the challenges for all of us in Macao. We are maintaining the higher -- and they have taken all their rooms and doing something with them that they didn't do before they got to sell them, they are not selling the rooms, they don't have the expenditure of selling the rooms, all they did was give them all away, we have experience in selling the rooms is what I said before. We\u2019re -- I'm sorry to sound boastful like this, I apologize for it, but we have to look at the reality. The reality is that our experience tells us what to do, when other people are confronting experiences they\u2019ve never confronted before. Rob do you want to say anything? Rob Goldstein : You mentioned retail and that\u2019s why I want to stop for a second and mention that you know ex-jewelry and watches, our retail business is pretty good and I think it\u2019s got on two fronts, one, we\u2019re getting great traffic on our sales, it\u2019s holding up pretty well. If you take out the very premium, not the fashion, but the watches and jewelry are particularly soft across the Macao market. You saw that in some luxury report numbers, but our retail malls provide both income but also visitation to the properties and I think is a really important point. We built these malls a long time ago and they get stronger year after year, visitation is stronger it's a reason to come to properties, we\u2019re very proud what\u2019s happening on the retail segment, how it translates down to the casino and the room occupancy. What you see in Macao, very clearly is that it\u2019s mass market. It's a premium mass, it's no longer driven by junket GGR. I hope the junkets resurrect, but right now it doesn\u2019t look promising. But what is happening in mass market is emerging and again mass markets demand lots of product, retail product, room product, diversity of pricing, lots of table, lots of spots. ETGs that\u2019s who we are, that\u2019s our background, we build our products for that. When Macao was developed and Cotai was brought to be, Sheldon\u2019s vision always was a Vegas style strips with lots of visitation lots of mass market, its happening. And so our products are lot more -- I think they're diverse in both pricing and quality, the room product rings is over the board from very high end suite to base rooms, lots of ETGs, slot machine that\u2019s just happening in Macao, very clearly. It's a mass market. Now the question becomes, in the future how fast can it develop and get deeper in the Mainland China and more China visitation, that\u2019s the real question, to grow GGR. For all the operator that benefit and we are hoping we see that shortly. So that\u2019s the trend we are seeing and we hope for the return of higher end, but right now we're living in a mass market with weekend penetration very strong, maybe not so strong and you see obviously deterioration of metrics because of the loss of 10% to 15% of the very high end customer that drove so much more GGR on certain tables. Shaun Kelley : Thanks for that, just as my follow, as tempting as it is to ask about Sheldon's view on Donald Trump I\u2019ll hold back and I'd love to get some, love to get your thoughts on one other thing, which is on the dividend. Last quarter I think in some of the remarks you mentioned that the target was still at least to try and be able to increase your dividend by 10% for a year for the next three years. Is that something that you believe is still on the table at this stage? Sheldon Adelson : I don\u2019t see any reason why to even reconsider it. We constantly maintained a rolling evaluation and the rolling cash flows. There is no reason to even question it. Patrick you want say anything about that? Patrick Dumont : We spend a lot of time analyzing different scenarios with the board and with the Chairmen regarding our return capital program specifically to dividend. And we feel very confident that as our cash flow continue to grow that we will be to support the Chairman wishes on dividend growth. Sheldon Adelson : We're getting more and more vibes that something is going to open up in Asia. And clearly if you talk to anybody in any of the countries where we've been, let's use the word lobbing for a number of years. There isn\u2019t anybody doesn\u2019t thing that we're in the pole position in any one of these countries. So it's getting to smell like something is going to be coming up soon. And we've considered that in our cash flow vis-\u00e0-vis estimating the dividend and knowing that we're going to have enough to do, and we're not taking into account the opportunity to borrow money to pay the dividend, which by the way if we did we've have a very, very super healthy dividend. But at this stage of the game we're not anticipating borrowing to pay the dividend, we've got enough cash flow. Notwithstanding the reduction in overall cash flow because of the challenges in Macao we\u2019re still earning a huge amount of money, billions of dollars. Shaun Kelley : But I guess just to be clear, dividend growth seems like its tied to cash flow of growth, is that a key part of the algorithm that the investor should be aware of. Sheldon Adelson : I think that\u2019s a fair statement. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Can you just give us an update on the Parisian? Given the state of the market, are there any changes on the timeline or the scope or anything like that? Thanks. Sheldon Adelson : I think the timeline is give or take about 12 months from now. For a full opening, we haven\u2019t lately looked at a partial opening. It all depends there are still something, some imponderables out there. But right now the way things are going we don\u2019t have as much labors as we'd like to have, et cetera. But we're happy enough with what the government is giving us, we're grateful, we're appreciative and right now it looks like we're probably going to have an opening in about 12 months. Rob Goldstein : And Tom just on the opening Sheldon address but again we think more than ever in this environment. The Parisian's European theme is exactly the right focus for the mass visitation and just like the Venetian's the most visited hotel in Macao. We think Venetian is just situated perfectly in terms of the consumer in today's Macao. Thomas Allen : Great, thanks. And then just as my follow-up, following up on a previous question, just on your thinking around the rooms, can you give us some more color on the mix today versus maybe six months or a year ago on the number of rooms that are going into junket versus direct casino customers versus selling rooms? You guys have a lot of experience, you have over 7,000 rooms in Vegas. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that mix in general? Rob Goldstein : Well it changes every day obviously and to your point, six months go a year ago is different. But the biggest single change you all know is the decline of junket participation in the rooms. So that used to be a very important part the mix, it\u2019s become much-much less important. We are spending more time focusing in getting more premium direct customers and premium mass customers those rooms, we using them as more directly as a tool. We have been more aggressive in the pricing and how we get premium mass customers in. There as a time when we were as high as $1,200 and $1,400 a night, ADR. That\u2019s dropped to half that, we are now looking at 600 to 700 bucks a night. And again resellers are networked, we are very aggressive on the pure cash sales, we\u2019ve always have been, because it had to be from day one. Unlike competitors that may get a thousand hotel and comp 90% we've always been a heavily skewed towards cash sales. We built -- our network to sell rooms is a lot more advanced perhaps than others because we have to be in that business. But I think in the future you you\u2019re going to see that the increase on pure cash sales, the decline of junket sales, the increase of premium mass and direct mass play. We\u2019re becoming more self-reliant because the junket just can't pick up the slack at this point, and that makes a move based on the market, but one thing is very clear we make most of our money these day on weekends, weekends look a lot like they did a year ago.  There is huge room demand on weekends, we run very high occupancies at very high rates, there is all kinds of competition amongst the segments on weekend, where the trouble comes in Macao like Las Vegas was when we first got here 20 years ago is mid-week demand is soft. There isn\u2019t much junket pick up, there isn\u2019t as much premium mass play. So we\u2019re making a lot more of our money, it\u2019s much more skewed to weekends because demand is there. The nice thing is, the old church for Easter Sunday, or synagogue for the high holidays, depending on your religious beliefs, but we have a lot more ability to fill those seats, those rooms on the high demand, at weekends, special event periods, holidays, we are -- that's where the money is being made in Macao today when you have got 9,000 soon to be 13,000 keys you can participate more than ever in their high demand period.  So, just like the fight when the MGM guys brought the fight late in May, you couldn\u2019t get enough room, and enough gaming tables, that's happening on weekends in Macao, that's where demand is and that's where the market is moving to. Everyone is struggling mid-week to my opinion, it's the weekends where the money is being made, so that's my take on the [loose] demand. Sheldon Adelson : We are struggling less than our competitors are struggling because we have a unique tool, it's called MICE. They can\u2019t fill up with MICE, we can. So that's why our occupancy is higher, our rates our high cash rates, are higher and we could -- we have more of a mass market in the casino. It's again it's you got to look at what we -- what this fundamental business model is, we are MICE-based we\u2019re supposed to fill up the mid-week at the rates of the weekend, when you have good MICE business. That's the fundamental nature of being in the trade show and the convention business. Thomas Allen : Sorry, just to throw one other quick one in here, you guys don't often give a lot of metrics around your MICE business in Macao. Is there anything you can talk about in terms of year-over-year growth or anything like that, that may help us think about how that's helping kind of sustain your business in Macao versus competitors? Rob Goldstein : We provide those stats, but rather -- different times because it\u2019s complex and time consuming. I\u2019d like to move on next question. Would be happy to do offline with you Thomas. Thomas Allen : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I had a two-part question, both of which were pertaining to the balance sheet. First and foremost, as you talk about using a little bit more of your direct -- using the balance sheet a little bit more for direct play in Macao, could you talk us through the thinking in terms of credit extension and doing a little bit less with the junkets? And if you see that being a real focus going forward or just kind of offsetting some volatility in the near-term? Additionally, as it pertains to uses of cash from the balance sheet, what leverage level are you guys comfortable with as it pertains to paying the dividend on a go-forward basis? Is there a certain level of net debt to EBITDA where you would think that maybe additional dividend growth would be something that you'd have to think a lot more about? Rob Goldstein : Hi it's Rob. Can you go back I missed your first question I was listening to your dividend question. So, your question relates to junkets and the premium direct? Carlo Santarelli : Exactly. Just how much you're willing to kind of use the balance sheet? I know in the position that you're in, obviously a position of strength from a balance sheet perspective, using the balance sheet for more direct play and kind of offsetting some of the junket softness is an option that's available to you? Rob Goldstein : Right. It's really not a balance sheet question from my perspective because it's a credit worthiness question. And what I mean when I say that is, we've got plenty of capacity to use the balance sheet if we could feel comfort about the credit issuance. I mean the first questions always not, can we afford to take the risk, is it good risk to begin with. And the problem I have unfortunately lot of the success in the Macao has been through the junkets because it's not as transparent to credit worthiness to some of these customers. So the people we know well, the people who have proven to be creditworthy and can pass all the regulatory compliance issues, we have been extending credit to, we did it aggressively in this quarter. We've done aggressively in the last few quarters. We loved to step into that position, but it's getting enough transparency and comfort from a regulatory perspectives who we are dealing with, to get issue of credit. We\u2019d love to give millions of dollars of credit every day in Macao like we do in Singapore. As you know in Singapore we\u2019ve issued probably $20 billion of direct credit, but the customer is very high profile, they're very scrutinized, they've got long track records and they're very regulatory compliant. If we can get that kind of transparency in Macao, we'd be big advocates of direct credit. Now we have no -- we're the biggest credit granter in the world by a lot in terms of the casino business. We're aggressive in Singapore. We're aggressive in Las Vegas. But to get there in Macao means we need to know the customers deeper and there are far more customers in Macao, much more diverse and much less transparent to us. As we become more conversant with those customers, understand it, I think we can issue more credit. But I wouldn\u2019t look for us to replace the junket segment nearly the quantities they've issued. We're getting closer to a balance with our junket play. If I look at this quarter our junket play balance is a premium direct is getting more imbalanced, but do we ever get the same level of credit that junkets do, not in the near term, no. As a dividend question I'll turn it Mr. Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : We\u2019re committed to the dividends, as I've said a number of times our interest, my family\u2019s interest is on the same page as yours. Our interests are very much aligned. To answer your question very specifically we are comfortable with a 2 to 3 times leverage to EBITDA, now we\u2019re not near that and we don't have as I have said earlier in the call, our present intention is not to borrow money to pay dividends, we have sufficient cash flow and excess cash flow to be able to do that. And we're just thinking about new development opportunities. There's a lot of conjecture about what a new development opportunity in an emerging market like Japan or somewhere else in the Far East, keeping our powder dry so we can go after that aggressively and we could build, what it takes to build to win the day, to win the competition. We are keeping our powder dry in our borrowing capacity. We\u2019re not uncomfortable with 2 to 3 times but we are uncomfortable right now to go out and borrow money to pay dividends. We as I said earlier, we\u2019re beginning to feel vibrations that a development opportunity is hopefully around the corner. Operator : We have now reached the end of time allotted for questions. This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you.",

Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question so we might allow everyone with interest to participate. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased we continued to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter. And despite the continuing challenges in the Macau market, we delivered a strong set of financial results with company-wide hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA, reaching $1.09 billion, an increase of 7% over the prior quarter. At the same time we continued to return excess capital to shareholders. It has always been clear to me that our unique MICE-based integrated resort business model positively differentiates us from our competitors, in terms of both financial performance and economic contribution to all those jurisdictions. In Macau, our hold-normalized EBITDA was up quarter-on-quarter with continued sequential improvement in our operating margin. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands delivered yet another record quarter in mass gaming win-per-day, when measured in Singapore dollars, as well as a 20% sequential increase in rolling volumes. On a constant currency basis, Marina Bay Sands hold-normalized EBITDA was up 22.4%. At the heart of our company's success is having the right strategy at the outset. We had the courage of our convictions to build early and aggressively. We develop critical mass to scale and diversification. And we offer product and amenities that are best positioned to capture long-term tourism and consumption growth in Asia. We're unique in the scale and diversity of our portfolio. We have focused on the most stable and profitable segment, the mass market. We're clearly differentiated by the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet and we're the further distinguished versus the competition by our track record as well as the pioneer of the MICE-based integrated resort business model. That balance sheet strength at only 1.6 times net-debt-to-EBITDA allows us to stay fully committed to it development plans as well as our commitments to returning capital to shareholders. Again this is unique in our industry. Our retail mall portfolio which features the industry's broadest and deepest set of retail offerings in both Macau and Singapore, is also unique. I'm pleased to highlight that our retail mall revenues have held up well in today's retail market which is softer, in particular, at the higher end. Also we have the ability to monetize our retail mall portfolio in the future. In Macau, our share of EBITDA in the Singapore market has continued to increase to around 36% in the first six months of 2015, up from 34% in 2014. In fact, in quarter two, our EBITDA share climbed to 39%. In Singapore, our share of EBITDA of the duopoly market has increased to 65% in the first six months of 2015, up from 59% in 2014. That's notwithstanding the fact that projections of the Singapore market have been premature and exaggerated. Our operations represent a substantial portion of the EBITDA generated in all of Asia for the industry. This is truly a precedent. Now let me take you through some of the operating highlights of our results in Macau for the quarter. For quarter three on a hold-normalized basis, Sands China EBITDA was $537 million, up 1% over the prior quarter. While we consider EBITDA shared the most important metric reflecting market performance, we also held the number one spot in revenue share in the quarter, with 23.6% of the Macau markets gaming revenue. In the mass segment we do see signs of stabilization, the continued benefit from the scale of our hotel room inventory, the diversity of our product offering and the attraction of the Venetian as Macau's must-see destination. I want to remind you because we haven't talked about this before, that the casino at Venetian Macau is less than 4% of the total amount of space in the Venetian Macau. We sometimes get asked whether our capacity advantage is diminished given the recent market revenue decline. I believe the opposite is the case. In a market with peak periods, the weekends and holidays matter more than ever before and where mass-market customers will generate the lion's share of the revenue of future profit growth, our capacity advantage low, in fact, we further amplified. I believe the Venetian Macau which a must-see attraction and everybody coming to Macau will be matched by the Parisian, because it's got a geographical theme that people really want to see. Look at our market share revenue in the peak revenue periods. 26.5% in May, with the Labor Day holidays, 25.3% in August, the peak summer month and then October around 25% again for National Day Golden Week. Our hotel occupancy in the July and August summer months was 89%, 5 percentage points higher than that of the whole Macau market. In VIP gaming, despite the continued weakening of the junket segment during the quarter, our premium direct business yet again delivered a solid quarter. Our premium direct growing volumes were up 1% quarter-over-quarter versus the 17% decline in the overall market junket set. With respect to cost efficiencies, we're well on track to achieving more than $200 million of savings in 2015. Hold-normalized EBITDA margin in Macau improved sequentially to over 33%, primarily reflecting cost efficiencies. I am pleased that since quarter one, we have been able to sustain higher levels of market share while controlling costs and increasing labor productivity. Rob can elaborate further in the discussion later. With the completion of St. Regis and [indiscernible] we will have almost 13,000 hotel rooms in four interconnected resorts, over 840 retail stores across four shopping malls, with the potential to add several hundred more stores in future development phases, subject to government approval, 2 million square feet of meeting and observation space and four performance and event venues, including our Venetian CotaiArena which can be utilized either for our MICE business or major entertainment events. We remain fully committed to playing the pioneering role in Macau's transformation into Asia's leading business convention and lead gestures of destination. We have steadfast confidence in our future success, a track record in being transformative pioneers in MICE, retail and entertainment speak for itself. Now moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We delivered another strong quarter at Marina Bay Sands which despite the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, generated hold-normalized EBITDA of $411 million, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. As I mentioned earlier, on a constant currency basis, our hold-normalized EBITDA increased over 22%, while rolling and non-rolling segments performed well. Mass win-per-day was $4.8 million, when adjusted for the currency effect, our mass win-per-day was up by 8%. That strong performance was principally driven by the successful execution of our strategy to bring premium mass customers from throughout Asia to Singapore. As a result, we delivered another all-time quarterly record in mass win-per-day in Singapore dollars. In the rolling segment, we enjoyed the best rolling volumes in any quarter since quarter one 2014. On a constant currency basis, rolling volumes were up 36% year-on-year and up 20% quarter-on-quarter. In addition, we have maintained a proven accounts receivable reserve ratio during the quarter. Our company remains committed to leading the industry compliance. Now on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders. I'm extremely pleased to announce that the Las Vegas Sands Board of Directors has approved an increase in our recurring dividend program for 2016 calendar year. The 2016 calendar Las Vegas Sands dividend will be $2.88 for the year or $0.72 per quarter. This represents a 10.8% increase over the $2.60 dividend we're paying in 2015. We remain committed to the maintenance of our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China and we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity and balance sheet strength enable us to continue these recurring dividend programs, while retaining financial resources to invest for future growth and pursue new development opportunities. Yay dividends and yay buybacks. We bought back 80 million of stock in the most recent quarter. We have approximately $1.6 billion remaining under our current stock buyback authorization. And we look forward to continuing to utilize this stock buyback program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns. I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome Mr. Wilfred Wong will join us on November 1 as President and Chief Operating Officer Sands China Limited. Wilfred brings the distinguished track record in both the public and private sectors to Sands China. We're pleased to be able to continuing to contribute to Macau's success in realizing its objectives at diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses, providing meaningful career development opportunities for citizens and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tours of destination. Finally, let me share that I'm extremely pleased about the depth and strength of our management team, not only at Sands China, but in Singapore, Las Vegas and in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The strength of our team is clearly reflected in our ability to stay disciplined and continue executing our strategy in challenging brackets. I want to thank you again for joining us on the call today, now let's engage in Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff. Your line is open. Joe Greff : I will start with the question on Singapore I thought Macau was kind of down in the middle of the fairway. Singapore I thought that's where the biggest positive area was relative to our expectations and forecast. I suppose on the mass side and also on the VIP site. Can you talk about it a little bit Sheldon but Rob maybe go down a little bit what factors are driving relative to our expectations to better performance there, what you\u2019re doing differently or better in the past? Different sourcing geographically, that would be helpful to understand, thank you. Rob Goldstein : The NBS remains outstanding I think the quarter reflects our dedication to all our business statements, the lodging please, held up, very, very well both in our occupancy, the retail piece actually grew year-on-year which is exciting in these difficult times in China. Our gaming business remains exemplary. I would caution you again the VIP get a lot of attention but against highly concentrated we did every quarter relative to last six quarters. But the real start is showing I think Singapore remains our non-rolling table slot [indiscernible] performance 63% margins, $4.8 million a day. To your point of regionalization I think we benefit by being in a place that has Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Japan as neighborhoods. And we're very pleased with the team over there, couldn\u2019t be more pleased in fact I see our growth getting better and better, our magic number is still $5 million a day, haven't hit yet, currency adjusted were there actually. So despite the foreign exchange headwinds, despite the problems in China, we have an annualized run-rate of about 1.150 billion coming out of stocks ETGs, it's a great business it's not credit dependent, it's not [indiscernible] dependent, as Sheldon reference we dominate the market in terms of EBITDA split. We\u2019re just very encouraged by the business, we see the trends getting more solid for us. A lot of skepticism around Singapore but it's not China dependent. It's not high order dependent, it's very sustainable and we\u2019re very proud that results in and the team over there has really executed where we want to be. So very, very pleased with it and hope we can keep that momentum going in the fourth quarter. Sheldon Adelson : I think the discouragement or the pessimism about Singapore is based upon how our competitor in Singapore is doing. Can you imagine we're doing double the total amount of business? It's two to one that they are doing. We own 65% of the market. I attribute that to not only a location, quality of the product and the most important thing is that [indiscernible] has never operated in a competitive market. We have never operated in anything, but a competitive market so we understand how to compete a lot stronger than our competitor knows how to compete. So I think the fact that they are not doing as good as we're, we're doing twice as good as they are, sort of you want to hold us in tandem with what they are doing and I think that\u2019s why I wanted to emphasize the word differentiated from the rest of the market in Asia. Rob Goldstein : I do think Joe, that building is exemplary where it's at physically, how it looks architecturally, the food and beverage, the retail is pretty iconic. We\u2019re just very proud of it and I think it's going to continue to do very well in the future, so all good signs coming out of Singapore. Joe Greff : For my follow-up question, again not Macau related but looking over the Las Vegas trip, did RevPar growth performance in the Q3, what drove that and how sustainable are mid to high single digits RevPar gains going forward and that's really it for me. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : We will probably say it's our best quarter in Las Vegas since the difficulty of 2007-2008, it is a real strong quarter from many perspective but the start here is the lodging piece and we did [indiscernible] and ADR of 96%, it's a record quarter for us on a normalized basis plus $100 million in EBITDA. The gain piece held up pretty well but again the start here is going to be the lodging segment which is getting stronger. We see support from all the group segment FIG, very encouraged by Las Vegas right now because our lodging business, gaming needs to be very competitive, lasted [ph] okay nothing spectacular. Our table adjustment affected somewhat by the downturn in national play but over all our drop is 600 plus million strong third quarter, just very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in Las Vegas from our perspective. It is not been the last couple of years a strong for us. We're seeing return to better time and I think the group has been exemplary in helping drive some of that compression of REIT, so very excited of RevPar and over lodging trends for our property share in Las Vegas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Rob in the prepared remarks, Sheldon put you on the spot and said that you might talk about your continued ability to cut costs. So I was wondering if you could do that and just how we should think about the ability for you guys to continue offsetting the negative operating leverage as the operating environment continues to stay challenging. Rob Goldstein : Well obviously we can operate in what is a very difficult environment in Macau right now, the VIP erosion and the continuing softness in the mass. We're down here today about 170 million year-on-year, our goal is to get to 230, 240 annualized. The cuts come from everywhere, it comes from about 30% drives the payroll, about 25% from gaming OpEx, about 25% from non-gaming OpEx, about 20% from all entertainment. I think we can operate Felicia in this environment we have proven we can do it, now this year has been difficult as you all know and if it continues to be harsh in Macau but we can operate and keep doing this and we're confident there is more to be done there. But as you know at some point you cut into muscle and not just fat and that\u2019s my concern is how much further we can go, the 900 pound gorilla in the room is to return to growth in the mass market. Our buildings are built for mass-market, they are large room capacity, large gaming capacity, large retail capacity, they are built for mass markets, we\u2019re built for today's Macau market, frankly we\u2019re not as strong higher end, never been as strong, what Sheldon always prophesied unfortunately came true, there will be a downturn at some point in every market. So we built better rooms, better retail diversified product. I'm hoping as the mass-market gets stronger, the cost cutting will be minimized but if '16 continues like it appears to be going we're there to play in that arena. We're cost-cutting across the board, is not always easy to team there, with a very good job of doing it but it can continue and we can go deeper and harder and again it's derived from all parts of our business and doesn\u2019t rely in anyone segment. So unfortunately that\u2019s where we're at, we still think we make a lot of money in Macau. It will be a lot more fun and exciting if we can see return to growth in the mass segments. So that's our Macau situation for today. Felicia Hendrix : That's good. And also a good segue to my next question my follow-up question which is on the mass customer. Just looking at the statistics obviously the base mass win per table continues to decline is that a slower rate Sheldon mentioned that it's stabilizing. But Rob as we think about the competition that\u2019s coming online and the continuous pressures that the customer is seeing from the market from the government, where do you see the base mass statistics settling out and can you describe the type of base mass customer that you\u2019re seeing today versus a year ago? Obviously their spent per visit to the casino continues to decline but is it their entire budget down or they just spending less in the casino but increasing their spent on non-gaming activities. So again like where do you see the base mass statistics settling out and how is the customer, what is the customer's budget look like? Rob Goldstein : I think you have to be careful when you say base mass, it's very confusing but we all know that junk of these without [indiscernible] that's pretty simplistic. We can see that very black and white. Mass is more confusing because I believe the base mass business hasn\u2019t really changed that much, what has changed is the premium mass when you put that together and that equation becomes base pretty mixed together. There is a fall-off and that the customer, Felicia, has been in the premium mass my opinion is the base mass customer is holding up pretty well. I think you're seeing stabilization there. Well you\u2019re not seeing growth, you\u2019re not seeing return is more premium mass mix in there. Think of it this way, you walk into a high-end store in New York City or Las Vegas, walk into a high-end retailer and you will see a lot of customers, but you see three or four a day they might make a huge purchase, that's what happened in Macau. We have lost a lot of these premium mass customers that were quasi-direct play and that customer base has eroded and until that customer is back I think you will see very slow lower return to a year ago. And I think the pure base mass customer loses $1000 or $500 a day, if you go to Macau, it looks very busy over there, they are alive and well especially weekends and holidays. So I think the real softness here is a derivative of junket place somewhat. It's that same person affected by economy, anti-corruption, liquidity, union pay, smoking I think it's the same story to the extent.  Again we need to see that segment return from Macau crew and get brighter and happier, we need to see a return to more premium mass customers. I believe are base business is actually pretty good. The rooms are pretty good. Our gaming business is holding up okay. But we're not getting that 5% or 10% of the population that drove extraordinary amounts of gaming win and that GGR took us back I think Macau will continue to be difficult. And I don't think it's base mass I think it's premium mass when you mix them together. Felicia Hendrix : Maybe we can talk about this offline because I know my time is done here but in your chart you showed base mass since the second quarter of '14 is down 18% continued to decline sequentially so I was kind of referring to that market, really specifically. Rob Goldstein : Again I think it's hard to be real honest I think for any of us, it's difficult to identify not to disregarded [ph] our charge because it must be perfect but the truth is hard, it's difficult to differentiate at times and at any operator in Macau can tell you this. It's very difficult to differentiate base mass, premium mass, what table, I'm not convinced that those charge don\u2019t reflect still, a heavy smattering of premium mass mixed with base. I think from experience, maybe [indiscernible] will tell you that it's almost misleading because it's hard to exactly what is, they are holding up signs on premium mass, on base mass. You're doing it based on our sample, our indications, I'm not convinced that our base mass business is down 18%. I think our premium mass business they are down more, that\u2019s where the softness is and continues to be. I'm happy to take you offline and talk about it but it's my firm conviction that you can't get every number right and market that in terms of, when you segment these markets, it's difficult. Junket's are easy, they're all in the same room, they're all playing the same place. Mass is much more difficult to really understand the segmentation. Sheldon Adelson : And we do know for a fact that there are premium mass players in play in the geographic area that we\u2019re identifying here as they are absolutely are in there and they contribute piece of this [indiscernible]. Rob Goldstein : Our mass drop actually grew. What I like more sequentially not year-on-year but sequentially, I also rely on the people -- work force to talk every morning, if you listen to the dialogue and it's getting more and more, we have seen a lot of bodies, a lot of business in those buildings. We\u2019re not seeing the better quality customers. That's what drive table win per unit, it drives higher minimum bets, it drives the entire GGR and that's what I think the weakness really is. Our drop is I think it was on the base mass but we're suffering on the premium mass side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Oh from CLSA. Your line is open. Jon Oh : Well done on raising the dividend to 288. My question is I'm just trying to understand the kind of the implicit assumptions within what you guys are thinking as to what you need to actually make maybe next year and in 2017 or what are the hurdle rates of EBITDA that you think are crucial for you to generate in Macau and also in Singapore for you to be able to sustain a dividend and also the kind of thought process behind how do you think or what your expectations are for the Parisian in order for us to kind of understand what kind of free cash flow could come out of this auto of Macau and also for Singapore offering to sustain a 288 dividend ? Sheldon Adelson : So Jon let me start off and then turn it over to some of the other guys. But big picture we don't give guidance for guidance, but our perspective and the confidence that we have in our cash flow and our ability to continue to grow cash flow in Singapore, Las Vegas, Bethlehem and over time in Macau is strong, but we wouldn\u2019t raise the dividend. And if you look at '16 next year, we're expecting that it could potentially be a tough year. I think you've got three new properties opening but we're confident that when you go out two, three, four years Macau will be at growth market again, there is a big underpenetrated market in Mainland China that the Parisian is designed to appeal to and together with the Parisian you're going to have a very, very strong capability to generate increased amounts of cash over time and the increase in the dividend is reflective of that confidence that we have in the future. Rob Goldstein : I think we have a lot of confidence in the Parisian being a product that will speak well for mass business in Macau market. We have a lot of confidence in Singapore and Las Vegas and Bethlehem perform next year to levels that hopefully exceeding to this year's levels, the big question mark obviously remains Macau, no one is confused about that and it's virtually impossible for us to tell you what -- how to think about Macau, it's so unknown to any of us. It is a big question mark for any operator today. We don't want to forecast, we think what we\u2019re going to do, we feel very confident about that Parisian performance but it won't be open until best case end-of-the-year in Q4, so it won't be a huge contributor. Sheldon Adelson : Not necessarily. Rob Goldstein : Well, Q4. Sheldon Adelson : And in Q3 and in Q4. Rob Goldstein : It's hard for us to sit here and think that number will be, we feel great about three of our places, Macau remains the question mark and obviously for us to take that guess today would be a mistake. Jon Oh : And if I could follow-up on a remark that you guys made signs of stabilization in mass. And I think the kind of following you said earlier Rob about the base mass which is something that you think is quite flattering, I think the impact has been largely on premium. What your thoughts about the VIP market as it stands? Have we seen some signs of bottoming or do you think that this is still the market that has very little visibility as it stands? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : I think the numbers speak for themselves, the VIP market has gotten, it is where it is, a pleasant place. I don't know what the catalyst will be as these VIP return. I do think there is hope for the premium mass to get better, and that\u2019s where my hope resides. I think VIP junket model has such turbulence both yesterday and tomorrow that it's hard to see how they can better. But I do think that premium mass customer can resurrect and we believe the base mass is stabilizing, I still think the weakness is in the premium mass. Sheldon Adelson : We think that the junket market is the one that's getting hit the most. Premium direct business is improving and we\u2019re getting some of those people that are not going through the junket, they may have been going through the junkets before. And we\u2019ve built relationship with them and we think the credit is good. We're very strict on issuing credit, so from our standpoint we never went into the junket market as big as some of the other guys did, because it wasn't our fundamental business model. Our fundamental business model is MICE based and that didn\u2019t rely upon the VIP market. When we first opened Venetian in Las Vegas, we only had took us a couple of years to start increasing the amount of the maximum bet that we would take. We started off with $30,000 with maximum bet and when we opened the Sands in Macau we started off with about the same thing. We didn't go after the junket market. It happened to our growth and in Singapore we're not allowed to deal with Macau styled junket reps with third-party and everything we do there is premium direct. So it's still going on. We\u2019re still having VIP players coming in and look at the results, 2/3rds of the market belongs to us and 1/3rd belongs to our single competitor there. The mass market is what we were built for even though today in Singapore will take as much as $1 million a bet, $1 million a hand and we\u2019re the only casino in the world that will take that. So I don't know, we\u2019re setting the pace for other people perhaps to do the same thing. So we're basically built for the mass market and that's why we have so many hotel rooms, so many so much gaming capacity, we\u2019ve built it for that market and now we're achieving the results and the mass market is now the low hanging fruit for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : I just wanted to maybe speak about Macau on a higher level, we have seen a lot of policy announcements in the market over the course of September in particular and I was just sort of curious to get your thoughts sort of the latest views as it relates to some of those whether be kind of a mix lead of junket regulation and union pay withdrawal limits versus the announcement from the liaisons office about potentially doing something to help out the gaming industry, sort of how are you guys appealing about the policy environment in Macau right now and how incrementally supportive you think the government is likely to get from here? Rob Goldstein : Well we have always been respectful of the Macau government's desire. When we first got in we said we were going to bring in as part of our presentation to them, we said we were going to bring in national and international brands which we have done. We brought in Intercontinental Corporation, we\u2019ve brought in Holiday Inn. We brought in the Hilton Conrad we brought in Sheraton, we brought in Four Seasons. We keep our commitment. If you talk to anybody in Macau, the current government, the former government and you ask which company which of the concessionaires or sub-concessionaires is out there has followed the direction that the government has outlined, the answer is going to come up either LVS and then we change our name to Sands China in Macau. We have a belief that our gaming license in Macau is a privilege and not a right. So we do everything we can to develop and direct our properties toward the goal that the government wants and diversification of tourism. Look, we've got 10.6 million square feet in one property one 3000 room property, The Venetian in Macau and we've got 13.5 million to 14 million square feet of Sands Cotai Central. You don't need that for a casino, the idea is to put it in, we're the pioneers of integrated resort business model, that's what the Macau government wants, that's what we offered to the government and we will continue to do that. Obviously we can always hope for things to be better but we don't have control over that and we've got to respect we're in China, let the Chinese decide what they want to do with the concessionaires. Again it's our privilege, it's not our right. So do everything we can to justify getting the blessings from the Macau government. It's their government. It's their right and we will do whatever they asked us to do. Sheldon Adelson : Shaun, we really affirm the government's want to see Macau prosper and succeed. We're very fortunate to be there I think Sheldon's history in Macau speaks for itself, 11 years ago he opened the first a modern-era casino in the Peninsula, the Sands, it has made a lot of money for his company, it has open doors open for all kinds of people make lots of money in Peninsula and he then three years later spent at that time a record-breaking $2.4 billion at the Venetian and opened up the doors to Cotai, at a time no one believe Cotai was viable today. The first time he looked at numbers Cotai exceeds Peninsula in GGR. Point we\u2019re making is we\u2019re u lucky to be there, we have done very well there, we have been good partners with the government and we believe strongly in the future of Macau and we\u2019re fortunate. We opened a new building up next year, and we hope lots of success but I think your look to the action of the company, the success of the company and the properties of Sheldon, there will be a $13 billion capital spend that tells you how we feel about Macau . Shaun Kelley : I guess a follow up same theme would be, we\u2019re starting to get sort of more questions from investors about the concession renewal process. As we move into late '15 from I think what we last heard from the government they were going to be in sort of evaluation phase, I was just curious, do you know if that dialogue is ongoing and/or where things sit today as it relates to that? Any update or thoughts on when we might hear something more on that? Rob Goldstein : To the best of my knowledge, I read the clippings from both here and our [indiscernible] PR and government relations department. I haven't heard a word, haven't written word, haven't heard a word about the midterm evaluations in Macau. So as far as we know, if it's happening, they're not publicizing it and if it's not yet happening, they will be getting to it. It will happen when it happens. Our worrying about it doesn't advance it any further. They will do what they want to do when they want to do it. Our concession expires in '22, that\u2019s still seven years away. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : So Studio City is opening in Macau in five days, just want to hear your latest thoughts on how you expect the property to impact the market overall and are either you doing anything differently to benefit from the new opening or you\u2019re seeing others doing I think surprising? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : No we\u2019re not seeing, we\u2019re not different at all, we\u2019re in a business as you\u2019ve in the past Thomas, but we\u2019re hoping that Melco and Galaxy bring business to Macau are hoping for the success obviously, we\u2019re all in this together. We need to see Melco do well, we\u2019re routing for them. We\u2019re big fans of what they have done in the past, we are big fans of Galaxy's new building, it is excellent. So we\u2019re cheerleaders, we\u2019re rooting for these guys to make lots of money and bring business to Cotai. We\u2019re happy to see Cotai continue to evolve and have a have footprint in Macau. We\u2019re happy to see this crossover and now the Cotai exceeds the Peninsula, and we\u2019re just looking for more and more success for all of us because let's face it this is a rising tide we will carry overboard so, for a great opening a great looking building. Sheldon Adelson : Competitively I think that our Parisian theme building -- we just topped off the Eiffel Tower, it's going to be a fantastic construction [ph], fantastic and I think this is what the market wants. But why is the Venetian a must-see property because it's something they can't see anywhere else. I saw a design yesterday of the Studio City and they have an eight shaped Ferris wheel, couldn't figure out and neither could our development department figure out if the top half of the circle connects to the bottom half, I don't know. Rob Goldstein : He's looking for free ticket Sheldon Adelson : I would be happy to pay for it but they didn't have a change. Thomas Allen : And then just as a follow-up, just for clarification around Singapore. Rob, I have heard you say a few times now that you think people think that they misunderstand that the property is not Chinese customer dependent and you really draw a lot of your customers from across Asia, should we take that imply that you\u2019re seeing declines in Chinese plate or is it and then strength other regions and maybe local business or? Rob Goldstein : Well let's begin with our plus segment because it's a complicated question beginning in the high-end we're seeing declined visitation on the very high-end customer for gaming segment, the rolling customer out of China has diminished -- lack of demand also we\u2019re watching our credit issuance there. So just like Las Vegas has been impacted by the issues in China, we're often in the very high-end. However, what we have seen in Singapore is the regionalization and on the rolling business again I always caution you as you know it's concentrated, it's not 2 million customers there. So it's heavily concentrated, but we've seen great success out of the region and that being Indonesia Malaysia, some Chinese, some TRs [ph], some people live in Singapore that are internationals and have a proper residency. So yes, we have not been -- is not growing in Singapore, it's probably in decline in the high-end. But the more important part of our business there is not Chinese dependent, that is the ongoing slot ETG segment which has never been Chinese dependent. It's mostly people in the region again, Indonesia, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese and that\u2019s been the pleasant surprise, we have maintained and grown that segment and it's never been dependent on Chinese visitation. I'm also pleased with our retail sales in the luxury segment, in Singapore actually up year-on-year again despite a downturn in Macau's retail environment. So clearly we\u2019re in different place in Singapore. The region at this point has not been impacted by China as it has been in Macau. So depending on where you look our retail business is improving even the luxury, even very high-end high street stores are doing better. Single digit year-on-year increases -- our rolling business is okay, it's acceptable, but again the real strength of that building was people just can't seem to accept is we're not dependent on the slot ETG non-rolling, that is the power house, that\u2019s the 1 billion, 2 billion that drives that building to these kind of numbers. And I don't think that's China dependent at all. We do get some Chinese play, but again the regional aspect of the customer segment is very strong and growing. Exciting part for our team over there is we're finding more $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 gaming customers out of those neighboring countries. So I guess you can say we're not China dependent, we like Chinese business, it's been good to us in the past but right now it's not the driver of Singapore. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Sheldon, as you think about your Macau collection of assets today, and obviously Parisian coming on, in a year or so, when you think about the new supply that is coming to the market and having a lot of experience dealing with supply and way competitive dynamics change, do you guys feel some of the work you're doing today on the cost side will mitigate some of that and furthermore are you seeing any evidence or getting the sense that the folks will have to be more promotional as some of the new capacity comes online? Sheldon Adelson : Well, we're always going to have to be competitive, very sensitive to whatever new capacity. I believe that the new competition will have to be in order for us to be cannibalized. It would have to be a better thematic posture than what we have. We still believe first of all we\u2019re putting up pedestrian bridges that will collect all our properties. We will truly be the Cotai strip where we will be able to get 13,000 hotel rooms without walking outside. So we will hit five or six casinos depends on how you connect the casinos in Sands Cotai Central without leaving the building. There are and there will be pedestrian bilges going across the strip moving sidewalks. We have like 30,000 people a day crossing in both directions and that's quite a traffic breeder. I think that the Parisian with it's unique theme will be highly competitive and I think we will have the third must see property in Macau, the Venetian, the Sands Cotai Central and the Parisian which will be major attractions. And I think from a competitive standpoint, I don't think the other properties, although as Rob said we're rooting for them for all of them to be successful. I think that the Studio City will be a little more competitive because it's a different look, people want to experience a different look. We happen to think that the geographic positioning combined with our fundamental basic MySpace [ph] business model will be very successful. We\u2019re looking at over 3000 units and there isn't not one of the other five properties that are building as many as 2000 keys, somewhere building approximately 2 keys for every key a competitor is building and we think that the uniqueness of our geographic theme, particularly I will tell you we just topped off the Eiffel Tower and I got to tell you look at that and you will see a very, very attractive theme. So people when we first opened in Singapore and the Sky Park was built, the ambience was built adjacent to the Singapore Ferris Wheel, the Singapore Flyer. As soon as we opened, we had a separate set of elevators and we charged SGD20 for people to go up there, it killed the Singapore clients. They went into bankruptcy because people would rather do more than just take a Ferris wheel right. They want to have an experience at the top and I think the Eiffel Tower is going to give that to them. So it isn't just there is a competition out there. It is the quality of the competition. How competitive is it? And how does it meet the needs and the aspirations of the mass market? I think that, look, forget about the issue of market share although we\u2019re happy to be at the top end of the market share, I can't deposit market share in the bank. I can only deposit EBITDA and nobody is even approached us in the last 11 years since we open in terms of EBITDA so that's what really counts. You can put EBITDA on the bank and we could be highly competitive regardless of how many properties they open. If you don\u2019t ever open a property that is sensitive to the needs and to the aspirations of the customer, you can build ten competitive places and we\u2019re still going to do well. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : I wonder if you could give a little bit of color around maybe there is a big occupancy decline of Venetian Macau and I don't know if that was intentional to lower occupancy to eliminate some cost, I'm thinking it was not, how should we think of the decline in RevPAR and rate in occupancy both given the hotel supply coming into the market over the next few months. Rob Goldstein : Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t planned that way, there was no grand schemes to knock off the rate down. It just now fell. As you well know that market is adding rooms quickly both from actual bricks and '16 build as well as the junket transition as people stop giving away with the junkets. There is more and more rooms in the market, mid-80s is acceptable but we\u2019re working in the Venetian and we also have some CapEx plans for some of the room product? But it was not planned, it wasn\u2019t to save cost, it's simply we didn\u2019t have the demand we want to have and plan to fix the future. Venetian is still the only billion-dollar property left I think in Macau from what I can tell based on the run rate in this quarter. I hope that change in the future with more people getting billion dollar run rates for those properties but Venetian had a week quarter in terms of occupancy rate, had a good gaming quarter, was low 80s in Macau. Robin Farley : Okay. Rob Goldstein : The point is Rob, it wasn\u2019t planned, that\u2019s not how we want to do -- we want that rate to go back up when an occupancy backup, we're trying to keep our rate higher than other people in town. There is a lot of slip through rate capacity and I think the junket, the transition from giveaway rooms, comp rooms to junket is down to cash rooms is an issue for tomorrow. I do think -- Cotai will get stronger, we\u2019re excited to see, we\u2019re going to over and see the new Melco product next week or two, we\u2019re excited to see what [indiscernible] does in the spring and I do think that demand for Cotai is going to continue to grow and grow. We\u2019re still the biggest footprint in Cotai and so I think it's going to be a very competitive, very positive impact on the Cotai area. I know that wasn\u2019t planned, we need to improve our numbers both in the rate and from in occupancy perspective. Robin Farley : Maybe just as a follow-up to that, I know that the market -- there is not a lot of forward visibility in terms of room bookings, but just from what you do see, past October 27 next week. Is your early read on sort of those first two weeks after that that it's helping occupancy with your property or not necessarily yet? Rob Goldstein : I don't see, I don't have insight at this point is too early to tell, but I think again I'm a big believer that this Cotai area when you get Mr. Win there and you get [indiscernible] these guys are building these multi-billion dollar properties you\u2019re going to see a list for all of this. I really believe that. I believe it may come at the expense of the Peninsula. I think the must see products will reside on Cotai. I think it's part of Sheldon's comments about Parisian, I couldn\u2019t be more Parisian, it will be a must see iconic and theme building which I think Macau responds well to. So we're very pleased to be in Cotai with great building. There is no [indiscernible] short-term I don\u2019t know, does it help us long term? I believe it does, I believe it does, we have to win this thing together. We need to exceed GGRs growth, we need to see visitation grow, we need to see premium mass grow. Our company is different than others in a lot of ways but the one thing we do have differential and continues the scalability. We have lot more rooms, lot more retail, more gaming opportunities, so we need more visitation, we need more better customers and I think the more that Cotai area grows, the more benefits this company. So again we are believers in Macau long-term. The visitation, the penetration in mainland to Macau remains sub-2%, the instructional improvements keep coming. We believe the government can see and they believe to see Macau succeed. So whether it's this week or next week we\u2019re thinking long-term big picture that Cotai does very well and again the biggest player in Cotai by many rooms and many gaming opportunities, we're going to be the biggest beneficiaries.

Goldstein - President and COO Patrick Dumont - SVP Finance and Strategy Daniel Briggs - SVP of IR Analysts : Joe Greff - JPMorgan Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital Chris Jones - Union Gaming Group Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Robin Farley - UBS Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Chris and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call led by Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference, sir. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, Chris. Joining me today on the call are Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our Senior Vice President of Finance and Strategy. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we're making under the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Security Laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption forward-looking statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results. In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income and hold-normalized adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and hold-normalized adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted property EBITDA and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA and constant currency results, all of which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. We also want to inform you that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations Web site for your use. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest to participate. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon G. Adelson: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today and thank you for the introduction, Dan. I am pleased we continue to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter and despite the continuing challenges in the Macao market, we again delivered a strong set of financial results with companywide hold-normalized EBITDA reaching $1.70 billion. For full year 2015 and against a backdrop of 34% decline in Macao\u2019s gross gaming revenue, we generated companywide EBITDA of $4,200,000,000. This industry leading cash generation reflects both the strength of our business model and the geographic diversity of our cash flows, and underpins our balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we continue to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in new development opportunities. Our unique MICE-based integrated resort business model positively differentiates us from our competitors, in terms of both financial performance and economic contribution to our host jurisdictions. In Macao, our adjusted property EBITDA was up 7% quarter-on-quarter enabling us to finish 2015 with our best quarterly EBITDA for the year, despite the arrival of new competition. Our quarter four EBITDA margin in Macao improved both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands delivered another strong result on a constant currency basis and excluding the property tax refund. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Marina Bay Sands hold-normalized EBITDA was up 12% as mass win-per-day was up 6% and reached another quarterly record when measured in Singapore dollars. The Venetian Macau is today the iconic, must-see integrated resort destination in Macau welcoming over 30 million visitors annually and when we calculate all the visitation to all our properties, we have an average of 2 to 1 visitations from 30 million visitors. So we last year welcomed 61 million or 62 million visitors. That\u2019s an average of two visits to any one of our properties for each visitor. Despite all the headwinds and challenges of 2015, the Venetian Macau produced $1.1 billion of EBITDA for the year and was the only Macau property to exceed 1 billion plus in EBITDA. Indeed, the only other integrated resort property in the world that earned more than $1 billion in EBITDA for 2015 is at our Marina Bay Sands. I\u2019ve not a shadow of doubt that the Parisian, which is to open later this year, will replicate the success in the Venetian as another theme iconic, must-see integrated resort destination for Macau\u2019s visitors. In Macau, our share of EBITDA in the six operated markets has continued to increase and around 37% in the first nine months of 2015, up from 34% in 2014. In fact, in quarter three, our EBITDA share climbed to 38%. In Singapore, our share of EBITDA of the duopoly market increased to 68% in the first nine months of 2015, up from 65% in 2014. Because of industry leading investments in Macau and Singapore, we are unique in the absolute scale of our cash flow as well as our dominant share of the industry\u2019s cash flow. Scale, diversity and critical mass allows us to outperform our competitors. This was my plan when I conceived of the Cotai Strip. There was in one of the clippings I read this week, it said that the visitation or the GGR in Cotai, which is my baby, was 60% and the peninsula was 40% when it used to be virtually 100% to the peninsula. A retail mall portfolio is another unique differentiator. For 2015, the operating profit of our malls in Macau and Singapore reached $0.5 billion. I\u2019m pleased to highlight that despite the downturn in luxury retail in Greater China, our Macau mall revenue still grew by 4% in 2015. We are also clearly differentiated by the strength of our balance sheet. The balance sheet strength at 1.7 times net debt to EBITDA at year end allows us to stay fully committed to our development plans while continuing to return excess capital to shareholders. Again, this is unique in our industry. Now let me give you some additional highlights of our results in Macau for the quarter. For quarter four, Sands China EBITDA was $581 million, up 7% over the prior quarter. On a hold-normalized basis, EBITDA was $555 million, up 3% over prior quarter. We do see stabilization in gaming revenue trends. In the mass gaming segment, our non-rolling drop was down just 1% over the prior quarter, despite new competition that has predominately focused on the mass market. Our VIP rolling volumes were actually up 5% over the prior quarter outperforming the 2% sequential increase in the Macau market. We continue to benefit from the scale of our hotel room inventory. In a market with peak periods, the weekends and holidays matter more than ever before and where mass-market customers will generate the lion's share of future revenue and profit growth. We believe our capacity advantage will be further amplified. Weekends and public holidays, which represent about one-third of calendar days, generate almost half of our EBITDA. I was in Macau in mid-December to officiate at the opening of the St. Regis hotel. Despite adding 400 keys to our portfolio, our hotels were running at virtually full occupancy during the entire Christmas and Western New Year period. More importantly, the impact on our premium mass gaming revenue in the Himalaya casino at Sands Cotai Central has been very positive. Our win-per-unit in Dragon's Palace, the high limit area in Himalaya is running at about $16,000 since the St. Regis opening, an increase of over 60% when compared to the two months prior to the hotel opening. We will continue to make investments in Sands Cotai Central. In addition to the opening of the St. Regis hotel, we will also be expanding the retail mall in the Northwest corner of Sands Cotai Central and will open both Planet J and the Monkey King Theatre Show during the course of 2016. When Planet J is launched, it will be a one-of-a-kind attraction drawing families from across the region and beyond. We are also planning to connect a Parisian to Sands Cotai Central with an air-conditioned walkover bridge equipped with airport style moving sidewalks. In respect to cost efficiencies, we achieved approximately $250 million of savings in 2015 well in excess of our $200 million goal. Hold-normalized EBITDA margin in Macau improved by 130 basis points to 34.7% primarily reflecting cost efficiencies. I\u2019m pleased that since quarter one of 2015 we have been able to maintain high levels of market shares despite new competition while controlling costs and increasing labor productivity. We believe margin can continue to expand in the future and in particular as the Parisian opens. Rob will elaborate further in his discussion later. With the completion of the Parisian, we will have almost 13,000 hotel rooms in four interconnected hotels, over 840 stores across four shopping malls with the potential to add several hundred more stores in future development phases subject to government approval, 2 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space and four performance and event venues including our Venetian CotaiArena, which can be utilized either for our MICE business or major entertainment events. Business and leisure visitors to Macau will be able to enjoy all of this and more under one roof in one destination. In order to go to 13,000 hotel rooms, all these retail malls, all the individual stores, you won\u2019t have to leave the building. You\u2019ll be connected with air-conditioned pedestrian walkways, a one-of-a-kind in the world. I believe this will help to increase the length of stay in Macau as well as reduce overcrowding issues in the traditional tourism hotspots in Macau. I\u2019m encouraged that based on the latest government statistics, average length of stay for overnight visitors to Macau actually increased in 2015 from 1.9 nights to 2.1 nights. I believe this will further increase as we complete the next stage of our development on the Cotai Strip. We remain fully committed to playing the pioneering role in Macau\u2019s transformation into Asia\u2019s leading business and leisure tourism destination. Our track record in being transformative pioneers in MICE, retail, and entertainment speaks for itself. And no less important is the decade-long effort we have made in developing to promoting the local talent that is necessary to operate and grow our business over the long term. In 2004, only 7% of 900 or so managerial staff were locals. Today, 86% of our 2,700 or so managerial staff are locals. In summary, we regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macau\u2019s success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses, providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. We have steadfast confidence in both our and Macau\u2019s future success. Now moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We delivered another strong quarter at Marina Bay Sands, which despite the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar generated hold-normalized EBITDA of $375 million. As I mentioned earlier, on a constant currency basis and including the property tax refund, we received in last year\u2019s fourth quarter a hold-normalized EBITDA increased 12%. Mass win-per-day was $4.6 million. When adjusted for the currency effect, our mass win-per-day was up by 6% year-on-year resulting in our best-ever quarter in mass gaming revenues when measured in Singapore dollars. That strong performance was principally driven by the successful execution of our strategy to bring foreign premium mass customers to Singapore. Now on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders, yay dividends. We announced last quarter that the Las Vegas Sands' Board of Directors has approved a 10.8% increase in our recurring dividend program for the 2016 calendar year to $2.88 for the year or $0.72 per quarter. We remain committed to maintaining our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas and Sands China, and we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we remain optimistic in returning excess capital via a share repurchase program. We bought back $60 million of stock in the most recent quarter. We look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buyback program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity and balance sheet strength enable us to continue these recurring dividend and stock repurchase programs while retaining ample financial flexibility to invest for future growth and pursue new development opportunities. Thanks again for joining us on the call today, and now we\u2019ll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. Sheldon, in your prepared remarks you referenced that you do see stabilization in the mass segment. Can you talk about how you define stabilization, how you\u2019re looking at or what specifically you\u2019re looking at to gauge whether there\u2019s stabilization or not in the fourth quarter and in the 1Q? And then I have a quick follow up. Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson: Well, if you \u2013 look, it\u2019s just 70 years of experience that I have in business. So, after I made that verbal prognostication, which very hard to do prognostications particularly of the future. And I said to the inquirer, the personals not to the newspaper but to the person who was asking questions of me that I thought we had either hit bottom in the mass market or we are bottoming out. Ever since I said I\u2019ve been reading the issues, I\u2019m been reading from analyst reports and from other Sands China reports that I get daily, other clippings that people are starting to believe that and some of the numbers put out and experienced through December and January indicate to me that that\u2019s the case. It\u2019s not the case with every operator, every one of the six, it is the case with us. Joe Greff : Okay, great. And then Rob, can you just talk about your outlook for Las Vegas? I know it means less to you than Singapore or Macau, but I guess our view on Las Vegas right now it\u2019s a pretty good environment for room RevPAR growth and non-gaming spend. I guess maybe can you share with us what you\u2019re seeing on the gaming side particularly given some of the recent turmoil in the equity markets? Robert G. Goldstein: Running Las Vegas, Joe, is \u2013 I agree with you, the direction is positive. It\u2019s an ADR RevPAR story more than a gaming story. We have 7,100 keys right now in this environment and we think we can do over $400 million here annually if the markets hold up. All the segments are performing well, the FIT wholesale and I think it\u2019s been a strong year for the lodging side. Gaming is a mixed bag. We are very pleased with our mass slot and table business in the last quarter. We\u2019re seeing softness in the high end premium because it emanates from China and Asia. My view is the market in Las Vegas feels good, feels favorable and it\u2019s a RevPAR ADR lodging story more than anything else and visitation keeps climbing. I think Vegas is doing sale for too long and perhaps the market is responding favorably to the price \u2013 the price movement is in the right direction and good for everybody and we\u2019re certainly participating. So we\u2019re on line with you on that, we agree. Joe Greff : Great. Thanks, guys. Good job. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Rob, hi. Robert G. Goldstein: Hi, Felicia, how are you? Felicia Hendrix : Great. On the Parisian, you\u2019ve now seen two properties opened in the market, neither have moved the needle in terms of the impact to the market and you guys are obviously excited about the opening of your property. So I\u2019m just wondering as you have observed the performance of both properties, what learnings if any can you apply to the Parisian? And also I think there\u2019s been recent headlines that Win Palace might be delayed past June. Wondering if that could have any impact on your opening date for the Parisian? Robert G. Goldstein: Sheldon will take that. Sheldon G. Adelson: Yes. I\u2019ve answered this question in previous earning calls that I don\u2019t want to tell people what mistakes they\u2019ve made because in case they expand, I don\u2019t want my competitors to correct it. So all I could say is we think we\u2019re doing it right and if they\u2019re not going to expand like we will, then maybe they know something we don\u2019t know or maybe they don\u2019t know something that we do know. Felicia Hendrix : Maybe I can rephrase. In your prepared remarks you said Rob was going to touch more upon some of the exciting things that you were thinking about the Parisian, so maybe Rob could touch on that. Sheldon G. Adelson: Was it something I said? Felicia Hendrix : You did. In your prepared remarks, you said \u2013 you were talking about the Parisian and then you said Rob will have more to touch upon that later. Sheldon G. Adelson: I said that. Felicia Hendrix : So, Rob? Robert G. Goldstein: Yes, we see it pretty simple. I was there last week and without commenting on other properties, the Parisian is unique. It emulates the theme approach of the Venetian, which as Shell alluded to was a $1 billion property. The Venetian might be the greatest return on invested capital in this industry. And the fact is we think being on Cotai has a mass product with the kind of elements and attractions that I think will appeal to mass Chinese visitors. I think it is unique. I think when you walk on the floor as I did and you see the room product and the mass product we\u2019ve created there, it\u2019s pretty special. I\u2019d be really surprised if the Parisian doesn\u2019t do very, very well out of the gate. It\u2019s also on Cotai, which is our big positive as the migration moves from the peninsula to Cotai, it\u2019s got that built-in advantage of having that. And I just think we have the ability with a theme product, with our margin focus, with our ability to be on Cotai will be 13,000 sleeping rooms on Cotai. The Parisian is part of the family of success on Cotai that I think will be very strong. But again, I think the physical product, when you walk through it and you see that Parisian look and feel, it feels lot like another version of Venetian which I think is an inherent advantage. It can\u2019t be copied. So we feel very bullish about it. And with the opening of Win and Parisian next year that migration of revenue from peninsula to Cotai continues. So, yes, we feel very good about it and that\u2019s our take. You also mentioned the possible Win delay. I don\u2019t know any more than you do about the timing of Win Palace, so I think you have to ask the folks at Win about that. I just don\u2019t know any more than I\u2019ve read in the clippings. It sounds like they\u2019re still shooting for a summer opening but I don\u2019t know -- Felicia Hendrix : No, I was wondering if they were delayed if it would affect your opening timing. Robert G. Goldstein: No. We want to open as soon as we can. We believe the product will do very well, the sooner the better and it won\u2019t delay our opening at all. We plan to be open as soon as we can. If that\u2019s September, October, whenever it is, we\u2019ll open the doors. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. And then you saved more than you expected this year or last year in 2015. How should we think about cost savings in 2016? Robert G. Goldstein: We\u2019ll keep trying but I think the bulk of the cost savings are there for you to see. I\u2019m not sure where else we can \u2013 we can continue to be judicious about spend, we can look at all the areas from marketing, entertainment, payroll, gaming reinvestment OpEx, non-gaming OpEx. And obviously everything is on the table but we did 250 all-in this year and we just want to keep moving in that direction. But we are hoping for a growth in gaming revenues to make it best challenging on the cost side. So we feel very good what the teams achieved this year and we\u2019ll just keep looking for more. But again the lion\u2019s share is there. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Robert G. Goldstein: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Jones from Union Gaming. Your line is open. Chris Jones : Excellent. Thank you for taking my question. First, it\u2019s been about kind of the 10-year mark on Marina Bay Sands. I was wondering if you could comment about what your plans are for the Marina Bay Sands mall at this point. Robert G. Goldstein: You\u2019re ahead of us, Chris. It was opened in '10, so we\u2019re on our sixth year of operation there. Chris Jones : Okay. Sheldon G. Adelson: Are you talking about 10 years from the time the license was granted? Chris Jones : Right, precisely. Robert G. Goldstein: Well, we\u2019re six years into operation and I think the mall numbers there just keep getting better. We\u2019re very, very pleased with how it\u2019s performed. On a currency adjustment basis, it\u2019s up again and about 7% both in profit and sale. So feel really bullish. I was there last week and the mall has pretty much been re-merchandized by our retail team in a very favorable way. I think there\u2019s some softness in the Singapore retail market but we\u2019re not feeling it. Both our luxury and our mass sales are up and feel very good about it. And it just keeps getting better and that\u2019s our take on Singapore retail. Chris Jones : And then just my quick follow up as it relates to just development and given that Japan is delayed a little bit, are [indiscernible] what are you guys thinking about other development beyond that, whether it be South America, Brazil or back in the United States in New Jersey? Any comments there? Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson: Can I finish on what Rob said? Chris Jones : Okay. Sheldon G. Adelson: Orchard Road according to the clippings was down across the board and Marina Bay Sands \u2013 the shops at Marina Bay Sands was up, were 100% rented and notwithstanding that the most popular street in all of Asia, Orchard Road in Singapore went down, the shops at Marina Bay Sands went up. Chris Jones : Thank you. As it relates to development opportunities outside of Macau, are there opportunities perhaps in Asia or rest of the world? Sheldon G. Adelson: We continue to lobby in four countries; Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and the newly elected President or Prime Minister of Taiwan does not offer a lot of optimism for changing the previously approved Taiwan Strait legalizing gaming, enabling gaming in the Taiwanese Strait to the Mainland, which there was discussion of before. The current head of the government said \u2013 I don\u2019t know which Prime Minister or President said that \u2013 at the clippings say that she is anti-gaming in our programming. So we\u2019ll cross off Taiwan as a potential for the time being. But the Asians don\u2019t move very fast. So we are watching if we have people in various places representing us and as soon as something happens there we\u2019ll be right there paying attention to it. We are interested in Northern New Jersey but right now we don\u2019t have though I\u2019m interested in buying out a casino in Atlantic City. It looks like Atlantic City will \u2013 Atlantic City operators will have the first option to apply within 60 days with a plus \u2013 1 billion or a plus program to open in Northern New Jersey. If that doesn\u2019t work out or they don\u2019t provide the components that non-Atlantic City operators can provide, it will be that the government will reach out outside of the Atlantic City operators. We feel that with a much focused \u2013 a convention focused marketing theme and development theme business model that we would be a prime candidate. You mentioned Brazil, we haven\u2019t gone to Brazil but we\u2019re contemplating doing that. We\u2019re in touch with somebody down there who\u2019s got a business going, some Americans and be knowing [ph] for many years. And so we\u2019re going to look at that. But we have some concerns about inflation and about the currency and about the economy there. So we think it\u2019s potentially a very good opportunity. And outside of that, we are interested in Atlanta. And I read a clipping recently last week that the state of Texas is interested in getting rid of the eight-liners, whatever they call them, of which there are tens if not hundreds of thousands of slots. They\u2019re everywhere and the possibility if that exist that we would be a candidate for one of the main cities, maybe Dallas and Fort Worth or Houston which would be the leading candidates for us. So wherever there\u2019s an opportunity, we\u2019re looking at everything. We don\u2019t miss one. Robert G. Goldstein: One follow-up comment to Sheldon about New Jersey. We\u2019d very much be interested if they weren\u2019t real multibillion dollars worth to create bona fide tours and MICE opportunities and not just simply overtaxed slot bonds, we don\u2019t do that. But if that opportunity is there, we\u2019d be keenly interested. Chris Jones : Perfect. Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson: You said the English phrase keen -- Robert G. Goldstein: Keen; excited. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe a little bit more of a theoretical question but I think part of the economists out there currently are pretty focused on what\u2019s going on in the currency markets. And I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts a little bit on what do you see the impact of a weakening RMB being both sort of the fundamentals that you\u2019ve kind of gone through so far in Macau? And more importantly I think if we\u2019re to see a more material devaluation in the future, what do you think some of the fallout or potential implications for Macau and Singapore could be? Sheldon G. Adelson: I\u2019ll leave that up to Patrick to answer. Patrick Dumont : So, it\u2019s a very interesting discussion. I think the hardest part about it that we\u2019ve seen in the last quarter is the change in our purchasing power in dollars so that as you noticed in our financials we actually show a currency-adjusted result from Marina Bay Sands. So that\u2019s the near-term impact from the changing of the RMB in the devaluation. I think long term, it\u2019s really hard to call. I think it\u2019s hard for anyone to figure out exactly what the impact will be and how the currency may continue to devalue. The only thing is we\u2019re looking at hedging programs, we\u2019re speaking to economists and doing our best to evaluate the impact to the business. But in terms of long-term impact on our customers, it\u2019s hard to say. A devaluation of currency could impact manufacturing economy there and drive further growth in the economy. Other people have different views. So now we\u2019re just studying it and hopefully we\u2019ll continue to grow our business in the face of any currency changes that may occur. Shaun Kelley : That\u2019s helpful, Patrick. Maybe just one follow up on it. Do you guys think you saw any impact just to the typical mass consumer due to a weaker RMB in the fourth quarter? I mean, putting it differentially, do you think actually numbers could have been a little bit stronger if you hadn\u2019t had an RMB headwind or is it too difficult to tell? Robert G. Goldstein: Shaun, it\u2019s Rob. My sense is that \u2013 we really can\u2019t discern that at this point. Our fourth quarter our mass revenues are fine, our retail spend was pretty good relative to the market. I think it\u2019s early to tell. I think it\u2019s more \u2013 my personal belief it\u2019s more economic concerns if people who are gambling in Macau felt more comfortable or felt they\u2019re going to do well financially. It\u2019s like any place in the world. You gamble based on what you expect your earning ability to be. I think it\u2019s too early to make that decision about RMB and customers. I think we are seeing Macau get stronger but I think it\u2019s really the key thing for most of our customers is how \u2013 well, I heard more people in the last week is how is my job, how is my business, how is the economy doing? That seems to be the focal point. Sheldon G. Adelson: When the mass market comes into Macau, they don\u2019t know about the currency exchange. They too transfer the RMB and it\u2019s not an issue with the mass market. They\u2019re not foreign exchange fixated. Yes, there are people who [indiscernible] and absolutely are fixated with foreign exchange, but those guys are in the VIP category. But the mass market, they earn so many Renminbi, it\u2019s the same rate of about eighth to the U.S. dollar and they could buy MOP, the Macau currency or they could buy the Hong Kong currency and play with that. So, I don\u2019t think that it has a big impact on the mass market. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you all very much. Sheldon G. Adelson: You\u2019re welcome. Robert G. Goldstein: Thanks, Shaun. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Sheldon, bigger picture, if you think about that your balance sheet and your capital needs going forward, which obviously after the opening of the Parisian will lessen and you try and conceptualize that with some of the developments that you mentioned and the likelihood of them coming, what is a net leverage level that you feel comfortable running the business and obviously delivering the capital returns that you guys have and we expect you to continue to? Sheldon G. Adelson: It\u2019s higher than what it is today. If we\u2019re at 1.7 \u2013 what did I say? 1.7 or 1.9. Robert G. Goldstein: Yes. Sheldon G. Adelson: 1.7, you\u2019re going to understand coming from a poor family that I come from to have tens of billions of dollars property with debt, which I\u2019m fundamentally debt adverse, at 1.7 times it\u2019s like a fantasy to me. If I were younger I could have dreamt that if I knew that I ever achieve this, I could have dreamt about that. But I never dreamt that I could be down to 1.7 and some of our debt is at sub-2%. And I think the highest of our debt of our first lien properties like 2.5, something like that. So I\u2019m extremely happy. And so I think we\u2019re far away \u2013 and I\u2019d be comfortable in my minimum level of comfort, which is still large is somewhere between 2.5 and 3 personally. But I\u2019m going to listen to the Board of Directors. Carlo Santarelli : Great, thank you. And one follow up -- Sheldon G. Adelson: You may know they don\u2019t listen to me. Carlo Santarelli : Rob, and I think Sheldon mentioned in the prepared remarks you guys had already achieved 215 million. I think on the prior call you mentioned 175 million with upside to maybe 230 million or so. If you think about that 215 million and the buckets where it\u2019s come from, could you kind of talk a little bit about how you\u2019ve parse through that if it\u2019s predominately labor, et cetera? Robert G. Goldstein: The biggest number is payroll, Carlo, and the second biggest number would be marketing, entertainment costs. The third biggest number would be non-gaming OpEx, about 20%. And the smallest will be gaming reinvested in OpEx. So it\u2019s kind of evenly divided among those four categories. As a reference to Felicia, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve got a whole lot more room to grow in those cost areas. At some point you start cutting into the muscle instead of the fat but we\u2019re comfortable we can maintain it and we\u2019re continuing to probe for more opportunities. A lot of people have taken on the entertainment and other issues. We used to run first in Macau. We\u2019re happy to see control of those areas and be a ticket buyer versus an entertainment purchaser. So, we\u2019re a little more conservative. I think we \u2013 again, the majority is out of the business now. So I wouldn\u2019t look for whole lot more growth as far as cost cutting. And also I should reference that we\u2019re carrying an awful lot of people and dollars being spent on payroll as we move into the Parisian. That will be a big shift away from the operating side, the overhead SCL once Parisian opens up in the fall. Sheldon G. Adelson: We already got rid of a guy who used to have multimillion dollar losses on entertainment for major performers. We already got rid of him because he called those brand builders. We already have brand, so we don\u2019t make those mistakes anymore. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Thank you both very much. Robert G. Goldstein: Thanks, Carlo. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. I have two questions. One is with Chinese New Year approaching, do you have any kind of observations about whether you feel like there was sufficient liquidity in the junket system to keep the number of junkets that are active there through that period? And then I have a question about the Parisian as well. Robert G. Goldstein: Robin, I was there with a number of the junket groups last week. I do think there\u2019s sufficient liquidity and I do think we\u2019ve got sufficient gaming capacity because we\u2019re going to increase our \u2013 I saw the count this morning. We feel like it\u2019s a good run up as far as room bookings and reservations, lodging and casino for Chinese New Year and we do think the junkets \u2013 the ones that are still standing and we met with some of the top people the last week. We feel actually they\u2019re in pretty good shape and there\u2019s sufficient liquidity. Obviously, some have folded. I think more will fold later this year. But the people we\u2019re doing business with, we\u2019re very comfortable with and those who have stopped doing business are paying their bills and performing admirably, so feel good about that. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the Parisian, I know you said you hope to open as soon as possible but can you just maybe clarify at this point are there any permits or anything \u2013 anything gating issues that are kind of not in your control, some kind of government approval or permit that could keep you from opening if you were the day that you\u2019re ready to open whenever that may be, if there are other things outside of just the progress of you construction? Sheldon G. Adelson: Instead of listing all of those we can list a handful of things that are in our control. The government wants \u2013 I believe the government wants us to open as soon as we can. Robert G. Goldstein: That\u2019s the indication. Sheldon G. Adelson: That\u2019s the indication that\u2019s we\u2019re getting but I think we will open \u2013 look, I haven\u2019t discussed that in length with my staff but I\u2019m personally thinking about the possibility of an early opening and partial opening. We just turned over 1,000 rooms to operations from the construction department to start installing furniture, fixtures and equipment, FF&E. It\u2019s amazing that eight months before a scheduled opening, which we\u2019re scheduling to September that we\u2019re turning rooms over to the operations to provide the finishes and installing FF&E, it\u2019s never happened before I don\u2019t think in any property. And so our power in the rooms are going very well. So if we could finish a lot of those, maybe if the opportunity presents itself, maybe we could do a partial opening at summer time but our scheduled opening is mid-September. Now that could change because of weather, of our labor or the government. There\u2019s no indication that there\u2019s any major obstacle that the government is interested in putting in our place to prevent our opening. And I\u2019ll just tell you that the reason we\u2019re successful is because we\u2019ve build something different and interesting. Beyond that, I won\u2019t give anything because I once saw a movie about Houdini. It said that he didn\u2019t disclose his secrets. So I\u2019m taking a hint out of there. Robin Farley : Okay. Thanks very much. Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson: No further questions? Operator : No further questions at this time, sir. Sheldon G. Adelson: Well, we can either stop or give you answers without questions? Robert G. Goldstein: Thanks very much for your time. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Angel, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call, led by Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Briggs, you may begin your conference. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Angel. Joining me on the call today are Sheldon Adelson, Rob Goldstein and Patrick Dumont. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results. In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income and hold-normalized adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and hold-normalized adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted property EBITDA and hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA and constant currency results, all of which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. We also want to inform you that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for your use. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest to participate. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased we continued to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter, and despite the continuing challenges in the Macao market, we again delivered a strong set of financial results with company-wide hold-normalized EBITDA reaching $1.031 billion, an improvement over the first quarter of 2015. This resilience and consistency in cash generation reflect both the strength of our business model and the geographic diversity of our cash flows, which in turn, underpins our balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we can and will continue to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in new development opportunities. Our unique mass-based Integrated Resort business model continues to positively differentiate us from our competitors, in terms of both financial performance and economic contribution to our (03:09). In Macao, we gained market share revenue despite the competitive impact of two new properties. And we improved operating margin as we continued to reap significant benefits from our cost control programs. Last quarter, I commented that we are beginning to see the first signs of stabilization in our Macao operations. It is therefore very encouraging to report that this quarter, we experienced our first sequential increase in mass gaming revenues in Macao since quarter one of 2014. Our Macao portfolio-wide mass revenue per day was up 5% sequentially. And at Venetian Macao, mass table revenue per day was up 10%, which is no small feat considering the arrival of new competition. Our share of EBITDA in the six-operating Macao market has continued to increase to around 37% in 2015, up from 35% in 2014. In fact, at quarter four, our EBITDA share climbed to 39%. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands delivered another strong result. On a constant-currency basis, Marina Bay Sands' hold-normalized EBITDA was up 10% against the prior year, as mass win-per-day increased by 10% to reach another quarterly record when measured in Singapore dollars. Our share of normalized EBITDA in the duopoly market increased to 68% in 2015, up from 58% in 2014. Because of our industry-leading investments in both Macao and Singapore, we are unique in the absolute scale of our cash flow, as well as our dominant share of the industry's cash flow. Scale, diversity and critical mass allow us to outperform our competitors. Our retail mall portfolio in Asia is another unique differentiator. For 2015, the operating profit of our malls in Macao and Singapore reached $0.5 billion. I'm pleased to highlight that despite the downturn in luxury retail (05:45), our Macao mall revenue still grew by 9% during the first quarter of 2016. We are also clearly differentiated by the strength of our balance sheet. That balance sheet strength at 1.9 times net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the first quarter allows us to stay fully committed to our development plans, while continuing to return excess capital to shareholders. Again, this is unique in our industry. The Venetian Macao remains the iconic must-see Integrated Resort destination in Macao, welcoming over 30 million visitors annually. That's almost as many visitors as the Macao market generates as a whole. Despite all the headwinds and challenges in the marketplace, The Venetian Macao produced $268 million of EBITDA for the quarter, essentially flat against the prior year. I have not a shadow of doubt that The Parisian, which is targeted to open in mid-September, will replicate the success of The Venetian as another themed iconic and must-see Integrated Resort destination for Macao's visitors. I believe the positioning of The Parisian Macao caters well to both the current Macao market conditions and the long-term growth trends in Chinese outbound tourism. The Parisian will be a themed premium destination where the aspirational themed appeal of its public spaces, attractions and amenities is combined with affordable hotel accommodations, providing a complementary offering to the (07:45) at The Venetian Macao. Our existing portfolio has clearly enabled us to hold our own amidst new competition, and I am extremely confident we will see growth in Macao in the future with the opening of The Parisian. With respect to expenses and profit margin, we exited 2015 with annualized cost reduction of around $250 million. I believe we can achieve further savings in 2016. Moreover, as we open The Parisian Macao, we will be able to increase labor productivity and redeploy staff to operate the new property. Rob and Patrick can elaborate on this later, but additional cost avoidance from staff transfers will amount to approximately $140 million on an annualized basis. Together with targeted savings of an additional $60 million on an annualized basis, we anticipate having a total benefit to our current operations in 2017 of approximately $200 million after we open The Parisian later this year. The combination of incremental revenue from Parisian and our various cost efficiency programs should further strengthen our industry-leading cash flow generation, which in turn underpins our balance sheet strength and dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China Ltd. Now, let me give you some additional highlights of our results in Macao for the quarter. For Q1, Sands China EBITDA was $518 million, down 2% over the same quarter last year. Encouragingly, we experienced solid sequential growth across our gaming segments. Our revenue per day grew by 5% in premium mass, 6% in base mass and 2% in slots. Our premium direct rolling volumes increased by 9% sequentially. Hold-normalized EBITDA margin in Macao improved by 200 basis points to 32%, primarily reflecting cost efficiencies. I am pleased that since quarter one of 2015, we have been able to maintain high levels of market share despite new competition while controlling costs, increasing labor productivity and continuing to invest in destination marketing in China and in the development programs for our local employees. We are on track to deliver a further operating margin improvement following the opening of The Parisian. While competition in our hotel cash sales market has increased, particularly on weekdays and non-peak periods, we continue to benefit from the scale of our hotel room inventory. In a market with weak periods, the weekends and holidays matter more than ever before and where mass-market customers will generate the lion's share of future revenue and profit growth. We believe our capacity advantages will be further amplified. The two-week period over Chinese New Year shows this advantage, with average hotel occupancy of 98% and EBITDA up over 20% when compared with the corresponding two-week Chinese New Year period last year. With the completion of Parisian, we will have almost 13,000 hotel rooms in four interconnected resorts, over 850 stores across four shopping malls, 2 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space and four performance and event venues, including our Venetian Cotai Arena, which can be utilized, either for our MICE business or major entertainment events. Business and leisure visitors to Macao will be able to enjoy all of this and more, under one roof at one destination. I believe this will help to increase visitors' (12:15) average length of stay at Macao. It is encouraging that for the two months of 2016, the number of Macao visitors who have stayed overnight in our hotel increased by 14% compared with the prior year, even though overall visitor arrivals decreased by 1% during the same period. I believe Parisian Macao, with its premium and iconic destination appeal, coupled with affordable and plentiful accommodation will help drive sustainable growth in overnight visitors to the Cotai Strip. We remain fully committed to playing the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Our track record in being transformative pioneers in MICE, retail and entertainment speak for itself. In summary, we regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses, providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. We have steadfast confidence in both our and Macao's future success. Now, moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore; we delivered another strong quarter at Marina Bay Sands, which despite the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, generated hold-normalized EBITDA of $383 million. As I mentioned earlier, on a constant currency basis, our hold-normalized EBITDA increased 10%. On a constant currency basis, our mass win per day reached another all-time quarterly record and was up 10% year-on-year. This strong performance was principally driven by the successful execution of our strategy to bring foreign premium mass customers to Singapore. Now on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders. We announced last quarter that the Las Vegas Sands board of directors has approved a 10.8% increase in our recurring dividend program for the 2016 calendar year to $2.88 for the year or $0.72 per quarter. We remain committed to maintaining our recurring dividend program at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, and we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future, as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic in returning excess capital via our share repurchase program. While we chose not to repurchase any stock in the quarter ended March 31, we look forward to continuing to utilize the stock repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity and balance sheet strength enable us to continue to use recurring dividend and stock repurchase programs, while retaining ample financial flexibility to invest for future growth, and pursue new development opportunities. Lastly, we announced the SEC settlement of the FCPA matter on April 7. We're pleased to have that matter behind us. I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today. And now we'll take some questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, everybody. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hi, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sheldon, you referenced stabilization a few times in your prepared remarks, much like you did three months ago on the prior earnings call. My question for you is this, does the Macao market feel less stable in the last month-and-a-half versus the two months of the year? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Joe. It's Rob. Sheldon stepped out for just a second. He'll be back. I'm sure he'd like to answer the question, but I'll give you my take on that. I think the, March was obviously disappointing. We had a really great January, February. March certainly softened up. Worldwide, I think Chinese tourism and consumer numbers are pretty depressing across the globe. And certainly, it was a little bit soft than we hoped in Macao. That was not the case in Singapore, but in Macao, we saw a downturn. But we feel great. Cumulatively in the quarter, our mass revenues, both our premium and the mass-mass side continued to grow. We had some margin pressure, as you see, Q-on-Q, but we feel like the numbers \u2013 really, our quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year, our mass numbers, which we think is the most pivotal metric in Macao in terms of GGR continues to grow. I think, if anything, we're encouraged by the first quarter and the year-on-year comps. March was a \u2013 we hope was an aberration and we'll see a return with their April, May and June. Sheldon, like I said, stepped out for a second, but that's \u2013 I think it's a pretty clear take that we believe there is stability. We believe we might even see growth, but clearly, it was a challenging March. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then \u2013 thank you, Rob. And then, Rob, another question for you. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : If we assume that Wynn opened Palace in early August and you obviously announced today September opening for Parisian, why wouldn't you want to give more time between those two openings and letting the market absorb it versus opening it several weeks after maybe a bigger, certainly more CapEx property opening up in front of yours? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, you could make the argument either way, couldn't you? You could argue they had more time to absorb, you could argue the impact of the Wynn Palace on top of The Parisian could be a very powerful catalyst for the market. There's no way to handicap that perfectly. I have a funny feeling that Wynn will be an inflection point to the market as will Parisian, and I think opening them within the same 30 days or 40 days isn't going to matter a whole lot. So, you wait until November or you wait until December, what's that mean? Not a whole lot. I'm a believer that these two products are unique. They're pretty special. I'm hoping they turn the corner a bit. I don't want to be Pollyanna-ish and think that the day's going to turn around, but I think I have a lot of confidence in what Steve Wynn's building and a lot of confidence with Mr. Adelson's building. So, I believe these two products might be the inflection point to the market, and we're actually eager to open The Parisian. I walked through it not too long ago. It's a wonderful product. It's mass driven, lots of sleeping rooms, very eye-catching, very similar in mindset to the themed concept of The Venetian. And we all know what Steve Wynn can do with a new opening. We have a lot of hope that that'll turn the corner in the market as well. So, I don't think there's any reason to wait an extra day or 10 days. What's the point? Let's open. Let's drive hopefully some more visitation and more revenue to Cotai. It does, by the way, complete the visions that happened years ago when Sheldon went to Cotai a long time ago. I think with Steve opening there and with the new Parisian product, I think, Sheldon's vision is really in full force. It will move the GGR deal completely over to the majority of GGR will emanate from Cotai. Actually, we're pretty enthused about it and think it's the culmination, and MGM comes on in 2017. So it feels good to us, Joe. It feels right to us in spite of what is a difficult market today. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks, guys. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. On Singapore, in Sheldon's prepared remarks, I think he talked about how your strategy of attracting foreign premium mass customers is working. The market in general did see a big pickup in Chinese visitation. Are you seeing that business impact at all? And any other color would be helpful. Thanks. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. It's Rob, Thomas. To your point, 34% increase year-on-year in Chinese visitation to Singapore is very impressive. I think Singapore is just \u2013 it's a jewel for us. We're very happy with the quarter. It's unfortunate we suffered both the currency issues, we can't control that unfortunately, and we had some bad luck in the rolling segment. But if you take our numbers and really dissect what happened there, our retail business was strong. At 98% occupancy, ADR is climbing close to $400. Our non-rolling business was just terrific at $4.8 million a day, heading for that $5 million a day number. Our margins exceeded 66% on that non-rolling business. We're seeing more foreign visitation, better quality hotel guests and the continuing phenomenon of what we did in Singapore is just very exciting to us. It's a solid property. It had a bad piece of luck. It happens occasionally. We've held now close to $300 billion with a cumulative life-to-date hold percentage exceeding 2.7, so obviously that's simply a blip. But we're very encouraged by the non-rolling numbers, very encouraged by visitation, quality of visitation. The government of Singapore's vision has been realized in terms of what we're getting there. We are very fortunate to be there. It's a shame we hold 1.5%. We lost about $135 million of win disappear with that hold percentage. But if you take that out, the resting (22:50) was very fat and happy and we're delighted to be there. Our performance, despite the actual results being less than we'd like them to be, it was a very, very good quarter for us there. And to your comment, more quality Chinese and other regional visitations are occurring to Singapore and it's very, very exciting to watch. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks. And just as my follow up, just on Macao, Rob. Earlier you talked about seeing some quarter-over-quarter margin pressure there. Can you just talk about the promotional environment? Thanks. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yes. It's unfortunately \u2013 well, fortunately or unfortunately, it's not promotional from our perspective. What really happened, Thomas, as Sheldon referenced, I think is a good story. We had Q-on-Q increases in our mass revenues, very encouraging. We had three hits on the negative delta : a retail turnover rent, which is a seasonal issue, cost us $22 million; we took a bad debt hit of $22 million versus Q4; and we had some weakness, honestly, in the rooms in non-gaming side, F&B, about $17 million. It resulted in a less than \u2013 what we hoped for the quarter to be like $475 million (23:56) and unfortunately those factors are a negative delta for us. But I think the most encouraging thing, and I think Sheldon referenced it, is just we're seeing some strength in premium mass and I think that goes to our core story, which is we're Cotai focused, we're mass focused, we've got diversity of room product, diversity of hotel product, lots of retail, 2 million square feet post Parisian, and we've got a very strong presence in Cotai. And when Sheldon started years ago, I think, it's rare you see a vision come to life, but you're seeing it. Unfortunately, this quarter, we had some setbacks in three areas that it happened, and it cost us about $60 million. We would have otherwise had a much fatter quarter in Macao. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Haverty with GAMCO. Your line is open. Lawrence J. Haverty - The Gabelli Multimedia Trust, Inc.: Yes, hi. I was just curious \u2013 I'm sure you people have been watching the MGM REIT offering. If you could walk us through the rules on Singapore, any thoughts you may have on monetization of the mall and what kind of multiple those assets are trading at in Asia. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We always have thoughts of monetizing anything except our core assets. We have been thinking about we cannot monetize anything until 2017 in Singapore. That's the rules under which we got our license. So, we have been approached. We have been talking to people. The cap rates are attractive, and we may or may not sell a portion. We don't know \u2013 I'm going next month to see the government in Singapore and we'll see what they think about it. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I'd add one thing to Sheldon's comments is that part of the reason we've been looking at selling that mall, he always thought about selling malls as we did here in Las Vegas 12 years ago. The one thing Sheldon has been steadfast about is maximizing the value. You've seen that mall in this difficult environment continues to produce more EBITDA every month, every quarter. It did again this quarter. Our team over there has done a great job of merchandising that mall to a level where it's the premier mall in Singapore we believe. And it just keeps getting better. We recognize interest rates are at historical favorable position for us and for the first time Mr. Adelson has taken at least some \u2013 fielded some phone calls from people who want to buy a part of that. So it's under consideration. It's a very valuable mall. I think cap rates are going to be extraordinary for that mall, or for any mall we sell over there. But I think his vision of not selling it has been vindicated, because it just keeps getting better. It got to $100 million, then $125 million, $150 million. We think it just keeps going, and maybe $200 million makes that mall probably one of the most valuable malls in the world today, if not the most valuable. So we're very excited. Lawrence J. Haverty - The Gabelli Multimedia Trust, Inc.: We're talking about a 3%, 4% cap rate, I presume, Rob. Right? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think, Mr. Adelson and most people would say 3%, 4%, he might be more aggressive than that. But I'll let him comment. Yes, God bless him. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yes, I think that it appears, based upon the conversations we've been having that a cap rate between 3% and 4% is doable. Of course, if we get down to 3%, why can't we get down to 2%-something? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And there lies the magic. But I will tell you that our team over there, led by David Sylvester, just keeps improving that mall. And we've got some more deals in the pipeline we're working on that it just gets better. If you haven't been there recently, you should go visit. It's very impressive, and we think it just keeps moving upward. So you marry that to these wonderful cap rates, and it's a great story for us and for the first time we're at least listening to people's perspectives. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Trump is not the only guy that's a good negotiator. I've been accused of that. Lawrence J. Haverty - The Gabelli Multimedia Trust, Inc.: That's all for me. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Larry. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You mentioned in the remarks earlier, obviously, about the $140 million of labor shifting and then an additional $60 million. Obviously, you guys had over $200 million of cost saves this year. How should we think about where you are in the current program, and then as we think about 2016, beyond the labor, that incremental $60 million, what segments do you plan to attack? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Carlo, it's Patrick. How are you? Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. And yourself? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Very good, thanks. So the $250 million has been realized. The number is in the books. You see the effect of that through the first quarter. The $60 million that was referred to in the script is new incremental cost savings. The $140 million is labor and other expense that will actually be shifted over to The Parisian once it begins operation. So what you're looking at is $200 million that would be cost savings in the existing asset base in 2017. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then if you guys could, obviously, the direct business on the VIP side has trended a little bit better than the junket business, per se. Could you talk a little bit about those customers and where they're coming from? Or are those just customers coming from outside of mainland China that are more your direct customers? Or are you starting to see junket customers more so playing on a direct basis with you guys? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Carlo. It's Rob. I think it's a mixture of both of those. We're actually seeing some older Hong Kong customers we've known for 100 years who keep coming in and gamble large and have no issue. We're also seeing some mainland business that has come over from the junket side. To your point, we're trading up in that segment. It's getting better, it's improving. I don't think at the end of the day it's going to be that material. We're really more focused on the growth of our mass story. We'll take the business \u2013 we'll only take the credit we feel very comfortable with. We're very, very I guess demanding in terms of credit issuance. But the story there is better, it's improving. The junket business may be a small contributor, but most of the people in that segment are really people we've known for a lot of years who are very established, have large bank accounts that can move the money without any issue, and it's a positive story, but I think our real focus, our real belief in the future of Cotai is going to be in that mass, premium mass growth. That's where we're going to make most of our dollars. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Rob or Sheldon, I just wanted to touch a little more on maybe some of the non-gaming in Macao that you guys saw. It looks like on the one side we saw year-over-year growth of 4% in the mass market, which we haven't seen in close to two years. On the other side, if we look at just sort of the non-gaming categories of rooms, retail, food and beverage and convention, I think, all-in we're calculating that it was probably down about 10% year-on-year. So as you think about new capacity coming into the market, could you help us just think about what you're seeing in the non-gaming side of the business at the moment? Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think on the retail side, there is the slowdown in China that is affecting the amount of money that people are spending. There's certain categories of the retail that are doing good and there are other categories that are not doing as good. The room rates, which are the biggest non-gaming category are the other properties that have opened, Studio City and Phase 2 of the Galaxy, they're dropping rates because they're trying to fill up their rooms. They don't have the MICE-based pressure on room demands like we do. So they're dropping their rates, their ADRs, and so we've got to compete with that. But I don't see that this is going to be permanent. When we open The Parisian I'm completely confident, more than confident. Just take a look at the picture of The Parisian. It's in the supplemental deck, you can \u2013 what page is that? Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: 14. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Page 14. You can see the picture, and that is going to be a really, really major attraction. It'll be equal to The Venetian, but of course The Venetian, we've competed against two new openings and The Venetian is still attracting virtually a number equal to the entire visitation in all of Macao. I think the number was 30 million. So, as I've said repeatedly, the industry is cyclical. We're not going down on the rooms. There are conversations about the VIP. Some of the analysts and some of the journalists are talking about and quoting some of the junket operators. The junket market has stabilized. The mass market has increased. It's performed better, and I think we can look forward to more of that. And as far as the non-gaming is concerned, people have to eat, they have to sleep, they want to be entertained, there are the non-gaming elements that I think will pick up again and do better in the future. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Shaun, just a couple thoughts on our retail for a second. We traded down to $86.5 million for the quarter, which gives a run rate of $340 million or so. So if you cap that at some reasonable number, it's still worth $8 billion, $9 billion that retail mall which is (34:56) our buildings there. And although it's down from $95.3 million, it's still a great asset. It does two things : it creates lots of EBITDA, $350 million a year, roughly $340 million. It also creates lots of sticky visitation. People sleep in the building. It helps our room sales. So I think our retail business there still is incredibly important and $340 million, $350 million of EBITDA. On the issue of room sales we've been doing it longer than anybody else over there. We're more diverse. We have more penetration. We have 13,000 keys to sell nightly as of this fall. So I think our team has been on the ground a lot longer and we sell a lot more rooms than anybody else. We have to, because we have more rooms than anybody else. And so I think our focus on non-gaming is very high. It's still a very important business. Other people will focus more on the pure gaming play. But I do think we'll survive and succeed despite more rooms coming online. Again, as you know, it's a weekend holiday-driven market. That's where we excel. That's where we make most our EBITDA, and that combination of the shopping, the retail, the diversity of room product and our room team selling retail rooms to a non-gamer. We're trying to penetrate mainland China. Our focus is not to sell rooms cheaply in Hong Kong to people looking for the best deal. That's what's happening a lot in that market is deep discounting where you can buy a room for sub-$100 a day. Our goal and our team's goal is to stay occupied with mostly people coming from further away, a larger shopping/gaming budget, and I think that's going to prove to be a very big advantage for us in The Parisian and throughout the entire portfolio. We're longer doing this, we're better at it, so we have more experience. And again, we have the convention space as well. So we're very focused on maximizing our retail non-gaming portfolio in Macao. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you both for all the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thank you. Rob and Sheldon, you guys have made your excitement for the opening of The Parisian very clear. But as you prepare for the opening and then the new competition coming from your peers, what are you doing at your other properties in Macao in terms of maybe slot floor reconfiguration, new restaurants, attractions and so on to prepare for the new competition? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Look, it's an ongoing process. Sheldon's authorized us, we're basically spending a lot of money to rehab our products and keep them fresh. We're in the middle of a redo of every room at The Venetian, as we speak, redoing all the Four Seasons rooms. We are looking at our F&B offerings with a little more of a jaundiced eye, if you will. We're looking closely at how we can do better. We don't think we've done as well. Some of our competitors have done very well in the restaurant offerings. We're very happy with our retail. We're less happy with some of our F&B. We want to get better at that. But, to your point, it's a very competitive place, $20 billion of fresh capital coming online last year and this year. We need to be very good at this and last one is Macao, we made a concerted effort to rethink a lot of our F&B offerings, redo the rooms, redo gaming floors, constantly reinvesting in the slot machines, always buying new games, new ETGs, rethinking signage, rethinking floors, keeping The Venetian fresh. It's the only asset left in Macao that does $1 billion-plus. It's approaching its, what, ninth year anniversary? Actually, tenth year next year. So, it's an amazing machine, but you've got to respect the customer and always reinvest in F&B, retail, the room offerings, and we're very, very cognizant. And our CapEx budget for Macao is extraordinary, hundreds of millions of dollars annually. So we're very focused on that as well as our shortcomings how to get better. Very competitive market, very serious people coming to the market with new products on Cotai. We're very, very careful and constantly reexamining how we can do better in Macao. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Felicia, this is Sheldon. We have good news and we have a little less than good news. The good news is that my vision about Cotai Strip has come to fruition. That the Cotai Strip has taken over the majority percentage of the GGR, the gross gaming revenue in Macao. You've been around long enough to remember back in 2004 when Stanley Ho and I had \u2013 we had disagreements over whether or not Cotai was going to even survive. And at that time, I said the Peninsula is going to be comparable to the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas downtown. But we can easily pick up the Sands tables and bring them to Macao and make the hold 100% best. But the fact is that the bridge from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Zhuhai-Macao bridge will be opening, I think, in 2017 or 2018 and nobody knows how it will affect the \u2013 we don't know where \u2013 the islands that are off the Peninsula where everybody is going to park, they'll distribute the visitors by bus. So we don't know where those bus routes are going to be, but everybody believes that will help out the Peninsula. And of course, I just read an article today that the light rail won't be completed until 2019. So that still leaves three years waiting for that. So, of course, we're doing everything we can to maintain the growth potential of the other properties. We're not going to \u2013 because we think The Parisian is going to be a whopper of an opening and a whopper of an operating (41:14) that we're going to ignore the other places. No, no, no, we're doing everything we can. We're improving the retail, we're improving the rooms, we've allocated money for The Venetian. Look, 30 million visitors, which is equivalent to one visit for every visitor coming into Macao is something to write home about. So, we're not ignoring and we're not going to rest on our laurels. We're going to continue to promote and continue to market our other properties. And we just believe that without a doubt in our mind, The Parisian opening will be the best by far of all the six concessionaires opening new properties. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for that. And I think it sounds like you're more optimistic than others on that bridge opening. But my follow-up question is just in terms of the cost structure, and thank you for the details you gave us at the beginning of the prepared remarks, I'm just wondering which property will benefit the most from the shift in labor to The Parisian? Is one property kind of holding more FTEs than others? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sorry, so it'll probably be proportional shifted from The Venetian. So the property that will benefit the most is likely going to be The Venetian, although there will be some from Sands Cotai Central. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. I just have two quick ones. One is, do you think it's reasonable to think that you'll get 250 tables for The Parisian; is that kind of your expectation at this point? And then also Rob, you mentioned that March was not as strong as January, February in Q1. I wonder if you could just give a little color since we're three weeks into April, you said March was an aberration and whether that's going to continue? Thanks. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I didn't understand that question. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well Robin, March, obviously I made the comment because I don't know what's going to happen. I don't want to pretend to have clarity of the future. But it was disappointing after a really great February and a really pretty strong January. I think the entire market felt the doldrums. And when you look at the global numbers of Chinese tourism, et cetera, it's pretty dismal as well. We're hoping it was an aberration. We're hoping for a good strong April, May, June. But obviously we can't give guidance what's going to happen. I think it was across the board, so that's reason to believe that something was happening over there. I don't think we are alone in this concern. But as for the future, we don't comment, as you know and we're just hoping for return to numbers that resemble more like January and February. As for the tables, I think we again, we've learned to be respectful and wait for the government's guidance. We're hoping we're treated fairly. I think Sheldon, if anybody's been a visionary and a guy who plunges and puts his money where his mouth is, he has. The Cotai Strip is now pretty clear what it's done, that was his vision. I would hope the government will treat us fairly and respectfully. But whatever the decision is, we'll embrace it and hope we get the best treatment we can get. I don't know if it's 250 tables, 10,000 tables. But we're hoping for a fair treatment, and whatever it is, it is. As you know, because of our other buildings we have a lot of tables that are market ready, but we'll need the tables for The Parisian. We will need tables because we think the mass demand for that property is going to be overwhelming. We don't pretend it's going to be \u2013 it may not be at The Venetian level from day one but I think that when you see it, it's got a lot of mass appeal. The themed feel of that building is pretty impeccable. It's very seductive when you go through it. I think it will get a lot of demand. So hopefully we have a lot of tables the government will grant us. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe just a last little follow-up is; without thinking about knowing what May and June is going to look like, how do you feel about what you've seen in April so far? So not forward-looking, but just looking at the last three weeks. Do you feel like so far not necessarily a change from the tone of business in March? Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Robin, one month does not a trend make. We can't say authoritatively that it's an aberration. It's not an aberration. I mean, if January and February were good, why do we think that March could have been an aberration or it signals a trend? It's too early. It's only one month. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Robin. Just one thing, I want to go back to the earlier comment, just because of our, I mean, the fact that we've invested more than anybody by a landslide in non-gaming in Macao, I think we hope that on the table issue we'd be treated equally. No one's built more retail, more convention space, more sleeping rooms, more anything than us. And we'd hope that will be taken into consideration by the government. So we'll see how that plays out. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. That question is from David Katz with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi. Afternoon. Well done. Congratulations on a solid quarter. And I'm not sure if I'm exactly following up what Robin was getting at also, but as we look out 12 months to 24 months with the new projects opening, what are the key factors or the gating factors, or what needs to happen in terms of really just getting new people into the market, and quite frankly, extracting greater spending from those people? Because your execution, your ability to execute, is quite clear. But it appears that the market, at the moment anyway, is constrained. And so for everyone to be successful, it has to come from somewhere. How do you envision that? Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, my comment is, is just repeat again : everything is cyclical. We've been in Macao for 12 years now. And there have been times over the 12 years that people thought that the business is going down, and then it's going to go up. I remember somebody saying that things are going to hell in a hand basket because the growth that year was only going to be 50% and people were projecting 70%. I mean everything is cyclical. It's going to change. People that come from China that aren't coming now will come again. The same thing with the high end of the market; we are seeing an increase in our premium direct, meaning the high rollers that are not going to the junkets, we're seeing junkets, more regulation of the junkets. Just everything evolves and I don't see that we can take away any direction of a trend for one month. So if March wasn't as good as January or February, so be it. Who knows? It could have been the weather; it could have been anything else. But I am very optimistic. I have no reason to be pessimistic. In fact, I have more reason to be optimistic at least in our placement within the framework of the six concessionaires. We are holding, we are up at close to 40% of the business and EBITDA in Macao and you can't have six 40-percenters. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : That's good because you (49:50). Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You know, it will add up to more than a 100 and it won't be because of rounding. So our competitors, we think that, look we respect our competitors. We respect Wynn, we respect Galaxy, we respect the others, we don't necessarily agree with how they do things. So we just focus on how we do things. And we've tried to improve every aspect of our business and we don't give up on it. We spend an enormous amount of money on CapEx. We had a board meeting yesterday and we told the board from our development department which handles CapEx and we had a very large amount of money scheduled to keep things in good shape. Look we have so many rooms. We'll be the only destination in the world that will have two, 13,000 rooms available without leaving the building. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I would just add to Sheldon's comment, it's Rob. I just wanted \u2013 it's like no place in the world. I've been going there for three decades, since the early 1980s and there's a billion plus Chinese people, enormous propensity to gamble, billions and billions of dollars we import into Cotai. Anyone that thinks this market is done growing is simply silly. We don't know when it starts growing again, but it will grow. And to Sheldon's point life does go up and down. As you get old you recognize that. There'll be a day, and I can't tell when that day will be, but a lot of faith in what we've seen, the new products there. I think the Wynn product will be great. Our product will be exemplary and I think this market will resurrect, we just don't know when. To your point, you've got to grow some GGR for everyone to win. We've been winning for a long time there. We have huge faith in the government, in the market and the question is when does that time come? Is it later this year? I hope so. Hope it's this fall. Maybe it's the opening of the Wynn, the opening of The Parisian. But it's too wonderful a market with too many people close by who love to gamble and too many great products for it not to resurrect and come back to a growth process. So we're weathering the storm. We've proven we can run our business very well in a difficult environment. I think our team over there has done great work with the cost cutting, cost controls. I think Sheldon's vision in Cotai is coming to full fruition this fall. Believe it or not, we're encouraged. We think the turn is coming, but we don't want to point to a month or a day. We just believe, long term, this is a great place to be. So let's hope for the best and hope for a healthy second quarter ahead of us. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Thanks for your comments. I appreciate it. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Mike, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Las Vegas Sands Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Daniel Briggs. You may begin your conference. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, operator. Joining me on the call today are Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures, a definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures have included in the press release and also at the end of our earnings deck, which is available for your use during the call on our Investor Relations website. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased we've continued to execute on our strategic objectives during the quarter. And despite the diminished but continuing challenges in the Macao market, we again delivered a solid set of financial results with company-wide hold-normalized EBITDA reaching $954 million. This resilience and consistency in cash generation reflects both the strength of our business model and the geographic diversity of our cash flows, which in turn underpins our balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we can and will continue to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in new development opportunities. In Macao, our hold-normalized EBITDA margin expanded in the second quarter by 160 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, and by 120 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016, again reflecting our continued success in cost management. At the same time, despite the significant year-on-year increase in competition on Cotai, our second quarter mass gaming volumes at both Venetian and Sands Cotai Central were more or less consistent with prior year. It is encouraging that in June, our Macao properties experienced a year-on-year increase in both mass gaming volumes and revenue, marking the first month of year-on-year growth in mass gaming since September of 2014. I was asked when I announced in January why I thought the market was about to stabilize or that it was stabilized, this is a validation of my expectations at that time. June is the first month that we experienced year-on-year gains. So I think stabilization appears to be here. I mentioned in January of last year that I believe we were seeing the first signs of stabilization in the Macao mass market. Our mass revenue growth in June despite the arrival of new competition on Cotai represents an important data point supporting the ongoing stabilization of the Macao mass market. At Marina Bay Sands, quarter two adjusted property EBITDA was similar to prior year. MBS has continued to dominate the competitive landscape with its share of hold-normalized EBITDA increasing to 74% in quarter one 2016 versus 65% in quarter one 2015. Likewise, our share of EBITDA in Macao also continues to increase. On a trailing 12 month basis through March 31, 2016, our share of EBITDA in the six operating markets increased to 37%, up from 34% one year earlier. That's more than double our fair share. Because of our industry-leading investments in MICE-based Integrated Resorts in both Macao and Singapore, which places up in the pole position when it comes to emerging market opportunities, we are unique in the absolute scale of our cash flow as well as our dominant share of the industry's cash flow. Scale, diversity and critical mass allow us to outperform our competitors. This unique ability to generate consistent and industry-leading cash flow in turn underpins our balance sheet strength. That balance sheet strength is two times, two times net debt to EBITDA at the end of the second quarter, allows us to stay fully committed to our development plans while continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. Again, this is unique in our industry. Our retail mall portfolio in Asia is another unique differentiator. For 2015, the operating profit of our malls in Macao and Singapore reached $0.5 billion. I'm pleased to highlight that despite the downturn in luxury retail in Greater China, our Macao mall revenue still grew by 7% during the first half of 2016. I'm extremely excited about the upcoming opening of Parisian Macao. We're well on track and I'm pleased to announce today that we plan to open The Parisian on September 13, about seven weeks from today. I have not a shadow of doubt that The Parisian will replicate the success of The Venetian as another themed iconic and must-see Integrated Resort destination to Macao's visitors. The Venetian Macao remains the iconic must-see Integrated Resort destination in Macao, welcoming over 30 million visitors annually. That's almost as many visit as 32 million as the market as a whole. Despite all the headwinds and challenges in the Macao market, The Venetian Macao produced $244 million of EBITDA for the quarter, essentially flat against the prior year. I believe that this is another indicator of a stabilizing mass market in Macao. The positioning of The Parisian Macao caters well to both the current Macao market conditions and the long term growth trends in Chinese outbound tourism. The Parisian will be a themed premium destination where the aspirational appeal of its public spaces, attractions and amenities, this combined with affordable hotel accommodation, providing a complimentary offering to the all-suite hotel at The Venetian Macao. Our preopening marketing efforts are progressing nicely, and videos and promotional pieces featuring The Parisian on social media have achieved well over 143 million reach over the last month. Our existing portfolio has clearly enabled us to hold our own amidst new competition. And I'm extremely confident that with the opening of The Parisian, we will see growth in Macao. With respect to expenses and profit margin from our Macao operations, Rob and Patrick can elaborate on this later. Suffice it to say that we're on track to meet or exceed the targets we set out to you previously. To recap, we achieved annualized savings of an excess of $250 million as we exited 2015 when we projected that we would achieve an additional $60 million of cost savings during 2016. As of the end of June, we are well on track to meet or exceed those projections. In addition, we will achieve approximately $140 million of cost avoidance on an annualized basis with the opening of The Parisian. Now, let me give you some additional highlights of our results in Macao for the quarter. For quarter two, hold-normalized EBITDA in Macao was nearly $500 million, down only 2% against the first quarter despite the overall Macao gross gaming revenue, GGR, declining sequentially by 8%. Hold-normalized EBITDA margin in our Macao operations improved to 33.3%, an increase of 160 basis points against prior year, primarily reflecting cost efficiencies. I'm pleased that since quarter one of 2015, we've been able to maintain high levels of market share despite new competition while controlling costs, increasing labor productivity, and continuing to invest in destination marketing in China and in development progress to have local employees. Encouragingly, despite the significant increase in gaming and hotel capacity compared with the prior year's quarter at two flagship properties on Cotai Venetian, Venetian and Sands Cotai Central both held their own against the new competition in the mass gaming segment. Non-Rolling drop at Venetian was almost flat against the prior year while SCC's Non-Rolling drop increased by 2% (11:28) against the prior year, again validating our belief that the Macao mass market is stabilizing. While competition in the hotel cash sales market has increased, particularly in weekdays and non-peak periods, we continue to benefit from the scale of our hotel room inventory. In a market where peak periods, the weekends and holidays matter more than ever before, where mass market customers generate the lion's share of future revenue and profit growth. We believe our capacity advantage will be further amplified when The Parisian opens. In the first half of 2016, Chinese public holidays represented 10% of the calendar days but more than 20% of our EBITDA. With the completion of The Parisian, we will have almost 13,000 hotel rooms and four interconnected resorts. Over 840 stores across four shopping malls, 2 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space, and four performance and event venues, including our Venetian Cotai Arena, which can be utilized either for our MICE business or for major entertainment events. This is the only MICE Space Integrated Resort complex of this scale in the world. Business and leisure visitors to Macao will be able to enjoy all of this and more under one roof, at one destination, without having to go outside to connect with six different properties. I believe this will help to increase the tourist average length of stay in Macao. It is encouraging that the first five months of 2016, based on data provided by the Statistics and Census Service of Macao, the number of visitors in Macao who stayed overnight in hotel increased by 12% compared with the prior year, even though overall visitor levels decreased by 1% during the same period. I believe The Parisian Macao with its premium and iconic destination appeal, coupled with affordable and plentiful accommodations, will help drive sustainable growth in overnight visitors to the Cotai Strip. We remain fully committed to playing the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Our track record in being transformative pioneers in MICE, retail and entertainment speak for itself. In summary, we regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses, providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens, including through our Sands Academy and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. We opened The Sands Academy at the Adelson Advanced Education Centre nearly 10 years ago in conjunction with the 2007 opening of The Venetian Macao. We're extremely proud that tens of thousands of local Macao employees have received training, development, and continuing education through our Sands Academy educational and development programs. We have steadfast confidence in both our and Macao's future success. Now, moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We delivered a solid quarter in Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $357 million. Hold-normalized EBITDA was $320 million and was impacted by lower table game volumes. The hotel continued its strong performance while our retail malls continued to outperform the Singapore market. Now, on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders, yay dividends. Early in the year, the Las Vegas Sands board of directors approved a 10.8% increase in our recurring dividend program for the 2016 calendar year to $2.88 for the year or $0.72 per quarter. We remain committed to maintaining our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. And we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow particularly with the opening of The Parisian. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic in returning excess capital via our share repurchase program. While we chose not to repurchase any stock in the quarter ended June 30, we look forward to continue to utilize the stock buyback program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity, and balance sheet strength enable us to continue these recurring dividend and stock repurchase programs while retaining ample financial flexibility to invest for future growth and pursue new development opportunities. This is the conclusion of my prepared remarks. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We're now prepared to take questions. Operator : Your first question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, everybody. Sheldon, probably what intrigue most investors on this call are your comments on the mass performance in June. Can you talk about how your mass segment performed relative to the market mass segment performance? Was there a big difference between the base and the premium mass in June? And then while we recognize July is far from over, can you talk about whether that June mass segment performance has continued thus far into July? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Joe, I'm going to take that, it's Rob. (18:34) business in June definitely ticked up. We're seeing strong \u2013 I think we're the lucky people to have all this capacity at a time when capacity appears to be very important in weekends and holidays. That has always been a summer trend for us. And we're seeing it \u2013 we saw it in June. So, we saw a strong year-on-year growth for the first time in a while and very encouraged by it. I don't want to go into the numbers for July. I'll stay away from that. But I think, June is the beginning of the summer season. As you know, our model is predicated on size and critical mass. And that demonstrated very well for us the results in June, because I think the weekends are very busy, and I believe that will continue to summer, although we're not going to comment about July at this time. But, yes, we did see a nice uptick in June for the first time in a while. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Then my follow-up question is with regard to The Parisian opening on the 13th. I guess, how much of a staggered opening is it? How much do you open with initially in terms of room capacity, gaming capacity, other non-gaming capacity? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. We're taking a different approach, Joe, opening it, totally open everything. We've tried it in a few different ways but this time we have all the rooms. We have, I think last time I talked to the retail folks for us in Macao, about 90% of the retail keys we opened, the doors we opened, the gaming floor is fully operational. I think we're going to have a pretty much 100% opening at this point unless something is off the rails with approvals. But we feel pretty confident that the building will look fully represented. And if you haven't seen it in person, it's pretty astounding. The casino floor is terrific and the Eiffel Tower's already on, so we're in pretty good shape September 13. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much guys. Operator : The next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Sheldon, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned something about cost avoidance for The Parisian. I was wondering if you could possibly give us a little bit more granularity about just the overall magnitude of cost you're expecting to shift and maybe how much shifted in the second quarter as a part of the preopening expense line. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Shaun, it's Patrick. How are you? Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, Patrick. Thanks. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Just a little more color, we're looking about $35 million a quarter in run rate cost avoidance that will shift over to The Parisian when it opens. There is about, call it, $14 million or $15 million that we experienced in this quarter. So that's the run rate. That's how we got to the $140 million a year that we referenced in our prior earnings call. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. And could you just give us maybe a little bit of granularity on sort of the total employees that you think are going to sort of backstop that number? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You mean total magnitude of employees? Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, that will shift and then what you're sort of targeting for head count to run The Parisian at opening? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's about 3,500 in context. We don't have the \u2013 I'm not going to get to exact specifics because that'll move around a little bit, but think of it about 3,500 employees would be the shiftable number. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jon Oh from CLSA. Jon T. Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. I like to just kind of dig into this June growth remark, that was quite fascinating. As we think about \u2013 and I think, Sheldon, you made this comment earlier that the customer staying at hotel year-to-date is up 12%. How do we think about spend per customer? What kind of trends are you seeing so far especially in June? Are you seeing any meaningful uptick in spend? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Jon, I'm not sure I'd break it up \u2013 it's Rob by the way \u2013 I wouldn't break it up by spend per customer because we're seeing stronger occupancy, stronger overall visitation. I'm not prepared to break it up by customer spend. But clearly it's something that happened in June for us in the market, our occupancy picked up, our gaming floors are busy, especially weekends. And again, we think the critical mass this year we have the capacity in the gaming side, the retail side, the lodging side to have the customers. This is, let's be honest, Macao is morphing into the world's greatest mass-market. Our critical mass approach in terms of lots of capacity in all the dimensions we talked about are there. So we're going to anticipate when customers are there. And I think it started show through in June; hopefully, we'll see it rest of the summer. It's been a trend of ours in the summers, we do better. June was the beginning of that trend. So I'm not sure spend per customer as much (23:00) we're getting more occupancy. We're getting better customers in the hotel, obviously. And we're seeing some positive uptick in the gaming, especially in the mass segments and premium mass. Jon T. Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And if I can follow-up with your comments on market share, you guys have held your market share pretty well so far. What are your expectations for what your market share would look like when Wynn opens in the next one month? And also expectations for what The Parisian would do in mid-September after you open? That's it from me. Thanks. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We can't say what Wynn is going to do. The clippings that I read say that it's a 20-minute walk from The Venetian to the Wynn. We're hoping that he will do very well. But we don't know and neither does he how many tables we're going to be getting. But we have the greater capacity because we have more tables from other properties that we can move over. I don't \u2013 I can't answer your question specifically about why we feel stabilization, but we see no reason whatsoever to believe that it's going to reverse again. So June hit the bottom, or was the pivotal turnaround point, it is \u2013 we have no reason to believe that it won't continue. The Eiffel Tower on the \u2013 what do you call it, the supplementary information. Jon T. Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah. In the slide deck. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: The what? Jon T. Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : In the slide deck, the supplemental slide deck. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: In the slide deck. Supplemental slide deck showed an orange with the bottom, I think, it was red, of the Eiffel Tower, the bottom. Jon T. Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : Page 13 in the slide deck. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Page 13. I'm a little \u2013 it should have been \u2013 oh, sorry, red on \u2013 two-thirds of red and sort of orange at the bottom. But we copied the original Eiffel Tower from Paris with the sparkling lights and I think we did something that I'm not sure if they do there. We have a rainbow color that starts off with one color starting to move up, replaced at the bottom by another one, and continued to replace all of the colors of the rainbow. It is strikingly beautiful and I have no reason to believe that it isn't going to be watched by every person who comes to Macao. The Cotai Strip is my idea. And when we finally put in the pedestrian overpass, it's my vision, we will have \u2013 albeit fewer properties than what I've originally anticipated \u2013 but we will have the greatest under one roof, never having to go outside to go from one place to the other for all the MICE Space, the shopping, the restaurants, the hotel rooms, the casinos. Nowhere in the world will there be 13,000 hotel rooms interconnected. So this is going to be like The Venetian Macao, a must-see destination. The Chinese people like theme properties, particularly geographically-themed properties that is the main reason for The Venetian being a must-see property that it is and will continue to be, and the main reason why The Parisian will also be another must-see property. Hope I answered your questions. Jon T. Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Can you give us some more color on the softness that you saw in the Singapore gaming volumes both on the mass and the VIP side? And then any color on just the outlook for that property would be helpful? Thanks. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thomas, its Rob. Clearly, the VIP volume I think reflects global phenomenon of slowdown at the $5 million plus customer. Rolling volume was very soft relative to the past at $6 million, $7.40 million. We held well which was encouraging. But volumes are off and it's off primarily in that $5 million plus high-end rolling customer. I think that's reflected in Macao as well as Las Vegas, and maybe that's a global slowdown. I'm not sure how to explain that but we've always had super concentrated and we couldn't see a bounce, but I would think that's going to be a tough segment for the foreseeable future. On the mass table side, clearly, we missed our usual $4.7 million, $4.8 million. That's the first time in two years we missed getting to $4.7 million, $4.8 million. The question is, is that a short-term blip, the 90-day miss or is that a trend, we don't know at this point. That's the more interesting one to me. I think the Rolling business, it speaks for itself, and that's explainable throughout the world. This one is only explainable to our property. We've kind of done very, very well in that segment. We'll stay hyper-focused in that segment. We continue to have sales people and product against that segment. That is our focus. I want to believe we'll return in July and August, September back to $4.7 million, $4.8 million. That's we want to be. Our goal long term is $5 million five a day. It is a blip, it's a miss this quarter, but I don't believe it's a trend. I hope it's not. And we'll have to wait and see what the future holds. Now, the property overall, I think, the other confusing part to me is our slot business was up. It was quite actually improved Q1-on-Q1 and year-on-year. So, that's encouraging. Our retail business remains flat or actually up a bit. Our hotel business is very strong, leading the market, maybe on our occupancy and RevPAR. So, the other indicators in Singapore are pretty positive. The miss is purely in the table game side, and primarily in the mass table side. So, no way to give you an accurate prediction of whether that bounces back to $4.7 million, $4.7 million, $4.9 million, I'm sure opening so. But other indicators are all positive. Again, rooms, retail, slot machines, ETGs all positive as you identify the misses in the table game side. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Rob. That was helpful. And then just my follow-up question on The Parisian, I heard your comments earlier that you're going to open everything up on September 13. But given the current operating environment and the new supply that's coming in close to the same time as you guys are opening, how are you thinking about the speed at which you expect to ramp EBITDA at this property versus your prior property openings? Thanks. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: My feeling is it's very positive for us. I think the Wynn property is going to be a must-see and I think Parisian is a must-see. I think cumulatively the market's very fortunate. Cotai will be the beneficiary. If anything, the Peninsula will suffer because you're going to have to see the \u2013 that property that Steve Wynn's building, I'm sure, is a must-see and I know The Parisian is a must-see. I've seen it. And I think those properties combined will create something \u2013 I know that some people are concerned about so much product at once. It might actually be very much a catalyst for the market and for people in China and from Hong Kong and throughout the region to come to Macao. So it does two things. It transfers the business up to Cotai, which we have the majority of our assets on Cotai. That's encouraging. And frankly, it also creates a must-see Macao event to have two properties, $7-billion-plus of capital at one time. It's pretty amazing actually. It takes you back to the days in Las Vegas in the late 1990s when Venetian opened, Bellagio opened, Mandalay Bay opened on top of each other and no one even blinked because the market was strong. I understand your concern. And obviously, some people are concerned it's too much at one time. You might argue that and you might argue that it's a catalyst for more growth in Cotai in particular and for more visitations to Macao. Maybe it's the magic elixir that takes this market to a different place. No matter what happens short term, again, I believe we're anchored in a very fine place. We're in the mass part of this business. Sheldon's vision is always critical mass. 13,000 sleeping rooms, all that gaming capacity, lodging capacity, retail capacity on Cotai which is still the world's greatest gaming market. It's pretty positive, pretty powerful. I think, long term, we do very well in Macao. We're very bullish in long term. You can argue about the relative merits of all that capacity at one time. I'm going to argue positively and hope for the best. But I know long term, we're in a very, very nice position in Cotai. We're happy to be there and happy to open The Parisian. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Rob. Operator : The next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Good afternoon. Rob, maybe could you talk a little bit about the mix on the hotel side in Macao these days and kind of the strategy of cash versus comp room here going forward as the new competition comes on and obviously, as you guys open Parisian? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. I think we're a little different than most people, Carlo. As you know, we've been doing this for a long time. We've been focused on selling cash rooms for quite some time because no one else in the market had to. Most people are junket and high roller driven and Rolling customer driven. So the focus of most of our competitors has been non-cash. We've been forced, because of the amount of rooms that we put in the market, to be cash-driven and we remain in that place. We got a very, very experienced sales team. We're well represented throughout the region. And I think that bodes very well for our future cash sales. As you know, there's so much new capacity and frankly there's been some people learning how to sell hotel rooms in Macao because it's not been necessary in the past. And that's caused some rate pressure. But we remain convinced that our mix will be heavily skewed towards cash customers. And we'll take a focus like we do in Las Vegas, which is the lot (33:17), the casino comp side. We want to reward better customers. But I think our mix will remain heavily skewed to cash. We saw a very strong second quarter and the MICE business is ramping up. And I think, again, competitors will start to take more of a definite second look at MICE because they now have a lot of product to sell. Let's be honest. This is going to be a fight like Las Vegas was years ago. Midweek is going to be a challenge; weekends will fill. Midweek and holidays will be strong for all of us. It's the weekends and the midweek where the challenge is. But with our sales team and years of experience selling into that China, Hong Kong, regional Pacific Rim; I feel pretty confident we'll do fine. I know there's rate pressure today. I think that will subside once the capacity gets absorbed. We have a lot of confidence in the quality of competition and the quality of product. Keep in mind, it's a lot of hotel rooms for any one time to absorb so quickly. But look at the size of the market. And with 1 billion people in China and Hong Kong and Korea and Japan, et cetera; I think it gets absorbed and I think it grows. And I think we're going to lead the way in terms of rate and occupancy and product diversification. And again, I think you can't dismiss the heavy retail concentration and diversity of product we have in our buildings. We have retail pricing up and down from very reasonable stuff to the very fancy goods. We have hotel pricing which is very diverse. We have gaming price which is very diverse. And again, that is the strength of the LVS and that's the strength of Sheldon's critical mass vision that I think bodes well for the future for us. So we're very confident we'll sell rooms and do well in that market. I do think also The Parisian, the theming and the look of that is right for the market just like The Venetian was right for the market. It was only eight years ago, nine years ago, we opened The Venetian and people thought you couldn't fill 2,700 rooms and it was impossible. People thought it'd be a white elephant. And obviously, it worked out pretty well. I think the same thing will happen in time for all of us in Cotai. I feel pretty good about it. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you for that. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on the mass side. It looks like the base mass and the premium mass performed similarly from a year-over-year perspective in the quarter. If we thought about premium mass today and the theoretical required to reach, quote, that desired status; has that changed tremendously year-over-year in terms of what's being classified there or are you strictly kind of using the same table minimum thresholds et cetera? Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Carlo, we're not using the table minimum threshold at all. We're giving you that split on page 11 in the deck based on the geographic area of the tables on the floor. So we have a VIP area and a mass area. And we haven't broken out or changed whatsoever the methodology with which we're presenting that specific information. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, great. Thank you, Dan. Operator : The next question is from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Felicia Hendrix, your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sorry, had you muted. Thank you for taking my question and good afternoon. Rob, my question is a bit of a segue from your last comments and it's on competition. So if The Parisian and Wynn are as successful as you all believe they're going to be, do you envision your competitors getting more aggressive in trying to maintain share? I think there's a premise out there now that everyone's going to stay rational. But we see what's happening with the room rates and you mentioned that. So I'm not sure why I understand there's a belief that the competition isn't going to heat up. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, I think it has heated up. Already in terms of room rate, you're seeing competitive pressures in room rates today and that's probably remaining intact until there's more cash demand in the market. But the great thing about a mass market, as you well know, it's not as predatory in terms of pricing. It's not like do you in the high roller business where a gambler is sought after by 16 different people. It's a little harder to identify and to see the mass market. The most pressure you're going to see, I think, is in your room pricing. And I believe you're going to see with Wynn and Parisian, two new products that might bring more people to the market. I'm hoping that they can elevate the game there because in the end we all win if more people show up. Will there be pricing pressure? I assume there will be with all the new product in the market. But will it be absorbed and eventually prices trade back up? I think it will. You see that ebb and flow in Las Vegas. You see that in other markets where we compete. And right now in Las Vegas, I think the market keeps moving upward and moving together. I think that will happen in Macao. Is there short-term risk? Sure there is. But longer term, I think people will respect the products they have there, the quality of product. We're big believers in diversity of pricing, diversity of product. And frankly, we think our retail enables to us do things that other people won't be able to do. Our retail pricing and diversity, our lodging pricing and diversity, our gaming pricing and diversity gives us a very unique advantage. And plus, it's all in Cotai and as Sheldon referenced, it's all connected. So competitors may have to get there and figure it out. I think we'll be in a pretty good place. And I think that that market long term, perhaps the Peninsula might be the difficult portion because of pressure. I think Cotai will be pretty successful in the short term and long term. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful, thanks. And Sheldon, just for a minute moving outside of Macao, I was wondering if you could update us on your expansion plans in Singapore. What are the latest specifics with your plans there and where are you in the process? And then can you also update on your plans for the arena in Vegas, maybe cost, timing, anything you can share there? Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We don't have an okay from the full government of Singapore at this time. We're hoping after the summer when vacations are completed, that we'll approach the government again and see if we can get a final answer there, which we don't have at this time yet. As far as Vegas is concerned, I'm going to refer that to Rob who's been negotiating with MSG, Madison Square Garden. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, firstly, we're delighted with the deal. We think it's great that we have a rather nominal capital contribution and our partner's providing the bulk of that. And we also are delighted we have, I think, the strongest booking people in the business on our side of this trade. So we're very excited about the prospect. We'd like to think we get on the ground sometime in early 2017 with an opening sometime late 2018 or early 2019. We're excited about the closeness, the proximity to our building. But again, we're thinking it's probably a 18-month or 24-month build once they actually break ground. And I saw them yesterday actually and they're hoping to break ground first quarter of 2017, so late 2018, early 2019. We think it's very impactful for this end of the Strip. And we think we're the big beneficiaries of \u2013 we got first dibs on certain amount of tickets and we love the deal in terms of the quality of our partners in this thing. MSG and the Azoff Group. We're very excited about it. So a big impact for us down the road in that we think it elevates room rates and it elevates this end of the Strip. Our neighborhood gets much better with this arena. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The last question comes from David Katz from Telsey Group. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask and we may have discussed around this a bit. But on your slide 11 which I think is very telling, have you told us whether it was an increase in the volume of patrons or an increase in the spend per patron more so one or the other that's leading to this uptick that you have in both segments? Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: On slide 11, David, we're presenting the quarter-over-quarter \u2013 pardon me, second quarter 2016 versus second quarter of 2015 and they're both down about 8% in our mass business. We specifically called out the June month to help people understand that there was growth in June for the first time in 21 months across our portfolio. So we didn't specifically talk about whether it was more customers or just \u2013 Rob actually addressed this pretty well earlier. I'll hand it over to him. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think what we're trying to reflect here is, again, June growth both in mass and premium mass is there. And I can't break it out for you whether it's spend \u2013 I just don't know the answer, that was spend per customer or more visitations. I would tend to believe, if I were to make a guess, it'd be more visitations because again the summer season ramps up aggressively there. And I hope we will see it in July and August and September as well. But I think what we're seeing, to Dan's point, is a return to some strength for the first time in quite a while, which is very encouraging in June. And we're sure hoping it continues throughout the summer. And that's our story in a nutshell. It's an encouraging sign after a couple of years of discouraging signs. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : All right. You said it. And if I can ask just quickly about Las Vegas' hold percentage, which looks like it was low both years and markedly so; is there any particular reason other than luck as to why that would be? Is there a change in the tenor of the mix of games or something like that? Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No, I wish it was like that, but unfortunately it's just luck. The customers won and we lost. And when that happens, the hold percentage \u2013 it's just a very hard thing to explain to people that are not in this industry. There has been a lot of bad luck for us in Las Vegas. We saw this in Singapore. There was a belief out there we couldn't win in Singapore because we had a couple of bad years. But it bounced back and our long term hope is right where it should be. In the end, it all flattens out. We just had a pathetic run of bad luck at the high-ended tables. And keep in mind, Las Vegas doesn't have the volume. What makes Las Vegas frustrating is if you bring in a couple of dozen customers (43:29), you don't have the volume which offsets the volatility. The reason Macao and other places tend to be more stable is there's just huge amounts of volume. In Las Vegas, you're letting people gamble here, disproportionately high to the other mix on the floor. When it runs bad, it's pretty difficult. When it runs good, it's really wonderful. But this is simply a highly concentrated bunch of gamblers who played lucky, nothing more, nothing less. The mix has nothing to do with it. They're all playing baccarat at very, very high levels and hence volatility increases with high levels of gambling. And it's the business we're in in Las Vegas and the good news is that it's becoming more lodging focused. Do you see our numbers in Las Vegas? Our ADRs is just terrific and our occupancies and RevPARs. If it wasn't for that lousy table, well, we would have had a hell of a quarter in Las Vegas. So we'll bounce back probably in the rest of the year and hold a whole bunch higher. So I apologize, but there's no magic to it. And it's not a mix issue at all. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Appreciate it. Thanks very much. Nice quarter. Robert Glen Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Appreciate that. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Are there any other questions? Operator : There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call back over to the presenters. Sheldon Gary Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I want to thank everybody for calling. And we feel we had a pretty good quarter and we are very happy that there was one month that hit the bottom. And I think we're going to be \u2013 as I said earlier, we have no reason to believe that's not going to continue. And we are very, very excited about The Parisian. I was just to (45:14) it a few weeks ago. And I have to tell you it is undoubtedly one of the most beautifully decorated public spaces I have ever seen in any hotel in the world and I go to a lot of hotels. And this is really, really magnificent both from the outside with the Eiffel Tower and the rainbow colors moving up to the top \u2013 it's just going to be an incredibly high-demand hotel and a must-see. So thank you all for calling and we look forward to giving you another good quarter, even better quarter coming up. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased we continued to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter and delivered a strong set of financial results with company-wide adjusted EBITDA reaching $1.140 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year. The quarter was distinguished by an outstanding result in Macao where we achieved solid growth in mass gaming revenues, increased our EBITDA and profit margin, and opened The Parisian Macao with a smashing success. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands continues to deliver steady cash flow, with adjusted property EBITDA being in line with last year. With the resilience and consistency in cash generation, we've flexed both the strength of our business model and the geographic diversity of our cash flow, which, in turn, underpins our balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we can and will continue to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in new development opportunities. As you may recall, I had first indicated back in January that we were seeing signs of stabilization in mass gaming revenues in Macao. And in June, our mass gaming revenues saw positive year-on-year growth for the first time in two years. I'm pleased to say that this encouraging trend continued in the third quarter. Our mass table revenues grew by 6% year-over-year, the first quarter of positive growth since quarter three of 2014. This growth rate accelerated to 15% in the month of September as we benefited from the strong opening of The Parisian Macao. Nine years ago, we opened The Venetian Macao, which was the first step in realizing my vision for the Cotai Strip, a critical mass of MICE space Integrated Resorts that will contribute to the development of Macao as the world's center for leisure and business tourism. The opening of Parisian Macao not only significantly enhances our critical mass in the Cotai Strip, but adds another themed, iconic sea destination in Macao that will be complementary to The Venetian Macao. While I never doubted The Parisian's broad-based success, it was nonetheless very gratifying to see the property open with such strong patronage across all its different facilities and amenities. For the first 18 days of operations, adjusted property EBITDA averaged $1.1 million per day, and daily visitations to The Parisian exceeded 40,000. We experienced no noticeable cannibalization at our existing properties after the opening of The Parisian. And if anything, we saw an increase in activity in the hotels on our Cotai Strip development, and including the casinos. Our marketing efforts leading up to the property opening clearly paid dividends. A Parisian Macao hashtag on major Chinese social media channels recently exceeded \u2013 listen to this, 1.2 billion views and impressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is unprecedented. This awareness has translated into strong property visitation. Based on our customer surveys at the various points of entry, in Macao, since The Parisian opening, the most visited casino resort in Macao remains The Venetian, but the second place was Parisian. My strategic vision was to create a critical mass of interconnected resorts in Cotai. With the completion of The Parisian, we have almost 13,000 hotel rooms and four interconnected resorts. Over 840 stores across four shopping malls, 2 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space, and four performance and event venues, including our Venetian Cotai Arena, which can be utilized either for our MICE business or for major entertainment events. This critical mass of product and amenities allows us to cater to virtually every type of business. Business and leisure visitors to Macao will be able to enjoy all of these and more under one roof, at one destination, without ever leaving the buildings. You'll never leave air conditioned space. Because of our industry-leading investments in MICE space Integrated Resorts in both Macao and Singapore which places us in the pole position when it comes to emerging market opportunities, we are unique in the absolute scale of our EBITDA and cash flow as well as in our dominant share of the industry's EBITDA and cash flow. Scale, diversity and critical mass allow us to outperform our competitors. Our ability to generate consistent and industry-leading cash flow in turn underpins our balance sheet strength. That balance sheet strength at 2 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of the third quarter allows us to stay fully committed to our development plans, while continuing to return excess capital to shareholders. Again, this is unique in our industry. Now, let me give you some additional highlights of our results in Macao for the quarter. For quarter three, adjusted EBITDA from Macao operations was $629 million, an increase of 15% against the prior year and an increase of 29% against the prior quarter. Growth was driven by strong mass gaming revenues, continued execution on cost efficiency programs, and higher hold in the premium direct segment. Hold-normalized EBITDA was $565 million, up 5% against the prior year and up 14% against the prior quarter. Hold-normalized EBITDA margin in our Macao operations improved to 34.7%, an increase of 170 basis points against the prior year, primarily reflecting cost efficiencies and improved business mix. Rob and Patrick can elaborate on this later. We have realized more than $300 million of annual cost savings since quarter one of 2015, and we also achieved our annualized cost avoidance of $140 million by leveraging consistent resources for the opening of The Parisian. Sustainability, including energy efficiency, is a strategic imperative for the company, and we are proud that The Parisian Macao is our most energy efficient property to date. The Parisian Macao is targeting LEED silver certification for new construction and would be the first Integrated Resort in Macao to achieve this distinction to the entirety of its operation. LEED certification addresses sustainability measures, including energy and water efficiency, waste management, and indoor air quality. We are proud that our focus on sustainability will help us minimize the impact we have on the environment while also providing a financial benefit in the future. Our mass table gaming revenue, in total, grew by 6% year-over-year, while our premium mass segment grew by 15%, a solid result given the significant increase in gaming and hotel capacity in the market. We experienced broad-based growth across premium mass and mass segments, underpinned by our ability to drive increased patronage with hotel accommodation, shopping malls, and entertainment events. During the quarter, which included the peak summer season, hotel occupancy across our portfolio increased by almost 4 percentage points against the prior year to 90%, despite significant growth in both our own inventory and that of the markets. This, again, highlights our advantage during peak periods, with the higher hotel occupancy feeding positively into our gaming and retail revenues. In a market where peak periods, weekends and holidays, matter than ever before, and where mass market customers will generate the lion's share of future revenue and profit growth, our capacity advantage was further strengthened by the opening of The Parisian. The Parisian Macao generated $19 million in adjusted EBITDA in its first 18 days of operation. Mass table and slot revenue per day at The Parisian was $2.6 million while hotel occupancy was 88%. Not only has The Parisian been successful as a standalone property, I believe The Parisian also benefits our entire Cotai portfolio. Our overall Macao property visitations increased by 19% in September compared to the same month in the prior year. The Plaza and Four Seasons property in particular has experienced an uplift in visitation and business volumes since The Parisian opened. It is also worth noting that despite the recent increase in the supply of luxury retail in Macao, our retail sales at Four Seasons Mall grew by 7% in September. The completion of the bridge between Four Seasons and The Parisian in late November will further increase the synergies in traffic and patronage between our properties. Last night, I got a call from Wilfred Wong, our President of Macao, confirming that we will open by the end of November. We'll open that bridge, pedestrian bridge connecting The Parisian with Lot 2. We remained fully committed to playing the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Our track record in being transformative pioneers in nice retail and entertainment speaks for itself. In summary, we regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objective of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses, providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens, including through our Sands Academy, and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Regarding Sands Academy, we were the first ones in Macao to include a career development center of this scale, of any scale, in our operations from the beginning. Our first career development center was opened nine years ago on August 28, 2007, when we first opened The Venetian Macao. We have been committed to the career growth of our team members since the beginning. We have steadfast confidence in both our and Macao's future success. Now moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We delivered a solid quarter at Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $391 million. Hold-normalized EBITDA was $368 million. Our mass win-per-day was in line with prior year and grew 6% against the prior quarter in constant currency. Electronic gaming revenue reached an all-time quarterly record when measured in Singapore dollars. The hotel continued its strong performance with occupancy of 98% and an ADR of $475, which was an all-time record for Marina Bay Sands and a 10% increase compared to the prior-year quarter. Our retail mall continued to outperform the Singapore market, with tenant sales per square foot for the year ending September 30 of approximately $1,400. Let's move on to my favorite subject, yay (16:07) dividends, the return of capital to shareholders. The Las Vegas Sands board of directors has approved a $0.04 increase in our recurring dividend program for the 2017 calendar year, bringing our annual dividend to $2.92 or $0.73 per quarter. We remain committed to maintaining our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, and we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic in returning excess capital via our share repurchase program. The Las Vegas Sands board has authorized the amount remaining under the price stock repurchase program for another two years. While we chose not to repurchase any stock this quarter, we look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buyback program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity, and balance sheet strength enable us to continue these recurring dividends and stock repurchase programs, while retaining the financial strength to invest for future growth and pursue new development opportunities. This was another quarter in which we accomplished many important strategic objectives. My original vision for the Cotai Strip in Macao was further realized with the addition of The Parisian and the new property enjoyed a very strong opening. The structural advantage created by our unmatched critical mass and diversity of offering was very clearly displayed in our strong financial results during the quarter both in Macao and globally. All of this enables us to look ahead to the future with confidence. We have a strong organic growth network. We're in a great position to pursue new development opportunities and we have both the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Before we get to questions, I would like to welcome Lawrence Jacobs, known as Lonnie (18:46), our new General Counsel to our company. Lonnie (18:51) brings a wealth of experience, and we look forward to his contributions in the years ahead. Thank you for joining us on the call today and now we'll take some questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Shaun. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Congratulations on the strong quarter. I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on there's increasing press around the possibilities of potential legislation in Japan. So obviously, it had been an area you've been focused on for years. So, could you give us maybe the latest update and what you're hearing on the ground there? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: What we're hearing from various people is anywhere from 99% to 100% certainty the bill is going to come up this Diet session, but we got to look at the bill, the original bill. They may have changed it since, but the original bill called for a one-year period to determine the who, what, when, where, why, and how of Integrated Resort with casino. So, we got to see what happens over the next year. Are we there? We are there. We have people there. We have a head of Asian Global Development, George Tanasijevich. They're \u2013 quite frequently, I go not frequently but not infrequently. And I'm going again, I think, in a month or so. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yes. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I'm going in December. We'll see what the bill says when it passes. We are in touch with Osaka quite frequently. And I think that Osaka, from the scuttlebutt we hear, thinks that we are the best company to do that. Of course, we got to consider what position that will put us in vis-\u00e0-vis Tokyo. So, we don't know whether or not they'll allow one foreign company to have two locations, or they might do more than two locations. In any event, it's very optimistic, and I've always stated, based upon my many visits and conversations with people in Korea that if Japan legalizes casino gaming for its population, that Korea will rapidly do the same thing. We don't know that for sure, but that's speculation. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up would be, turning to The Parisian which is obviously extremely strong in the first 18 days, one of the big questions we've gotten from investors since our trip over there is how much of the growth is just euphoria around the opening. So any color you could provide to us on how patterns or trends are continuing into October here, early in November would be great. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Unfortunately, we're not going to comment on current quarter, but we'll be happy to update you in January how we did. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hello, everybody. Two questions, one on Macao then one on Singapore. On Macao, can you talk about what the competitive response has been since The Parisian opened both from newer properties and older existing ones? And then on Singapore, mass win per day of $4.8 million in the 3Q showed some nice sequential growth. Can you talk about what's driving that and is it just seasonality or is there something more than just seasonality? Thank you. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Joe. It's Rob. I'll take Singapore first. As you know, we had a weak quarter last quarter in that most critical segment, the non-rolling slot ETG segment. We're disappointed. We were honest about that three months ago. We're very happy to see a return to what's been the status quo for a couple of years at $4.8-plus million a day at a 60-plus percent margin. We said more activity on the floor of both foreign \u2013 mostly foreign activity, we had more overnight stays from Indonesia, Malaysia driving that, really encouraging because as we said to you, time and time again, maybe ad nauseam that that is the segment drives MBS. So, it was a great return for the quarter, solid performance, more foreign visitation, more use of the MBS room product and I think the aberration of Q2 is behind us. So, we feel very good about that, a bit of a sigh of relief after a weak Q2. As for Macao, as Sheldon referenced in his opening remarks, we're just really encouraged by the must-see destination appeal of that property and I would say to you that it's more encouraging than, I think Sheldon's comments said it very well in terms of \u2013 it's a destination resort that's got all kinds of traffic and all kinds of people pouring in everyday. So perhaps the most encouraging thing to us though is the positive impact we are seeing at Four Seasons, Venetian. Sheldon referenced the retail uptick into Four Seasons, but we're seeing also uptick in the retail mall, the room demand. The Venetian had a very strong quarter. We feel encouraged that our strategy of critical mass and running this 12,000 or 13,000 co-sites almost as one resort. We almost see it as one integrated resort with 13,000 sleeping rooms, plenty of casino capacity, 13,000 restaurant seats, 800 retail stores, and the ability through pricing power, diverse... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: 850. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: 850. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Don't cut us short. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Okay 850. I tried to cheat us by 50 stores, but I think the truth is we're seeing renewed power there and energy into our buildings, and it gives us unique pricing power, it gives us the ability to offer the customers diversity. If you want the Four Seasons versus the Holiday Inn, all kinds of retail, I think you've been to retail in The Parisian. It's extraordinary. It is not the same stuff you see in the rest of Macao. And what makes this so wonderful is, it is diverse, it is different, more fashion-forward, and the theming is great. And curbside appeal of The Parisian theming is great. But as well we're doing at Parisian, we're even more encouraged by the synergistic feel we are getting for the rest of the buildings. As for the competition, I really can't say they're much different. I think a lot of people are happy to see The Parisian open because it creates more traffic in that critical Cotai corridor and it grabs more trial into Cotai. So, I think everyone is benefiting honestly from The Parisian traffic. It's clearly been a very, very powerful opening, and we benefit mostly, as you know, Sheldon's critical mass strategy is most in evidence when there's holidays, weekends, high-volume periods, that's when we really drive some terrific numbers. And I think we're seeing that again and again with The Parisian. Everybody is participating. I think all the new properties got a little taste of the business coming to Cotai, coming to see The Parisian, but I think we're benefiting more than anybody. I think we're benefiting because we have a 13,000 room IRR there. So very encouraged by both its performance, its impact, and we hope our competitors share our enthusiasm. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Joseph, I just like to add to that, if I may. This is Joe, right? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, it's Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Everybody would reasonably think that if we opened another property on the Cotai Strip that we would have some cannibalization of the other property. The amazing thing is that not only do we not have cannibalization, we have improvement in visitation and improvement in business in our other properties. Look, this is the only property of its type in the world. It is a behemoth, single hotel with 850 retail stores. We put Macao on the retail map, unquestionably. We have 2 million square feet of MICE space. We have actually six casinos because Lots 5 and 6 are two different casinos, although we count the whole thing as Sands Cotai Central 1. As soon as we open the connection between The Parisian and the Four Seasons, we can safely and accurately say that you don't have to leave the building or an air-conditioned space to go to any one of the 13,000 hotel rooms, none. You don't have to leave air-conditioned space. What other property in the world has that? There's no city in the world that has it. This is truly the Cotai Strip. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Actually, Joe, what Sheldon just spoke about is in sync with that market today. What's really happening is the mass market driven by lots of body count, lots of overnight stays, lots of demand for retail and restaurants and sleeping rooms. I think we have the right product that's in sync with the market in Macao today, and it's reflective in these numbers, and as that market continues to ramp forward, ramp up, I think we'll be a very, very happy participant. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Appreciate the comments. Thank you. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Just... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hi, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: ...wanted \u2013 hey, Sheldon. Hi. It's probably a question for you because I wanted to focus on the midweek group meeting and association business. The midweek tends in Macao to be quite a bit softer than the weekend, other than holidays. And so, I just want to get your point of view on the opportunity to change the mix of group meeting and associations midweek, and what might the revenue lift look like once you begin targeting that market more seriously? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, we've been targeting the market seriously, but there was a potpourri of different properties. Now that we'll have 13,000 rooms that you won't have to leave the building to access, it's going to make quite a bit of difference. That will be a real plus to attract various groups. We just had a 20,000-person group when we were there. It took up all our hotels in Macao. So we're putting a pedestrian walkway between Lot 6, which is the southernmost end of Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian. That will be a very big and very productive pedestrian overpass. Once you have the Cotai Strip and that many rooms and that many ballrooms, exhibition space, ballrooms, and breakout meeting rooms, there's no place like it in the world. So, this ought to attract an awful lot of other people. People could come to a city, go to a \u2013 excuse me, a MICE event and never have to leave the building. They won't have to rent cars. They will just take a bus or a taxi to one of the hotels, and then they can go anywhere. Go ahead. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Can I jump in, Harry, just behind Sheldon? It's Rob. I just want give you a little historical context. Twenty-some years ago when we started here in Las Vegas, as you well know, there was no one who wanted to put hotel rooms to convention customers because we were seen as, how can I say it politely, we weren't seen in favor of midweek rooms. In fact, people used to fight against COMDEX and fight against conventions and fight against groups. Obviously, that's all changed today. Any earnings call from any major Las Vegas company, that group segment that Sheldon pioneered has become the dominant reason why people can build hotel rooms here for midweek occupancy. It took many, many years, and a lot of people had to be turned around the non-gaming potential. I think the same thing is happening, as you watch it evolve right now, the same philosophy is going to happen in Macao. For the first time, you've got an abundance of rooms. You don't have a plethora of VIP guests to fill those rooms. And so, I think our competitors as well as our 13,000 rooms are available for the first time. We have the group space that Sheldon built, and that group space hasn't been fully utilized. But now, with demand midweek being what it is and with lots of sleeping rooms in Macao, I think you'll see the evolution of that non-gaming business, the hotel room customers Sunday through Thursday, becoming very important in the years to come. The same way when we built the retail that Sheldon referenced, people chuckled and said, no one goes to shop in Macao. Obviously, they do. That's going to happen, and while the evolution of that meeting space that Sheldon authored in Las Vegas and now he did it in Macao, you know it's going to become important, and it's just a question of time. The junket demise and the VIP midweek difficulties will make that very appealing to everybody on the Cotai Strip to fill it with very good group business that's both high rate paying and because they're getting more Asian, there's more of an opportunity for gambling opportunities at night. So, I think that's a train that's starting to leave the station. It's been a slow coming, but there has been enough room product or enough other companies that wanted to participate. Just like it happened in Vegas, it's going to happen in Macao. It's ahead of us. It's not today, still down the road, but it's going to happen. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. And I just had one follow-up question on the dividend. I wanted to shift gears here, because the level of EBITDA in Macao to maintain the dividend has been targeted at about $2.5 billion annually, and now it looks like given the success of Parisian, that that's quite doable. The question I have is what's the simple math behind every \u2013 if you exceed that $2.5 billion, say, by 5% or 10%, would you plan to take the dividend up by a like amount? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Go ahead. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Harry. It's Patrick. How are you? Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: I'm good. Thank you. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think it's an interesting question. I think a lot of it would depend on the expectations of future cash flow growth from the year that you just described. So, as we said before, there's a very careful evaluation process that goes into the dividend planning. And so, it would have to be taken in the context the future growth of the company, the future growth of cash flows, and our view of sustainability of growth of the dividend. So, those are the thoughts that go into the dividend decision both at SCL and at LVS. The dividend is a cornerstone of our return of capital strategy, and it's very important for us to keep it going in a sustainable and a growing way in the future. So while we can't comment specifically on how we view the SCL dividend and increase in EBITDA, we really hope that it happens and we're looking forward to the continued growth of The Parisian and the Cotai Strip in the future. So we'll come back to you with more information as our EBITDA continues to grow. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anil Daswani with Citigroup. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Okay. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my call. A couple of questions from me. First of all, you guys did an amazing job with hotel occupancy. Can you just highlight if there's been any change in the comp ratios that you provide for those properties? Secondly, could you maybe comment a little bit on how the different segments are playing out, so premium mass, mass, etcetera. Is there any focus of any particular property on any specific segment or are you just happy to grow them separately at each different property? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No. It's Rob. I think the second question, we'll take first. We're obviously happy to grow with every property, any property. The competition in Macao and Cotai is hard, strong. Our growth, though, I think, comes from our diversity in our pricing, and frankly, what makes us so unique, as I referenced earlier, was the ability to sleep people in the Four Seasons or the St. Regis as well as the Holiday Inn product. It's a very diverse mix of rooms. And we're not seeing a lot of change. We're doing better in the premium mass. Perhaps, we'd like to see more base mass pick up, but we attribute that to there's so much new product, new sleeping rooms, another 600 table games in the last year. So there's going to be some trial even from our customers that goes to see other properties, because the properties out there are very, very good and they're worth seeing. But we're not seeing a whole lot of difference in terms of the \u2013 the properties remain constant. Our strongest performer from a premium mass basis is our Sands Cotai Central. That's our weakest performer from a pure mass basis. The Venetian is the juggernaut. It does it all. It's amazing property. It has everything you want it to have. It's got incredible sleeping rooms, a large casino, a fabulous retail product, it's tied to the Four Seasons physically and now it's tied to The Parisian. So, again, diversity of pricing, diversity of product, be it lodging, be it retail, be it gaming, is where we excel and we really excel weekends and holidays. As our comp ratios, they really haven't changed much at all. We must be clear. Sheldon referenced the 1.1 billion impressions we got on our social media approach. I think that bodes well. We are in the hotel selling business for a long time. A lot of people are new to Cotai or in Macao because it's been a VIP-dominant market. But our competitors are smart. They're going to get there very quickly and figure out how some hotel rooms. We've just been doing it for a lot longer. We have more armor. We have more bullets in the gun because if you look at our convention ability, we're the only guys in town with that much group space to fill midweek. We're the only people in town with a large-scale arena. We've been putting these massive arena shows. So, we have an unfair competitive advantage when it comes to selling rooms. We've been doing it longer. We have more product doing better. We're not a boutique company. We're not a premium mass company only. We do it all in the mass space. So we've not seen a change in our ratios as far as comp cash. We have seen more competitive pressure, which we welcome. It's good for Cotai. We welcome more sleeping rooms on the Cotai Strip because we think in the end we get the lion's share of that business. And as that market continues to ramp, we will be its biggest participant in the growth. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you, and congrats on a great set of results. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you very much. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I just want to add on. We've always been the EBITDA leader in Macao. We have never once been even second. We've always been first. Galaxy has done a very good job of getting into the market, but we're still twice as big as they are in EBITDA. Same thing in Singapore. They I think are a duopoly, just came out with earnings yesterday \u2013 did I hear it right \u2013 that we're double what they are? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're about 74%... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're 74% of the market. There's got to be something we're doing right and our competitors are not doing. Another we've got this behemoth one-stop shop for everything, unprecedented in the world. I think we're going to continue to have a high hotel occupancy and continued increases in our gaming market. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Next.. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Oh with CLSA. Jon Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : I'd like to refer to Sheldon's remarks earlier when he said that trends in September are pointing to mass growing at roughly 6% and premium mass at 15%. As we look at visitation trends in the month of September, I believe the Macao tourist official number was up 0.5%, and to see such a strong mass performance and premium mass performance despite visitation numbers not being anywhere close to that would suggest that spend per customer is a very strong indicator. Would you be confident to say now that spend per customer as an indicator across all your properties in Macao is a positive indicator that it is now a growth segment again? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It is a growth segment. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. I think Jon, what Sheldon... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: But the market itself is growing. (40:29) in the market. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. I'm not sure we understand the question totally, but what Sheldon referenced was a 6% year-over-year growth in table game in mass and 15% in the premium segment. We think the market numbers \u2013 if you see October's numbers as reported by the government and you see what's happening to market. There's clearly a trend here. We're getting better customers in the market. We're getting more spend in the market. I can't see the correlation to more spend per customer. I can be clear about that. But I think what we are seeing... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We haven't done any surveys. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. I think what we're seeing is just lots of visitation and we're seeing lots of growth and we're very encouraged by that. I wouldn't be so bold to say we can correlate those two. But clearly visitation is, it is what it is and revenues are growing and they're growing \u2013 I think, somebody made a comment, they grew well in October. If it had not been for a couple weather instances and there was a lot of things happening, it may have been double digit. We're looking for that double-digit growth for the whole market. And again, we are a big believer in the rising tide theory. Obviously if Macao grows at 12% to 15%, we'd all make money. We'd all grow together. And that's what we hope happens in October, November, and beyond. We're looking for solid growth, mass, premium mass and all participants. Let's all grow in the same boat. Jon Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thank you. And if I can follow up with \u2013 and this is maybe I'm just seeking for a broader comment on the ramp-up speed for The Parisian. You guys have attained roughly about $1 million of EBITDA per day within about roughly 18, 19 days of opening in a month, and that's impressive. So what I think about and I'm sure everybody in this call today will be going back to our models and we're going to be thinking about what's the real earnings power of Parisian given that this has kind of surprised us a little bit. I'm just trying to think about how do we really size up the earnings potential of Parisian? I mean given that it's roughly the same number of rooms as The Venetian, but The Venetian is roughly earning about three times more in EBITDA per day right now based on the current run rate. And at one point it was running at over $5 million a day. Would you say that The Parisian has the tools to potentially do what The Venetian could do? Any comments around that? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think can it do what The Venetian \u2013 look, The Venetian is so powerful. The visitation went up and the gaming business increased. You're looking at what we're calling around here a behemoth hotel, a behemoth integrated resort. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: A big one too. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. And it's a big one. We're sailing in unchartered waters. I hope that The Parisian can equal what The Venetian has been doing. But right now, it's not indicated. It's doing very well. We're averaging 40,000 people a day. Our restaurants are so full, it's tough to get a seat. So we're taking out some straight retailers and adding some more restaurants. It was really designed \u2013 the government wanted a three-star hotel. A lot of the rooms are designed as four-star. But The Venetian is very unique, every room is a suite. And so there is no star rating that you could say it's a six-star hotel or a five-star deluxe. It's tough to compare any of the hotel to The Venetian. The quality and the critical mass of The Venetian, the size of the casino, the loyalty that it has and following from people who come to the mass market, I don't know. I certainly would hope so, but if not, if it doesn't equal The Venetian, it should get a lot closer than the other properties there. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Jon, I think Sheldon's comments are excellent. I think you have to be careful. Look, The Venetian has been operating for almost a decade. It's got an immense loyalty. It's so sticky, it's unbelievable. The quality of people in there, the size of retail, size of food and beverage, the room product. It's a very unique product and the answer is no. The Parisian can't get to The Venetian numbers. It can do very well. It can ramp and grow. But you're comparing apples and oranges because I think it was built in a different time. It was a lone wolf out there back in 2007 when we opened that thing. It's got unique everything, from rooms, to food and beverage. We have too much. We have lot of great food and beverage. We don't have that same scale in The Parisian. We don't have the room product we have in The Venetian. It's unfair. But I do think The Parisian is going to keep ramping, keep growing, getting stronger by the day. I also think the one thing it has going for is it's going to cross traffic very well with the Four Seasons, and that should give The Parisian more lift, a lift at Four Seasons as well. Think about what we have there with all those unique room pricing across the SCC. We have the product in the Four Seasons. We have The Venetian. We have all that great retail with Four Seasons shops which is getting stronger by the day. So, it's going to help Parisian. But I think it's unrealistic to think it's going to approach Venetian numbers. Venetian is $1.2 billion. You referenced $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion at the peak. It's hard for me to see it getting there. Great property, great start, but those are very big numbers. That is the juggernaut in Macao. Jon Oh - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thanks for the commentary. I really appreciate that. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Just following up on the last question, Parisian had 28% margins in the quarter. I don't think you reached that level with Sands Cotai Central until a year after the property opened. So, can you just help us think about the trajectory of the margins from here? Thank you. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Well, let's be clear, the reason for that, Thomas, as I think you know, is that they're very different products. SCC is a very powerful room product that is more dependent. It opened at a different time, as well, but it's dependent on premium mass customers. That's the calling card for SCC. It does very well, but it's a premium mass house. It doesn't have the themed walk-in free traffic. The Parisian is getting ridiculous walk-in traffic that it's free business. They walk-in, they gamble. Some sleep there; some don't. But the margins are great because of that. What it doesn't have yet is that premium mass customer that we get at the SCC. So the margins are going to be better I think for quite a while at The Parisian because they're paying retail for the room, or we're comping less people. SCC is much more comp driven and different time, as well. The interesting part is going to be how does it intersect with when the Four Seasons bridge is completed, how much crossover we get on weekends, holidays from that high-end Four Seasons customer, and we get more premium mass to gravitate. The race in Macao for the premium mass is a big one. There's a lot of people out there with great products that are looking for that segment. So, can we grow that segment quickly at The Parisian? That remains to be seen. The SCC is our biggest premium mass customer, but that's our biggest comp house and frankly our biggest \u2013 it's soft to the margins as a result of that. The Parisian has just overwhelmed us with demand. So, we've got to figure out how to take advantage of that demand and offer the customers the kind of things they want to satisfy that segment. But I think it's clear that the SCC got off in a different time and was much more of a different product. It didn't have any free traffic. It doesn't have much to this day. So, different products, different margins. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And less VIP, less VIP... Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Much less VIP. Yeah. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: One thing to add is that if you look at the margin of The Parisian, and you look at the margin of the overall property set on a normalized basis, The Parisian is geared for growth. So, that as we continue to grow revenues there and as we increase play volumes in the very high margin mass and premium mass segments, you'll see that that margin will actually creep up closer to the margin of the consolidated property set as a whole. So, that the cost base is in and that we should get pretty good operating leverage as we continue to get increased play. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I don't think any of The Parisian for what, 18 days, 17 days, can make a real bold statement about that property. It's just so young. It's just not as \u2013 I think after this full quarter, we'll have a better look at what that property can do. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. And this is my follow-up. In your prepared remarks, you talked about share repurchases. You've been talking about them for some \u2013 about not doing them, but the potential to do them in the future. Parisian has opened. How are you thinking about them at this point? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, I think we've always used the dividend as the cornerstone of our return to capital policy. It's very important to us. It's something that we view as fundamental. We always viewed share repurchases as a way to return excess capital to shareholders in an efficient manner in an opportunistic way. So, as our cash flows grow, we'll feel more confident about returning capital in terms of increasing dividends, but also in terms of using the share repurchase authorization and actually buying back some stock. So, as our cash flows grow, you should look to us to be more aggressive in the way we return capital to shareholders. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just sticking on the topic of Parisian. I was just wondering if you could help us understand a little bit more about the complexion of the Parisian customer just in terms of are they mostly base mass? Are you seeing some mid to higher end mass, where they're coming from, kind of income in visitation relative to your other properties? Any kind of different or similar patterns than the typical Sands China customer? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. We're definitely seeing more of a mass-mass, base mass customer to The Parisian as the dominant customer right now. What we're trying to sort through is we want to be more aggressive on the premium mass side or direct that over to Four Seasons, Venetian, SCC and can attract new customers obviously, which the real goal will be to attract fresh customers in the building. But the dominant segment right now at The Parisian certainly is a mass gaming customer, not a \u2013 we had good junket play there for the few we have, actually very solid junket play, but our premium mass is not as exciting as other properties. It's mass-driven at this point. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just to finish with that question just in terms of like where they're coming from. Are you seeing kind of an incremental visitor from different regions, or is it similar to what you're seeing like from Guangdong and kind of the general complexion of the regular Sands China customer? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, for those, we have data on, it's coming from Guangdong, from the Mainland China. Guangdong, there's a lot of unrated business in that building, so it's hard to tell everybody since, again, unrated, we don't have the data we would have on people asleep in the hotel or people have ratings in the casino. Again, this is a brand new building that we're just gratified the run rate appears to be strong after the first, what, 17 to 18 days. We're very happy with it. We are more happy with just the awareness of the property. The sheer foot traffic in that building is \u2013 at the opening night, I went down to the casino floor, and it was overwhelming, but it stayed that way for that entire week. So, we're just gratified at the customer acceptance, and we \u2013 again, I think it's hard. We're going to get tougher and tougher on breaking numbers out, because this integrated behemoth strategy Sheldon referenced with a \u2013 basically a 13,000 hotel, we're going to get less and less able to differentiate because I think we're going to use our pricing power, multitude of hotel room capacity, our multitude of gaming capacity, our retail diversity, we're going to try real hard to price this thing according to the customer demand, move the customer demand around our portfolio, and run this thing to maximize cost efficiencies but provide a great customer experience based on your budget and your demand. So, it may just be that The Parisian is being wildly helpful to making that portfolio stronger. We're encouraged. Early returns are terrific. It's a base mass hotel at this point. It's not driven by premium mass, and it isn't driven by junket, although we have some good junket play in there. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And as my follow-up, can you just help also understand just \u2013 I know it's 18 days, and you said you had a lot of unrated play, but in terms of just the source of customers so far, like in terms of database, what little database there is so far, OTA/wholesale versus new marketing? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: What's strong on the hotel side, again, I think Sheldon referenced it, we had terrific demand outside of our usual database for Mainland China. The social media approach here was just terrific, and the people who work for us there, exemplary work. Our team should be applauded for what was an incredible launch. So, we're seeing a lot of new business. It's not database. It's fresh customers coming in from Mainland China who want to see the product. It's just people. I think Sheldon referenced, number two behind The Venetian is places you want to see. And let's be honest, that themed approach, that is the magic elixir, that people want to see that Parisian themed approach, the Eiffel Tower. That fa\u00e7ade has great curbside appeal. It is driving all kinds of awareness. It's easy to understand it when you watch the videos, when you watch the social media stuff. It's just easy to understand. Just standing outside that building, no place ever had that many people outside talking selfies in the tower or the fa\u00e7ade of the building. We're in new waters here with new customers that we like seeing. I'm not sure we're stealing share as much as creating new demand from China for the sleeping rooms. But the gaming, as I referenced, is still in its early days, but we got to decide how much we want to push into the premium business there because it's a mass powerhouse so far. But again, 17, 18 days, we're reporting this quarter, hardly enough time to understand the power of The Parisian. But we are thrilled with the acceptance of it. We're thrilled with the walk traffic. You've never seen walk traffic. I've been going to Macao since the 1980s. I've never seen people walking back and forth in droves between the Four Seasons and The Parisian. It's pretty staggering. And again, our team, our marketing folks in Macao did some great work on the social media side. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I'm sure you and Sheldon have plenty of your own selfies in front of that property. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's all I do all day, yeah. Pretty much. That's all I do. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Okay. Operator : And we have time for one more question, and that question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks. A lot of my questions have been asked. But the one thing that we didn't talk about much in the call was kind of the VIP segment in Macao. And clearly, you see it in the DICJ numbers and we saw it in your numbers here today that \u2013 and there seems to have been obviously a change in that customer in the 3Q. Would you guys care to opine on maybe how you foresee the VIP segment going forward? Have we kind of hit a trough and maybe you're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel or do you think there was more of a temporary kind of bounce? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I can only speak, Carlo, for our portfolio, but I don't think it's temporary. I think this is not obviously our portfolio material to our composite EBITDA. It's rather unimportant at this point. I don't know how it recovers in any meaningful way. We are a mass-driven house, premium mass-driven house. It's become the point where we offer that opportunity for the customers who want it because it's part of our diversity, but I don't see how it gets much stronger with all that's happening in China and all that's happening both from a economy's perspective and a compliance AML perspective. I just think that's a market that \u2013 I said a couple of years ago and people were very upset. And I thought it's going to be very, very tough sleding, and it's a broken model and I think it remains broken as far as I can tell. I can't speak for our competitors, but from the LVS-SCL perspective, it's not a focal point. We won't turn it away, but we have to focus, we want to make our money. We make our money in table games, mass and premium mass, in slot machine, ETGs, we'll offer junkets and we'll wait for a better day, but we don't see that day coming in the next two quarters. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Rob, and if I may, just one quick follow-up and an iteration of this was asked earlier. But when you think about your cash balances and your leverage position. How do you guys balance the thoughts of increasing dividends relative to buybacks, but in the context of the potential for a large scale development, be it in Japan or somewhere else at this stage? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Carlo. It's Patrick. How are you? Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. You? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So it's a discussion that we have quite frequently, and I think the way we think about it is if you look at the timing of cash flows acquired to fund The Parisian, it's actually a fairly long development cycle where cash comes out of the system probably over three to four years, and there's a lot of visibility going through the development of these projects. So given where we are in our divided growth cycle and hopefully the trajectory of growth that we're seeing in Macao, we'll have some ability to do some planning work and hopefully, what the chairman says holds true and we end up getting opportunities in either Japan or Korea or both. So the timing of this should work favorably in the future depending on the dividend growth rate we choose and the requirements for funding these developments if they were to occur in the future. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's something that we'll work through, but it's really a timing question. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I appreciate it. Thank you. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time, and this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

Robin Farley - UBS Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group Operator : Welcome to the Las Vegas Sands fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs. Daniel Briggs : Joining me on the call today is Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor Provisions of federal securities law. The actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. We also want to inform you that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our investor relations website for your use. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question so we might allow everyone with interest, to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Gary Adelson : I\u2019m pleased we continue to execute our strategic objectives during the quarter and delivered another strong set of financial results with companywide adjusted EBITDA reaching $1.12 billion US dollars, an increase of 6% over the prior year. Fully diluted earnings per share increased by 8% over the prior year to $0.64 per share. During the quarter our Macao operations achieved strong mass gaming revenue growth and delivered $610 million of adjusted property EBITDA including a solid first full quarter EBITDA at $95 Million US at Parisian. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands continues to deliver steady cash flow supported by its mass gaming and non-gaming [inaudible].  The resilience and consistency in cash generation reflect both the strength of our business model and the geographic diversity of our cash flows which in turn underpins our balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we can and will continue to return excess cash to shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in new development opportunities.  We\u2019re excited by the recent legislative breakthrough in Japan to permit casino gaming within integrated resort. We believe our pioneering track record of creating the [inaudible] integrated resort, our development experience, and our financial strength put us in the pole position to take advantage of an opportunity in Japan and other new development opportunities in the horizon.  As I look back at 2016, the year began with still declining market revenues in Macao and the prospect of increased supply and competition. Despite these challenging conditions, we successfully opened another truly landmark must see destination resort in the Parisian Macao. The Parisian not only helped us drive double digit revenue growth in quarter four, but also greatly enhanced the critical mass benefits of our interconnected properties on the Cotai Strip as evidenced by our visitations growing 23% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  As you may recall, I had first indicated back in January last year that we were seeing signs of stabilization in mass gaming revenues in Macao and in June our mass gaming revenues saw positive year-on-year growth for the first time in two years. This encouraging trend continued into the second half of the year as our mass table revenues grew by 6% year-over-year in quarter three and further accelerate to growth of 16% in quarter four driven by the first full quarter of the Parisian.  Our marketing efforts continue to pay dividends. Our Parisian Macao social media program has now exceeded two billion impressions. Two billion impressions. This awareness is translated into strong property visitation. Based on our customer surveys at the various points of entry in Macao since Parisian opened, the most visited casino resort in Macao remains the Venetian, but in second place was the Parisian.  Our strategy was to create a critical mass of interconnected resorts on Cotai. With the completion of the Parisian we have almost 13,000 hotel rooms in four interconnected resorts, over 840 stores across four shopping malls, two million square feet of meeting and exhibition space, and four performance an event venues including our Venetian Cotai arena which can be utilized either for our MICE or for major entertainment events. This critical mass of product and amenities allowed us to cater to virtually every type of visitor. Business and leisure visitors to Macao will be able to enjoy all of this and more under one roof and one destination. Because of our industry leading investments in MICE based integrated resorts in both Macao and Singapore we are unique in the absolute scale of our cash flow as well as our dominate share of the industry\u2019s cash flow. Scale, diversity, and critical mass allow us to outperform our competitors.  This unique ability to generate consistent and industry leading cash flow in turn under pins our balance sheet strength. That balance sheet strength at 1.8 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter, allows us to stay full committed to our development plans while continuing to return excess capital to shareholders. Again, this is unique in our industry. Now, let me give you some additional highlights of our results in Macao for the quarter. For quarter four, adjusted EBITDA from Macao operations was $610 million US, an increase of 5% against the prior year. Overall net revenues increased by 12% given the growth in mass gaming and non-gaming segments. There were some items that benefitted prior year\u2019s fourth quarter and impact the year-on-year profit comparison which Rob and Patrick will explain later. Our cost efficiency programs have continued to track well. We achieved more than our stated goal of $60 million of incremental cost savings in 2016 and have realized more than $310 million US of annual cost savings since quarter one of 2015. Despite the significant increase in gaming and hotel capacity compared with the prior year quarter in the Macao market, our mass table gaming revenues grew by 16% year-over-year within which premium mass segment grew by 20%.  We experienced broad based growth across both premium mass and mass segments underpinned by our ability to drive increased patronage with hotel accommodations, shopping malls, and entertainment events. One item to note for the fourth quarter, we held towards the low end of our expected hold range in mass tables. We estimated low hold in mass tables particularly at the Parisian impacted our EBITDA negatively by between $15 million and $20 million US.  During the quarter hotel occupancy across our portfolio increased by almost four percentage points against the prior year to 89%, despite significant growth in both our own inventory and the inventory in the Macao market. This again, highlights our advantage during peak periods with the higher hotel occupancy feeding positively into our gaming and retail revenues. In the market where peak periods, the weekends and holidays, matter more than ever before and where mass market customers will generate the lion\u2019s share of [inaudible] revenue and profit [inaudible]. Our capacity advantage was further strengthened by the addition of the Parisian. The Parisian Macao generated $95 million US in adjusted EBITDA in its first full quarter of operations. Mass table and slot revenue per day at Parisian was $2.2 million US, despite low non-rolling hold while hotel occupancy was 91%. The addition of the Parisian to our Cotai Strip development really takes our critical mass and diversity of offering to another level. This is the only MICE based integrated resort complex of this scale in the world. The completion of the bridge between the Four Seasons and the Parisian in November has further increased the synergies in traffic and patronage between our properties. The foot traffic of approximately 14,000 per day in the month of December. It is also worth noting that despite the recent increase in the supply of luxury retail in Macao, our retail sales at the Four Seasons Retail Mall grew by 6% in quarter four.  In summary, we regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao\u2019s success in realizing its objectives at diversify its economy. Supporting the growth of local businesses, providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens including through our Sands Academy and reaching its full potential as [Asia\u2019s] leading business and leisure tourist destination. We have steadfast confidence in both our and Macao\u2019s future success.  Now, moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We delivered a solid quarter at Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $366 million US. Our mass win per day was in line with the prior year. At the same time Marina Bay Sands continues to service the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large scale integrated resort developments. Now, let\u2019s move on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders via dividends. The Las Vegas Sands Board of Directors last year improved an increase in our recurring dividend program of the 2017 calendar year to $2.92 US for the year or $0.73 per quarter. We remain committed to maintaining our recurring dividend program at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. Recurring dividends are the cornerstone of our return of capital policy and we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow.  Our industry leading cash flows, geographic diversity, and balance sheet strength enable us to continue our recurring dividend programs while retaining ample financial flexibility to invest for future growth and pursue new development opportunities. We achieved many important strategic objectives in 2016. My original vision for the Cotai Strip in Macao was further realized with the completion of the Parisian. The new property enjoyed a strong opening against a backdrop of increased competition and has rapidly become a new landmark destination in Macao. The structural advantage from our unmatched critical mass and diversity of offering was evident in our strong financial results in the quarter and the year, both in Macao and globally.  All this enabled us to look ahead to the future with confidence. We have a strong organic growth outlook, we\u2019re in a great position to pursue new development opportunities, and we have both the intent and the financial flexibility to continue to return excess capital to shareholders.  That concludes my prepared remarks and I want to thank you for joining us on the call today. Now, let\u2019s take questions. Q - Shaun Kelley : I just wanted to maybe start with just the revenue picture in Macao. Obviously, it feels like on a year-on-year basis things have improved quite meaningfully, but as we start to look at the sequential movement between Q4 and Q3 it feels like you didn\u2019t pick up a lot of market share when we compare your overall revenues to the market. So, I was kind of curious as Parisian\u2019s ramping, do you think there\u2019s more opportunity on the revenue line and how do you feel about your sort of steady state or your current market share? Robert Glen Goldstein : Are you referencing all the portfolio or just the Parisian? Is your question about the Parisian\u2019s future or the whole portfolio? Shaun Kelley : It\u2019s really the whole portfolio Rob. If I [inaudible] back to the envelope it looks like we\u2019re looking like share was probably in the low 23% range and was actually slightly higher in Q3 than it was in Q4 when you had a full quarter of the Parisian. Robert Glen Goldstein : Right. Let\u2019s put Macao in context. Q2 of \u201916 we did less than $500 million in EBITDA and yet in Q3 and Q4 cumulatively we did $1.240 billion of EBITDA. We successfully absorbed the Wynn opening and the Parisian opening. The Parisian did over $115 million in EBITDA for Q4 plus the 17 days it was open in Q3. In six months our run rate has improved to roughly based on Q3 and Q4 to about a $2.5 billion annual EBITDA run rate.  The big difference between Q3 and Q4 from my perspective is the hold percentage on the mass table side. It\u2019s staggering these numbers, but we\u2019re throwing off $5 billion this quarter of table drops so if you adjust the 1.3% miss Q-on-Q we were up $1.3 in Q3-over-Q4. It\u2019s about $60 million of topline revenue. I know it\u2019s not statistically important, because in the long run when you\u2019re dropping $20 billion we\u2019ll get to the right number, but we held less in Q4 than in Q3. Adjusted, we assume that number popped by about $60 million to $63 million. Again, we\u2019re absorbing a lot of additional capacity. We have a lot of belief that the Parisian is going to get stronger and stronger. We have held incredibly poorly there, unfortunately, Sheldon referenced in his opening remarks, we actually held about 18% on a volume that was about $900 million, so that\u2019s disappointing. The Parisian should have had another $15 million to $20 million to its numbers. It didn\u2019t. That also holds true at the [SEC] did less, did about $19 and the same with the Plaza, so we had a little bit of, I wouldn\u2019t call it bad luck, we just took the lower end of the range which adversely impacted the topline. On a go forward basis, we couldn\u2019t be more bullish. We think we have the right assets, we think we have, in a market that\u2019s clearly about scale and capacity, the lodging, the retail and gaming capacity to service the demand and that\u2019s especially true, we believe, on high volume weekends and holidays like the one we\u2019re going to have next week. This is the future Macao and we are at the epicenter of that future and the growth. We are very, very much a believer in double digit mass revenue on the tableside will translate very well in the future for us and we\u2019re a big believer in Macao. We\u2019ve come a long way in the last six months from where I think was not scary, but concerning time, in Q2. We feel a place of strength here in January. A lot of confidence in the future and a lot of confidence in the revenue growth. Shaun Kelley : Just a quick follow up, did the promotional environment, or do you think the competitive landscape pick up a little bit in Q4 as people are starting to try and stabilize with what\u2019s going on in the market? Did it feel differently than it felt for the first few weeks after the Parisian opening? Robert Glen Goldstein : There\u2019s always going to be a market [inaudible] experienced this massive [inaudible] drop of 70% and it\u2019s just recurring a little healthiness. There is going to be some occasional signs of promotions. But again, in a mass market it is difficult to overspend, unless you\u2019re just being silly about it. Can you provide a few meals or a few meals? Yes. A lot different than a high roller environment where the comp excess can be excessive. Do I think there\u2019s a few things here and there? Yes. But, do I see in our portfolio or in others indications of massive over incenting or promotions? I do not.  I think the market remains pretty disciplined. We all recognize that in the end you\u2019ve got to deliver margins and you can only give away so much against a mass market. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem, I just think we need to see sustainable mass table growth and acceptable range of the whole percentage, to get us to a 650 or 675 number in the future. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far off in fact. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Greff - JP Morgan. Joe Greff : Rob, just a question on the Parisian ramp throughout the fourth quarter. Would you say it adjusted for the high VIP holds and adjusted for the low win in premium mass? Would you characterize the property\u2019s ramp as pretty consistent or accelerating throughout the quarter, or was it more even or did it decelerate through the quarter? If it was the later, to what would you attribute that? Robert Glen Goldstein : I will reiterate what I said earlier, that is when you drop $900 million you hold only 18%, you kind of say to yourself you lost $25 million to $30 million right there and that\u2019s not a pie in the sky number. Our historical holds is in the 21 to 22 range. So, I right away said, \u201cOkay, give yourself a $25 million to $30 million kick there in a positive direction.\u201d The VIP hold was a little high but it doesn\u2019t really mean that much at the end of the day, it\u2019s high but the truth is that that segment isn\u2019t the key segment, it\u2019s dwarfed by the importance of the contribution from the mass. It\u2019s much more important.  I think that it was a steady ramp. I think in the Parisian there\u2019s a couple things to think about. The bridge opened up in late November early December and that\u2019s been a positive towards the ramp, that\u2019s adding more body count inside there. Secondly, I mentioned the hold percentage which you can\u2019t refute the fact that we should pick up three points there over the course of the year and we will. Three, I think the Parisian is going to keep ramping because as Sheldon referenced, two billion people have now went online and have looked at the Parisian somehow someway. That\u2019s a staggering number from anyone\u2019s perspective.  Lastly, I think we\u2019re somewhat surprised at the strength of the premium mass demand for the Parisian. We positioned it more as a mass property. We\u2019re rethinking the room mix, we\u2019re adding some more suite product. It won\u2019t kick in until late in \u201917. My point is that we\u2019re just so pleased at the results thus far. We\u2019ve got a $400 million plus run rate. It should do a lot better once it beats a few more customers. We have some [inaudible] and good for them. One particular customer, she wins every day and she\u2019s doing very well and she affected the numbers.  But, as we get the suite product right, as those impressions keep building, as that bridge keeps maturing the ramp will continue. I didn\u2019t see a real change in numbers, it was pretty steady throughout. The Parisian is an unqualified winner. Any time you get $100 million roughly in the open like we did the first quarter and some change, that\u2019s an impressive start but, there\u2019s better days ahead for the Parisian. Lastly, I think the connectivity between Four Seasons, Venetian, and someday we\u2019ll get the other produce across to SCC, that\u2019s going to make that racetrack again, give us a very, very exciting set of assets all integrated working together, 13,000 sleeping rooms, 800 stores. The Parisian has got some great legs ahead of it. Joe Greff : Sheldon, I was hoping maybe you could give us updated thoughts on any progress you might be making with monetizing or partly monetizing the retail mall at Singapore. I know you\u2019re some months away before you have permission to do that, but are you premarketing that, are you soliciting levels of third-party interest? If you could give us some sort of an update. Sheldon Gary Adelson : We are in preparation with our bankers to prepare that property to sell. We can\u2019t sell it until March or April of this year, 2017. It isn\u2019t going to take that long. The interest we have is that it is the highest trophy mall there is in the world. We anticipate almost an unprecedented price to sell 49% of it. We\u2019re preparing but we can\u2019t sell it until March anyway. We want to give enough time to the perspective buyers to do their due diligence and from what we\u2019re told by a lot of people it is the best trophy mall there is in the world. We expect to receive a very heft, very significant price for the 49% we\u2019re willing to sell. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis - Instinet, LLC. Harry Curtis : Just a quick follow up in Macao. You\u2019ve walked through a little bit of the impact of bad luck, but according to the press release in Macao you did play lucky overall by about $44 million, so you must have held reasonably well elsewhere. Can you give us a little bit more color on that? I think most of us haven\u2019t really had time to go through the details of the press release? Robert Glen Goldstein : To put it in perspective, less than 10% of our business emanates form the junket segment that we reference in the luck factor. It may have thrown off a few more, but I\u2019m looking at it right now on the whole portfolio, the profit segment coming out of junkets is roughly 9% what it is out of mass tables. We have not historically normalized mass tables, perhaps we should rethink that. To put it in perspective for you, if we dropped $20 billion this year, which we think we\u2019ll do more than that, and you think about range of $20 billion to $22 billion, two points could be $400 million. At the margin it\u2019s probably about a couple million EBITDA, so obviously, very impactful. In the past the market\u2019s always looked to normalization of the higher roller, the junket business, when in fact, in this market today, especially for our portfolio it\u2019s not all that relevant. While you\u2019re actually correct, we play lucky for a few million, the truth is the junket business just isn\u2019t that impactful relative to the mass business and the mass business, the miss, was $67 million, depending on what number you use whether you use 2% or 3%, so it kind of negates it and adds some more volume. I\u2019m not pretending that we didn\u2019t play a little lucky in the junket, we did. But again, on a historical basis that\u2019s been the focus when in fact, the focus has to shift at some point to the huge amount of money we\u2019re doing.  I think in the end the volatility in this mass segment is always being trumped. In the end it works out just fine because our volumes are staggering, they\u2019ll overcome the volatility. But, quarter-by-quarter my point is a miss like this, we could have easily had a $50 million increase, $60 million increase, had we held a point more. You wouldn\u2019t have noticed it, it wouldn\u2019t have appeared statistically important but it\u2019s a fact and something you need to consider in the future. I think the junket thing should be minimalize based on the overall contribution to EBITDA mix. Harry Curtis : I\u2019m still a little bit confused. When you guys report 566 of hold adjusted property EBITDA, is that only adjusting the junket piece and not the mass piece? Robert Glen Goldstein : Correct, you\u2019re absolutely right. Which, it seems like we\u2019re out of synch with what\u2019s happening today, because you\u2019re absolutely correct, we don\u2019t adjust the hold percentage on the mass just on the junket and those numbers reflect that. That\u2019s like the Parisian, the Parisian held a big lucky in the junket, but it was dwarfed by the $25 million to $30 million it could have gotten off the mass tables. Our normalization may be a little bit inaccurate in terms of what\u2019s happening in the market today.  We may be alone, because no one does as much mass business we do due to the amount of tables, hotel rooms, etcetera, but nowhere I can think of is there $20 billion of table drop, mass table drop, in any jurisdiction. Again, that\u2019s why I told you earlier, a couple of three points either way, $400 million, it\u2019s impactful. Harry Curtis : Sheldon, if you could take a minute and describe what you believe will be the process from here in Japan and your thoughts on timing and possible potential ownership interest there. Sheldon Gary Adelson : We\u2019ve had somebody in Japan this past week who just came back yesterday, or the beginning of the week and the feeling about the partners is not very strong. They say that it\u2019s not likely to be in the law. The law is being formulated by, I think, the interparty committee that was formed before the first law passed. They have one year to submit an implementation law that will determine the who, what, why, when, where, and how of how they\u2019re going to establish the integrated resort with casino bill. I don\u2019t have much more to offer than what you see in the press.  I\u2019m going over there in about three weeks to give a talk at an event there, in the third week of February and I\u2019m optimistic. Look, they\u2019re basing this on our Singapore property. Prime Minister Abe has visited the property. He was very impressed with it and so I think it\u2019s going to be modeled after our property the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. I\u2019m optimistic and people tell us we\u2019re in the pull position in terms of getting the concession. Some people say the new bill that has to be done within a year could be less than a year or it could be the whole year. I really don\u2019t have anything new to add to that other than what you\u2019ve read in the press. Operator : Your next question comes from Robin Farley - UBS. Robin Farley : I wonder if you can give a little color, there have been some comments where permits for your management team in Macao that are not Macao residents are not going to be renewed. I wonder if you could talk a little bit if that was expected by you and would that affect anything that\u2019s in place now? Robert Glen Goldstein : I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referencing. I\u2019m a little taken aback. What have you read that we didn\u2019t read? Robin Farley : It was a comment that there\u2019s a goal to target a certain percent of Macao management, and originally this was a 2020 goal, but the comment in the papers in the last day is that they\u2019d maybe like to see that this year instead of 2020. Robert Glen Goldstein : I\u2019m not comfortable referencing what you\u2019re saying but I think the truth is, our team is probably already there. If we\u2019re not there already I\u2019d be surprised because I was there last month and I think most of our people at the management levels, the people I deal with every day the 100 or so people on the management side are all holders of the proper identification. I don\u2019t think they have an issue. Sheldon Gary Adelson : I read it last night in the clippings. They\u2019re proposing that by 2020 I think it is, sometime in the future there\u2019ll be 85% of the senior management should be Macanese. Robin Farley : It was a 2020 suggestion that they might want to see this year was what the media was suggesting. Robert Glen Goldstein : They can look at it right now as far as I\u2019m concerned. Our team, I look on the table there and I think we\u2019re there. I don\u2019t think we have any issues because we\u2019ve been doing this for the last two years, we\u2019re big believers in that approach and support the government\u2019s agenda. We\u2019d like to have all Macanese people and so I don\u2019t think we have an issue today and by 2020 I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t have an issue. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant to us. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix - Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Rob, regarding some performance in Macao, I just wanted to revisit. For Sands Cotai Central and Venetian in the quarter, just kind of looking at the numbers that you reported, might say that the Parisian was cannibalizing these properties. We talked a lot about holds so maybe it makes that noisy or maybe it\u2019s because the connectors not up yet, but I was just wondering if I could hear your take on that. Robert Glen Goldstein : Let\u2019s start with the fact that the new property, obviously you know Galaxy, Studio City, Wynn Palace, you\u2019re talking about 4,500 hotel rooms and 600 new gaming tables in the last year and a half and so obviously, we\u2019re looking at a huge increase in capacity both lodging and gaming. Then, you add the Parisian and then of course the SCC, the St. Regis, with another 3,400 rooms, another 125 tables, so huge increases.  As it relates to the Venetian having just been there, I don\u2019t know how much more we can do at the Venetian. It continues to be a billion plus property. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being cannibalized. I\u2019ll tell you one thing we are experiencing at the Venetian is the Parisian is a great looking property that people gravitate to. The sleeping rooms have not been as well received by some of the better customers who then move towards the Venetian and Four Seasons. I think if anything, the Venetian had a pretty good quarter. It held fine, it had no issues with luck, it had plenty of business across the board. If it runs at 1.1 or so I\u2019m pretty happy with that performance. We\u2019re redoing some rooms there and making the floor fresher and newer. We keep making sure that place stays at the number one position in Macao. But as far as appeal and people wanting to go there it just continues to amaze me how powerful it is after a decade of operation. The SCC is a different story. SCC I think is the polar opposite of the Parisian meaning that the SCC it did have a very tough quarter in terms of hold. It held on the mass 19.1 on a basis of $1.4 billion so that didn\u2019t help that we clearly left behind significant dollars there. Based on a 2% or 3% move it could have been $20 million to $30 million more. Having said that, I think the weakness in SCC might come from the fact that the Parisian is so damn attractive that the mass customer just gravitates to the Parisian. It\u2019s a fact of life. On the flip side, the who wants to sleep in a better facility might go back to the SCC after he sees the Parisian or the Venetian. It doesn\u2019t have the connectivity. If anybody would tell me if one property gets sort of bit I would point to the SCC. I think the Parisian has been helping the Venetian and helping the Four Seasons Plaza property. I think we\u2019ve got some things happening which we can\u2019t talk about in this call at SCC that will help its attractively. Both there\u2019s a new attraction coming in there in the future as well as the bridge will come along. Our connectivity bridge from the SCC to the Four Seasons will help the SCC. Sheldon Gary Adelson : To the Parisian. Robert Glen Goldstein : Right, to the Parisian. I think in the end the side of the street where the Parisian, and the Venetian, and the Four Seasons is feels very good, not cannibalized. If anyone\u2019s vulnerable a bit, it could be the SCC. Most of our high end business stays there because of the room product. It doesn\u2019t have the mass business we\u2019d like to get over there. It had a disappointing quarter from my perspective, down $50 million from Q3 and nowhere to hide that. A disappointing margin, a little bit of hold percentage probably could have popped through, over 31%, but you\u2019re right if anybody was affected it may have been the mass customer who now finds his or her way to the Parisian. Felicia Hendrix : Just reminds us when the connector opens? Robert Glen Goldstein : The bridge will open end of \u201917. We have so many different things happening. There are a couple of other things happening at the SCC, but the connector bridge was approved by the board, it\u2019s in develop mode now, so Q4 \u201917? A - DD We\u2019re talking about the pedestrian bridge, not the bridge from Hong Kong Airport? Sheldon Gary Adelson : It\u2019s essentially a raised air conditioned sidewalk connecting what we refer to as parcel six which is the Sheraton at two towers at 2,000 rooms each, 2,000 keys that connects to the bridge. The connection gives us a complete racetrack type connection. It\u2019s unprecedented anywhere in the world that there are 13,000 rooms connected without having to leave the building. You don\u2019t have to go outside to connect all those rooms of different price points and all that retail, 840 or 850 retail shops, and the entertainment and the gaming, and the restaurants. There\u2019s no place in the world like this.  Once we get that bridge open, but we\u2019ve got to promote the heck out of it so that people will understand it\u2019s a once in a lifetime kind of experience. Robert Glen Goldstein : We need government approval on that bridge. We don\u2019t expect it to be an issue, but we are waiting for government approval before construction begins. Felicia Hendrix : Moving on from that now, I wanted to ask about the Parisian and the EBITDA margins there and where you might expect margins to stabilize for the property? Or, maybe looking at it another way, which property should the Parisian be most similar to in terms of op ex per day? Robert Glen Goldstein : That\u2019s a good question. Sheldon would say the Venetian and I would agree with him. I think the Parisian, by the way let\u2019s be clear, a couple of things to think about, a brand new property just getting its sea legs. We\u2019re spending more on advertising and more on promotion to get that thing off the ground. We\u2019re very proud of the money we\u2019re spending, we believe it will yield large term dividends, but short term we\u2019re spending money there to make sure that property gets significant awareness.  We think we\u2019ve been vindicated so far because it\u2019s performance is pretty good for a starting property. Two, I had mentioned earlier we were thrilled about the premium mass demand but a lot of these customers don\u2019t want to stay - we don\u2019t have enough accommodations for them so we\u2019re going to accelerate some room growth into some larger rooms for some of these better paying mass who now will stay at SCC, or Wynn, or Galaxy or somewhere. There, I think your margins should resemble the Venetian down the road with one exception, it will never have the retail portfolio we have at the Venetian, obviously. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable to be at [inaudible]. To Harry\u2019s comment a couple of calls back, we on the junket side at the Parisian, we did play luck at 4.2%, but the contribution is not that terrific from the junket side. The fact is had the Parisian looked like the Venetian, it would have picked up $33 million more in mass table win.  The Parisian is going to be a machine of mass table play, it just is and as that margin will move, as that EBITDA will move, as that hold percentage drifts to a more normalized range. If this thing had picked up three or four points, you could have had a $125 million quarter, but it didn\u2019t. It just didn\u2019t play that way with luck. We had a couple of very exceptional pieces of bad luck which is fine, that will even out in time. But once we get that thing fully ramped, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever get the retail contribution because again, the Venetian retail is much larger and much more impactful, and we\u2019ll never get the room rate the Venetian gets, but I do think on the gaming side we should be able to achieve margins that resemble the Venetian and it should hold its way. I think the Parisian has some great days ahead of it once we get the rooms right, get the bridge fully operational, pull out some of the advertising, and opening costs. This is a brand new building, it\u2019s an infant and infants take a little more care and more money to get them there. The Venetian is an old girl, she\u2019s been around 10 years, she\u2019s made $10 billion, she\u2019s not quite an infant. When we get this thing in place we have a wonderful racetrack of properties, as Sheldon has talked about it before, it\u2019s all integrated, it\u2019s powerful stuff. I think the Parisian is going to perform very, very well and you\u2019ll be pleased in the future with how it shows up in the margin line. Operator : Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Sheldon, you talked a little bit about the potential for a 49% stake sale of the Singapore mall, any sense of how you\u2019re thinking about proceeds from that in terms of repatriation of the cash and maybe intentions you would have with it were you to be successful in that sale? Sheldon Gary Adelson : Not should we be successful on the sale, we will be successful. We haven\u2019t decided what we\u2019re going to do with it. We\u2019re waiting to see. There are more noises coming out of Korea now that Japan is talking about legalizing casino gaming. There are more noises coming out of Korea. I\u2019m not saying it is as good a prospect right now as Japan has shown itself, but it could happen. Korea could happen. Before we decide what we\u2019re going to do with the money, we\u2019ll want to see what the development opportunities are. We can always get money to develop properties.  We have a very good relationship with the bank. We rewrote one of our bank loans for 25 basis points less and we didn\u2019t give them any more. We just thought we should have 25 basis points less. Our CFO came up with the idea, he called the banks and they just dropped the rate. I asked him why he didn\u2019t ask for 50 basis points and maybe even 100.  When I think back to the time when I was actually poor and it took everything I had to borrow $10,000 from a bank and when I look at money now I look at all the banks we have in our portfolio and I see they\u2019re all willing to go to the max. We can get a number of banks each that will give us $400 million; each. We can get plenty of money. But, we haven\u2019t decided what we\u2019re going to do with it yet. Carlo Santarelli : Rob, if I could, obviously the hold issue or I should say the margin issue has been kind of talked about quite a bit on the call. One of the questions that I kind of have is as you think about the promotional environment, and it looks like your promos as a percentage of mass gaming revenue in the period were up about 90 bips year-over-year, I\u2019m assuming a lot of that relates to the Parisian coming online, etcetera. But, could you maybe talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of promotional activity on the mass and what maybe some of the competitive response has been? Sheldon Gary Adelson : I just want to finish my answer to your question before. We\u2019re looking at potentially $3 billion to $3.5 billion US on the sale of 49%. That alone tells you it will be the most expensive mall every sold in the world. Carlo Santarelli : Sheldon, when you say we\u2019re looking at, is that kind of where indications of interest have been or is that kind of what you\u2019re targeting as what you want for the sale and maybe they\u2019re on in the same? Sheldon Gary Adelson : I would really like to see [inaudible] a full handle. I think that\u2019s unrealistic. I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019ll end up in that range, it\u2019s what people are talking about. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m like Donald Trump, I think I\u2019ve been a good negotiator, I might want to do a little better job than what the market wants to do for us. Robert Glen Goldstein : Having been doing this for too many years, I was in Macao last month looking at that very issue with our team and visiting properties. One of the great things about our business is the high roller business is always fraught with over spending, and over promotion, and over incenting. It\u2019s just the nature of the beast, because when people lose that kind of money the sales people in management tend to gravitate and spend too much. It has just been a part of my world for 35 years. In Macao that beast has gone away because it\u2019s become a mass, premium mass market. There\u2019s not as much to give away. Free rooms, what a free bus ride, a comp\u2019d meal. I wish we could give away more rooms, because when we give away a room we make a lot more money than when we sell a room. Unless, you look at more aggressive comping of rooms and dropping theoretical rates as over comping; I don\u2019t.  If you\u2019re getting $1,000 a night and you drop it to $700, that\u2019s still a very good investment in your gaming floor and use of your lodging capacity. I don\u2019t see it. I know people want to hear that there\u2019s over incenting and over promotional activities in Macao, I just don\u2019t see it. I think we deal with some very, very smart people over there. They\u2019re patiently waiting. Are there more buses going into the terminal and more people getting on frequent flyers? Yes. Are there more free rooms? Maybe. But, I don\u2019t think over incenting is the issue. To your comment about our margin, I think that margin gets cured very quickly when you normalize or you simply give yourself a higher end of the range. I don\u2019t want to make it sound like we under held by some dramatic number, it wasn\u2019t, but the point is on $20 billion, $20 billion think about that number, a few points means a lot of money. We can look very smart next quarter, we hold 22 instead of 19, all of a sudden the margins will go up by 4% or 5%. I think that\u2019s the bigger issue and so on a quarter-by-quarter basis when you examine these figures and look at margins with a very strong look, I think that\u2019ll move depending on a little bit of luck and hold percentage. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be an issue of over incenting or over promoting. I mean that is true for our competitors as well as us. I don\u2019t see Macao as a market out of control. Carlo Santarelli : Do you think the statistical hold percentage on the mass side in Macao, is 22 the midpoint of where you think that number should be theoretically? Robert Glen Goldstein : I don\u2019t have a good answer and I\u2019ll tell you why. We think it\u2019s in the range of 20 to 22 and I think it\u2019d be crazy to try to pin down an exact number, I think a range is more acceptable because, there\u2019s always issue of false drop, there\u2019s things you can\u2019t always take into account. But, I think in the range of 20 to 22 is a reasonable range. But, my point is even though it may not be statistically important, when you think about 19.2 versus 22.2, three points on a billion dollars, on $10 billion, on $100 billion, the movement is significant, it could make these results skew dramatically in our favor, or as in this quarter we look a little weak on the margin at 32.9 versus 36.5. But, last quarter we held 22.4 and we held this quarter 21.1. 1.3% on $5 billion, it causes some margin erosion. My point is not that we\u2019re looking to control it or give you an exact number, but bet aware that is something that is going to get more and more important. We\u2019ve built something in Macao. What we\u2019ve put together is unique and 13,000 rooms, and all those different hotels, and all those retail, and all that gaming ability. This weekend the numbers are going to be off the chart huge and so we could hold lucky and have an incredible weekend or miss by five or six points and not. It\u2019s not something we can control, it\u2019s not something I want to spend more time on, but it\u2019s a fact of our world that you can\u2019t ignore that massive number. It\u2019s much more important than a few points on the junket side. Operator : Your last question comes from David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group. David Katz : What we\u2019ve observed, and heard about, and read about over the past three to six months are a couple of things : some increasing comfort on the part of junkets and VIP players with returning to Macao; and second, some changes in the Chinese economy and commodity prices that have, I think, by all accounts increased performance and our expectations over the past few months from where they would have been three to six months ago. That I think appears somewhat momentary but I\u2019d like your views and context around that and how sustainable you think the GGR trends that we\u2019ve been seeing and hearing are throughout the next couple of quarters, or the remainder of the year in whatever context you can discuss it? Robert Glen Goldstein : We\u2019re dead flat year-on-year on the junket volume. We\u2019re at 10.89 versus 9.05 so I don\u2019t see us experience it. Where I think we do experience it, gratefully and thankfully, is in the premium mass side and the mass market. That\u2019s where I think we\u2019re seeing the impact and the increase in play. The reason I\u2019m grateful is because it\u2019s much higher margin business and it\u2019s, I believe, much more sustainable than the junket model.  I would be not being honest with you if I told you I understand whether commodity prices impact that business or not. I do sense in China and I do sense in our business in Macao, a return to a little more confidence by the customer. Our sales people tell us that. we see more belief in what\u2019s happening in China and more comfort. But, for me to make a macro statement that\u2019s going to be across the economy, I can\u2019t do that. I can only tell you what we hear. Only 1% or 2% of all China visits Macao. Our sample size tells us that our premium mass customers feel better, they\u2019re spending more, the volumes indicate that and that\u2019s the bread and butter of Macao, not the junket business. We believe that\u2019s sustainable. Our model will be vindicated and will be a big participant in the growth of those numbers in 2017 and beyond. That\u2019s my take on that. Sheldon Gary Adelson : The clippings from Macao say that [inaudible] the new head of the DOCJ or DOCOJ, whatever it is, it\u2019s an acronym for the Portuguese name on what we call the gaming control boards. He said that there is only going to be about 120 or just a couple more junket licenses given out. When I think of how many there were in 2014 before the drop back in the business, there were 250 to 270 junkets licensed. Now, there\u2019s only going to be 120. There\u2019s a big difference and when you\u2019re talking VIP versus mass and premium mass, you\u2019re talking like a win is a VIP house, we\u2019re a mass and a premium mass house. We do have some of the VIP market, but to us it\u2019s not as important, it\u2019s only a single digit percentage of our total EBITDA. David Katz : If I can just follow that up and ask about capital allocation. Your position on dividends has always been clear, but as we look forward if you could talk about cap ex that you may be thinking about for the future, share repurchase, and how you\u2019re thinking about that as well as your well understood dividend policy, that would help. Patrick Dumont : If you look on page 32 of the earnings presentation that we posted to the website, you can see that there\u2019s a tail off in our cap ex as our development projects complete over the next two years. The key thing is that as we continue to grow EBITDA and grow cash flow from the operating assets that we have, we\u2019ll also have a reduced cap ex burn that will hopefully even out to be approximately $500 million of maintenance cap ex per year. Our cash flow profile will change materially from where we are today, assuming that we\u2019re able to achieve this. The key thing here is, while we said that the dividend is a cornerstone of our internal capital policy, and you can see the board and the chairman\u2019s commitment to increasing the dividend overtime as our cash flows grow, there\u2019ll also be an opportunity for us to return cash through share repurchases as these cash flows materialize. The other thing is hopefully we\u2019ll have an opportunity in Japan, or an opportunity in Korea, or other new growth in a high growth jurisdiction where we\u2019ll be able to deploy this capital and get a very high investment return.  Do we feel like we have the financial flexibility with our balance sheet to be able to return capital in the near term? As our cap ex tails off we\u2019ll be able to return of capital and hopefully we\u2019ll have an opportunity in new jurisdictions to really grow shareholder returns by investing in new MICE based integrated resorts. That\u2019s kind of the blueprint, it\u2019s what the board talks about at every meeting and hopefully as time progresses we\u2019ll have an opportunity to make those investments to grow and create shareholder value.

Fully diluted earnings per share increased by 50% over the prior year to $0.60 per share. During the quarter, we again generated strong cash flow across all of our operations, with solid growth in both Macao and Las Vegas. Our Macao operations grew its EBITDA by 20% year-on-year, driven by 17% mass gaming revenue growth. Marina Bay Sands continues to deliver strong cash flow. Adjusted property EBITDA was up 33% for the quarter. Our Las Vegas operation delivered its best quarter since the first quarter of 2008. The resilience and consistency of our cash generation reflect both the strength of our business model and the geographic diversity of our cash flows, which in turn underpins our balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we can continue to return excess cash to shareholders while investing in our existing assets and maintaining our ability to fund new development opportunities. I remain as confident as I have ever been in our company's prospects. After a challenging period, the Macao market is growing again and its growth rate has been accelerating for three consecutive quarters. Our Macao operation is experiencing strong growth in both our mass gaming and non-gaming segments. And we have successfully established a new landmark must-see destination resort in The Parisian Macao. Our Macao mass gaming table revenue growth rate was 18% this quarter, up from 16% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Parisian has not only helped us drive this double-digit revenue growth, but has also greatly enhanced the critical mass benefits of our interconnected properties on the Cotai Strip. Our visitation expanded 30% year-over-year in the first quarter, reaching 21.2 million visits across our portfolio, compared to 16.3 million visits in the first quarter of 2016. On a daily basis, that translates to a daily average of nearly 236,000 visits across all our properties in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a daily average of approximately 179,000 visits across all our properties in the first quarter of 2016. Our SCL retail mall revenues also grew nearly 24% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2016, reaching $118 million for the quarter. Our strategy was to create a critical mass of interconnected resorts for Cotai, creating what we have trademarked as the Cotai Strip. With the completion of The Parisian, we now have almost 13,000 hotel rooms in four interconnected resorts, over 840 stores across four shopping malls, 2 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space, and four performance and event venues, including our Venetian Cotai Arena, which can be utilized either for our MICE business or for major entertainment events. This critical mass of product and amenities allow us to cater to virtually every type of visitor. Business and leisure visitors to Macao will be able to enjoy all of this and more under one roof at one destination without ever leaving the building. Our unique ability to generate consistent and industry-leading cash flow supports our balance sheet strength. That balance sheet strength at 1.8 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of the first quarter allows us to stay fully committed to our development plans while continuing to return excess capital to shareholders. Again, this is unique in our industry. Now let me give you some additional highlights of our results in Macao for the quarter. Quarter one adjusted EBITDA for our Macao operations was $624 million, an increase of 20% compared to the prior-year quarter. Overall net revenues increased by 15%, driven by growth in both the mass gaming and non-gaming segments. EBITDA margin expanded by 140 basis points to a market-leading 33% as we benefited from ongoing cost efficiencies and improved business mix. Despite the significant increase in Macao's gaming and hotel capacity, compared with the prior-year quarter, our mass table gaming revenues grew by 18% year-over-year and our non-gaming revenues grew by 22% year-over-year. We experienced broad-based gaming growth across both premium mass and mass segments, driving increased patronage with hotel accommodations, shopping malls, and entertainment events. Hotel occupancy across our portfolio increased by over four percentage points this quarter compared to the prior-year quarter to 82% with occupancy in the 90s on weekends and holidays. This growth in occupancy occurred despite 8,000 new hotel rooms being added to the Cotai market over the last two years, including 3,000 from our own Parisian. Our total occupied room nights increased 13% compared to the first quarter of 2016. This includes growth from The Parisian and contributions from our other properties, each of which delivered a higher occupancy in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Same-store room nights also increased, even after considering the room nights for The Parisian. It's important to note that 8,000 new hotel rooms in Cotai have now been successfully absorbed in the Macao market over the last two years. Despite the new competition on Cotai, we've retained our scale and critical mass advantages during peak periods. The higher hotel occupancy positively contributed to both our gaming and retail revenues. In a market where peak periods, the weekends and holidays, matter more than ever before and where mass market customers will generate the lion's share of future revenue and profit growth, our capacity advantage was further strengthened by the addition of The Parisian. The Parisian Macao continued to ramp up and grew its EBITDA by 8% sequentially on a normalized basis. The Parisian experienced double-digit sequential volume growth in both rolling volumes and non-rolling table game drop. Not only has The Parisian been successful as a standalone property, The Parisian also benefits entire Cotai Strip portfolio. The Plaza slash Four Seasons property in particular has experienced an uplift in visitation and business volumes since The Parisian opened, and the bridge between Four Seasons and The Parisian, which averages approximately 20,000 crossings per day was completed. Mass gaming revenues grew by 15% over the prior year and retail tenant sales grew by 7% over the prior year despite the increase in the supply of luxury retail in Macao. This year marks the tenth anniversary of The Venetian Macao. When it opened in August 2007, The Venetian stood alone on Cotai. Its opening marked the first step in my vision to create the Cotai Strip. Within 10 years, Cotai has gone from zero to around 60% of Macao's overall gaming revenues. Non-gaming industries such as retail, MICE, and entertainment are now well established in Macao and will continue to flourish and grow. Meanwhile, The Venetian Macao has become the most visited integrated resort in Asia. The addition of The Parisian to our Cotai Strip development really takes our critical mass and diversity of offering to another level. This is the only MICE space integrated resort complex of this scale in the world. We remain fully committed to play the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. In summary, we regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses, providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens through our Sands Academy and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. We have steadfast confidence in both our and Macao's future success. At Marina Bay Sands, we delivered a solid quarter with EBITDA of US$365 million. When measured in Singapore dollars, our mass win per day for quarter one was the second highest quarter since the opening of the property. At the same time, Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large scale integrated resort developments. Our Las Vegas operations generated EBITDA of US$122 million in this quarter, our best quarter in Las Vegas since the first quarter of 2008. Record convention and group meeting business helped generate our strongest EBITDA, hotel ADR, and RevPAR since 2008. Now let's move on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders. Yay, dividends. As you may recall, the Las Vegas Sands Board of Directors last year approved an increase in our recurring dividend program for the 2017 calendar year to $2.92 for the year, or $0.73 per quarter. The 2017 dividend increase marked the sixth consecutive year that we have increased our recurring dividend. We remain committed to maintaining our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, and we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic in returning excess capital through our share repurchase program. We repurchased US$150 million of stock during the quarter, and we look forward to continuing to utilize the share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Yay, buybacks. In conclusion, our cash flow generation continues to be strong and predictable. The resurgence of growth in the Macao market has continued during the quarter. The structural advantage from our scale, critical mass, and product diversity is evident in our strong financial results, both in Macao and globally. We continue to maintain our position as the number one EBITDA producer in Macao, the number one gaming and integrated resort developer company in the world. We look to the future with confidence. We have a strong organic growth outlook, and we are in a great position to pursue new development opportunities. And we have both the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call today and now we'll take some questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen, your line is now open. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess on Marina Bay Sands, can you give us any thoughts or progress on monetizing the retail assets there and how you would think about allocating that capital now that you've initiated the buyback program? Thanks. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey. How are you? It's Patrick. Good to hear from you. So it's still very early on. There's a process that we're hoping to engage in and we look forward to reporting back with more information as we progress in that process. But there's really not a whole lot to report right now in that regard. In terms of return of capital, hopefully we'll be able to get some of the results that were discussed on prior calls at a cap rate that's very attractive. And when we obtain that capital if we're able to get through with the sale, I think at that time we'll take a very close look at our return of capital program and evaluate enhancing shareholder returns through using that capital. So if there's a high growth rate project available to us in a new jurisdiction that could help fund that type of development, although, depending on the time of those cash flows, it may create more of an opportunity in return of capital. So that's something that we'll discuss with the Chairman and something we'll discuss with the board. But I think, at this point, all options are on the table. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then bigger picture, how do you think about the capacity at the properties in general and the potential impact from infrastructure projects that are poised to come online over the next year or so? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: At Marina Bay Sands? Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: In Cotai. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Oh, you mean Cotai. Okay. Why don't you repeat that one more time, Stephen, if you would? Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just looking for a little bit of bigger picture thoughts on the capacity of your existing properties and how to think about the potential impact from the infrastructure projects that are coming online and maybe you could tie into margin kind of targets for some of the properties that just came on. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Well, let's start with the long-term view of Macao which we view extremely favorably. Infrastructural improvements including new ferry terminal are imminent; the bridge is probably 2018. Two more Cotai properties will open up in 2017/2018. But from that point forward, you see a capacity constrained as a more new capacity coming onboard from a gaming perspective. It could be additional lodging capacity. So we view Macao in the most favorable way. We see a fixed amount of capacity in the gaming side, perhaps a little less so in the lodging side. We see more visitation, more penetration from mainland China into Macao. We see the emergence of a stronger and growing Cotai. So I think \u2013 well, again, penetration's critical. We couldn't be more positive in how we see the market. But we see it as based on capacity, based on our ability to grow our market share in the most important section which would be the mass tables and slot machines. To your reference in our deck, pages 13, 14, 15, you can see we had very, very strong growth on a Q-on-Q basis. The numbers are really compelling and we think that's the segment we do best in. 30% growth in the premium mass tables win by quarter and 9.4% from the base mass. So that bodes very, very well. The flow-through, as you know, the margin on that business is extraordinary. Look, we couldn't be more bullish on the future of Macao. We see great infrastructural improvements. We see great opportunity to penetrate China further. We see limited capacity beyond the opening of MGM and SJM projects. So look, as the largest, we believe a rising tide will carry all boats and we have a very large boat in Macao. So we're very bullish on our prospects over there. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And on Parisian specifically, I guess any sense for where those margins could go as it continues to ramp up? Thanks. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Parisian had a interesting quarter. It did $82 million, which at first glance is under we hope it to be. But if you rethink The Parisian from a few different perspectives, the first being that we grew in every segment. Most importantly, we grew in the 9.8% Q-on-Q and mass tables from $895 million to $983 million in the drop. We again held poorly. We held 18.2%, well below the range. Probably cost us $30-plus million in revenue, which is disappointing, but that's life in our business. Our slot business Q-on-Q grew 6%. Our junket business grew 24%. It's clear to see that The Parisian is just a winner. The question is how far can we ramp it. When we get a little bit lucky and hold better and we get some more \u2013 frankly, we get some the hold percentage coupled with, thinking, look at the composite mix of our slots, tables, and also our room mix. We were surprised by the amount of premium mass demand. We grew 30% in the premium mass segment Q-on-Q at Parisian. We're rethinking our suite mix there, looking at other CapEx, ways to make the product better. We're thrilled with the exterior of the product. We're thrilled with the interior of the product. We have to rethink some of the room mix perhaps, but The Parisian has got a very, very long shelf life and I think the growth there is imminent. We'd like to see it get to $500 million-plus in the future. We have a lot of confidence in it. The margins will move when the hold percentage moves up, and frankly we start beating some of the people that come to gamble with us. The participation, though, and the occupied tables are extraordinary. The cover counts walk in, they're extraordinary. We're rethinking some of the retail and food product. But suffice it to say we're off to a very encouraging start. And I think $350 million, $400 million is a starting point; $500-plus million's a destination point. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful color. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun, Your line is now open. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. Rob, maybe to follow-up on that, on the last point on The Parisian. Could you just give us just a little bit more color on either incremental capital investment or the things you could do to get to that $500 million target? I mean just a little bit more specificity there would be great. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Well, first thing that I'll reiterate, we're thrilled with the growth in all segments. I just, when we look at the numbers, to see mass table growth and junket growth like that, it's pretty \u2013 we're delighted with that part of the business. Again, in the margin side, I'll reiterate that it's nice to win some money. So $30 million, $40 million more would helps the margin side. But looking at CapEx, showing how we think about that property, every time you open a new property, there's never been one open I can remember in all the years I've done this, where you don't go back and rethink some things you did better or worse. I think the food mix; we need more affordable food product. And we've got to look at some more food court expansion. There's some retail successes and retail failures. But I think the retail's got some rethinking to do. And perhaps, most importantly, I guess we're delighted, but surprised by the amount of high end business once asleep there. We're overwhelmed with demand in quality rooming supply, very frankly. So we're looking at the mix. We're going to talk about how we rethink the mix on these suites to get more premium mass in the door because we are \u2013 as you know, we're firm believers that's the path forward to us getting to $500 million in all of our products. We believe in premium mass and mass. We're fans of the junket business, but our strength has always been mass, premium mass. So the path forward is look at the retail, look at the food, look at the room mix. Perhaps add some more suite capacity and continue to grow that new hotel. We're excited by the exterior, which we think is one of the best things in Macao. And we're excited by the cross-traffic out of Venetian and The Plaza into The Parisian. So really feel bullish about where The Parisian can go from here. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that. And then you alluded to the second part of my question which is probably more broadly across the Macao portfolio. But the big surprise, it looked like, in Q1 was just how much VIP business kind of re-entered the market. And when we look at your Rolling Chip volumes, I think including The Parisian, they looked like they were pretty much flat year-on-year. So just overall, while clearly that's not the core strength of LVS, I mean, is there a point at which you begin to re-evaluate or think about re-engaging some of those junket partners and tweaking the product a little bit to focus on that segment a little bit more? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Unequivocally. I couldn't agree more with you. I think we need to go back and readdress it. We have been \u2013 we want to be more involved in that segment. We still think we get not enough credit for the business we do. And we make a couple \u2013 $300 million, $250 million a year in slots and in ETG. But to your point, as much as our focus is mass and premium mass, we should go back and address how we do better. The results in town make us rethink that. We spent some time looking at that. And there's no way to deny that we should be doing better and can talk to our partners and say what can we do to improve our Rolling Chip volume externally with the junket partners. So, yeah, there's no way to hide from the fact that's a point we could do better at and something we'll focus on. Again, my only concern there is I think the growth in that market, in that segment, benefits us in a strange way in that it adds more liquidity in the premium mass business which we grew at 30% year-on-year. I think part of the value of the junket segment is the liquidity it adds to the market in that other segment which we do participate in, not to deny we'd like to do better in junkets. Although the flow-through is not as exciting as our mass, premium mass segments or near to what our slot business, but still, why leave money behind? So one of our points of interest in the next few weeks is to sit down with our partners and readdress how we can do better, yes. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Remember that \u2013 this is Sheldon \u2013 remember that the percentage of, it goes down to the bottom line for us of EBITDA from the VIP, the rolling business, is less than a quarter of the percentage of the premium mass and the mass. So it's not really very enticing to push the business out from premium mass to the VIP or to the junket business. And it's just not that exciting to me, but we shouldn't pass up any opportunity to make any money, so that's what \u2013 that's what Rob was referring to. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe, your line is now open. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hear you good, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Rob, given the strength of the VIP market in Macao, obviously, you're not necessarily seeing it in the 1Q numbers, but are you starting to see that segment in Las Vegas pick up? And are you seeing incrementally more mainland Chinese VIP players flocked to Marina Bay Sands? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I'll start with Las Vegas. Joe, our approach in Las Vegas, we're seeing a better gaming environment, but I think it's still dwarfed by the power of the lodging story in Las Vegas. I'm not going to say there's not a pick-up here and there, but I don't think it's broad-based and I don't think it's that impactful. We're still in Las Vegas experiencing nice. We had a great quarter. We made some money in the VIP segment, obviously Chinese New Year's. We certainly made money in the slot business, but our focus in Las Vegas remains or our concentration to profit remains on the lodging side. We had a tremendous \u2013 we're back to \u2013 if I made it back to 2008 or 2007 in terms of ADR and RevPAR. So, yes, there's a lift, but I wouldn't consider it material at this point into Las Vegas from China. MBS, I've got to take a minute to just recognize how strong I feel about the performance there. I think it's extraordinary that we did $388 million normalized without having a strong VIP business over there. Frankly, what's really compelling about MBS is this is a product that it's a benchmark product for all new jurisdictions to look at, both aesthetically and from an operating perspective. In a rather difficult environment because of the downturn at GGR, headwinds from the currency perspective, I think MBS is just extraordinary to have a run rate of $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, maybe better, to be the shining star in the development world and operational side of our business. I'm very proud of our results there, but no, it's not driven by VIP out of mainland China. The diversification, geographic diversification of MBS is just compelling. We deal with a lot more business coming out of Malaysia and Indonesia, Korea, Japan. In fact, I think last time I looked, the contribution from China fell to 20%, which is both terrific in one regard and also it might make for a good story when VIP reemerges into MBS. But you have to take a look at MBS and be \u2013 I'm very proud of our results there. $388 million normalized, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. A great mall sale on the horizon. It's just a great business over there. We lead the market in ADR. We're 70% of the EBITDA composite goes to MBS, and so I think it's just a great story all these years later. And it's not really being helped that much by VIP at China from both a rolling or non-rolling perspective. So that's the story as far as how we see MBS and Las Vegas. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Using that as a reference site, everybody in Japan, Korea, those places that have yet to legalize IRs with the gaming, they're all referring to Singapore. They want an MBS-type integrated resort and it is the reference site for the entire world. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yes. No question. Anytime we get a new jurisdiction or visit, tours government or businesspeople, it's always MBS they refer to aesthetically, and frankly, operationally. And it's a great product for us. We're very proud of our success there. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I was going to ask a follow-up question regarding The Parisian but then Rob you piqued my interest in talking about the retail mall sale in Singapore. If you mentioned it earlier in the call, I missed it. I guess where are you in that process? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I'll defer to Patrick on that, Joe. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Before we get there, I want to point out to you that I want to repeat, $118 million, that's about a $500 million run rate. And if we were to achieve in Macao, not Singapore, Macao, a 3% cap rate, and I think that's achievable, that's a lot of money. Nobody, may a lot of money. Nobody ever thought that our mall business would put us in the same business as some of the mall operators, and it's actually it's a consumer attraction for us. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No question. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And even if we sold it, that's $500 million and it's still some growth left to come. And we've asked the government for permission to expand our retail in a separate standalone shopping mall. So I feel very, very good about the value. If we do a good deal on Singapore, which I'm convinced we will do, then we may consider Macao. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, Joe, I think the important thing about MBS is it's, in our view, the most iconic retail asset in the world. It's very well known. It's very well photographed. It has a tremendous level of productivity and we feel that it will draw a significant amount of interest from the people who invest in these types of assets. That being said, we're very early on in a process that still needs to be established and there's still a lot of work to do. But we're happy that we're engaged in the process, and we'll report back as we have more information. But as a practical matter, we're highly confident there'll be a lot of interest. That being said, one thing to note is that we intend to maintain control of the mall. It's a very important asset for us. And we think that it's important to maintain control of the mall asset in Singapore, even if we're able to find a third-party investor in it. But right now, early on in the process and really nothing to report on that front. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas, your line is now open. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Just related to Macao, can you just talk a little bit about your current mix of cash versus comped rooms and the potential opportunity there over time? Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, compared to the, say, in Macao, we're doing very well in Singapore. We're improving significantly here in Las Vegas. So in Macao, what we've learned is our competitors, the other five operators, concession holders, they give away most of their rooms. We don't. We sell a lot of our rooms for cash. Do you know the percentages, Rob? Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're about 50/50. But I think, I think, Tom, is the key over there is, as Sheldon referenced, is that most of our competitors aren't in the cash rooms selling business. They're more on the comps side. With our size portfolio, we have a mix. It depends on mid-week, weekend. We like to give away more rooms with the right qualified customers. We're happy to give away rooms for the right customers and we're happy to sell the rooms for the right number. We're pleased that we stayed, I think, pretty strong in the overall cash side. We have a very strong outreach program. We've been doing this for a long time, well before anybody else got to Cotai. We've been selling cash rooms for the last decade. The mix will move based on market demand. We're very clear we want to bring more casino guests in, but we have 13,000 keys every night to sell or comp. It's a lot more than those who have got a couple thousand. So we're a lot different I think than the usual hotel casino in Macao. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: The other point to make, too, as we've comped more rooms with The Parisian being opened, number of rooms is up. The percentage is relatively flat, but the actual productivity of those rooms on the gaming floor has actually been going up as the market has recovered, as the premium mass has continued to grow that we're seeing the ADT for those comp customers actually increase over time. So it's a good investment for us to put those customers into the rooms. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up question on Macao; obviously, you're more focused on the mass market. But just related to VIP, there have been some articles out about how the DICJ is auditing the credit issuance records of the junkets. How are you thinking that could affect the market in general? Thanks. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We don't know, obviously, because we don't know what the extent of that is. We're very comfortable, again, that we've been in that environment for a long time. I think the head of the pack in terms of auditing and being careful with our partners to take the necessary \u2013 the regulatory requirement precautions. So whatever the outcome is, the outcome is. We have no way to determine that. I don't think in the end it's going to be that impactful, personally. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think the Macao government is being prudent. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yep. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And being cautious. And they don't want any repeat of what happened before. And I take my hat off and I salute the Macao Government for doing so. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well said. Well said. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Of course, it's well said. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anil Daswani with Citigroup. Anil, your line is now open. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my question. Over the last couple of quarters, we've seen a lot of strength in the MICE business as well in Macao. Could you comment as to what percentage of room nights that now is taking up in Macao? And also, how that is affecting the base mass business? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I don't think that we have that number, the MICE business. But we are looking forward to a resurgent, if I can use that word, when the bridge opens. Bear in mind, when the bridge opens, Macao will have two airports, one in Macao and one called the Hong Kong International Airport covering 100 airlines, servicing 100 scheduled carriers and covering 180 cities with those 100 scheduled carriers. Look, I was in Macao recently and I tell you it was even tough to get into the General Aviation Terminal. So Macao is very strong. And \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 Hong Kong is very strong. And that'll be when the bridge opens operationally at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018, I think it \u2013 but nobody knows how that's going to affect everything. But being the expert on the MICE business, it's certainly going to open up Macao as a destination for MICE organizers. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: There's been two impediments to MICE growth. Just think about, one is, as Sheldon referenced, the bridge, and access to Macao makes it a very difficult thing for most large-scale organizations to consider. So that's been an impediment. The second is, our other hotel casino competitors, our associates over there, don't want to necessarily be in the MICE business in the past because they were playing mostly with the junkets and comp customers. So it was not really an issue. I think today, once the bridge is complete, this could grow a pretty material part of Macao's business, the same way 20 years ago people scoffed in Las Vegas that the MICE business and today they can't get there fast enough. It's going to evolve and get better with the bridge opening, and honestly, with more rooms available mid-week for other people beyond our portfolio to participate. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you. As a follow-up question, in terms of other regions in Asia, clearly Japan, can you give us an update there? And if there are any other major cities in Asia that you're currently looking at? Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We have been looking at other countries in Asia for a long time. They are not moving that fast. Japan is what everybody is talking about. We have been informed by people in the know in Japan that LVS is by far, not just marginally, but by far, ahead of the other competition as a candidate to get the IR approval. To the point where even a couple of people \u2013 I had a meeting last week with some Japanese here in Las Vegas, and they said that because of us the Japanese Government may even allow us, one operator, meaning LVS, to have an interest in more than one IR. And, of course, we would like \u2013 we've been told that we're in the pole position in more than one location. Well, I don't know whether or not the Japanese Government will allow a foreign company to have two IR locations. But then again, there is nobody out there that's an effective competitor with us. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think, look at our balance sheet and our development portfolio, it's a pretty compelling story and, of course, we have the appetite. So we're certainly hoping that Japan evolves for us. And we believe it's an incredibly important market. And there's nothing else really in Asia today to talk about that's at the forefront. I think Japan is the story at this point. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you very much, guys. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: But that doesn't mean we're not looking at other countries. We're certainly looking at Korea. We are looking at Vietnam. They're just starting to experiment a pilot program. We're not necessarily in love with the conditions or the three-year test period. We don't want to spend billions of dollars and find out in three years they've changed their mind and they're not going to allow locals in. So we want to see how that goes. And we are still active in lobbying in Thailand. So we're also looking at South America. And we're looking at a couple of, one in particular if something happens in New York, we certainly will be a candidate there. We're the largest gaming and integrated resort company in the world, by far. Our market cap equals or exceeds all the other Las Vegas companies combined. So we're what other people look to, other emerging markets look to, not being that familiar with our industry, they'll look to the biggest and the people that could bring the greatest benefit to them. And MICE is where our greatest benefit is. We are the MICE operators, and all of our properties are MICE-based. You can think of when we built The Venetian Macao, we put in an 800,000 square feet of exhibition space, and, save for the Canton Fair facility, we're the biggest facility. We were the biggest facility in China, the country of 1.3 million (sic) [1.3 billion] people. So where would emerging markets look to? Of course, they'll look to us first. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared, your line is now open. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I'd love to get your perspective on the mass market right now. It's growing but it's also now growing meaningfully slower than VIP, which really is actually growing a little bit. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Jared, you got to go to page 13 in our deck. That's just, that's not factual. You can go to page 13 of our deck and take a look at the first quarter of 2017, you've got a mass table and slot business together that's growing at about 14% and a VIP market that's growing at about 12%. And the numbers that are coming out of DICJ are representing VIP and mass before you have the reclassification of mass that's within the VIP classification where smoking is allowed and it's a meaningful and important part of the market. And it's growing probably faster than any other piece of the market. So it's a mass component that's super-super important. And Rob can talk about that in a little more detail. But I wanted to make sure that is very, very clear to everybody on the call. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I'd like to make \u2013 I'd like everybody to make sure that the profit margin on the mass and premium mass is four times that of the profit margin of VIP. So we can grow four times assuming they're both above 50% of the market. The last DICJ report that I read was that VIP for the last quarter I think was 55% of the GGR, the gross gaming revenue. But assuming it's approximately 50%, the VIP has got to grow from a profit standpoint, and that's what we're interest in, four times faster and higher than the mass and premium mass market. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, as far as new smoking policy that's out there, can you talk about your expectations on that for VIP and from how you understand it, is this effective as of January 2018? Curious any color you can share on that. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Yeah, I thinks it's pretty standard that with the thinking here is it'll be approved for 2018 with a one-year grace period, so probably it's Q1 2019 it kicks in, which is great from what this respect. It preserves smoking, which I think makes a lot of sense in any market to have a smoking component. It also allows the operators to build the smoking areas, the smoking rooms where people can go smoke on the gaming floor. Look, smoking, there is no way to deny that smoking and gambling in Asia is very important. It's important to a lot of the people gamble there. So you'll be able to preserve that smoking ability by those who do smoke on the gaming floors. Probably Q1 2019 it kicks in. There'll be the one-year grace period. Yet it's enacted by 2018 Q1, but actually happens in Q1 a year later of 2019. So we'll have smoking. It will be confined to smoking rooms. We will build a lot of smoking room capacity in the next 24 months to get there. And it's an essential component for us and other operators. It's one of the big negatives in the newer buildings on Cotai. The lack of smoking is a big differentiator and hurtful to the business volumes over there. There's just no denying the appeal of smoking to a lot of Chinese consumers. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Thank you. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Harry, your line is now open. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to Vegas for a moment. Very strong pricing in the first quarter probably helped by CON/AGG. Can you give us a sense for the balance of this year and also next, particularly with the opening, the re-opening of the Moscone Center and then eventually Ryman in Colorado? Give us a sense of your view on what a reasonable rate of room pricing growth should be over the next couple of years. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You're talking about two different things. You're talking about the MICE business and whether or not there's competition from Denver and San Francisco. San Francisco and Denver have been there for a long time, period. The growing of facilities doesn't necessarily bring in additional events. What it usually does, my having spent 17, well, 43 years in the MICE business both as an organizer and as a supplier of facilities, what usually happens is they don't bring in additional shows, and maybe once in a while they get a very small show. But they don't loosen up dates. The existing shows grow and they want more space. So if they're building additional space, most likely a lot of it, I can't tell you what percentage, but more than 50% will be taken up by existing shows. And you still can't compete. These other countries, sorry, these other cities cannot compete with Las Vegas. Denver is still Denver no matter how much space they got. And San Francisco is still San Francisco, period, and although they're two great cities, they're not Las Vegas. People come to Las Vegas just to be entertained. The LVCVA put out a number, like, some time ago that said that only 14% of the people that come to Las Vegas come to gamble. So people come here for non-gambling. They come for bachelor parties, bachelorette parties. They come here just to enjoy what Las Vegas has to offer. And before I was in the business, I used to come for what Las Vegas had to offer. And other cities building, first of all, I don't know if you know that they've already built them or they're going to be finished and imminently, but it isn't going to make any difference. The city is still the city and expansion will be taken up mostly by, I'm not saying 50/50, I think it's much more than 50% by the existing shows that are growing. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Harry, it's Rob. I just think that, I think Sheldon's comments are spot-on. I think this city is unique. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You can say that again. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I just think we're in a unique environment here. Great rooms, great diversity of pricing, great things to do, terrific weather. And in the last 20 years, all it does is it get better. I think the future here is very strong with the group business. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : And do you think that a couple of your operator colleagues in Vegas have established a 4% to 5% RevPAR growth target? Is that a reasonable growth rate assuming 2%-plus GDP growth nationally combined with no supply growth in Vegas? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We don't typically establish long-term growth rates for any of our business that we talk about publicly, but as a practical matter, we see very strong growth in both room nights and contracted rates on the forward calendar. But we won't comment on any growth rate. Our business will continue to grow as the market continues to strengthen. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: If you go to \u2013 I'm going to the San Francisco Bay Area and the average hotel price in a quality hotel is two to three, at least twice that of the best hotel in Las Vegas. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. We are still cheap relative to other markets. I think Sheldon's point's well taken. This is still a bargain of bargains. You look at the quality of these hotels and what they have to offer compared to some of these hotels you sleep in the Bay Area and L.A. This is still a real bargain. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And paying two to three times as much money as the best room would go for here in Vegas. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: The high end of the market as well is where we operate. And some of our competitors with guidance out there have a much broader, deeper portfolio of low-end hotel inventory that they have to try to manage which is a different challenge than the one we have. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : That does it for me. Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Harry. Operator : We have reached the allotted time for our Q&A and have time for one more question. And your last question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad, your line is now open. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me regarding Sands Bethlehem which has been impressive amongst the regional assets but still tiny for your overall contribution. Could you help us think about how this fits into your portfolio and the thinking and given the strength in your other markets, how this works into the three to five-year plan? Thanks. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, clearly, it's a mismatch in terms of our Asia assets, even Las Vegas. But we also look for opportunities to invest our money intelligently. And I think Bethlehem represents a pretty extraordinary investment in terms of what we put into the market versus what it returns to us, although it's a small number, obviously, relative to our other assets. It's still a compelling investment. We're very proud of it. As you referenced it, it just keeps making more and more money and doing very, very well. I think it's the strongest producer of EBITDA in Pennsylvania. So having said that, I'll let Patrick talk about... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I don't think there are too many regional properties around the country, even here in Vegas. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Bethlehem makes more money than some of the hotels. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We make more money than most hotels. Yeah. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hotels in Las Vegas. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It does. It makes more than most hotels on the Strip. Patrick, you want to chime in? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think you covered it. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Okay. So we like Bethlehem. We'd like to find, obviously to your point though, it's a mismatch relative to the \u2013 when you're running a $4 billion, $5 billion EBITDA business, the $150 million or so is not material. But it's still a good investment. We're proud of it. And it had a very strong quarter. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Chad. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This was a great quarter and I'm very pleased with our results. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA was US$1.21 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased by 38% over the prior year to US$0.73 per share. During the quarter, both our Macao and Singapore operations performed exceptionally well. Sands China grew its EBITDA by 23% year-on-year driven by strong mass gaming revenue growth. And Marina Bay Sands achieved its second best quarterly EBITDA since opening with year-on-year growth of 38%. I remain as confident as I've ever been in our company's prospects. The Macao market is growing and its growth rate has been accelerating for four consecutive quarters. At the same time, the significant new supply that has been added on Cotai since 2015, amounted to over 8,000 hotel rooms and over US$13 billion of additional invested capital, has successfully been absorbed by the market. Our Macao operation is experiencing strong growth in mass gaming and non-gaming segments. And we have successfully established a new landmark, must-see destination resort in The Parisian Macao. Our Macao mass gaming table revenue growth rate further accelerated from 18% in the first quarter to 23% in the second quarter. In its third full quarter of operations, Parisian Macao achieved a quarterly EBITDA of US$106 million. Our strategy was to create a critical mass of interconnected resorts on Cotai. With the completion of The Parisian, We have almost 13,000 hotel rooms and four interconnected resorts, over 840 stores across four shopping malls; 2.5 million square feet of meeting and exhibition space; and four performance and event venues, including our Venetian Cotai Arena which can be utilized either for our MICE business or for major entertainment events. This critical mass of product and amenities allow us to cater to virtually every type of visitor. Business and leisure visitors to Macau will be able to enjoy all of this and more under one roof, at one destination. Our retail mall portfolio across Asia continues to thrive, which demonstrates the success of our strategy to develop destination retail as a differentiation component in the critical mass of offerings in each of the Integrated Resorts in our global portfolio. Both Macao and Singapore delivered double-digit retail sales growth for the second quarter. Our annualized operating profit is now well in excess of US$0.5 billion. Both malls are poised for further enhancement in the tenant mix. Because of our industry-leading investments in MICE-based Integrated Resorts in both Macao and Singapore, we are unique in the absolute scale of our cash flow, as well as our dominant share of the industry's cash flow. Scale, diversity and critical mass allow us to outperform our competitors. Now let me give you some additional highlights of our results in Macao for the quarter. Quarter two adjusted property EBITDA for our Macao operations was US$600 million, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. Total net revenues increased by 23% driven by growth in mass gaming and non-gaming segments. We maintained a strong EBITDA margin of 32.7% as we benefited from revenue growth and our ongoing cost efficiencies. Despite this significant increase in Macao's gaming and hotel capacity, compared with the prior year quarter, our mass table gaming revenue grew by 23% year-over-year and our non-gaming revenues grew by 22% year-over-year. We experienced broad-based growth across both premium mass and mass segments. Increased patronage and length of stay with hotel accommodation, increased spend at our shopping malls and entertainment events. Our premium mass business performed exceptionally well with growth of nearly 40% over the prior year. During the quarter, hotel occupancy across our portfolio increased by 8 percentage points compared to the prior year to 86% with occupied room nights growing by 35% compared to the prior year. The Parisian Macao grew its EBITDA by 29% sequentially to US$106 million with solid sequential growth in both gaming and non-gaming revenues. Not only has Parisian been successful as a standalone property, The Parisian also benefits our entire Cotai portfolio. The Plaza/Four Seasons property in particular, has experienced an uplift in visitation and business volumes since The Parisian opened and the bridge between Four Seasons and Parisian was completed. Every gaming segment at Plaza experienced strong revenue growth during the quarter and Four Seasons' retail sales grew by 7% over the prior year, despite the increase in the supply of luxury retail in Macao. This year marks the tenth anniversary of The Venetian Macao. When that opened in August 2007, The Venetian stood alone on Cotai. Its opening marked the first step in my vision to create the Cotai Strip. I was absolutely committed then and I remain as deeply committed today to continuing to support Macao's economic diversification and its transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Non-gaming industries such as retail, MICE, and entertainment are now well established in Macao and will continue to flourish and grow. Meanwhile, The Venetian Macao has become the most visited Integrated Resort in Asia, if not in the world. The addition of The Parisian to our Cotai Strip development takes our critical mass and diversity of offering to another level. I believe this is the only MICE-based Integrated Resort complex of this scale in the world. We remain fully committed to playing the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. In summary, we regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses and providing meaningful career development opportunities for citizens, including through our Sands Academy, and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. We have steadfast confidence in both our and Macao's future success. Now, moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We delivered an excellent quarter at Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of US$492 million, our second highest quarterly EBITDA since opening. The quarter was marked by particularly strong performance in the VIP gaming segment where rolling volumes increased by 29% over the prior year, as well as our retail mall businesses, where tenant sales grew by 11% over the prior year. Normalized EBITDA margin increased by more than 6 percentage points, reaching 55% for the second quarter, supported by solid revenue growth and cost control. At the same time, Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as the most important reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large-scale Integrated Resort developments. Our pioneering track record, development experience and financial strength puts us in the pole position to take advantage of new development opportunities on the horizon. Now, let's move on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders, yay dividends and yay buybacks. As you may recall, the Las Vegas Sands' board of directors last year approved an increase in our recurring dividend program for the 2017 calendar year to US$2.92 for the year or US$0.73 per quarter. We remain committed to maintaining our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. And we remain committed to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic in returning excess capital via a share repurchase program. We repurchased US$75 million of stock during the quarter. We look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buyback program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Our performance demonstrates the resilience and consistency in our cash generation, which reflects both the strength of our business model and the geographic diversity of our cash flows. Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio remains low, at 2.2 times on a gross basis and 1.7 times on a net basis. My view of our leverage levels is that we are comfortable with the debt to EBITDA ratio of between 2 times and 3 times on a gross basis, before any additional debt related to development opportunities in new markets. As our EBITDA and cash flows grow, our leverage will naturally decline over time. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity and balance sheet strength enable us to continue our recurring dividend and stock repurchase programs while retaining ample financial flexibility to reinvest in our existing properties and pursue new development opportunities. In conclusion, our cash flow generation continues to be strong and predictable. The resurgence of growth in the Macao market has continued during the quarter. The structural advantage from our scale, critical mass and product diversity was evident in our strong financial results. We look to the future with confidence, we have a strong organic outlook, we are in a great position to continue reinvesting in our existing assets and to pursue new development opportunities and we have both the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call today and now we will take questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mr. Grambling from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Operator, let's move on. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon. So, last quarter, I think there was some debate around whether you want to target the VIP market in Macao given the strength that we are seeing. Can you give us updated thoughts post this quarter? Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: VIP market, you're referencing junkets, Thomas, or (16:23) VIP, let's define that? Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. I mean I think that there was debate around junkets exactly. So, debate around how much you want to target the junkets given the strength there when you historically have been more of a mass market company? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, obviously, we're a mass-driven, that's our calling card in the past and I think in the future, that wouldn't preclude though us from participating in the junket segment. Actually, we're redoing all of our rooms and I think we're making a concerted effort to keep pushing hard in the junket segment. Obviously, the margins in that segment are nominal compared to mass segment. But we certainly want to be a junket house and have junket participation for the direct profitability and also the other benefits to the premium mass segment. So, let's have no confusion, we want to be in the junket business for sure in Macao. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Helpful. And then, you highlighted the significant increase in occupancy in Macao. How are you thinking about allocating rooms now to kind of drive the highest returns? Thanks. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: There was never really a change for us historically. We allocate rooms based on profitability, be it junket, be it premium mass, be it mass or just cash customers. We ran 86% occupancy across the portfolio. We're very pleased by that. And I think the difference to us than most people I think it reflects our ability to sell 13,000 sleeping rooms and yet still take care of the casino customers. And I think one thing you should think about with us is we've successfully enhanced our business model and market initiatives to adapt to the continued evolution of the Chinese consumer, mobile, social media, e-commerce. We successfully leveraged social media product placement in our diverse non-gaming offerings to build an industry-leading online mobile social media presence in China. I mean, at The Parisian alone, we have 3.6 billion digital impressions. The Venetian and Parisian are two top, the most searched Macao properties on both Baidu and Weibo. And in WeChat, we've got more followers than any of the Macao companies combined, all the companies combined. So, again, we believe very much in selling hotel rooms because we have a large platform of 13,000 sleeping rooms but profitability is guided by each segment, be it casino, be it cash sales, be it junket. So, we're open-minded at all those segments, but our key is keep our rooms busy, occupied, and producing lots of EBITDA. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, everybody. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hi, Joe. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hi. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Question for you guys. Obviously, the VIP business was rip-roaring at Marina Bay Sands. What drove that? Is it a different marketing approach, is it credit, is it macro-driven? How concentrated or how broad-based was the rolling chip strength that you saw? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Well, let's be clear, we obviously had a stellar quarter, which was driven by the rolling segment and with stronger volumes and above-average hold percentage which helped MBS too, I think it was our second best quarter in the history of the property since we opened. The non-rolling... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Seven years ago. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, long time ago. The non-rolling table and slot ETG volumes were stable, although they didn't grow, a little disappointing and the lodging component was soft and usual because the Singapore lodging market is softer. But I think this quarter reflects the many opportunities of profit we have to drive our business at MBS even ex the large hold percentage, we delivered about $385 million of normalized EBITDA, which sets up the potential for a huge year this year at MBS. There's nothing new there in terms of marketing strategies. What we are doing is reducing commissions in the rolling segment to enhance our profitability and enhance our margins. We successfully keep pushing back on the commissions and testing the waters to see how far we can go. You'll see the enhanced profitability in the rolling segment this quarter. And we play lucky, let's be clear. We had a lot of luck this quarter, probably about $100 million of increased hold. But having said that, we're very pleased that in a quarter where the usual drivers were absent, we didn't see the big lodging component, we didn't see the big component coming out of the non-rolling slot ETG segment. We still delivered great results and it was all about the very high end and playing a bit lucky. But I would again look at the commission structure and how it's changing. I think we run about 65%-35% in terms of the composite market EBITDA in Singapore. And so, we're very proud of the results there, albeit our traditional drivers were a little absent this quarter. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. And just kind of a big picture on Macao for Rob, for anybody on the call, how do you think about the future investment or reinvestment in your property particularly when you think about your Peninsula presence and you think about Sands Cotai Central, what type of redeeming or rebranding opportunities you have to increase market share? How are you thinking about those things now? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. It's a good question, Joe. First of all, we are the market leader in Macao, and market EBITDA leader. We once hit $3 billion of EBITDA there a few years ago and our goal is to return to that place again. We will absolutely invest aggressively in all aspects of Macao, be it SCC, be it The Parisian. The Parisian had a nice quarter. We think we can do better. It's based on mass volume and I think it's based on the terrific job by the team there and the digital platform. And we're very pleased with our best performance at The Parisian. But we believe there's a lot more profitability. It has extraordinary curbside appeal. It has extraordinary connectivity, the Four Seasons. It's a very glamorous property inside the building, the casino. What it lacks is a better room product to address the premium mass. We're addressing, we're spending aggressively now. You'll see some of that product come onboard in early 2018 and by the end of 2018 be completed. But I think once that's done, The Parisian's going to be a very, very strong competitor and do much better than the $106 million this quarter. We're very proud of the product, we made some changes there which most people do if they open a property. We recognize the enormous appeal to premium mass. And we think we can do a lot better at The Parisian. We're very pleased that Sheldon referenced the growth of the Four Seasons that seems to be benefiting both from a retail and gaming perspective from the connectivity to The Parisian and The Venetian. And we are reinvesting in The Venetian right now. We're actually at 500 rooms out of order this quarter. We stood our room count down considerably, about 20% which impacted The Venetian's results. So we're going to spend aggressively in Macao. We are big believers, we're grateful to be there, it's a magnificent market. We are the leader in EBITDA, have been for years, and the biggest investor in the market. And that won't change. We're going to drive more revenue and as this mass gaming story evolves, we plan to be a very, very big participant and grow our EBITDA. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, and good afternoon. So, on the mass side, if we take the mass win estimate that's in the deck on slide 13, the $4.15 billion, and you kind of do a market share calculation based on your mass win. It implies you maintained market share in the quarter. And last quarter you grew share a little bit on the mass side. I would just think given your success with Parisian and everything you're doing that your mass share would be growing a bit faster, so just wondering how to think about that. And then also, in the deck, you highlighted that there was a sequential base mass decline in the quarter. So, I'm wondering if that's something that we need to discuss or if that's just seasonal. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Dan, you want to take that? Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. I mean, Felicia, I think the most important thing on the question is on page 15, which is it grew 22.6% across base and premium mass. So, base mass grew 11% in a quarter that doesn't have as much visitation than, say, the first and the third quarter. So, it's very nice results for us. And then premium mass, as Sheldon mentioned in his comments, grew nearly 40% for us, 39.3%. That's what matters, that's what counts. We're growing very, very quickly. We don't have precise information on all the other operators' growth. We'll wait to see what they do. You saw the results yesterday We got very nice market share in mass. And our expectation is that we can grow our market share in mass over time because of all the things Rob just mentioned. So, we're very, very pleased with the results. It could very well be that the growth rate in Macao for the whole market is slightly less or slightly more than we've estimated. We'll find that out in the next couple of weeks. But we know that the growth in the market is very strong at, say, 18%. We're growing at 22.6%. We're very proud of that and looking forward to continuing to move in that direction. With respect to sequential on SCL base mass, what I'd say is this is a seasonal business with visitors coming in the first and the third quarters, probably more so than in the second and the fourth quarters. And as we continue to evolve, I think, we'll see good stuff coming. And I'll point to another slide in this deck, which is on page 12. If you look at Mainland Chinese visits, that's up 16% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 2016. If you look at spend per visitor, that number is up 13%, and this is just mass tables and slots versus the visitors coming into the market. So we see a very nice opportunity to continue to grow. We expect that base mass business across Macao overall to grow at probably Chinese GDP-plus. So if that's the case, and we're participating, we've got a very, very nice growth opportunity in the future. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, can you guys just address the flow through in the quarter in Macao. It looks like it decreased a tad since last quarter? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think our margins have been consistent given our cost reduction programs. I think the team over there has done a very nice job taking costs out of the business, as the business scaled down in prior quarters. Now, that we're experiencing growth, we anticipate to see heightened flow through. From a labor standpoint, it's actually been probably good. I think, some of our cost expansion here has been related to increased marketing to capture some of the market growth. We're going to continue to invest in marketing as the business continues to grow, because we think that's helpful for the long term. So \u2013 but as a practical matter, we should start seeing some operating leverage as revenue continues to grow with the market. So I think it's going to be a little \u2013 there's going to be some cyclicality in our margins, just given the performance of revenue. The first quarter has Chinese New Year in it, but I think as you look for the business over the long term, you should see us control our labor cost, control some of our fixed cost and then look over time to increase our marketing spend as we invest in our business, invest on our customers and look to grow revenue and expand margins. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Rob, just wondering if you could maybe give us a high-level view on how you'd characterize the promotional or competitive environment right now in Macao. We should be getting close to lapping some of the new supply additions from last year including your own, but any changes or tweaks to the landscape there or is everything fairly steady? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think things are pretty steady there, Shaun. I think, we \u2013 unless I'm confused a little bit \u2013 our growth in the mass, Felicia's comments about base mass and premium mass indicates to me we have healthy growth in both those segments and we have healthy margins frankly at 33% or so. I'd take it anytime. As far as the competitive environment, I think it's obviously a very competitive operating environment. But from our perspective, it revolves around the base premium mass segments. And we've not seen unreasonable competitive pressure. I think it's actually very reasonable. We did see some obviously price cutting on the hotel side a few quarters ago, and even that's bouncing back, ADRs are improving. And so, I think the market there is rather rational and reasonable and measured, and I think it will continue. As long as we keep seeing these double-digit increases in revenue and people aren't chasing the customers, I think that environment remains very reasonable to work in, and we're very happy with the environment. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And maybe \u2013 so the quick follow-up. I think I caught earlier maybe in the prepared remarks that normalized EBITDA margins in Singapore were 55% this quarter, but I'm not sure if I inserted the word normalized. So, is that like a solid number or how should we interpret that? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, it is. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's a solid number. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's as solid as a rock. How do you say 55%, unsolid? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You don't. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I don't know. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. As we addressed, Singapore had an unusual quarter because we did have large volumes relative to the past \u2013 past year or so in the rolling. And obviously, when you hold well, that skews things a bit. But I think if you step back, and even with the rather soft lodging market and a softer non-rolling table segment in the market, we did pretty well, margins held up pretty well. And again, I think the power of MBS is evident this quarter by the fact that we had less traditional drivers, yet we had the high-end emerge and we held lucky. So, I think margins like that are reasonable, and you can believe in them long term. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Shaun, this is Sheldon. You got to remember that there is no reason to reduce the traffic and reduce the productivity of Marina Bay Sands, it is arguably the most beautiful building in the world. If you want to have an argument, I'll engage in that. I said argue. It is the most visited \u2013 it's one of, if not the most visited hotel in the world. There's nobody that goes to Singapore that doesn't see the hotel, that doesn't want to go up to its SkyPark and look out over Singapore. It's just so attractive and so magnetic to people who come to Singapore. I don't see any reason why the Marina Bay Sands been open for seven years and we've done good and we continue to increase \u2013 our mall is considered one of, if not the most beautiful mall in the world. And while all the other malls are going down, as you are saying, we're going up. So, it's \u2013 there's no reason for it to go down, particularly when people who come to Singapore. Everybody who goes to Singapore goes to see the Marina Bay Sands. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Shaun, I think, one other thing to note is the margin that you're seeing there is based on the operating leverage of the business. So, that if Marina Bay Sands continues to develop a better mass business over time, if we continue to have the VIP growth that we're seeing. Eventually, we'll continue to scale and you'll see some margin expansion in that business. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I can tell you I'm involved in development, then expansion, and I could tell you I was in Brazil recently. And people had gone from Brazil to Singapore to see the Marina Bay Sands, just for that purpose. People from \u2013 everybody in Japan knows what the MBS is, and most everybody from Japan that has any interest in the potential Japanese Integrated Resort, everything they do is copying Marina Bay Sands. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, to reference, Shaun, just one more thing about Marina Bay Sands, and about how we think about that asset, and obviously, we're very proud of it. It's the reference point for an exemplary IR. Anywhere you're going, whether it'd be in Asia, South America or the U.S. And on page 24 of the deck, I think one of the reasons why is we've invested aggressively in world class entertainment, Remember that list of action with Rolling Stones to Michael Bubl\u00e9 to Elton John to Aerosmith, Diana Ross, et cetera, Asian acts. All kinds of top-tier K-pop and J-pop; sports, boxing, theatrical. It's a pretty impressive place. We are the touchpoint in that part of the world for entertainment in Singapore coupled with the view Sheldon referenced. As we travel to new jurisdictions, we're very proud of the fact that it seems to be the place that everybody talks about, as what they want to have in their backyard. So be it entertainment, be it MICE, be it retail, we reinvest heavily and want to keep this superb asset looking like it looks and leading the way. So... Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. I just want to ask a little bit about return to shareholders and based on your opening comments. It looks like you did less share repo in Q2 than you did in Q1. So I was wondering if you can give any color on how you think about that. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. I think, our \u2013 as we said previously, the return of capital cornerstone is really our dividend. That's really what our Chairman and our Board focuses on in terms of long-term sustainable growth. And that's really the focus of our return on capital program. We use share repurchases to modulate return of capital to our shareholders. So then, we feel we have some excess cash, and we feel like providing some additional return to our shareholders, shrinking our share count. We'll go out and repurchase shares. In this particular quarter, we chose to purchase $75 million. In the future, we hope to do more, but that's what we did this quarter. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : And, that was just a function of literally like liquidity in the quarter or just thinking about that versus Q1? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think, it's really just a view on the outlook. I think, we tend to think about our cash flow growth, tend to think about the liquidity that we have, to think about a whole host of factors that kind of go into the mix, and we make repurchases based on our long-term view. So across the year, we'll look at it more in that concept, than we will particular quarter to quarter. So I think the way we kind of look at it is going back across the year and saying, what was our total return of capital, how will our shareholders treat it and that's the context that we really consider in it. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Thanks. And then, just one other very minor question, but are you still actively looking to maybe dispose of non-core assets? Just wondering what your current thinking is on that. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think that's something that we always are opportunistic about. I think our Chairman has set up a very effective model where we reduce our cost eventually by ultimately selling down assets that are considered non-core either in total or in part, and it's something that we'll always continue to consider to enhance shareholder returns. But at this time, we don't have anything to report specifically although the Chairman has said all along that this is part of his core and fundamental strategy for the business, and that's something we hope to follow over time because it does create an unbelievable return environment. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hey. Good afternoon everybody. Just a couple of quick clarifications following up on Joe's question in Macao. Can you walk through the projects or the property improvements that you're planning and give some general price tag on what you're planning to do this year and next in Macao? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, Harry, it's Patrick. Nice to hear from you. I think if you turn to page 35 in our earnings presentation, you'd kind of see that we provide a forecast for our CapEx expectations for the entire portfolio, and then there are some details there regarding maintenance CapEx, some investment that we plan to do in existing properties, things that are specific to The Parisian and then some other. And I think the key thing to note is that the $500 million maintenance that we intend to spend, although we haven't spent it in years past as our property portfolio needs room refresh, it needs high limit space changes, needs junket room adjustments, we intend to spend that money. I think we have a very motivated team in order to grow the business. I think we're working hard to identify areas of investment, areas of change that can be helpful. And I think we're actively pursuing that in Macao, in Marina Bay Sands, here in Las Vegas, and in Sands Pennsylvania. So, I think the key thing here is I don't think we can call out a specific list of projects because they are numerous. But what I would like to highlight is we have a history of investing in our properties of making the changes necessary to support earnings and cash flow growth. And we've had the spending history that shows that we do it. And so, if you look at these next three years, you'll see there is a significant commitment made to both capital expenditures to provide growth, as well as capital expenditures to make sure our assets are kept to where they need to be to continue to boost the cash flow that allows a return on capital to happen. So, I'll turn it over to Rob or to the Chairman to see if they have any additional remarks. But I just want to highlight page 35 lays out the amount of expenditures that we've spent historically, the way we've deployed capital and the way that capital intends to be spent in the future in a general basis. I don't know if there's any specific projects that we'd like to highlight now, but I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, a few things just to think about. We referenced The Parisian. We're in the midst of converting into some suite product over there. It'll come on line in Chinese New Years and throughout the year. Otherwise, The Parisian \u2013 we're adding a restaurant or two restaurants in the gaming floor. We just finished redoing all the rooms and suites in the Four Seasons. We're making changes to all of our junket rooms we have in 100% of the junket areas. Obviously, adding all the new smoking rooms like our competitors for 2019 finish date. The Venetian right now would be having another 500 rooms on top of the 500 rooms we did last year, where we have in the entire casino floor. We constantly are adding restaurants, right now about 11 restaurants in the Macao are being changed up from new product to rehab. I can't stress enough how much we recognize in highly competitive markets with very, very good competitors. I was in Macao last month and we walked through the new products and even the older ones and they're very, very good. So, we're aggressively spending money in all of Macao. MBS room rehab across the board and casino update, refresh and we've just finished the new slot room there. So there's no place we aren't spending money, and it goes throughout, be it night clubs, be it restaurants, be it casino floor. We're aggressive, we're investors, we love the products we own, and we're going to be spending money throughout this year and next to rehab a lot of places. So no lack of capital expenditures. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : That's very helpful. And then, my follow-up question relates to Marina Bay Sands. A couple of curious curiosities, in your press release, it shows that mall revenues were flat quarter \u2013 or year-over-year at $40 million. Yet, I think, it was reported that last year that it was about $64 million. Was there some kind of an accounting change year-over-year? I might have missed it. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I don't have that. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Harry, I'm not sure what you're referring to. Give us a chance to get back to you. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. That's fine. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're showing occupancy at 97%, rent is about $1,480 a foot. And it looks to me like the operating profit is about $35.1 million for the quarter. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: If you turn to page 26 on our earnings deck, we have the Asia retail mall portfolio with operating cost and operating margin, as well as mall revenue. Maybe you could direct your question to that section and that page and maybe we can answer it. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Yeah. This was just specific. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Or on page nine in the release, we've got mall revenue. That's $40 million in 2017 and $40 million in 2016. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Correct. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So you're saying a year-ago, we had $60 million in the mall revenue? Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : That's what we show, but we've known to being wrong. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, let's chase it down together. Let's chase it down together. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hi. It's Rob. We've not had any significant changes in Marina Bay Sands. It's pretty flat year-on-year but I don't think we'll get some detail on that but I don't believe we had a $16 million quarter last year. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. I believe that he's thinking about gross versus... Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No, because it runs about 90% margin. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I don't think so. We'll come back. We'll clean up. We'll come back to you directly. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Harry, what you see both on page 26 and page nine of the press release is accurate, so I'm not sure what you're referring to. But if you have any questions, please follow up with Dan. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : I will. And just staying in Marina Bay Sands for the last question is, on the rolling chip volume. In the first quarter, I just want to make sure I've got these right, it was $8.9 billion in the first quarter and $8.7 billion in the second quarter, so it's sequentially pretty stable. Is that a fair statement? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. If you look back a year ago, it was $6.7 million a year ago in Q2 of 2016, so a nice growth year-on-year, but Q-on-Q it's flat and obviously Chinese New Year fell in Q1, so it's a nice stable run rate of $35 million, $36 million. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Yeah. So, that was where I was going is, do you think that we're in a more stable environment now, because historically that rolling chip volume has been quite volatile? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. I think it's been stable the last year or two. As you know, it's fallen off terrifically from the early days when there was belief we could do $50 million or $60 million, but I think currently we're running in the $35 million-plus range. I think that's realistic. As you know and I think it bears repeating that this is a highly concentrated segment that a couple of dozen players can make a difference in a quarter, but we feel like we're running at a more stable rate the last three quarters \u2013 the $8.2 billion, $8.9 billion, $8.7 billion, range. But bear in mind, a year ago we dropped down to $6.7 billion, so a big increase year-on-year. But this market, especially in Singapore, it's like Las Vegas, 10, 20 people can make a difference. And so, I would caution you always to keep in mind it's volatile and concentrated. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Got you. That's very helpful. Again, thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Now he stepped back in. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, can you hear me now? Sorry about that earlier and thanks for getting me back in. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Glad you're back. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. So, sticking with Singapore, can you provide any update on the thoughts around monetizing the retail real estate there and provide any color into how that may play into your capital allocation strategy going forward? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right now, still very early on, nothing really to report on the process. Although, I will tell you that I think as we said previously that the chairman's strategy all along when he developed these large-scale Integrated Resorts that are MICE-based and have a lot of critical mass, that a part of that critical mass will be non-core components. And those non-core components are integral to the resort but also have monetization capabilities. And so, we'll look to in the future monetize those assets as pricing allows and as the chairman feels comfortable in order to enhance our shareholder returns. So, while we have nothing to report specifically at this time, we're optimistic, we're hopeful for the future. We realized the value of the mall that's sitting there. As the chairman said earlier, it's a great property, it's the most iconic mall in the world. It's probably the most valuable mall in the world on a per-square-foot basis. And we're looking forward to the opportunity at some point in the future. Hopefully, we'll get that chance. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then on the slide 30, you put down principal areas of future development interest. And if we maybe look at South Korea and Japan, specifically, can you provide any updates there and what are some of the key factors that would make you maybe more or less interested in either one of those areas? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We've always been interested in both those locations and I think that's no surprise to anybody. We're cautious, I think in Korea, at this point, there's nothing really to talk about. We have been actively involved in trying to make ourselves known in Japan. We've been there several times, quite a bit, and we're hoping that process goes well and hoping we'll be considered for a license at some point. We're very bullish on Japan and very much hopeful that the process completes some time later this year. Stay tuned and see what happens. We're hopeful. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Rob keeps going to Japan because he found a great pizza parlor. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. It's true. It's true. If you want a great pizza place in Tokyo, e-mail me. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then I guess, the other follow-up, regarding South Korea. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Pardon me? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: He wants about South Korea, your thoughts on South Korea. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, there's been nothing \u2013 recently they had a impeachment and the lady was indicted, the former lady president. And they put a new president in, but there's no indication whether he's interested or not. I think that, from having gone to South Korea many times, I think what will move that along will be the implementation bill in Japan that we hope will pass before the end of the year, but it's possible it could be delayed. And I think that once they pass that \u2013 remember they have 17 casinos there and only one allows Korean nationals, and it's about three hours drive away from the biggest city from Seoul. I think they've got bigger problems now with North Korea than looking at Integrated Resorts to attract more tourists. So we don't know. There's nothing new about Integrated Resorts being restructured in South Korea. The most likely \u2013 I've heard that Bangkok in Thailand is reconsidering IRs, but it's very gratifying to know that everybody who talks about IRs in Japan is referring to one thing or more about Marina Bay Sands. So, it is an absolute must reference site. It certainly puts us in the number one position to be the top candidate for a win. So we don't know, there are different opinions as to whether or not Abe's loss of so many seats in the Diet, the Japanese parliament. We don't know, whether or not that hurts the move, but Patrick and Rob were just there last week and they say that it doesn't seem to have any effect. And they're still moving along and they hope to get \u2013 I don't know why but they are going to pass the bill for gaming addiction first. I don't know what that has to do with anything, but they said they're going to pass that first. And we are hopeful that it will pass the forthcoming month in August. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Fair enough. I'll... Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. I'll shoot Rob an e-mail on that sushi pizza. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Not sushi, just pizza. Great pizza. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I eat pizza in Italy. The home of the pizza. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly, if you guys, obviously not a material piece of your business. But, if you guys could comment a little bit on what you're seeing in Las Vegas right now and kind of how you're assessing current trends? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think Carlo, you know, that this quarter was disappointing in terms of the lodging component which is more and more important in Las Vegas. But, George Markantonis who runs the building tells me that this summer looks better to him, group business is picking up considerably. And he thinks the second half, he will do well, he thinks the FIT business picks up and the group business will be strong. So hoping for more there. Obviously, we didn't have as good a quarter as we hoped for after a stellar first quarter. But, George says the summer looks good, the group business is accelerating and the FIT business as well is accelerating. So let's hope for the best in Las Vegas. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Rob. And then, if I just could go back to one point you made. I just want to make sure I heard it right. You talked a little bit about MBS and kind of what you're doing on the VIP side. And did I hear you correct in saying you're \u2013 obviously no junkets in the markets, so every relationship is direct. Your rebates or commissions to your VIP customers, you've been kind of pulling back on them a little bit. So even on a normalized hold going forward, your margin profile within VIP should be improved? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Exactly, correct. We continue to cut back commissions as our second bite at the apple and you've identified it perfectly. Yes. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And is there any kind of, in terms of departmental margin, improvement that you would expect to see from that? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yes. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. Sorry. That you could quantify, I meant. I apologize. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No, I don't want to quantify it, but I think you'll see improved margins and improved profitability in that segment. We think we had a showcase property that people want to come to, and we are the market leader there, I guess, by 65 :35. And we believe that we can perhaps reduce commissions and get better margin. That's the thought process. I don't want to quantify what that will mean, but it will be improved margins, improved profitability at MBS. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon and we want to thank you for joining us today. Our company delivered another huge quarter and I'm very pleased with the strong financial results. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA reached $1.21 billion, an increase of 6% over the prior year and an increase of 10% in a hold-normalized basis. And I don't know what the percentage is over the consensus number but it's over. Our Macao operations produced its best quarter since quarter four 2014 with adjusted EBITDA reaching $652 million. Hold-normalized EBITDA grew by 11% year-on-year and we significantly outperformed the market in both rolling and non-rolling volumes growth. We delivered strong growth metrics across every segment of the business both gaming and non-gaming. During the quarter, we grew rolling volumes by 48%, that is whopping; non-rolling revenues by 19%; mass gaming revenue by 13%; occupied room mass by 24% and retail sales by 18%. It was a good quarter. Overall, property visitations were up 26% over the prior year. At the same time, we have successfully established The Parisian Macao as a new landmark must-see destination resort. The Parisian Macao achieved a quarterly EBITDA of $135 million and I am pleased to report that it has now met our targeted 20% annualized rate of return within just one year of opening. That was good too. During the quarter, we reached a major milestone, the 10th anniversary of The Venetian Macao. When it opened in August 2007, The Venetian stood alone on Cotai. Its opening marked the first step in my vision to create the Cotai Strip. The Venetian introduced large scale, non-gaming amenities to Macao such as retail malls, MICE, live entertainment and arena. These attractions are now well established in Macao and will continue to flourish and grow. I cannot be more proud of the fact that today after receiving more than 280 million visitors, The Venetian Macao stands as the most visited integrated resort in Asia, if not in the world. The addition of The Parisian to our Cotai Strip portfolio takes our critical mass and diversity of offering to another level. The Parisian together with The Venetian, Four Seasons, and Sands Cotai Central, all interconnected, is the only MICE space integrated resort complex of this scale. I'm truly grateful to the Macao government and the local community for their great support over the years in enabling us to implement this vision and strategy. I was absolutely committed then and I remain as deeply committed today to continuing to support Macao's economic diversification and its transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. It is in that same spirit of deep commitment to Macao's future development that we announced today that we will be reinvesting in excess of $1 billion in Macao over the next several years, primarily till the complete renovation and the expansion of the Sands Cotai Central property. We will also strategically increase our high-end suite accommodation with a full scale development of the St. Regis and Four Seasons apartment hotel towers. I'll say much more about these investment projects in a few moments. I've always said that in this competitive market, we would build themed integrated resorts. This has worked especially well in the Macao market with The Venetian and The Parisian. The connectivity between our Cotai Strip resorts gives us another unique competitive advantage. The rapid development in digital and social media marketing in China has been instrumental in establishing The Parisian Macao with its iconic Eiffel Tower as a cornerstone attraction for Chinese travelers visiting Macao. The brand recognition we have generated for The Parisian Macao on these platforms has simply been incredible, yes incredible, with over 4.3 billion, 4.3 billion, that's a lot, impressions as of September 30. With The Parisian's early success and momentum now clearly established, the time is right for us to create another landmark attraction on the Cotai Strip. I'm excited to announce today that we will create a third European destination by expanding, renovating and re-theming Sands Cotai Central into The Londoner. The Londoner will have tremendous potential as a third landmark must-see destination. The scale of the current SCC assets are unmatched in Macao, including over 6,000 hotel keys, a 400,000-square-foot retail mall, a 1,700-seat theater and over 300,000 square feet of developed MICE space. The Londoner renovation and expansion will completely re-envision the property, developing another 1.7 million square feet of space, expanding and enhancing all our offerings, hotel suites, retail mall, F&B, entertainment, and MICE. Upon its completion, The Londoner will accommodate more overnight guests than The Venetian and The Parisian combined. The Londoner will offer great potential for visitation and growth as a stand-alone integrated resort, but will also provide synergies with The Venetian Macao and The Parisian. Having three iconic must-see European-themed destination resorts with a broad range of amenities will strengthen our marketing and customer service capabilities and position us to grow faster than the Macao market in every segment on both the top line and the bottom line in the years ahead. As part of The Londoner project, we intend to fully develop the St. Regis apartment hotel tower, introducing 350 luxurious St. Regis Tower Suites. Year-to-date, our premium mass segment has grown by 28% over the prior year. Given the structural growth we foresee in this segment over the medium and long term, we will seize this opportunity by augmenting our inventory of high-end suites. In the process, we will also stay ahead of our competition on Cotai. The St. Regis Tower Suites will cater to every segment of the luxury travel market, including families, and will complement The Londoner's offerings which will directly target the mass, leisure and MICE markets. Our strategy to again boost our investment in Macao is testimony to our unwavering belief in the secular growth trend in China. We are laser-focused on being competitive across multiple segments by offering unique attractions and enhancing our current offerings to take full advantage of the growth in this dynamic market. I am confident that these projects will provide strategic benefits for our company and we look forward to updating you with more specifics as we reach critical milestones. There is also a tremendous potential to upgrade and expand The Plaza/Four Seasons property. We are therefore excited to announce today that we will build out the suite inventory in the Four Seasons apartment hotel tower. And we'll open a new tower at the property, the Four Seasons Tower Suites. These 295 spacious and luxurious suites will nearly double our lodging capacity at the Four Seasons. Given its central location and easy connectivity to all of our Cotai properties, the conversion of the Four Seasons apartment hotel to the Four Seasons Tower Suites will not only enhance our ability to grow patronage at the Four Seasons/Plaza property but will also support patron growth at The Venetian, The Parisian, and eventually, The Londoner. These three products will significantly bolster our strategic position and competitiveness across multiple segments. Both the St. Regis Tower Suites and the Four Seasons Tower Suites will directly appeal to longer-staying families visiting Macao, a valuable customer group that will expand greatly in the years ahead. At the same time, both the time to market and incremental return on capital for these projects should be much more favorable than a standalone greenfield project. We look forward to updating you on our progress across these important strategic developments. I also want to take this opportunity to express our sympathy for all those who were affected by Typhoon Hato in late August. This was the most severe typhoon in Macao in more than 50 years. Our deepest sympathies go to the families who lost loved ones during the typhoon. The damage this typhoon inflicted on the community was serious and widespread. I'm very proud of the efforts made by the Sands China team to take care of our customers and employees during this tragic event and its immediate aftermath. As well as the aid our team members supported to the local community in the days and weeks following the typhoon. As I announced at the end of August, Sands China and the Adelson Family Foundation have pledged MOP 65 million to assist with longer-term relief and rebuilding efforts in Macao. Providing financial resources in support of those efforts is a commitment that Sands China and the Adelson Family are proud to make. Sands China is a company rooted in Macao and we will continue to strongly support the community. Moreover, we remain as committed as ever to playing the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Our decision to reinvest and develop The Londoner Macao, the St. Regis Tower Suites and the Four Seasons Tower Suites reflects that long-term commitment to Macao and our confidence in its future. We regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses and providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens, including through our Sands Academy, and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Back in Las Vegas, I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the victims of the recent tragedy at (15:31). While we are extremely saddened by this tragedy and share in the grief of all those affected, Las Vegas is a very resilient place. We have every confidence that this town will bounce back as it is already doing today and will make a full recovery. Vegas is strong. We are very proud of the massive outpouring of support from within our community and around the world to the people impacted by this horrible event. Our team members have exhibited tremendous support to those affected and we are proud of the concerted efforts and the efforts of the entire community. Now, moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We did another excellent quarter at Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $442 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year. The quarter was marked by a particularly strong performance in the VIP gaming segment where rolling volumes grew by 30% year-over-year, our retail mall also continues to outperform the broader Singapore retail market with strong tenant sales growth of 8% over the prior year. Normalized EBITDA margin increased by more than 4 percentage points versus the prior year reaching 54.4% for the third quarter supported by solid revenue growth and cost control. At the same time, Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as a powerful reference site to emerging jurisdictions that are considering large-scale integrated resort developments. Our pioneering track record, unmatched development experience, financial strength puts us in the pole position to take advantage of new development opportunities on the horizon. Remember my middle initial, G. doesn't stand for Gary that my parents named me, it stands for growth. Now let's move on to my favorite subject. The return of capital to shareholders, yay dividends and yay buybacks. Our recurring dividend program remains the cornerstone of our program to return capital to shareholders. I'm pleased to announce that the Las Vegas Sands board of directors has approved an increase in our recurring dividend for the 2018 calendar year to $3 per share for the year, or $0.75 per quarter. After establishing our recurring dividend program in 2012, with the dividend per share of $1, this marks the sixth consecutive year that we've increased our recurring dividend to our shareholders. We remain deeply committed to our recurring dividend program to both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. And we look forward to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic in returning excess capital via a share repurchase program. We repurchased $75 million of stock during the quarter and we look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buyback program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity and balance sheet strength enable us to continue our recurring dividend and stock repurchase programs, while retaining ample financial flexibility to reinvest in our existing properties and pursue new development opportunities. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio remains low at 2.1 times on a gross basis and only, only 1.6 times on a net basis. My view of our leverage levels is that we are comfortable with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2.0 times and 3.0 times on a gross basis, before any additional debt related to development opportunities in new markets. As our EBITDA and cash flows grow, our leverage will naturally decline over time. In conclusion, our cash flow generation continues to be strong and predictable. The structural advantage from our scale, critical mass and product diversity remains evident in our strong financial results. The resurgence of growth in the Macao market has continued during the quarter. And we have grown faster than the market in both VIP and mass volume. We will continue to make significant investments in Macao because we have a long-term and unwavering commitment to Macao. The substantial capital that we will deploy to redevelop Sands Cotai Central into The Londoner Macao will add a third iconic must-see destination to our Cotai Strip development. The full scale development of the Four Seasons and St. Regis apartment hotel towers comes at a strategically opportune time. As we look to take advantage of the structural growth in Macao in coming years and stay ahead of the competition in terms of the quality and scale of our product and amenities. We look at the future with confidence. We have a strong organic growth outlook. We're in a great position to continue reinvesting in our existing assets and to pursue new development opportunities. And we have both the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And now, we'll take questions. Operator : And our first question is from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just talk a little bit more about the expected returns from the renovations and work you're doing at Sands Cotai and Four Seasons and how those returns might compare to a new property for example? And then as a related follow-up, when will the renovations get started and how should we be thinking about any kind of near-term disruption? Thanks. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: First of all, we expect the return to be huge... Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Well, I think... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: ... (23:19) nowadays. We are going to start the development and the renovation in the second quarter of 2018 and it will take about 18 to 24 months to complete. Am I saying that right? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You're correct. And we also expect \u2013 I mean, the way we look at this building, Stephen, is it's a well-executed thematic building. Locational advantage will create opportunities to grow in all segments, but especially from our perspective the mass segment, the gaming side as well as the retail segment. The SCC has performed very well in the premium mass segment because of the 6,000 sleeping rooms, but we think underperforms the base mass segment where the highest margins reside, and its location is particularly advantaged to being between the new MGM building and the Wynn building across from The Venetian; 6,000 sleeping rooms, great location. It's always been somewhat ambiguous from my perspective as far as the non-themed approach. We think it coincides nicely with our Parisian success and of course the landmark building, The Venetian. Think about a building that right now runs about half of the rents that The Venetian is running in the retail. We think we can bring those rents up to a Venetian type level. We believe we can grow base gaming. There's adequate capacity in that building for more gaming on the base mass side, obviously, the highest margin business in Macao and that's our particular advantage at both The Venetian and The Parisian. So, we're highly confident that this renovation can take us to a whole new level at Sands Cotai Central and it's something we're very excited about. We spend a lot of time researching, thinking about it. It's been in the works for quite a while, and it's time to go into action. So, as Sheldon referenced, sometime late 2019, it should be open and ready for business and start performing. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, it will be open and ready for business during the period of time. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It will be. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Only some of the rooms that are going to be renovated and the rooms that are completed will be put to immediate use. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Correct. There will be disruption. We can't deny that. That's a fact of life in any building this large, and it's an ambitious renovation. It won't speak to \u2013 it's more about the casino, the fa\u00e7ade, and some of the sleeping rooms, but the majority of the sleeping rooms remain intact. We are very pleased with most in the St. Regis building, we'll take the new St. Regis suites and redo those, and we'll leave alone the Conrad and the Sheraton. We're going to redo the entire Holiday Inn facility and redo the fa\u00e7ade of the building. And there'll be some unexpected surprises as part of the renovation. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's very good color. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think the way that we think about returns is that these are existing assets. So, it will be quicker to market. And they happen to be addressing our fastest growing segment, which is the premium mass segment. If you go to page 16 in the earnings deck that we provide, you'll see that that segment grew 17.7% year-over-year. So, we feel very confident in the long-term growth of premium mass. It's a very high value customer segment. We have a very deep database in this area. And we feel that these two buildings, once they become activated will speak directly to that segment in a very powerful way given the non-gaming amenities we have available adjacent to them and in those facilities. So, we think the returns will be very good. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And maybe one unrelated follow-up. Just the rolling chip drop at The Parisian was much, much better sequentially year-over-year. I guess, is there anything unusual in that? Or how do you think about the right run rate for that property now that you're kind of lapping over the opening? Thanks. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. Well, first, we're very pleased The Parisian has proven to be wildly successful. This quarter, I think, validates our approach there, the themed approach. The fa\u00e7ade is exemplary. It attracts 40,000 people a day into the building. And all segments seem to be attracted to this building. Our new suite product comes onboard starting with Chinese New Year's. So we'll keep growing that segment. The high roll, I guess, is a concentration of demand-driven, large volumes of business, and it shows the acceptance of this product by the market. Is it sustainable? We never comment what's going to happen tomorrow in terms of any one segment. We've seen how that works in the past. We will say the building is getting great response from all segments; mass, premium mass, base mass and obviously rolling. And we're delighted with the results and it's a very strong quarter. And we hope it continues. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Best of luck. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We don't hope it continues. We expect it to continue. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Oh, excuse me. My mistake. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It is a mistake. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Okay. We expect it to. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Can you just give us some more granularity about the drivers of the strength in Singapore? Thanks. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. First of all, I think, it's \u2013 the numbers speak for themselves. It's another exemplary quarter and another $1.6billion plus year it appears. I think our focus on the cost side has been very helpful in the commissions. We're very \u2013 I think, we've got a good approach there. The building is proving to be very, very resilient in terms as we keep dropping commissions, customers keep coming. And we'll keep doing that until they stop coming, so that's one positive. The other positive you see, the rolling volumes which are significant, and -but I would caution you again as we said in The Parisian call and we said in the past. These are concentrated segments and it does represent 10,000 customers or smaller than that. So I think in the end the only disappointing part about the MBS is the lack of growth in the non-rolling slot ETG segment kind of flattened out four or five a day. But I think it speaks to our team over there running this exemplary building that we've driven this kind of a EBITDA, out of a market that's not really growing that much. And frankly the hotel does well for $454, $446 ADR and 90%-plus occupancy strong and sustainable retail. But again, all cylinders are working there. The one which we had is the four or five a day. The one really big positive is larger rolling volumes and great commission structure against that rolling segment producing greater margin. So margin has crept up into the 30%s, and I think it speaks to what we've done over there to maximize that asset. So, that's my take on MBS. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And Rob, is this strength coming from Chinese players coming back or is it Greater ASEAN? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think, it comes from people in the region. I wouldn't necessarily characterize as Chinese driven. It's \u2013 we have a strong permanent resident base there with a strong base out of the surrounding countries. We do well in Indonesia. We do well in Malaysia. We do well out of Japan there, so it's a mix of business. I wouldn't identify China as the primary driver. In fact, if anything, we're seeing, it's stable in China but not necessarily growing significantly. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And just to clarify on the comment Rob... Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: \u2013 made on the margin piece, he was talking about the VIP margins specifically being into the 30%s which is fantastic for the property overall, but we're effectively in the mid-50%s at this point. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Yeah. Correction, we did mid-30%s for the rolling segment, 54% or 55%in the whole building. So remember, that's a long way for it used to be, so I think again, our concentration on costs and commissions have paid off. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. And your line is open. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Maybe to go back to the expansion plans a little bit, just sort of kind of new investment here. Could you just walk us through your intentions around the hotel brands? Has that strategy worked or is your intention to terminate any of those or any of those kind of contractual relationships? And then on sort of in a similar vein, when we think about the disruption is there sort of a plan for how many hotel rooms there'll be out of service, maybe overall or be touched by the renovation so we can just kind of try and think about possible disruption in modeling that? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. On the hotel side, we're not going to discuss which brands. At this point, the goal is to keep all the brands in play at SCC. There may be some changes and some rethinking how we do that, but the intention \u2013 we're very happy with the quality of brands we have there. There is a strong intention to re-fa\u00e7ade the building. So when you drive by, we actually are going to Macau this evening, you drive by The Parisian, as you arrive there, it's always the most \u2013 it's visually stunning and same thing with The Venetian. It's very, very attractive to the eye and makes you want to go inside the building. We want to achieve that more at The Londoner, something with all the iconic architectural look and feel of Big Ben, et cetera, Parliament Building something which you would see visually from the street and feel very much willing to come in and explore in the building. Secondly \u2013 so it's both going to be a architectural treatment and a re-fa\u00e7ade of some of the towers. Once you're in the building, again, very much a London-feel, London-style approach all kinds of opportunities to (32:39) to theme it. If you think about London, it's iconic in so many ways, the busses to the Beefeaters, and there's just so many opportunities there. Our team is having great fun playing with that, inside we think the casino experience to be much more iconic, much more thematic. As I said, the hotel was mostly remain untouched. We were happy with our, with our partners, they're happy, we're seeing there, and there may be some rethinking to the decor pieces. But for the most part it remains untouched and the goal is to be both in both sides of the street both facing the Cotai Strip and to the rear as well towards MGM and Wynn. So we want to make this place, a place where base mass gravitate to. We want to elevate our rents to look like more like The Venetian. We want to make a very themed retail experience. Our retail wizard, David Sylvester has made clear to us he thinks we can do a lot better in that building. We agree with him. So, it's meant to be both a base mass, a retail experience, but I also believe an energized exciting building will drive all kinds of other demand in the rolling segment and the premium mass segment as evidenced by what you saw this time at The Parisian this quarter. This Parisian building is attracting all kinds of people, I don't think any new building in Macao has done the kind of volumes and the kind of activity we're seeing in all segments from base mass, slot machines, rolling segment, across the board, Parisian is just showing some real strength and growing. And our new suite product comes on board. We want that kind of enthusiasm, that kind of visual experience from our Londoner, there will be disruption. We're not prepared to go into how much detail yet, because we're working through those issues with our architectural team, our design team. And there will be disruption, you can't re-theme the building, spend a lot of money without having some disruption. But I think the payoff pitch on this will be extraordinary for this company and real growth in a market we're very comfortable with. And we lead the market in every way in terms of EBITDA, in terms of what we've done there at division in Cotai. This is just another step forward in our Cotai plan. So, we're very enthused about it. We represent to you that we think it's going to be very, very impactful a few years down the road. There will be some disruption and we'll report back to you as we get further down the path in the renovation of the SCC into The Londoner. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. And just maybe a follow-up which is really just a kind of a clarification, but the $1.1 billion total investment. That's fully inclusive of the build out of all the incremental hotel rooms, we know you obviously have a lot of that, at least the building is constructed [Technical Difficulty] (35:15) everything in the rooms, right? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. The numbers that we show in our CapEx slide are inclusive. So, that's to complete the project and that's our anticipated timing of spend. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, everyone. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Shaun. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Shaun. Operator : Thank you and our next question is from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan and your line is open. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Just going through your earnings slide deck on slide 16, the base mass departmental profit margins, you took down 35% to 45% from 40% to 50%. I guess what's driving that? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You want to take it? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think it's a combination of factors. Part of it has to do with rating of players and the fact that we have more rated play on the base mass floor than we've ever done before which is helpful, because it allows us to know our customers better and set them up for repeat visits. The problem is it's just not as profitable. So, as the market matures, as we get to know our customer base better in the base mass segment, we're going to have some margin change as they become rated. That's really the driver there. But it just means that as the volumes go through, as the market becomes more competitive, remember there are more people addressing the base mass segment in the Macao market today, we're going to do things to retain our customers and develop them and there's going to be some margin reinvestment required for that. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's a good long-term investment retaining customers and loyalty. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And to add some historical color, you have to go back five or six years, you'll see a time when we had a 50% margin in base mass. Since the downturn in Macao, we've been pretty much right at 40%, close to 40%. Margins are steady in the base mass business right now, so we're right at the midpoint of that range today. And you know, they got a chance to go up over time as business matures. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great guys. Thank you. And then, I guess we'll find out at the end of earnings season what actually the mass segment grew in the 3Q, but your math in the slide deck in terms of the estimated mass growth is very similar to ours. To what extent do you think the level of deceleration in the mass and slot segments both here in October and at the end of the 3Q is a function of your lapping two new properties versus, there's something else going on with mass players or the mass segment in terms of their ability to access cash in the same way they could earlier in the year? Whether it's (37:47). Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, Joe. Obviously, it's hard; we're not going to speak to October at all as its fourth quarter. But I think there's more competition, there's more people in that space, I think Galaxy has done a very good job. Look, everybody wants a piece of that business and they should. It's the highest margin, it's the most profitable part of our portfolio and something we \u2013 we want to be dominant in all segments, from base mass, premium mass, rolling, across the board. But as Patrick referenced in our rating situation, and as we see for the competition, there's some very good products out there which we're competing against. So we used to be alone in Cotai, we used to have the 100% share of that. That's changed. And I think that's going to continue to be an evolving process. Part of the reason we are so excited about The Londoner, is we can recover more of that business with The Londoner we haven't had. The Venetian has been our base mass product that's been all along the most important, the most successful part of our portfolio. We see very little of it at the Four Seasons Plaza, we saw a lot more of it come back to The Parisian and The Parisian taught us a lesson that we go back to the drawing board and say we want to be in all segments to be successful. So that's part of our planned strategy for The Londoner on a go-forward basis. Our goal is to be successful, dominant in all of the major segments including base mass, premium mass, rolling segment, all important to us. So a lot of competition, a lot more people competing for that customer, that segment's dollar. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Joe, the other thing we want to point out is, if you look at page 13 in the deck as well, you've got Mainland Chinese overnight visit which is a super important statistic. That's up over 15% when you look at the third quarter. So that's 3.23 million Chinese visitors, that's a record. And the other two data points we provide on page 13 are the average length of stay, which is going up because of the hotel inventory, as well as the mass win for customers. So, that's also going up. And this is a seasonal business too. And if you look at the mass win per customer on page 15, we've got an illustration for the last five years here. The second quarter to the third quarter, this is the least amount of degradation we've seen in the win per customer between the second and third quarters here as well. So, you've got a very nice premium mass business, more visitation, we don't have the bridge open yet. There's a lot of things to think to the future that give us a lot of confidence that the mass business is going to continue to grow at double-digit rates higher than the rates we're seeing today. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And just to just to add to that, our mass drop, Joe, is up 19% year-on-year, our hotel room nights are up 24%. I think the key component as we see more visitations and (40:31), obviously, sleeping accommodations, we have all those keys in Macao and clearly that's driving that base mass into our buildings and will continue to. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you for the thoughts, guys. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I want to point out that you originally said that we were the only ones we had all of it. Now, others have come in to take it, but I think it's significant to point out that the entire market has grown. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, what we took in at the beginning when we were alone, we've increased... Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: The pie has grown. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: The pie has grown and we've got a bigger share of the pie. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: More people eating, but a much bigger pie. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Next? Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anil Daswani of Citigroup. Your line is open. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Hey. Good morning, guys. My question is about The Venetian. The Non-Rolling Chip win rate fell to 22.8%. That's the first time in six quarters that it's been below 25%. Was this a one-off and it's something that we should expect to be modeling to rebound in maybe the premium mass segment? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We hope so. You're right, absolutely. We fell 3% year-on-year in terms of that. The nice part of the story is that we had 500 keys off the market, premium mass keys, which are coming back on the market. The second nice thing is we actually grew the volume. We had material growth in \u2013 over double-digit growth in the mass segment coming out of that segment, which was very positive for us. It's unfortunate. If you actually applied the 2016 hold percentages to 2017 volumes, we would have had one hell of a quarter. But it doesn't work that way. So, you're absolutely right. We had a nice volume. The Venetian had nice growth. Consider the fact it had all those rooms off the market, it just had a stellar quarter, just unfortunately didn't hold like it did the year before. Still within the range, but 3 percentage points off on an awful lot of play. Can it return? You hope so. Historically, The Venetian has been a very strong hold percentage building. Can we predict 25%, 26% sustainable? We cannot. Can we hope it returns where it's been historically? We can. 22% is in the range, 25% is better. What's really good though is the volumes of Venetian continue to grow in that segment and I think that's a great sign for the future. We would spend some money in The Venetian rooms which we needed to. We're looking at some casino renovations. We're doing all the junket rooms (43:02) with our partners. Our partners are working with us on the design. And we're going to spend some time this next couple of days with them. We're very keen to see The Venetian get back to a higher run rate because it's just a great place to visit and, again, has that wonderful curbside appeal we want to emulate across the street at The Londoner. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Fantastic. As a follow-up, could you give us a progress report on the renovation program at both The Venetian, when do you expect the entire room product to be renovated, and also at The Parisian, you're going to upgrade some of those to a suite product, is there a time line yet as to when all that will be complete? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. So, on The Parisian rooms, the renovation into the premium suite, it begins to come online Q2, actually, during Chinese New Year. I should say Q1. We'll see some of the suites come back. It continues throughout the entire year. It doesn't finish until the end of 2018. 600 keys becoming 300 suites. At The Venetian, it's the early 2018, so sometime around Q1 and that's 1,000 upgraded rooms, stellar rooms by the way that will compete very well with any product, very large Venetian-style suites, completely renovated bathrooms, all FF&E. And I think it puts The Venetian back in a very, very strong position for that premium mass customer. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Robin Farley of UBS and your line is open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Two questions. One is, I know, Vegas is a smaller part of your EBITDA, but I wonder if you could just give us a sense about how occupancy has been trending over the last few weeks in terms of kind of rate of recovery or when you expect occupancy levels there may get back to kind of previous levels? And then my other question is Macao-related, which is, trying to think about that $1.1 billion, kind of how much of that is sort of maintenance CapEx versus \u2013 you're adding the 645 rooms and so obviously a lot of the cost is going to kind of the re-theming rather than adding new supply to your hotel base. So, can you give us a sense of how much is going to add the 645 hotel rooms as opposed to just kind of maybe more refreshing of existing product, if we think of it as kind of maintenance versus growth CapEx? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Well, I'll take the Las Vegas question, and ask Patrick to take the second question. Las Vegas is recovering. The group business had expressed some concerns about obviously the tragedy. The horrible truth is these events keep happening. We become a lot more resilient in the world to these tragedies. What used to be, 10, 15 years ago, would have altered the course for months and months, it seems like people now accept these horrible situations. And truth be told, we feel Vegas is recovering rather quickly. Anecdotally, we hear that across the town; we see it in our building. So, I hate to say it, but what a few weeks ago seemed like a \u2013 might be a real difficult event, the town appears to be bouncing back. The hockey game was filled the other night. Bookings are strong. Our place looks very busy. So, I think Las Vegas is recovering well and more \u2013 quicker than I would have imagined when it first happened. As for the CapEx issue, I think, we'll turn it to Patrick or Dan or both. Fellas? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, if you turn to page 22 on our earnings deck, you can actually see the split between what we consider maintenance capital and the investments in the projects that the Chairman described earlier regarding The Londoner at the St. Regis, completion of the tower suites and the completion of the Four Seasons tower suites. That's all there on page 22. So, actually, maintenance CapEx, we've been running in the $400 million context. We've always tried to show that it will be about $500 million. As you know, we like to reinvest in our buildings to make sure they're leading in terms of their design, in terms of their amenities, in terms of their offerings to our customers, in terms of their finish. And we're going to continue doing that to ensure that we can market to the best most profitable customers. That being said these projects do address the premium mass segment which is one that is a larger suite product. It's not our standard room, so these will be very impressive product, great renovation. So, in the \u2013 what was mentioned in the script, if you look on page 22, you can actually see the amount being spent for each of the renovation. So, the split between maintenance CapEx for the entire property portfolio in Macao, as well as each of the individual projects described is actually there. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : I see that the maintenance CapEx is not changing too much each year, so I guess I was thinking about maybe some of the rebranding to The Londoner, kind of the split between rebranding and actually adding to you \u2013 new hotel room. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Robin, the whole \u2013 everything that Rob has been describing about re-envisioning and Sheldon have been describing about re-envisioning, that's about $700 million of budget right now. The St. Regis Park Hotel is about $275 million of budget, and the Four Seasons is about $250 million of budget. The $275 million and the $250 million are a lot less than they would be if we're building brand new towers because these towers have existed for an extended period of time, so the core and shell has been there for a long time. And so, this is a small investment for hopefully a big impact in opportunity. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Robin, also we've referenced these \u2013 the Four Seasons apartments. I mean, these things will be almost 290 residential field type apartments that can be deployed for The Parisian premium mass, for the Four Seasons premium mass or for the Venetian. So, I think, they would be very impactful for that customer who plays large, wants a family stay, wants to bring his children, et cetera. I think that building is very well situated. It's been dormant, it's going to be reactivated, and I think, it would be very powerful as far as an EBITDA generators down the road. It's expensive, but it's well worth the investment. So, along with the St. Regis, The Londoner, it's a big part of our CapEx plan for 2018 and 2019. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Just in Macao, I was just wondering if we could talk about how to think about flow-through in the near term? So, in your second quarter, you grew EBITDA margin sequentially 80 basis points adjusting for hold in this quarter. Seasonally, you tend to grow EBITDA margin. Sequentially, you're just flat to slightly down adjusted for hold. So, in our quick calculations, it shows it might be mix, so I'm wondering if it's mix or is there something else. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. I think \u2013 well, you're absolutely right. Our portfolio is strong across all segments. Our Q3 premium mass grew 18% year-on-year and that's five consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. Our premium mass drop increased 30% year-on-year and is impacted again by lower than average hold. Our rolling segment at 48%, it was extraordinary year-on-year. But as you know, the margin is partially dictated by the segment mix and each segment's contribution from the mix. In this quarter, we experienced strong rolling volume, up 48% year-on-year for the portfolio. However, the flow-through in this segment as you know is much less than base mass or premium mass. While we're very pleased with rolling volumes, but profitability will always reside for us in the mass, premium mass and we have to have the highest margins in Macao as a result. But again, the third quarter while it was a victory in terms of lots of growth and lots of volume, we didn't translate well into the hold percentage and again the mix situation hurt us there. Of course, year-on-year also, we had the cost issue in Q3 of 2016 which is always confusing and somewhat ambiguous. So, I think long story short, we're over that now. We're moving into Q4. We hope we can continue to experience these high growth in all these segments. We'll hold better in the hold percentage portion of our business, and it will translate to again higher margins. But I would emphasize that our margins continue to be the highest in Macao. Our Parisian property exemplary quarter. The only disappointing part, my perspective is, we could have held a bit better and the mix certainly impacted our overall margin. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I mean, I just wanted to be clear, (51:27) but what I was asking was on hold adjusted, right? So, that would just mean maybe the issue was mainly mix then? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, when we present \u2013 Felicia, when we present our hold normalized, we're only normalizing for the VIP... Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: -- rolling and we're not normalizing for the 300 bps of life hold at Venetian and in premium mass. So we don't actually normalize for that in the presentation that we're giving you. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Okay. And then just as my follow-up. If we could just talk about Japan for a second. So, now that the election is behind us, I was just wondering if you could walk us through the timeline you see for the Diet to consider and vote on the implementation legislation. I'm just wondering if how the snap elections might have set the process fast, if at all. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: If I were \u2013 This is Sheldon. If I were to give you an answer on that, I'd be reading it from a crystal ball. Well, no... Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's the one in the closet. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No, that's the other one. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Oh, that's your crystal ball? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: \u2013 in the other room. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I forgot. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's where I get my ideas from. It's \u2013 there are a lot of people speculating about it, and I read this morning that he's got a super majority. Nobody said he had \u2013 he's got a super majority with the Komeito Party. So he could do whatever he wants, as long as he got the Komeito Party to go along with it. The press said that is \u2013 there are two things. One is to set up his defense forces again. They were prohibited since World War II, and the other thing is to watch his economic program including the IRS (53:22) with casinos implemented. So you know it's tough, it's tough to read a crystal ball as to what's going to happen there. But different people are saying different things. They say that by November 1, they could open which is in a few days. He did open an extra session of the Diet and not the regular session. So people were speculating and saying that he could pass the Gambling Act and then the Integrated Resorts Act still within this year. So there's \u2013 nobody knows for sure. We don't know for sure. We're hoping, we've been optimistic for many years about that. Now it looks better than ever that we'll get the implementation bill, and \u2013 but who knows when. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Felicia. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. You're your line is open. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. I have two questions. I appreciate you taking my questions. But, really quickly on the first one, and Dan, you're probably best suited to help me on this, but the \u2013 it looks to me unless I have something wrong here, it looks to me like it was a 2.9% VIP hold in Macao in the period which reduced your revenue by $18 million and then it looks like there was $28 million of expense. So, despite the fact that their hold optically wasn't high, your EBITDA was down $10 million. Does that just relate to holding a lot higher on the direct side? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's correct. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's exactly it. That was it. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's it. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's it. You're right. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, Rob, when you think about everything as we look at the outlook, obviously the work that's being done at Sands Cotai Central, clearly, the grind mass as Patrick referenced kind of doing a little bit more with recognizing the customers. And having them in the database, as well as the mix of revenue growth on a go-forward basis with VIP kind of currently outpacing the rate of growth in mass both for you guys and for the market. When you think about 2018 putting all that stuff together, directionally, do you guys believe there's an opportunity to grow margins next year? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We'd like to believe there is as revenues continue to grow. We've taken over $310 million of run rate cost out of the business basically in effect last year as we talked about on prior calls, we're very confident to be able to manage cost in the business. But really what we need now is revenue growth. If you want to see margin expansion in Macao, we need to grow revenue. Fortunately the market is growing. And fortunately we believe we have the best asset portfolio there to take advantage of the most valuable segments that are continuing to grow the fastest. So we're very confident in our ability to expand margins over time, but we need revenue growth in order to do so. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And guys, just a quick one on Vegas. Rob, I believe you mentioned Las Vegas is recovering well. The RevPAR in the quarter and kind of the mix that you guys had between occupancy and rate clearly not at all impacted by what happened on October 1. But when you think about your 3Q, is there anything discernible in there just based on the fact that the LVCVA data through August looked pretty solid market wide. I'm assuming there were some larger conventions that were out of September. But is there any color you guys could provide on kind of Vegas for the 3Q? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Into the RevPAR, no. Nothing to it. I think that we're comfortable with our numbers, we're disappointed with some of our gaming numbers, want to see some more growth there, but we're very happy with the lodging numbers, the RevPAR holding up well. Vegas holding up well, it's morphed into a lodging market primarily. And we feel very good about where we're at in the market. So, no more color than that. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Carlo. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's it. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everybody, have a great day.",

Please note, that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our company delivered another great quarter and I'm very pleased that we ended 2017 with such strong financial results. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA reached $1.34 billion, an increase of 20% over the prior year driven by outstanding growth in Macao and Singapore. This has given me a hint that I should change my middle initial meaning Gary to growth as I've done before; so it's now Sheldon Growth Adelson. Our Macao operations produced its best quarter since quarter three 2014 with adjusted EBITDA reaching $731 million. Hold-normalized EBITDA came in at $758 million representing growth of 30% over the prior year. Macao's mass market growth accelerated during the quarter from 9% in quarter three to an estimated 18% in quarter four. We again outperformed the market in mass gaming growth as we have throughout 2017. Our non-rolling table grew by 18% over the prior year while our non-rolling win grew by 27%; this outperformed it's mass revenue growth rate throughout significant margin expansion. Our whole normalized EBITDA margin reached 35.1% through the quarter, an increase of 320 basis points compared with the prior year. The structural advantages that enabled us to drive mass non-gaming growth were fully evident during the quarter. The scale and range of our hotel suite inventory, the diversity of our non-gaming offering, especially in retail and entertainment and the unique benefit of inter-connectivity between our Cotai properties. These advantages allow us to attract more overnight visitors than any other operator, as well as increase their length of stay. As a result, we grew by an exceptional 52% in premiums mass when compared to the prior year. We achieved hotel occupancy of 94% in the fourth quarter despite having added approximately 3,000 rooms to our inventory just over a year ago with the opening in The Parisian. At over 1 million occupier room nights in the fourth quarter, this was an on-time quarterly record for our Macao hotels. Our MICE business has gone from strength to strength growing by 44% year-on-year to just under 290,000 room nights in 2017. Our strategy to build integrated results with scale and diversity is clearly paying dividends as Macao's mass and tourism growth accelerates. The opening of the Venetian Macao 10 years ago marked the first step in my vision to create the Cotai Strip. The Venetian introduced large scale, non-gaming amenities to Macao such as retail malls, MICE, live entertainment and arenas. These attractions are now well established in Macao and will continue to flourish and grow. I cannot be more proud of the fact that today after receiving more than 290 million visitors, The Venetian Macao stands as the most visited integrated resort in Asia, if not the world. We have also successfully established The Parisian Macao as a new landmark must see destination resort. The Parisian Macao achieved EBITDA of $412 million in its first 12-year of operation and welcomed over 15 million visitors to the property. The rapid development of digital and social media marketing in China has been instrumental in establishing The Parisian Macao with its iconic Eiffel Tower as a marquee attraction for Chinese travellers visiting Macao. The brand recognition we have generated for The Parisian Macao on these platforms has simply been incredible with over 5.2 billion impressions as of December 31. The addition of The Parisian to our Cotai Strip portfolio has taken our critical mass and diversity of offering to another level. The Parisian together with The Venetian, Four Seasons, and Sands Cotai Central, all interconnected, is the only MICE space integrated resort complex of this scale. I'm truly grateful to the Macao government and the local community for their great support over the years in enabling us to implement this vision and strategy. It is in that same spirit of deep commitment to Macao's future development that we announced last October that we would be reinvesting over $1.1 billion over the next two years in expanding, renovating and reframing Sands Cotai Central into the Londoner, as well as adding approximately 650 in [ph] hotel rooms by completing the two towers at the Four Seasons in the same bridges. The Londoner have tremendous potential as the third landmark must-see destination. The scale of the current SCC assets are unmatched in Macao, including over 6,000 hotel keys, a 400,000-square-foot retail mall, a 1,700-seat theater and over 300,000 square feet of developed MICE space. The Londoner renovation and expansion will completely re-envision the property, developing another 1.7 million square feet of space, expanding and enhancing all our offerings, hotel suites, retail mall, F&B, entertainment, and MICE. The fourth quarter results at SCC demonstrate the earnings power of this building with quarterly EBITDA above the target [ph] anchored by its strong position in premium end segment and a scaling range of hotel suite inventory. But the full potential this property in care doing to every segment of the market is yet to be realized and that is why it's exciting for us to embark on The Londoner project. Upon its completion, The Londoner will accommodate more overnight guests than The Venetian and The Parisian combined. The Londoner will offer great potential for visitation and growth as a stand-alone integrated resort, but will also provide synergies with The Venetian Macao and The Parisian. Having three iconic must-see European-themed destination resorts with a broad range of amenities will strengthen our marketing and customer service capabilities and position us to grow faster than the Macao market in every segment on both, the top line and the bottom line in the years ahead. Sands China is a company rooted in Macao and we will continue to strongly support the community. Following the pledge of 65 million MOP by Sands China and the Adelson Family Foundation to assist with the rebuilding efforts and the aftermath of Typhoon Hato we are working hard to provide financial assistance to the individuals, institutions and charities that have been significantly influencing. This long-term support of Macao will continue in the coming months and years. At the same time, we remain as committed as ever to playing the pioneering role in Macao's transformation into Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Our decision to reinvest and develop The Londoner Macao reflects at long-term commitment to Macao and our confidence in its future. We regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses and providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens, including through our Sands Academy, and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Now, moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We deliver another excellent quarter at Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $456 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. The quarter was marked by a strong VIP and slot revenue growth. Normalized EBITDA margins increased by 190 basis points versus the prior year reaching 52.5% for the fourth quarter supported by solid cost controls and efficiency gains. Our retail mall also continues to outperform the broader Singapore retail market with strong tenant sales growth of 10% year-on-year in 2017. It is worth noting that for 2017 the total operating profit from our malls in Singapore and Macao exceeded $570 million. 2017 was a record year for Marina Bay Sands and adjusted property EBITDA when measured in Singapore dollars. Because of its business in leisure tourism deals and strong positive impact on the local economy, Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as a powerful reference site to emerging jurisdictions that are considering large-scale integrated resort developments. Now let's move on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders, yay dividends and yay buybacks. Our recurring dividend remains the cornerstone of our program to return capital to shareholders. Last October the Las Vegas Sands Board of Directors approved an increase in our recurring dividend for the 2018 calendar year to $3 per share for the year, or $0.75 per quarter. After establishing our recurring dividend program in 2012, this marks the sixth consecutive year that we have increased our recurring dividends to our shareholders. We remain deeply committed to our recurring dividend program to both, Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, and we look forward to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we will remain opportunistic in returning excess capital via share repurchase program. We repurchased $75 million of stock during the quarter, we look forward to continuing to utilize the stock repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Our leverage or debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains low at 2.0 times on a gross basis and only 1.5 times on a net basis. My view of our leverage levels has not changed. We're comfortable with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of between 2.0 times and 3.0 times on a gross basis, before any additional debt related to development opportunities in new markets. In conclusion, our cash flow generation continues to be strong and predictable. The structural advantage from our scale, critical mass and product diversity remains evident in our strong financial results. The resurgence of growth in the Macao market has continued during the quarter with mass market growth accelerating. It feels like we have now returned to 2014 and the period prior to that. I'm very excited about the growth that we're experiencing in Macao. We have grown faster than the market in mass, in both the fourth quarter and in 2017 as a whole. We will continue to make significant investments in Macao because we have a long-term and unwavering commitment to Macao. The substantial redevelopment of Sands Cotai Central into The Londoner Macao will add a third iconic must-see destination to our Cotai Strip development. The full scale utilization of the [indiscernible] and hotel towers comes in an opportune time as we look to take advantage of the structural growth in Macao in coming years and stay ahead of the competition in terms of the quality and scale of our product and amenities. We look to the future with confidence. We have a strong organic growth outlook, we are strategically reinvesting in our existing assets while also pursuing new development opportunities and we have both, the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And now, we'll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Rob, maybe we could just talk about Parisian for a moment and I did want to thank you for the really nice detail on the deck on that, it was helpful. So at The Parisian, it looks like last quarter may have been an anomaly on the VIP side, so just want to talk about that relative last quarter, this quarter, and how we should think about VIP at the property and what might have changed? Robert Goldstein : I'm not sure if anomaly is much of a very, very strong quarter; we've always cautioning of that this concentrated levels of play sometimes, be at Singapore, Macao. And clearly, The Parisian has some very, very strong play last quarter. I think The Parisian has captured the most important segment of all of the base mass, however the room product we build at The Parisian just isn't sufficient to meet the premium as demand and that will change with the addition of 300 more suites that come onboard in 2018. In addition, the Four Seasons apartments will be available to us for use in -- sometime in probably Q2 of '19. So I think with those 300 more suites and the 300 or 400 of the Four Seasons, you will see a much stronger premium mass customer at The Parisian. We have the demand, frankly, we don't have the room price to satisfy demand. In addition, we should keep knowing that depreciation was down 600 rooms this quarter, so it suffered bit there. I think it's early days in The Parisian's evolution, I believe we'll get much stronger. It also issued a note that The Parisian performance this quarter was pretty extraordinary and that's a direct result of a 1,000 keys back on board, premium mass keys that drove most of that play. So I think you will see a light kind result at The Parisian wants to get the product right. We built a very, very nice hotel, very attractive hotel, a great demand hotel, I'm not sure we built the right room for us to satisfy the demand we created. With this incredible double-digit growth we're seeing in Macao, it matches perfectly with our massive footprint; our lodging, gaming, retail footprint. And even though with the market leader in mass as you know, we still outperformed the market by 25%. Our mass, table and slot revenue grew by over $300 million year-on-year but we think that's as much as 40%, 45% of the mass growth in the entire market. And to show the reference, to see numbers of that magnitude you have to go back to '14, we did a $1.5 billion roughly in mass table in slot in this quarter; it's pretty extraordinary numbers. I'm convinced The Parisian will participate just like SCC and Venetian once it has the appropriate room product matching up with its mass and mass appeal. So yes, on the terms that we had more concentration of rolling play last quarter but yes, we believe long-term Parisian is a very strong product; it's just early days [ph]. Felicia Hendrix : And then just switching gears to Singapore; Rob, you've highlighted previously that VIP -- the volumes could be volatile there. So I was just wondering if the decline year-over-year there was just due to the normal ebbs and flows in your business or anything else? And then also on the mass side, you did better than what we were looking for in the quarter but the volumes were also lower year-over-year as well so I was just wondering if you could comment on that? Robert Goldstein : I have two thoughts on Singapore; one is we're extremely pleased with the results this year, $1.07 billion is pretty extraordinary result. Yet, I would caution -- realize that Singapore has -- is not growing on the rolling side, in fact it declined a bit. And as we've mentioned [indiscernible], it's highly concentrated and continues to rely on two small segment of customers to drive it. So we're not seeing growth in that segment, we are seeing extraordinary management, I'm really pleased the team over there -- they did an excellent job of drawing cost, commissions, everything across the Board to create these big numbers that came out of MBS this year. I'd also agree with you that we're not seeing growth in the mass segment, it's hovering around 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 for the last eight quarters and I'm disappointed we haven't seen more growth at Singapore. I don't know why I would say otherwise until the future, I don't see why there would be any catalyst in the near future to drive that. Singapore is a wonderful success story but at this point it's just a very large producer of EBITDA without growth prospects in the near future. So we would applaud management's efforts this year to create $1.07 billion, it could be a lot less and yet I'm hoping we'd see growth to make it easier in the future to create some more growth, be it rolling or non-rolling. Your points are appreciated and I agree with. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : On the Sands Cotai Central, renovation of the Londoner, I mean this -- maybe it's an adhoc, but what are the factors to mitigate any kind of disruption there and any sense for how you can quantify the potential impact or compare it to other types of renovations? Robert Goldstein : I can't really tell you what the impact would be, I do believe there will be disruption, that would be forced to think otherwise; it won't happen in the '18 until the very, very end of the year. We'll close down the Holiday Inn product late in the year, probably November/December. The next 10 months you won't see any disruption whatsoever and I would also just highlight it as the number is coming SEC -- $200 million plus this quarter are just terrific and it shows the power of that room product but imagine we can marry that product to a base mass demand and a retail demand and get that product upto Venetian type numbers and I believe we can exceed a $1 billion and more when we get to The Londoner. Disruption is very hard to quantify, I would say to positive side we have two different casinos there, we can move business back and forth. The St. Regis will be under construction in the rear and will not be as -- it won't be an operating hotel, it's just a show at this point. So that will be less disruptive, Londoner will be more disruptive, the transition from the Holiday Inn to Londoner. There will be some pain along the way, I have a hard time Steven giving you a number because I don't know that number, it's never been done in this size and scale, it's truly a herculean task but I think the net result in '20 is going to be very, very helpful to the company. We see great things at Macao this quarter, our run rate [indiscernible] normalizes pretty astounding and the market just seems like it has great, great win behind it. And so while we think this is a great transition for us to achieve, it will be disruptive in '19; I don't want to quantify because I simply can't. Stephen Grambling : And then maybe changing gears a little bit; there has been the Macao Hong Kong bridge is seemingly always been in process. Are the things that you are doing as you think about the potential opening coming up in the next 12 to 18 months; hopefully what are the things that you can do to try to position yourself? A benefit from that, how do you think about how that will benefit the market? Robert Goldstein : I think we have to wait and have confidence the government will deliver us the bridge sometime in this year and it will take\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : They're saying it will be done in the first half of this year. Robert Goldstein : No, I think we'll just wait and see. I mean, I'm not sure we can do a lot but wait and see how the connectivity; how we can best -- obviously it benefits the entire market, we're excited to see it happen but it's hard at this point to make a concrete observation that we would do as a company. I think as an industry, we're waiting and hoping that thing can really deliver some fresh products and fresh customers and be a real value add, we've all been [indiscernible] for a long time; it's a major achievement for the government to achieve it and get it done and we as operators wait patiently to see how it works. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Barry Jonathan : This is Barry Jonathan for Shaun. For Macao, I was just wondering if you can give any color on what you think drove the 52% growth in premium mass in Q4? Is this just more volume of players, lower players stepping up or just generally quality of players driving it? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : I think it's all of the above, I think it's a lot more players, I think it's larger people -- bank rolls perhaps, higher visitation. I also think as a company it's underappreciated how valuable these assets are. They are coming from further away, they are younger, I think more fluent. There is a new generation we're seeing and especially in the plause [ph] and even the new Venetian suites; I think we're experiencing a really strong growth period that is further filled outside Guangdong. The visitation outside Guangdong is growing and to us as the guys own 13,000 sleeping rooms it's pretty good. We're seeing huge demand, hotel rates have spiked, occupancy has spiked, our entertainment offerings have just been extraordinarily well received, we can't -- we can't get enough shows in there, just keep adding more of better shows to the mix and the reception has been phenomenal. So our growth is tied very simply to -- it's coming from further away, we've got the sleeping rooms to accommodate it, it's mass and premium mass, it's -- every weekend it's mid-week, we're seeing numbers mid-week that you see weekend successes. We're seeing dropping numbers that are just simply off the chart, a year ago couldn't comprehend these kind of numbers we saw in the last three or four months, it's very exciting and it's full force and December was even stronger than November and October. So we're hoping this continues to charge forward and I think our biggest advantage is this massive footprint of 13,000 rooms [ph], primarily in Cotai, the growth is in Cotai, that's our major footprint obviously. It's entertainment driven, it's mass -- premium mass driven, as coming outside Guangdong or which is honestly falls into -- that's the reason we're growing so quickly. You know, $300 million of growth in one quarter year-on-year on mass is pretty extraordinary for any company. Barry Jonathan : And then just a quick one on Vegas; I'm wondering if you have a view on other operators starting to invest again in the Vegas market. I know in the past you've talked about maybe converting the condo tower to 1,000 hotel rooms or so. And while we're talking Vegas, any update on the arena JV with MSG? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Yes, the arena JV with MSG is live and well, construction will start this summer, it's going to be quite an arena, we'll have a public [indiscernible] are coming out here to present publicly, I think it's going to be in March -- is it February or March; I'm not sure of the date yet but you're going to see something is pretty spectacular. I know our neighbors across the street, the wind guys [ph] have seen it and it looks extraordinary, it's a great building, it's just great but what Jim [ph] build is extraordinary. So we're looking forward to construction commencing this summer, hope we're opening in 2020. As far as more building Las Vegas, why not, it's a great market, it's a great place to live and work, the growth is returning to Las Vegas, it's more of a lodging based market deserving the past. The Black Knights have done extraordinarily well, the hockey has been -- is just terrific, the football is coming, why not? Las Vegas has some great days ahead of it, so we're very much in favor of the market growing and if competitors want to invest dollars, so be it. Operator : Your next question comes from Anil Daswani from Citigroup. Your line is open. Anil Daswani : Just another one actually on premium mass in Macao, clearly that's been outperforming the base mass business. Do you guys see that being the key driver in '18 and '19 as well and can you give us a flavor for how many rooms you guys are now comping in the premium mass segment and how that's compared over the last couple of quarters? In addition, once you guys open the St. Regis suites as well as the Four Seasons suites, do you see that comp ratio going up as you can put in some higher end premium mass players into your product? Robert Goldstein : Well, there is no question that premium mass is where the money is being made, it's double -- it's 52% and base mass is double-digit, we're not complaining about solid double-digit growth in base but to your point the driver is premium mass unequivocally. As far as our approach this whole thing, we clearly are building this; think about this, we're going to add 650 keys using the Four Seasons of the St. Regis to sometime in '19, that will be built for the premium mass customer and those customers drive extraordinary amounts of business on buildings, we are extremely excited about what could be a surge in our business next year from that. There is no arguing that that's where the profitability is coming from, we still like our base mass, it's important to us, what's driving this market right now for us and for most of the operated tours is the premium mass customer. We're a 50-50 cash-comp mix right now in cash versus comp, I can't see a change in the whole loop [ph], I do think the greater lion share of the Four Season suites and the St. Regis will go to the premium mass customer, probably be a much more skewed to that base. I mean those rooms are built -- those products are built for that customer; as long as they perform the levels they are giving us now, we can keep growing our topline and the flow through is there, the extraordinary, why not. As you see our flow to this quarter, not just the top line growth but the flow through the margin has just been excellent and so that's the future of the business as we see it today. Anil Daswani : And my follow-up would be, is there any update on monetizing the mall product in Singapore? Patrick Dumont : So right now as you can look, the year-over-year sales number -- salesforce [ph] per square foot and Singapore is up 15%, it's the best mall in the world, it's exceeding everyone's expectations. As per performance we saw some talent remixing going on, we think we'll get more out of that asset in the years to come, we're very proud of it, it works incredibly well and demonstrates the power of the integrated resort. That being said, we have nothing to update anyone on the process, if anything happens we'll let you know but right now we're optimistic, we're hopeful that at some point that will come to fruition but at this time we're really just proud of the assets operating performance, how iconic it is, how well it fits in with the rest of the integrated resort and we'll let you know if we have anything to update you on. At this point, no comment. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Joseph Greff : Sheldon, you always say that one of your favorite topics is the return of capital; given the momentum in across the board and all of your markets in -- what we would characterize as limited CapEx over the next few years relative to your free cash flow generation; is there any appetite to assess capital return more than just once a year, i.e. few times a year or every quarter? Patrick Dumont : The highest and best use of our capital is for our Chairman to make investments of high growth projects, so that's our primary focus. So if there is an opportunity in Japan or Korea, we hope that we can put our Chairman to work and have him develop something extraordinary like he does in every other market we're in. That being said, if we have excess capital, I think we've said all along that our dividend is our return to capital cornerstone and so we'll look to increase that prudently and sustainably in the future. And of course, the lever that we can pull to modulate our return to capital is our share repurchase program. So I think if you kind of look through that waterfall, that's how you should frame out any excess capital that we have and we'll go by that guidance, that's something that we talk about with the board very frequently, that's the discussion we'd have with our Chairman very frequently and I think that's how our company and shareholders ultimately will get comfortable. So I think that kind of the process you should have in your mind or framework you should have in your mind as you think about excess capital and what we look to do with it. Operator : Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : I've always had the perception that that kind of premium mass and VIP were somewhat tethered at least from a cadence perspective, obviously premium mass as you mentioned in the slide is up 52% year-over-year where only chip volumes kind of slowed a little bit and we're up kind of mid-single-digits. First of all, could you talk a little bit about the decoupling of those two metrics? And then maybe, if you can, any specific industry drivers in terms of where you're seeing kind of that strength in the premium mass from Mainland China coming, is there any specific industries or sectors of the market that are really driving it? Robert Goldstein : I think they call it second but parked first [ph], and that is, I don't think we can identify where it comes from in terms of the drivers industry or what business they come from. What we can tell you with certainty it comes outside Guangdong increasingly. What we like to see and we're seeing is more penetration in the other provinces, we're seeing fresh money, fresh customers, it's very encouraging to see younger people, we're seeing them packing our retail malls and go to CRE -- our shows and using our suite product and we're seeing lots of them. So I would think that is a very positive sign for us, and as that increases, again, that's one of our hidden advantages or not so hidden advantages. As far as the decoupling, I missed the part a bit to your point, what has happened because I agree with you that typically, historically these two segments were tied together at the hip; the premium mass grew like it's growing, you see junket grow much more. Now one of the theories I have and it's not substantiated is that perhaps we're seeing more and more younger people opt for direct play and not going through junket and they are opting not that the situation of rolling environment. We're seeing -- we of course have not been as strong as others which we were or not as strong as others in the rolling business with the junkets, we're trying very hard to increase our share, we want to be back in the industry average and we're working with the junket people as well as our physical product and to improve it. But clearly, this quarter has been decoupling of those two segments and I guess I would think this way that demand is still there to gamble but perhaps the demand is moving more towards direct non-rolling as opposed to rolling chip program tied to a junket operator, that's the only rational explanation I can give you. I think demand is still there and demand is there stronger than ever but perhaps it's moving away from the rolling segment into the non-rolling which obviously has some benefits on the margin flow through. And again, from our perspective it's more of them, we're seeing a lot of customers and we're seeing a lot of people outside Guangdong, and so our rooms are being used as special weekends and holidays but even mid-week, some of the non-rolling drop we're seeing is just extraordinary. And so that's as good an explanation I can give you, I don't know if I can give you more clarity on the decoupling but clearly, the number is evident it's there. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you very much, that was really helpful. I appreciate it. Sheldon Adelson : What I'd like to tell you is that Macao feels like it's going back to 2014 and prior to that. Nobody could tell you with certainty how much the VIP is going to grow in the forthcoming year, how much the mass is going to grow. The mass is comprised of additional people and Macao is getting additional people. I see on our Lays [ph] accounts every day; on some we can set holiday, we get as many as 400,000 people in one day coming into our properties, that's quite a bit, 400,000 people. So I see Macao growing like it did before and we're going to take advantage of that. Spending the money in The Londoner is for the purpose of reframing the property and bringing the same number of people to Sands Cotai Central, soon to be called The Londoner. You know, you asked before and Rob answered that it's going to be a major disruption; I disagree with that, I don't think it's going to be any major disruption any more than any other property that's [indiscernible]. So we have the equivalent of two properties, two individual properties on that side of the road, we call it slots 5 and 6. For now we would have one lot, one thing. Here we've got two lots together and we still don't have a team for a say [ph]. I don't see any reason for this to be any more disruptive than any other renovation of any other property hotel anywhere. So as a matter of fact, there is -- there will be two major entrances; one for the first two buildings and one for the last two buildings. So it's not as though the entire property is going to be worked on at onetime on one day and all the entrances will be closed, we'll be doing it in sections where we'll have the least disruption. So I disagree with the fact that it's going to be a major disruption. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David [ph] with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : I just wanted to ask one detail and as I look across at the progress of The Parisian, I'm just trying to think through what the EBITDA margin, opportunity or aspirational level could be based on looking at some of the other properties in Cotai which are -- have managed to get up into the 30s. And last quarter was particularly high and this was a little bit lower, and if you could just color that in a bit that would be helpful. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : I think we should be clear that we have a lot of belief in The Parisian, it is 30% or 30.6% in Q3 '17 margin, it's 29.3% this quarter, normalized. But I think the whole story isn't margin, we're missing an important part -- the growth in Macao this quarter, our growth and the markets growth is tethered to premium mass, we're not getting our fair share, it's simple; we have demand like crazy that have property walked in it, it's chalked for, our people want to stay there, they are disappointed in their own product, we need more premium suites to address it. That product comes, we went back and redid these suites, they are very, very -- they are [indiscernible], we're very pleased with the end result, it's a various [indiscernible] and customers are going to love it. If it comes onboard first in Chinese New Year's and throughout the year, I think it's really simple, The Parisian is more topline to get to the 150, 160, 170 because I want to see at $500 million to $600 million building is going to be there, the question is it's got to be reflective of the market; the market as we've talked about for most, the call David is tied to this mass of tsunami of revenue coming out from premium mass. We saw The Four Seasons, we're seeing at The Venetian, The Venetian numbers are just terrific and we're making $0.5 billion a quarter top line at The Venetian in these base mass and premium mass markets, we saw this quarter at Sands Cotai Central. There is no way not to see The Parisian getting there but every market, customers dictate where they want to spend their money, it dictate where they want to be; they want to be at The Parisian, they want to sleep for example at The Four Seasons right now because the room price is better, you can see that The Four Seasons is taking off and they've got this $75 million this quarter normalized, it's now being a plus $300 million building. Once we fix the room price, both inside The Parisian and honestly, The Four Seasons suites are the hidden opportunity for us. If you get 600 or 700 suites between the two of those buildings adjacent to The Parisian you're going to see a big uplift in The Parisian and I think you will see it in The Four Seasons. The Four Seasons and The Parisian almost work in tandem, you think about it; one's with a mass, very attractive product, one's a very high end product, you throw in 650 or so premium mass suites, you're going to see some very, very good numbers out there. I don't want to make you feel disappointed that we haven't gotten there but we are disappointed we haven't gotten there. We need to fix the product and get where we can get to. This product can be every bit strong as we're seeing at the other buildings that have the right mix of room. And the SCC results this quarter reflect a very strong room product with no base play, that's what I wonder is going to happen. The Venetian shows the product with all cylinders hitting, great mass play, premium mass play, even great broad [ph] play; and we're 1,000 rooms of The Venetian, it's becoming a worldclass product again, could get to 1.4, 1.5, we think there is a lot of room left. If this march continues to grow double-digit premium mass, we're at a whole new place [ph], a whole new place to make money, pretty exciting times for us. Patrick Dumont : One other quick comment. If you remember, a couple of quarters ago we talked about the expenses we took out of the business and the rationalization that we did in order to make it more efficient so that when we did receive revenue growth there would be leverage against that revenue. I think you've seen that in Sands Cotai Central, the margin change there in this quarter. One thing to note as Rob referenced, the rooms that are offline and are being modified or being changed to address the customer that's very high value and very high margin; so the segment differential there and the value that customer will be seeing, eventually you will see better flow-through in The Parisian when those rooms open up, and just as you did in Sands Cotai Central, just you've seen the strong margins that you get at The Venetian. So system-wide we're very happy with our expense base, as we said in the prior quarters you will start to see some margin expansion as revenues grow, we believe that will continue. Operator : Your next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : I wonder if you could just sort of speculate out loud a little bit on why you think the VIP volumes aren't growing in Singapore, just given the improvement we've seen from other VIP play at Macao, just why that's not happening in Singapore? Patrick Dumont : Rob and I will take my best shot at this. First of all, we've always said it's concentrated to not thousands but hundreds of players. I also think that Singapore is somewhat a victim of -- you've got some competition in the region, I think the Philippines have grown a lot, Thailand has been renovated nicely, I think you've got -- Macao is going to be a very, very important destination for people coming out of Korea and even Japan, much more -- I think it's much easier to go to Macao than Singapore for all the premium mass Chinese play. I had to point to those examples, as well as you know, we've had some -- we had to be very careful, we cannot remarket Indonesia, that's becoming increasingly more difficult and so we're very cautious, we run our business that way; we take no risks with marketing, we take no risks with collections, we take no risks we think are unnecessary. You're right, I think the growth in Macao is driven by premium mass Chinese business out of Mainland China but I think it is opting very, very nice resorts in Macao that are attracting a lot of attention, so it's also easier to do business in Macao in terms of credit, money movement, etcetera. So I think we're the victim of a very strong Macao market and increasingly strong competitive market, be it the highlands, be it Philippines, etcetera. We're not far from giving up, I mean the property made $1.7 billion is not too bad and as you know, it might be a concern is not enrolling but in the premium mass and they are non-rolling because that's where most of our proper resides and most of our margins are 60 plus, that's more concerning and that's a mix that comes out of this decline in Singaporean [indiscernible] but also decline in other markets around this. So as much as we've focused on rolling, I think the non-rolling is more disturbed and we can't grow that number beyond 4.5, 4.6 for the last 7 or 8 quarters. We're going to keep at it, we've got a very good team on the ground there, we'll keep looking at cost but obviously we'll love to see some top flying growth and that's the best indications or best thoughts I can give you on the growth prospects for Singapore. Sheldon Adelson : We're going to press more in the Pacific room countries in Korea and Japan to come to Singapore. I'm very excited about Singapore reaching the highest quarter that we've had of the year since we opened it in 2010. So I can't say that we're sorry, that we achieved the record, I'm very happy we achieved the record and I'm not apologizing for it. Robin Farley : I was going to also ask just switching to Macao for a moment, whether your reinvestment there; do you think that will lead to maybe greater table allocation in 2018 or 2019 above what you've received already? Robert Goldstein : We never talk about that because it's beyond our control. As you know, we align the government to make decisions for us and have no comment or table allocations or what we might expect in future. Robin Farley : I'm just curious about your convention mix for the full year in Vegas was versus the prior year if you happen to have that -- your convention mix as a percent of room nights? Robert Goldstein : I can't tell you the mix but I can tell you we had the best room nights we ever had and I mentioned we broke 800,000 room nights in Vegas. We're seeing a bigger opportunity for '18. I know there has been talk about the Vegas market, we think it's strong, we think convention business looks very strong, there are some concern about international business because of the October tragedy but we've experienced a pretty good quarter here at 92% or so, we feel good about '18, we feel very good about our convention or a nice demand is accelerated and the bigger part of our mix. So if you guys have those numbers -- we have the actual number to split for you. This is 30% on the group business for Q4 against 39% for the FIT [ph]. But I think the real keyword business here is, we're always a group house, we'll always will be a group house, we have complete confident in the group market in '18. Again, we hear some talk to the international business going off but we feel very good about Las Vegas, the tragedy made for some very difficult moments around here and great concern but the market has bounced back and it appears to be going pretty strong at this point. Sheldon Adelson : We have the strongest MICE facility in the world, no integrated resort, no hotel has small MICE business than we do, that arises from my experience and the experience of our staff having been involved in the tradeshow business but as far back as 45 -- give or take 45 years. So somebody just builds a new convention center few years ago and says in the newspaper, we're copying Adelson; you can't get that kind of experience. When I was in Japan a few months ago, one of the officials from the city of Osaka said, I remember you back in the early 80s you helped to design Makahari Mass [ph], now that's almost 40 years ago. Makahari Mass [ph] is the biggest exhibition and convention center in all of Japan and the governor of -- because [indiscernible] -- the Governor of Chiba [ph] that was adjacent to Tokyo in the way to Norida airport saw what I did with the conducts and he said, he sent his entire staff and he came as well to my office in Boston and we redesigned that convention center. So somebody who builds a convention center today isn't going to have the experience and the know-how how to deal with the people. We are -- we earn in our Sands expo center here in Las Vegas. I think more money than any exhibition is called convention center in the United States and we've always earned money, right almost from year one. So nobody has -- that's why we're in the strong position when it comes to new destinations because there isn't a city in the world that doesn't want MICE space, that doesn't want MICE business. We're the experts in the MICE business, we know how to get it, if we get another location in the Pacific Rim, we'll have several locations surrounding the Pacific that could take shows that move from one city to another every year that we're in a better position to pick those shows up to be in our convention center. And I think I'm not the only one who feels that way because it's my background but the people -- the elected officials in various perspective new destinations, they also feel that same way. Operator : And your last question comes from [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : My question is -- I have two of them that focused on the development of The Londoner. First of all, Sheldon had talked about an incremental $1.7 million square feet, I'm assuming there are the suites comprised off reasonable chunk of that, are you developing any other space that doesn't exist today? Sheldon Adelson : No. We are looking to the government to give us an okay to do that but I don't want to make any statement vis-\u00e0-vis how they've responded to us. We're taking, we're adding in the apartment side of the tower that's close to a million square feet of the St. Regis tower where we have about 300 apartments. And so that's a substantial part of that 1.7 million. We have warehoused one or two levels for more MICE space and that will open up more completed space and that will contribute another substantial portion of the 1.7 million. I can understand what you're thinking, we're not adding 1.7 million, we're converting unused space now from unused to used; so maybe we should have explained that a little better. Robert Goldstein : Say the rig is 1 million square feet roughly, and that's a sheld hotel [ph], it's not been buildout but shelled. The 300,000 was our retail -- additional retail, there was also shelled but not built out, the same with the MICE, 400,000 more of MICE shelled, not built out. So it's a mammoth building, big footprint, a lot of which was never used. Unidentified Analyst : And then just the other, the last question was; when you think about reframing the properties, what are the kind of iconic tourist sites -- are you planning to put out outfront to act as a tourist attraction? Sheldon Adelson : The outside will be like the Big Bang [ph] and the Parliament building. We will have the tower bridge represented somewhere, we will have telephone booths that are all over London, we'll use them as ATMs; so we'll have the telephone booths as ATMs or vice versa, we'll have two level buses, we'll have the bear skin hats, a plenty, like the guards at the Beefitters [ph] at the Buckingham Palace and maybe we'll even have some horses in the -- and puck [ph] skin hats riding down the Cotai Strip. Look, I want to say that one thing, people won't talk a lot about it but we have 13,000 rooms interconnected. Can you imagine if that was in Las Vegas or any other location; I created that by creating the Cotai Strip and if you could see 13,000 rooms without going outside you could connect to all of the properties together without stepping outside the addition space. And it is nowhere else like that in the world we have a property of different priced rooms of different sized sleeping rooms and we have large and medium, maybe even small casinos; so there is a mixture of taste for everybody who wants to have a different experience. There is no other property in Macao that has done that, and people say we have a lot of tables. Yes, we have a lot of tables because when I built the properties with so many rooms and a common restaurants and entertainment and the arena; and so much for -- to attract so many people. Whoever gets 400,000 people in one day in their properties, never, no category, no good properties in the world has ever attracted that many people. So I'm very proud of the fact that we have an interconnected 13,000 rooms that covers from small to medium to large in every aspect; restaurants I never added them up but we probably have 100 or so places to eat which is not good for my belt size. So it's -- we have that large number of tables because we needed them when we built, and so we have them; not that we've got any extra, frankly, we've got fewer than anybody else or fewer at the same time. So I'm very proud of where we are in Macao and I'm very excited about the possibility that Macao can grow. You guys weren't sitting there like I was, standing on a hill, looking out over the swamp and the bay and saying to my wife and her colleague with me, I'm going to turn this bay and the swamp into Las Vegas. And everybody laughed and criticized me, Stanley [ph]. Stanley said he is going to fail, he will be in bankruptcy, he will never get the first place built, if he does get it built he will never get it open and I said and we created a confrontation. I said Stanley, if it's too hot, get out of the kitchen. I'm sorry to say he is not around as much so he could see that Cotai became the equivalent of what I said the Las Vegas Strip compared to downtown. Now there is something that is a big jolt in the arm that downtown is going to get when the bridge opens. It's said that it's going to open operational by the middle of this year, of course we've been hearing that for a couple of years but there is a lot of belief that it will open this year. That could change downtown dramatically, people who have approached us and they want to buy the Sands Macao, I don't want to sell it because I think that when the bridge opens it could be a different property, on the upside. So I'm very optimistic and I'm very confident about the growth of Macao. As I've said a couple of times today, it feels like 2014 and earlier. Operator : There are no more questions at this time. Sheldon Adelson : If that's the case, I want to thank everybody for calling in today and I'll consider this earnings call adjourned. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This was a record breaking quarter and I am very pleased that we delivered such exceptional results in each and every one of our markets. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA reached an all-time record of $1.5 billion, an increase of 31% over the prior year. Our Macao operations generated adjusted EBITDA of a whopping $789 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year. We broke a number of quarterly records, the highest ever mass table gaming drop in revenue, the highest ever retail mall sales and the highest EBITDA margin since the third quarter of 2006. At the same time we achieved an all-time quarterly record in adjusted property EBITDA in both Singapore and Las Vegas. As I said last quarter, the G in my middle name stands for Gary but it also stands for growth and that is fully on display at present in each of our markets. The acceleration of Macao's mass market growth in the fourth quarter last year has continued into the first quarter. Non-Rolling drop grew by 21% over the prior year and Non-Rolling wins grew by 22% over the prior year. This strong mass revenue growth combined with cost efficiencies drove significant margin expansion. Our hold-normalized EBITDA margin grew a record 36.4% for the quarter representing a substantial increase of 350 basis points compared with the prior year. The structural drivers that enabled us to grow across all segments in Macao were on full display during the quarter. The scale and range of our hotel suite inventory, the diversity of our non-gaming offerings, especially in retail and entertainment and the unique benefit of interconnectivity between our Cotai properties. These advantages allow us to attract more overnight visitors than any other operator, as well as increase their length of stay. We achieved total hotel occupancy of 94% in the first quarter maintaining the record occupancy that we enjoyed in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we grew by an exceptional 35% in premium mass when compared to the prior year .And our retail mall sales grew by 33% over the prior year with each of our four malls delivering strong growth. Our strategy to build Integrated Resorts with scale and diversity is differentiating and is visibly paying dividends, especially in Macao as visitation increases from outside Hong Kong and Guangdong province. In support of that, official government statistics this week reported total visitations to Macao from Mainland China excluding Guangdong province were up 18% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2018. These visitors are staying longer in Macao and spending more time enjoying the ever growing diversity and critical mass of both gaming and non-gaming attractions and amenities. The Venetian introduced large scale non-gaming amenities in Macao, retail malls, MICE, live entertainment and arenas, which came to be known as Macao's first Integrated Resort. These attractions are now very well established in Macao and will only grow in importance and contribution to Macao's diversification in the future. Our market leading property portfolio received 23.8 million visitors in the quarter, while Macao's total visitation was 8.5 million. It means we've got almost three visitations from each visitor. The strong appeal and power, the critical mass of hotel, dining, retail and entertainment and our property portfolio at the Cotai Strip is evident. This demonstrates the appeal of our properties as they receive multiple visits from tourists each trip. While much has been accomplished to-date in the transformation of Macao into Asia's premier business and leisure tourism destination, we will not rest on our laurels. We will continue to invest substantial capital into our portfolio across every segment of our businesses. In particular I am very excited by the way the design work for The Londoner is progressing. The Londoner will have a tremendous potential as a third landmark must see destination, complementing The Venetian and The Parisian. Our commitment to further reinvest in Macao is not limited to The Londoner. Many other significant capital projects are taking shape as we speak. The suite additions at Parisian, the renovation of our VIP gaming areas, a plethora of new and exciting F&B outlets and the full scale development of the two luxury hotel towers immediately adjacent to The Four Seasons and St. Regis properties, all of which will greatly bolster our growth prospects in the year ahead. We regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success in realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses and providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens, including through our Sands Academy and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading business and leisure tourism destination. Now I'm going to move on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. As mentioned earlier, we delivered an all-time record quarter at Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $551 million (sic) [$541 million] (9:18), an increase of 48% over the prior year. The quarter was marked by strong VIP and slot revenue growth. Normalized EBITDA margin increased by 490 basis points versus the prior year, reaching 58.7% for the first quarter, supported by solid cost control and successful collection of receivables. Our retail mall also continues to outperform the broader Singapore retail market with strong tenant sales growth of 14% over the prior year. We're proud that Marina Bay Sands stands as the ideal reference site for countries that are considering iconic, large-scale Integrated Resort developments. Turning to Las Vegas. We achieved an all-time record adjusted EBITDA of $141 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year. We achieved record hotel room revenues, underpinned by group room revenues and stronger backlog rates (10:35). So that's the summary of the quarter. Did I mention that growth was fully on display? Now let's move to another of my favorite subjects, the result of capital to shareholders. Yay dividends and yay buybacks. Our recurring dividend remains the cornerstone of our program to return excess capital to shareholders. Last October, the Las Vegas Sands board of directors approved an increase in our recurring dividend for the 2018 calendar year to $3 per share for the year, or $0.75 per quarter. We have increased our recurring dividend to our shareholders every year since we first established it in 2012. We remain deeply committed to our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. And we look forward to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. We repurchased $75 million of stock during the quarter. We will continue to use share repurchases to return excess cash to shareholders in the future. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity and balance sheet strength enable us to continue our recurring dividend and stock repurchase programs, while retaining ample financial flexibility to reinvest in our existing properties and pursue new development opportunities. In conclusion, our cash flow generation continues to be strong and predictable. The structural advantage from our scale, critical mass and product diversity was on full display in our strong financial results. The robust growth in the mass market in Macao continued during the quarter and the secular growth in Chinese travel and wealth creation together with enhanced transportation infrastructure bode well for future growth. We will continue to make significant investments in Macao because we have a long term and unwavering commitment to Macao. We look to the future with confidence. We have a strong organic growth outlook. We are strategically reinvesting in our existing assets while also pursuing new development opportunities. And we have both the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Yea dividends, again. Thank you for joining us on the call today, now we will take questions. Operator : Thank you. The first question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, and congrats on the good results. So focusing on Macao I noticed that for your three larger properties there, RevPar in the quarter was up anywhere from 27% to 29%. Can you just kind of talk about the trends there, is that cash RevPar, is that stronger premium mass and then in the slides you talk about your strengthening VIP business, can you just touch on that a little bit more too? Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Thomas. Just talk about our Macao business in general, and I'll answer your questions as well. The hotels are running about 94% occupancy and that's in a market that introduced 10,000 new sleeping rooms last three years. Just for commentary, our food and beverage sales exceeded $300 million annually, our 850 retail stores saw a 33% increase in sales and will soon grow about $0.5 billion a year contribution and our arena, which isn't spoke about much is, we carefully book with top stars from all over the world, this week Bruno Mars sells out numerous shows. Macao has become a full blown destination, has worked for China far beyond Guangdong and far beyond Hong Kong. The penetration into China is growing and growing and finding younger and more affluent customers who find Macao a compelling destination. As you know, the bridge opens up sometime this year and soon the entire Pacific Rim will be able to fly into Hong Kong and take a car to Macau, which makes it pretty extraordinary. As to your question, it's driven by both more gaming demand, higher demand from the gaming side but also higher cash demand. As you know, we run about 50/50 cash/comp, but the comp standard keeps rising as does the cash ADR. And the gaming portion of our business just keeps growing and is well balanced in all segments, whether it's Rolling or Non-Rolling, tables or slots, there's strong double-digit demand, which we believe is sustainable, and this is not 2013 or 2014 which is more rolling dependent. This is a mass of nongaming and gaming market. We're at the epicenter of this. If you look at page 11 in your deck, I think you'll see our strong mass table story. From both a base mass and premium mass perspective, it illustrates our growth and the power of this segment. So page 11 is worth a look as is page 15 which illustrates the growth of Macao's overall high-margin mass gaming segment, and that's the place we reside. And as Sheldon referenced, we'll keep aggressively investing in Macao. The Londoner is engaged and work begins later this year. We expect this property resemble The Venetian in terms of mass and premium feel from both a gaming, retail, and lodging perspective. Our Four Seasons St. Regis suite product will open in 2019 offering 600 additional suites. And one more point about our gaming business. Our junket capacity today is about 50% of where we want to be. By 2019 we could offer as many as 21 junket rooms as opposed to our current 11. And these rooms we fully renovate it with input from our partners with smoking rooms easy access. So we're fully committed to Macao. That's the market to be in. We're on a run rate of 3-plus billion dollars a year and growing, and I think the demand for rooms is insatiable. Hard to imagine, running 94-plus percent in a market that's grown so much capacity. It speaks so well to the penetration into China, it speaks well to the surging demand both from the gaming and nongaming perspective. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Rob. This is my follow-up. Can we just touch on Singapore? You've had four quarters in a row now of high hold and you've shifted your theoretical hold in Macao. Would you think about doing that in Singapore? And then any update on your thinking around the mall sale? Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Look at page 40 in your deck, Thomas. That might be helpful to understand the change I'll refer (00:17:50) to the non-rolling chip drop at Marina Bay Sands. We have adjusted and we have changed the methodology, and perhaps that's illustrative of what we're trying to do there. It just keeps our business instinct across the globe. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sorry, Thomas, did you also inquire about changing the normalization percentage for Singapore? Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. On roll for Singapore and then another question was just on the mall sale potential. Thanks. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're constantly looking at our table mix at our play historically and looking at the math behind achieving the correct theoretical volumes. So in doing that that was the review that we went into, and we actually revised the hold normalization range in Macao based on the volume of play and the historical averages. When we think about Marina Bay Sands, we're constantly evaluating it. So if you look at our hold percentage over time, you'll see that we typically are holding outside of that range. So it is something that we constantly look at, and when there is math to support that change, we'll definitely review it. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. And, yeah, on the mall sale. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think our answer to that is the same one that we had in prior quarter. I think it's the best retail asset in the world today. If you look at the growth that we've experienced just in the last quarter alone, you can see that sales per square foot for Marina Bay Sands on the trailing 12 months for the first quarter were above $1,700 a square foot. There are not many malls of that size globally that have that type of productivity. So from our standpoint, it's an unbelievable asset and one that has trophy status at the highest level. So from our standpoint, it should be very attractive to any potential investor. That being said, there's really nothing to talk about at this time, but eventually we hope to be able to achieve the cap rates the Chairman has alluded to in prior calls. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, Joe, please check to see if your line is on mute. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, everybody. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Joe. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Obviously what stood out to us was the approximate 35% growth in premium mass in Macao. I guess, just trying to get a better understanding of the operating leverage there, I know you're still targeting segment profit margin in the 25% to 40% range. I'm presuming given that type of growth, you're at the high end of that range. I mean can you give us a sense of where you were in the 1Q? And again, to further better understand the operating leverage there, how do you think about that segment OpEx growth relative to the top line growth? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I missed the last part of your questions. Can you repeat the second portion \u2013 Joe, I'm sorry \u2013 about the leverage? Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Just to get a better sense of the operating leverage when you guys are experiencing this type of segment growth, I guess where were you in terms of segment margin for the 1Q? I'm presuming just where you ended up for the quarter, you're at the higher end of that 25% to 40%. And then maybe to complement that answer, where has that segment OpEx or where was the OpEx growth in the 1Q and then I have a follow-up on Singapore. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Okay. Obviously, the demand in that segment is growing and so is the leverage. It's not changed a whole lot in the last few quarters and pretty much consistent. But to your point, as the surging demand at the premium mass level is going to make more money (00:21:14) changing all that much against this. So leverage is growing, but more importantly demand is growing. And again what we are seeing is a lifestyle thing. We're getting people from further and further. You see the growth in non-Guangdong I think it's slide 13, which talks about the growth outside of Guangdong province. I believe that's \u2013 yeah, the growth of non-Guangdong has been hugely beneficial to us in filling our 13,000 rooms. And part of the reason why we're rethinking St. Regis Londoner, Four Seasons is because that's where the sweet spot is in that demand. That customer is valuable. More of them, they're coming further away. We believe that even increases further with the bridge later this year. So I don't know if it's going to grow a whole lot more as leverage, but there's a whole lot more demand and more top line and more value to those rooms than ever. And again it's the retail component, it's the better sleeping rooms, it's the arena. We have some great competitive structural advantages which enable us to grow and grow to hopefully 800 and beyond. Patrick, do you want to take a piece of it? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Hey, Joe. So, a couple of comments. I think a couple quarters ago, we reviewed some of our cost-cutting measures and call it cost offsetting measures in order to try to mitigate expanding cost as the business grew. And I think you can see some of the benefits of that. I have to hand it to the team there, did a great job. If you look at our margins, you can see the deck on page 10. Our hold normalized adjusted property EBITDA margin was 29.1%, which \u2013 excuse me, our EBITDA grew 29.1%. Our margin itself was 36.4%, excuse me. That's an incredibly strong flow through percentage, and we feel very confident that as revenues continue to grow, as the mass market is deeper and more developed in our property portfolio, we'll have the ability to continue that margin, potentially expand a little bit further. I'd like to point out that we did a nice job with our controllable expenses and managing those. There are obviously variable expenses related to gaming taxes and other things, but those are out of our control as play grows. But from a controllable expenses standpoint, we've worked very hard to ensure that those only grow at the minimum levels in order to support our customer base. And I think you can see that today in our margin and the expansion that we showed just across the year even on a normalized basis. So I think we're pretty happy with our margins. We feel there's some more opportunity there as we continue to get improved flow through from the mass market because it is such high margin, and we look forward to taking advantage of that as the market grows. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Joe, I think you know this from years looking at Macao. The story we told years ago is actually occurring rapidly. The deep penetration into Mainland China, the deep growth of this market in terms of premium mass, it makes the margin appreciation easier to get to. So I think it's going to keep getting better and better. As we see more top line, we'll deliver stronger and stronger margins, and it's a very encouraging story from our perspective. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. That's helpful. And then for Marina Bay Sands, you have on page 25 of the slide deck on a hold adjusted basis EBITDA grew 11% year-over-year. If you were to neutralize for FX and collections activity, what was that \u2013 I guess it was neutralized in both periods, what was that EBITDA growth? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think it came down to $420 million. The hold-normalized, I think we showed $420 million for the quarter. And as you can tell by the numbers, there is de-acceleration in the Rolling segment. It's disappointing that segment has slowed down quite a bit. We held very well. The other aspects of our business look strong. Patrick referenced the sales per square foot in the mall, the ADR, the lodging business holding up nicely, and our slots and ETGs, the Non-Rolling business decent at $4.7 million. But there's a slowdown at the top line in terms of the (00:25:01). That's a pretty soft quarter. We just played very lucky against that business and are hoping to see a return to a better day, but right now that's the soft spot in Singapore. The rest of the business looks pretty decent. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess as a follow up to your response to Joe's question just now on customers coming from outside Guangdong, how does the spend from that customer base compare to those coming from the existing regions? And as you think about the typical new customer spend trajectory, do you typically see a ramp in spend from those visiting for the first time? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, it's higher for a couple reasons. One is they come from further away and I think they are very lifestyle driven. What our teams describe to us is this acceleration of younger people who are very affluent, bring their families, want to stay as much as four nights. They want to see Bruno Mars or whoever the star is that weekend, they want to shop at the stores, they want to go to the spa and they bring families, and they like to gamble. It's quite a great combination. So they are not necessarily \u2013 they stay longer as they gamble more and they have more time to spend in our shops. It's a positive thing, but more positive is as you can see by that chart on page 13, the acceleration of demand outside of Guangdong is incredible. And I think when you start seeing the Pacific Rim property at the (00:26:33) airport and the transportation via bridges there, hopefully that process or that approach keeps getting better for us. We have 13,000, soon 13,600 sleeping rooms, pretty powerful products we have coupled with our 850 shops and our spas and our entertainment. So the answer is they spend more time, they spend more money, they're younger and there is more of them coming every day, and so very positive trend for Macao. I think our properties are built for this customer, and this customer is showing up in mass, and so we believe this quarter is \u2013 really I think this quarter redefines where Macao is going in our mind. It's becoming a very, very impressive place, a retail destination, a spa destination, an eating, lodging, lifestyle destination. We're very encouraged by the things we're seeing, our trends. Our team is very excited about what's happening to our business in Macao. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I guess one quick follow-up on that. I guess what kind of data are you able to collect on that customer now that you can potentially utilize in the future? Is it equivalent to the existing kind of database of customers? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, yeah, of course, we collect data the same way we've always collected data. We have extensive database, we have extensive information of customers because that's the nature of this business, isn't it. So, of course, we have extensive data on our customer, yes. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Not going to share that extensive data (00:28:01). Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. So my main question would just be to maybe follow up on Patrick's comments on operating expenses, but by our account, Macao looks like operating expenses were super well-controlled in the market for the quarter. The question is how sustainable is that as we move through the year and sort of what kind of level of trajectory of inflation should we sort of be considering or thinking about in those types of expenses? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Before Patrick, I'll just say I think it's going to \u2013 Shaun, obviously margins are driven by two different variables, but the top line is growing and the quality of customer is growing, and that makes margins easier to achieve. And I think our team has demonstrated an ability to deliver top line coupled with margin and great flow-through. I think it gets better. I don't think it's a question \u2013 just I hope it gets better, not de-accelerate. I think we have with our offerings and with our team's approach to this premium mass customer, if we get our junket business where I hope we can get it to, which couples up nicely with premium mass, I would think we'd see more top line business which would create more flow-through. So I don't think we have much risk of it de-accelerating. Patrick. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think the current environment should allow for what Rob just described. I think the team there has done a great job. I think the market itself is very favorable on the revenue side and we hope to see continued and further margin expansion in the upcoming quarters. Of course, there is no way to predict what will happen, but we feel very confident that we will be able to manage cost appropriately. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And just as my follow-up, Dan. I mean, Rob, you alluded to what's going on on the VIP side and that that's a target area for you guys. I think if I've got the slide decks correct then last quarter you saw roughly 4% growth in VIP. This quarter that jumped up to 20%, 21%. Can you talk a little bit about what initiatives you may have in place that already started to drive a little bit of that and then what you might have on the come? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Look, we're not happy with our VIP segment. We can do better. We want to do better. People think because we're so dominant in the slot business, ETG, not only table that we should see that segment growth. We're not going to do that at all. Just the opposite. We have spent a lot of capital, a lot of time with our partners to create we think are the best environments, most accessible, egress access, smoking friendly. In terms of 2019 January, our goal is to accelerate our VIP play because we think it's important both as a segment unto itself, but as you know, it offers crossover opportunities into premium mass. So we're very happy that we are investing large amounts of dollars and time in an approach that we think will grow our junket business and other segments as well. We're not finished. We want to be a much bigger player in that segment, and we've got some wonderful partners that we're listening to very carefully to grow that segment. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That 17 illustrates where we're at, but again we hope we can get to a much better place. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks a lot. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Anil Daswani of Citi. Your line is open. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Okay, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, with all the new infrastructure that's coming online in Macao with the bridge as well as the new high-speed link to Lotus hopefully, do you guys see that as a driver more for the base mass business rather than the premium mass business? And do you believe that we could see a shift in the focus of the market to this base mass business that you guys are incredibly strong in? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, we do. Very simply put, all new products in the market, be it the rail, be it the bridge, anything and everything that drives more base and more business in that market, we're hugely in support of and excited about. I think we've waited a long time. I think I was 28 when they started that bridge and I'm now almost 41. So it's been a long time. But we're damn excited about the bridge. It offers a whole new entr\u00e9e into different segments. The real story in Macao, yes, it's Hong Kong, it's Guangdong. But the real growth potential resides outside of Guangdong. And you see it in that one slide. We've done that for years. It's really actually happening where the growth in those markets are extraordinary. I also believe the Rim can open up too. The Macao in the 40 years I've been going there, it's become a wonderful destination. The government has done extraordinary job, and we've invested billions of dollars to make it a place that is extraordinary. What's happening in Cotai is nothing short of an exemplary development of a property that has opened up wonderful IRRs to a bunch of people. So as the infrastructure completes the picture for both local and for foreign tourism, we're going to be at the epicenter and believe as that can drive more business, both base and premium mass. So, of course, we're both supportive and enthused about what's happening there. It can only be good for us. We're the biggest player in the market in terms of hotel rooms, lodging, retail, gaming capacity. We intend to be aggressive in trying to create more capacity there. So, sure it's a positive for us, of course. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Perfect. And as my follow-up, clearly Japan's hotting up again. Seems like everyone is expecting a bill to get tabled at some point at the end of this week even potentially. If you guys have the choice and you could pick between Yokohama or Osaka, which are the two favorite cities at this point of time for big urban centers. Can you suggest which one you'd prefer? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: (00:33:44). Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're still assessing that. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We want them all. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's the better answer. We're still assessing that. They're both very good. In Yokohama, we've got like a bedroom community to Tokyo. Tokyo has got about 32 million people in Tokyo Metropolitan area, of which Yokohama is part, but Osaka is about 12 million to 14 million people. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: With 20 million if you go the outer line, the entire... Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're still assessing that. The Yokohama location is right downtown and the Osaka location is the farthest island. Next stop is the other side of Tokyo Bay and after that next stop is Hawaii (00:34:57). And the location is much further away from downtown, so it's very difficult to say. First of all, we don't think that anything is going to happen. Appoint the operators, according to everything I read in all the clippings that we are number one in line. We've got the best chance of getting the first choice. So we've been lobbying for that location for better part of 10 years for Japan. And now it looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe it'll by this Friday that they'll submit the IR bill, but then again, you hear other people say that it's postponed for a week or two. But something that I heard from somebody in Korea was a little more encouraging than what we've been hearing in the last year or two. They are thinking about making another location outside of Seoul, a Korean national's visitation casino in an Integrated Resort. We think we're also number one in that line. And Korea could be real. We're also looking at Brazil. I'm going down there in a couple or few weeks. Again, we've had people from there come up here. We're optimistic that in the near future, we should know more about getting at least one of those, either Korea, Japan or Brazil or hopefully more than one. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So we're very enthused about Japan. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you, guys. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Very enthused. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Yeah. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Thank you. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hi. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, if we could just go back to Macao for a second. Obviously your results were outstanding. I'm just wondering if we could drill back on page 11 of your deck in the premium mass slide or part of the slide where it shows that the premium mass table win in the quarter was basically sequentially flat. So I was just wondering is there anything to read into that because obviously everything else is so strong? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think it's more about a hold percentage. As we're dropping the kind of volume we're doing, Felicia, these numbers are so extraordinary. I hate to \u2013 I've said this a few times. And the truth is a point here, a point there makes a big difference. So if you pick up a point Q-on-Q, we actually lost a point, a hold percentage; on the kind of volumes we're doing it's pretty extraordinary. So I can't do much about that. We play a point lucky. If we start talking $20 billion, $25 billion of a drop in a year, a point means a lot. It's like real money. And the story is we actually had a nice \u2013 we had that nice sequential growth in the quarter but we didn't hold as well, we dropped a point in hold, that's the whole story. I think our mass table business and our premium mass table business just continue to outperform even our expectations here in Las Vegas. So it's simply a hold percentage, we're up single-digit, about 6%, 7% I think Q-on-Q and up I think 21% year-on-year. So, factoring a point here in hold percentage, we held 22.7% versus 21.8% and therein lies the drop off. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's perfect, that's what I was looking for. Okay, and then just if we can switch gears to Las Vegas for a moment, just your properties in Las Vegas they generated some \u2013 it was moderate but some RevPAR growth in the quarter. But we were actually expecting you to be down given the tough comps. Wynn also reported growth yesterday as well within RevPAR. So just wondering, can you just talk about what you're seeing in Las Vegas? I mean there was a tough comp in the quarter, the market is still recovering, but it seems like it could be better than we expect? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, I think so. We did have a record quarter. $140 million EBITDA. I've been here since we opened, that's the best quarter in our history. So we're doing something very right. And the nice thing is it's not about hold percentage or luck, we held within the expected range, we had a strong MICE business, strong ADR coming out of FIT, incredible banquet demand, it was $70-plus million in the quarter of food and beverage. Gaming business was really strong. Great Chinese New Year's, great international play, we held normal, nothing exceptional. So, if you can make $140 million in Las Vegas in a quarter without doing something lucky, that's pretty exceptional results. We're very proud of the team, margins look good, future looks bright. And our outsized results will depend on not \u2013 historically we've always been a very good performer in the lodging segment and the food and beverage. Our variable I think there is contingent upon getting more international play in the door. We did it this quarter. We played fortunately within the range and, boom, $140 million quarter which is exemplary. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Would you attribute most of the growth to the international play and perhaps the domestic is more flattish? How would you look at the complexion of that? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, that's fair to characterize. Our slot business was stellar. It remains strong and we're very happy with the margins and the topline. Our mass play, we have more work to do to get it to increase but that's the Las Vegas story across the board. It's not like Macao where you expect 20% and 30% growth. It's tougher here in Las Vegas. But international play, we need to get our \u2013 to show these kind of quarters successfully and sustainably, we need to get more international play and keep it. There was a time in our history, it was pretty commonplace. We fell off a bit and I think we're back to a better place. To deliver $150 million, $140 million, $130 million quarters, we're going to need a continued contribution of a drop from the table game side. But again, it was an exceptional hold, we're in the range with strong Asian play, strong Chinese New Year's coupled with amazing lodging results and strong F&B. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yep. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks everyone. Rob or Sheldon I think mentioned earlier in the call, talked a little bit about expansion of the VIP footprint in Macao. Could you just talk a little bit right now in terms of however you can categorize it, your mix between kind of your junket business relative to your direct in-house business and the plans for kind of the direct business going forward? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Carlo, I don't want to talk, break out our numbers. We have a strong business premium direct and as I referenced earlier, I want to get better at the junket side, we're very happy with our premium direct business. We want to grow our junket business as I referenced and Sheldon referenced, we're dedicating capital and more importantly we're dedicating manpower and brainpower to figure out how to do better in that segment. We should do better. And we want to drive more VIP, let's be very clear about that. So, we're spending a lot of money on rooms at the direction of our partners, making sure access egress is good, making sure smoking friendly in gaming for 2019 (42:50). I won't break out the numbers but I will tell you we're growing in the junket segment, we're double-digit growth year-on-year and sequentially growing. But I want to see more. I think we need more because that segment is growing again and we should be bigger participants. And as I referenced earlier, there's a spillover effect in the premium mass. There's a value there. So, we are very laser focused on getting better with that segment. We're very happy with the other segments. We want to be better in our junket partner segment. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And Rob if I may just ask a quick follow-up, you mentioned obviously that spillover effect, what does that stem from? Is there almost a crowding out of liquidity on the VIP side and as you mentioned earlier kind of constantly adjusting levels for hotel room comps. But does the same type of phenomenon happen within VIP or at least are you guys seeing that where you're starting to see some of your previously lower rung VIP players kind of be more or less pushed into the premium mass segment, which is obviously a good problem to have for you guys, but is that happening as you think about liquidity in the junket market today and junkets being a little bit more discerning about which customers they're taking in? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think you're absolutely right. They're more discerning. Their coffers are full of liquidity and so why not be balanced and why not enable our \u2013 people want to be a junket customer, go to the junket side; you want to be a premium direct, go that side. What we're seeing though, again our hotel rooms are getting more and more demand from further and further away. Those people tend to be less junket sensitive and more into the premium direct side, whereas Guangdong tends to be more junket preference. But it's not my job to tell people where to gamble, what to do. I just want to make sure they have access to capital and that we have access to sleeping rooms and junket rooms they want to play in. So, again, we're a equal opportunity gaming house. We want to give all kinds of opportunity to our customers to go to the place they want to gamble. We're happy wherever they gamble but you know and I know, liquidity is there, growth is there, and they're darn good partners to have. So, we're very happy to work with them. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Company had a great quarter and I am pleased that we continued to deliver strong financial results. Hold-normalized company-wide adjusted property EBITDA reached $1.23 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior year. Our Macao operations again performed exceptionally well, with adjusted property EBITDA growing by 25% to $750 million. We experienced strong growth in both the VIP and mass table game segments, enabling us to grow our market share of gaming revenue both year-over-year and sequentially. Our Macao operations are back to generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of $3 billion. Marina Bay Sands continue to produce strong cash flows, while Las Vegas had another strong quarter on a hold-normalized basis. Our balance sheet remains the strongest in the industry. As of the end of the second quarter, our gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.2 times at Las Vegas Sands and 1.6 times at Sands China. The size and stability of our cash flows enable us to reinvest in our existing portfolio, pursue new development opportunities and return excess capital to shareholders. At the same time, we will continue to maintain a prudent approach to our balance sheet and we intend to stay within our targeted ratio of gross leverage to EBITDA between two and three times at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. In Macao, the acceleration in mass market growth that began in the fourth quarter of last year has continued into the first and second quarters of this year. Our non-rolling drop in the second quarter grew by 19% over the prior year and non-rolling win grew by 20% over the prior year. This strong mass revenue growth combined with cost efficiencies drove significant margin expansion. Our hold-normalized EBITDA margin reached 35.2% for the quarter, representing an increase of 170 basis points compared with the prior year. The successful execution of our Cotai Strip development over the past decade is giving us important structural advantages; the scale and range of our hotel suite inventory, the diversity of our non-gaming offerings, especially in retail MICE and entertainment \u2013 and the unique benefit of interconnectivity between our Cotai properties. These advantages allow us to attract more overnight visitors than any other operator, as well as to increase their length of stay. In the second quarter of 2018, we equaled our record hotel occupancy of 94%, despite the second quarter typically being a seasonally softer period. As a result, we grew by an outstanding 29% in premium mass when compared to the prior year, and our retail mall tenant sales grew by 30% over the prior year with each of our four malls contributing strong growth. Our strategy to build Integrated Resort with scale and diversity continues to pay clear dividends as Macao receives more visitors from outside of Hong Kong and Guangdong province. Chinese visitation to Macao from provinces outside of Guangdong grew by 17% over the 12 months to June 30th. These visitors are also staying longer in Macao and enjoying the ever-growing diversity of non-gaming attractions and amenities. The opening of The Venetian Macao over a decade ago marked the first step in my vision to create the Cotai Strip. The Venetian introduced large scale non-gaming amenities in Macao such as retail malls, MICE, live entertainment and arenas. These attractions are now well-established in Macao and will continue to flourish and grow. This quarter The Venetian Macao delivered an exceptional performance, benefiting from its comprehensive suite renovation program which was completed at the beginning of this year. Rolling volumes were 44%, non-rolling drop grew by 32%, retail mall tenant sales increased by 27%, and hold-normalized adjusted EBITDA was up by 33%. The Venetian together with the Four Seasons, SCC, and The Parisian all interconnected, comprises the only MICE-based integrated resort complex of this scale in the world. I'm truly grateful to the Macao Government and the local community for their great support over the years in enabling us to implement this vision and strategy. I was absolutely committed then and I remain as deeply committed today to continuing to support Macao's economic diversification and its transformation into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. We will continue to invest substantial capital into our portfolio across every segment of our business. I'm confident that these investments will drive additional growth in leisure and business tourism for both our portfolio and for Macao overall. In particular, I am very excited by the way the design work for The Londoner is progressing. The Londoner will have tremendous potential as a third landmark must-see destination, complementing The Venetian and The Parisian. Our commitment to further reinvest in Macao is not limited to The Londoner. Many other significant capital projects are taking shape as we speak \u2013 the suite conversions at Parisian, the wholesale renovation of our VIP gaming areas, a number of new F&B outlets and the full scale development of the tower adjacent to The Four Seasons Macao, which will greatly bolster the competitive position of the Plaza/Four Seasons property. Let me assure you that we are not resting on our laurels, but constantly investing, upgrading, and modernizing key elements of the Macao portfolio to attract new visitors and give repeat visitors new reasons to come back to our properties. Our decision to reinvest and develop The Londoner Macao and to add additional suite inventory reflects that long-term commitment to Macao and our confidence in its future. We regard it as a privilege to contribute to Macao's success and realizing its objectives of diversifying its economy, supporting the growth of local businesses and providing meaningful career development opportunities for its citizens, including through our Sands Academy and reaching its full potential as Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Now moving on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. As mentioned earlier, we continue to generate strong cash flow at Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $368 million. Our mass win per day grew by 10% over the prior year to $4.85 (sic) [$4.85 million]. Our retail mall also continues to outperform the broader Singapore retail market with our tenant sales per square foot growing more than 19% in the 12 months ended June 30. At the same time, Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as a powerful reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large scale Integrated Resort developments. Our pioneering track record, unmatched development expertise, and financial strength put us in a leading position to take advantage of the most promising new development opportunities on the horizon. With the successful passage of the IR implementation bill in Japan last week, we look forward to pursuing what would be a unique opportunity. We hope to be able to bring our track record, expertise, and development vision together with our industry-leading financial strength to deliver to Japan a large scale MICE-based Integrated Resort that would be uniquely tailored to the Japanese market. In Las Vegas, we achieved another strong quarter with hold-normalized EBITDA $106 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Now let's move on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders : yay dividends and yay buybacks. Our recurring dividend program remains the cornerstone of our program to return capital to shareholders. Last October, the Las Vegas Sands Board of Directors approved an increase in our recurring dividend for the 2018 calendar year to $3.00 per share for the year or $0.75 per quarter. After establishing our recurring dividend program in 2012, this marks the sixth consecutive year that we've increased our recurring dividend to shareholders. We remain deeply committed to our recurring dividend programs at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, and we look forward to increasing those recurring dividends in the future as our cash flows grow. At the same time, we will remain optimistic in returning excess capital via our share repurchase program. We repurchased $ 100 million of stock during the quarter. We look forward to continuing to utilize the stock buy-back program, to return excess capital to shareholders, and to enhance long-term shareholder returns in the future. Our industry-leading cash flows, geographic diversity and balance sheet strength, enable us to continue our recurring dividend and stock repurchase programs, while retaining ample financial flexibility to reinvest in our existing properties and pursue the most promising new development opportunities. In conclusion, our cash flow generation continues to be strong and predictable. The structural advantages from our scale, critical mass and product diversity continues to translate into strong financial results. The marked acceleration in mass market growth in the Macao market has continued during the current quarter. We will continue to make significant investments in Macao, because we have a long-term and unwavering commitment to this market. We look to the future with confidence. We have a strong organic growth outlook. We are strategically reinvesting in our existing assets while also pursuing new development opportunities. And we have both the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And now, we'll take questions. Operator : We have a question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to maybe start with the current market and operating environment. I think the last couple of months of GGR growth, we've seen a little bit of a deceleration in the market overall, but obviously LVS is taking a material share and performing well. I was just wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts on both the operating environment, a little bit about that deceleration, and if I caught it correctly, I think at the tail end of the prepared remarks there was something about an acceleration or continued strong growth in the current quarter, and I just want to clarify that comment. Thank you very much. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hi, Shaun. It's Rob. I think the success of this quarter demonstrates material growth in all our segments in our business with the Macao rolling, mass, premium mass, slots, ETGs, rooms, retail, all showed material growth, and our EBITDA reflects $150 million year-on-year improvement. But the most important driver of this growth is premium mass, and on page 11 of the deck, you'll see our references to our win per unit per day in mass and premium mass tables. We're basically at $7,300 a day in mass and about $17,000 a day in premium mass. This strong growth comes \u2013 we think it comes from a non-Guangdong segment of our business and it bodes well for our future. We intend to emulate the success of The Venetian from a lodging and from a perspective of how we move forward and grow. The Venetian's renovated room and suite product has resulted in about 33% year-on-year EBITDA growth, mass table drop is up by about 32%, rolling volume up 44%, slot volume by about 20%, retail sales up 27%. This property just continues to accelerate and it's hitting on all cylinders. And this is the blueprint as we move forward in our CapEx, how we see the market for our company. The Parisian currently has about 30% of its rooms out of order. But by the end of this year, by the end of 2018, we'll have about 350 newly converted premium suites. The theoretical win of the ones we've been \u2013 we've finished thus far is four times what we're getting at the old rooms. So by year end, The Parisian is a whole different product. And again, the blueprint here goes back to our Venetian success. Same holds true with the Four Seasons and we've renovated and we've literally about 22% year-on-year growth, EBITDA growth. But, next year, we'll see the addition of 300 new suites of the Four Seasons which is going to be a material impact on the performance of that product. The SCC is showing growth, but when it comes to The Londoner, with newly converted suites at both The Londoner and St. Regis, we believe this property could go far beyond its current $700 million to $800 million run rate. It will feature 2,000 premium mass suites, and by far our greatest growth vehicle in the future. Let's address non-Guang [Guangdong] growth for a second on page 12. This is the penetration store we've been waiting for that will grow our EBITDA to $3 billion and beyond. The penetration beyond Guangdong province is critical to our growth and our ambitions. These people come to gamble. They stay longer at our hotel. They come to our arena for shows. They shop at our 850 retail stores. This is a lifestyle segment and the situation of these visitations of these affluent Chinese consumers, we think, is the future of the growth at our company. In summary, the long term demand is there, non-Guangdong penetration, younger premium mass demographic which consumes our lifestyle driven Integrated Resort product with retail, entertainment, dining, luxury. At the same time, we have a clear path to end at what we've achieved at The Venetian followed by at first \u2013 The Venetian this year, The Parisian, Four Seasons and lastly The Londoner. So we're extremely confident that we found the key to growing our business not just this year but beyond. And unlike '14, which will probably rival our '14 EBITDA this year, unlike '14, obviously the growth is based on a much more sustainable segment, that being mass, premium mass. So we're extremely confident of not just this quarter, next quarter, but next few years of meaningful growth of our properties, assuming the market continues to tick up like it is. We feel very bullish. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for that Rob. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I could. I could. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that, Rob. I appreciate it. Just the other update would be, you mentioned the importance of getting some of the new premium mass suites opened at both Four Seasons and I assume St. Regis as well. Just \u2013 I know there's been some scope changes you guys have been looking at there. What's the latest on timing for when we could expect or think about those opening? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: At this point we're working through the issues with our development team and we'll get back to you when we have a final date. But we feel good about the timing, we feel good about the scope. We've expanded some of the quality. Our main goal, as we move forward, is to get these right. If it comes in poorly done and poorly executed, it will reflect in the revenue. We've learned the hard way. But when you get things right, it does pay off, and if it takes more dollars to do it, we'll do that. So we'll come back to you with a finite number in terms of design schedule and timing, but we're not prepared today to talk about that. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Thank you, Shaun. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thanks, Shaun. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. How are you? Can you talk about the Singapore performance in the quarter? Mass trends look to have grown pretty strongly, but obviously VIP fell significantly. So can you just talk about what's driving that and how should we think about the future? Thanks. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. As you see MBS stood about $368 million for the quarter. We ran \u2013 our business ran very well there with the exception you called out, the hotel ran about at s97% at $418, RevPAR of $405. Retail had I think its best quarter ever at $1,753 sales per square foot. And non-rolling slots, as you mentioned got to \u2013 non-rolling slots tables got to $4.8 million per day with margins hanging up in there in the low-60%s. And that is of course the main driver of our success. The weak link of the performance was the rolling segment and we have our lowest rolling volume in our history, under $6 billion. And we held about, in the range, 2.84% but down than last \u2013 from last quarter's 4.77%. We've always represented this is a highly concentrated quarter and this quarter there was no concentration. The business was soft and there's no denying it. We are working towards \u2013 looking at what we can do to improve that. Even with that weakness, this place still shows about $1.5 billion annualized run rate which is acceptable. The question is how can you drive more business in here, and the answer is twofold. We've got to keep ramping our premium mass business, which clearly is the real driver of the underlying EBITDA. And we gotta work harder to figure out how to get better quality play in from the rolling segment. It's \u2013 again, it's concentrated, it's confusing to us at times how it jumps up some quarters to $7, $8, $9 billion and then tumbles like this quarter. We're not happy with it. We plan to work at it. We're looking at our suite product. We need to renovate some suite product. The competition for that segment is strong regionally, Macao and Australia, et cetera. But we're not pleased with that rolling segment performance. We've got work to do and there's no other excuse and we've got to keep looking at how to improve it. And we still don't want to give up on it because the next thing you know we could have another $8 or $9 billion quarter this year. But, clearly, that's the weak link in the performance at MBS. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thanks, Rob. And just as my follow-up, there's obviously been some new supply that opened up in Macao this year. How is it influencing the market and your position within the market? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I'm sorry, Tom, one more time I was looking at something, I'm sorry. One more time. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: The new supply in Macao, how is that impacting the market in your view and how is it impacting your share in the market? Thanks. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think it's positive, very positive when Macao gets new product. And I think the Morpheus tower, the Wynn, MGM, all these things are very positive for the market. We view Macao as a growing market, as a growth market. Those products make it, honestly, bulletproof to the rest of the region as it grows into a $40 billion, $50 billion CapEx there. It's an amazing place to watch \u2013 what started \u2013 I'm here 11 years ago with the sole Venetian product and that has morphed into this amazing visitation machine. Very honestly, it just benefits us. We think the new product helps us because with 13,000 rooms, we have the \u2013 the MICE business is ours, the entertainment business, we have the only arena of scale, we have the only place with 850 stores. The pure scale of what we have over there helps us when these guys bring new product to market. The competition is great. The quality of product is excellent. Our job is to, again, take our Venetian model to fuel our growth and emulate it. We do think, at the end of the day, it's a rooms-driven market. I kind of chuckle when people say a few years ago people say, oh it's a bloodbath, there's too many rooms. And now we're running at 94% across our portfolio. Our biggest problem is the team there wants more rooms, more quality rooms because we're sold out every weekend. So I believe that we are \u2013 everyone's going to win in Macao just those with the most capacity will win the most. So I think this quarter reflects the beginning of a good strong trend, the non-Guangdong visitation. And I think it's great that Cotai keeps bringing more products like Morpheus, like Wynn, like MGM, it just helps us bring more visitation which bodes very well for our company. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I want to point out that \u2013 this is Sheldon \u2013 I want to point out that this $1,753 per square foot sales in... Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: MBS. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: ...Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is probably the second highest \u2013 if you were in the United States, it would be the second highest. Beyond, I think, a couple of one or two shops, one or two malls in Florida. It may even be one of the top two or three highest. I want to point out that the reason for that is while all the malls in the United States are frequented by local visitors \u2013 they're not visitors but the local people, we are frequented by tourists. And the same thing is happening at malls in Macao, at the duty-free shops, the first level of the Four Seasons Mall is over $5,000 per square foot. On an average, I think, between the duty-free shops and the one or two additional floors, we're at close to $3,000 a foot sales. There's nothing like that in the world and it's nothing like our Integrated Resorts which acts as the anchors. If you think about it, we don't have any department store anchors and we won't have any because we don't need them. The Integrated Resort is the anchor. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thomas, what you mentioned Q3, I don't think we gave any indication of Q3 and we won't. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Rob. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just a follow up on Marina Bay Sands. Have you seen any change in the competitive environment specifically there within the market? And I guess has anything changed from a promotional intensity and how you think about that as a lever? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Not really. I think the market remains. We \u2013 I don't see competitive problems there as far as \u2013 Genting does a really good job in the market. But we continue to run our business as we see fit. Our concern is about ourselves with our product was getting the right kind of team out in the field to get the rolling segment we are missing. But we're very pleased with our $4.8 million a day. We couldn't be \u2013 Sheldon referenced the mall sales are extraordinary, hotel is sold out. If anything we lack in that market, Stephen, is more capacity. What's frustrating is we just need more \u2013 a lot more sleeping rooms and more gaming capacity. Slots there do terrific numbers, and it's hard to see that as a competitive problem. It's simply a problem of capacity. We have built a building that's always full. Retail's full, slots, ETGs \u2013 we actually have 80%, 90% occupancy at weekends. So, I don't think it's a competitive problem in terms of pressures from Genting. We just try to do a better job in our rolling segment. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Fair enough. And then maybe changing gears, I think last quarter you gave some good detail on Japan and now with the bill passing, can you just remind us of how you're planning and anticipating the process to unfold from here? And how you assess the opportunity, I guess, across various markets as well as how you're thinking about capital allocation in pursuit of that opportunity? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, Japan, as we all know passed finally and we're thrilled. And I think Sheldon has talked about the passing of a very, very important part of our \u2013 we'd love to be there as a third country along with Macao and Singapore. We don't have a timetable, we wait for the government to direct us as to how to go forward. We've had a presence there for over a decade and we're eager to be there. I think our plan is simple. We have the balance sheet. We have the reference point IRs in both Macao and Singapore that the Japanese government look to. We have the defining MICE space in Macao and Singapore. We have the defining entertainment activity in those places. So I think when you realize what we've done in Macao, I think Sheldon's reference to MBS is true, but also the buildings we built in Macao are pretty extraordinary too. I think, again, strategically what makes this company different is our balance sheet and Sheldon's ability to figure out what to build and where to build it. What he built in Macao remains the reference point for Asian IRs. He took up in the Cotai Strip and that's amazing achievement. I think they look at that, look at his MICE focus, look at his retail focus, look at his grand plan, I think that bodes well for our future development in Japan. We have the balance sheet. We have the reference sites. We sure have the appetite and we just want to get started. So we're hoping the government to move forward. We'll wait for their direction and adhere to their advices. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: What about our good looks and charm, Rob. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah we're getting old, so. You and I are the old dogs in the hunt here, so I don't think that's gonna get us there. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: What I'd like to point out is that we have \u2013 everybody says, local Japanese business people, banks, everybody says, we have the leading position in Japan because of my background. I used to produce Comdex show in Japan, and I also helped them to redesign the biggest exhibition center they have in Japan called Makuhari Messe. And when they went to build that in the 1980s, the Governor of Chiba, in which Makuhari is located, came to my office in Boston and I helped them redesign the center, the exhibition center. So I've got a good background and reputation in Japan for being the leading MICE Integrated Resort developer and operator. And I think that the estimates by people who know \u2013 say they know, whom we believe they know, say that we're in the number one pole position. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I guess one quick follow-up. Is there anything, I guess, as you're looking at the market that has changed that makes you reconsider either how much capital you would deploy or how you're thinking about returns in that market? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're not \u2013 as I've said before, we're not going to do anything that will \u2013 we don't intend to do anything that will bring returns down below 20% cash-on-cash. And we just don't know the details. The law was just passed last week. It consists of hundreds of pages. There's about 250 different items in the bill. And I think it's going to go down to the various prefectures before we know what can be done and when. And to get further clarification on several of the important things like the percentage of overall build space. They're saying 3% but there are a lot of variables that might be able to get us. I mean, we normally count front of the house and back of the house in our casino allocation or space. But over there, we will count only the front of the house. And, as we understand it, we won't have to count the aisles and the food and beverage space as part of the 3%. So it's a matter of how many gaming positions we put in and I think it's too early now. This implementation bill will take at least a year for any city that wants to be involved to come up with their requirements and their criteria. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Fair enough. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, everybody. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hey, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Rob, what was interesting to me going through the earnings release and the supplemental presentation was when we look at your Macao results in mass and VIP compare it to your growth versus the growth of the market segment you meaningfully exceeded on the VIP side. And on the mass side, you're a little bit below the estimated mass segment growth. And I can understand the rationale of each of those but can you talk about sort of, from here, your efforts in growing the VIP business through the use of maybe underutilized junket rooms and maybe what the path is there. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then my second question is with respect to the mass growth, this quarter was maybe the first quarter where you didn't meaningfully exceed or maybe match the segment growth. And I get it, we probably have to sort of total up all the operators to get a really true segment number for the market. But from here, does it get more difficult to keep pace with the mass side of things just given your historical position in the mass and that's all for me. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Joe, I'll take the second part first. I think just the opposite. I think our mass business is going to continue to do very, very well. We grew so quickly in the last few quarters. Our base grew so quickly that perhaps you're right we underperformed by a point or two. But we'll see that once all the numbers come out. I think we're built for growth far beyond anybody understands because of the products we have. As we complete these renovations, what we did at The Venetian, which now puts us on track to do $1.4 billion, maybe $1.5 billion next year, that's going to just keep like dominoes. You're going to see it at The Parisian next at the end of the year, boom. And you're going to see it hit the \u2013 the Four Seasons is going to become a very, very strong player. And then lastly you're going to see it at The Londoner, that conversion. So my belief is that this company, with 13,000 rooms, the dominant position in both rooms, retail, arena, it just has all the elements of growth. And as that non-Guangdong visitation continues, I think we're going to be a very strong player in the growth segment. I have total confidence and I should also throw in there, in case you missed it, we opened the first Apple flagship store outside United States last month. We're very proud, it sits outside of Cotai. We were with the people from Apple last month in Asia and they're delighted with the store and we sure are. We're hoping for more stores with the Apple people if they want to do more with us. We think that that store is going to become a traffic machine, great for our retail business, but not so bad for gaming. Again, I think these kinds of things, the Cotai Arena, the new Apple Store, the renovation of literally thousands of rooms and suites in over the next 18 months to 24 months, I think it redefines our growth and who we are. I am very optimistic that this non-Guangdong visitation which is we built this company for us to go beyond Hong Kong and Guangdong into the outer reaches, the outer provinces of China is the story. That's where the growth is. They're younger, but they gamble. They want all the amenities. They want the lifestyle we offer. And I think we're built for that kind of growth. And frankly, if you don't have the rooms on weekends, you can't get them. And they come over the border and they want quality product, they'll pay for it. They'll buy the retail products. They'll buy the shopping. They'll buy the dining. But that's the growth engine that we are \u2013 we're dependent upon. And if we execute our rooms suite product properly and get the right product in front of the consumer, we have total confidence. On the junket piece, I think, again it looks \u2013 it behooves us to look at the 44% year-on-year growth at The Venetian. What we did in The Venetian, we redefined some of the rooms there. We re-did our suite product, we worked with our junket partners and we're just doing some great numbers out of The Venetian. That we think happens at The Parisian. That's what happens at the SCC. It's happening, as we speak, at The Plaza. The only problem with The Plaza, we need more sleeping rooms of the quality we have currently and that comes on board with the completion of the Four Seasons. That Four Seasons, 300 suites, is going to really make us rethink the value of that asset at Plaza and Four Seasons. We're really excited. The junket business we need to do more. We keep redefining the physical structures in the rooms. We keep talking to our junket partners. We think there's a lot more growth ahead of us. And as you know, that relationship also spills over into our premium mass. So there is a relationship there that's undeniable in Macao and you have this strong junket, you have liquidity that fuels other segments. So you're seeing in our business this quarter that $750 and it hopefully gets to $800 and keeps growing is the beginning of, we think, a strong growth pattern with 13,000 sleeping rooms, the dominant retail position, the dominant entertainment position in Macao to fuel more growth in all segments. And we just started our work in junkets, it's just beginning. And we're at the early phases of adding more rooms and make the rooms nicer and more acceptable to our customers. So we are very bullish on our growth. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Rob. And just a follow-up on the VIP segment. Do you think you're growing that segment or do you think it's more just a share shift? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, that's \u2013 I think we're growing that segment. I think when you see the kind of growth, we get the majority. Obviously, our business coming out of Cotai about 93% but you're running $18 billion portfolio wide and you're seeing, like Venetian by 44% growth, you're seeing The Plaza growing, you're seeing The Parisian. The Parisian is just handicapped by \u2013 these are better room product, it's going to get it, but even that product is growing. I think we're \u2013 I believe we are growing but that's hard to say adjusting everyone else's numbers but I feel that our products are getting better and our competitive position is getting stronger. And, again, I think our junket partners recognizing that, too. So \u2013 and don't forget we have a strong premium mass, premium direct business as well as the junket rolling, so we kind of hit them on two fronts. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anil Daswani from Citigroup. Your line is open. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Good afternoon, guys. My question is also along the lines of The Parisian. You mentioned in your remarks earlier that you're getting 4x the return from these new suites at The Parisian. Again, given the markets being driven by premium mass, would you consider doing even more conversions to these premium mass friendly rooms, whether it be at The Parisian or even at some of the other properties in The Londoner going forward? That's my first question. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It's a really good question, a very fair question. The answer is, I would certainly talk to Mr. Adelson and our Board about that because if we can deliver our current returns we're seeing on the first hundred or so suites converted, why wouldn't you? I mean, the truth is, we've learned in Macao \u2013 a room \u2013 all rooms are not created equal. A better room product definitely speaks to the segments you want to speak to. So if we can get ourselves up to a couple of $3,000 a day versus $500, $600, why wouldn't you convert, and that's a good question and the answer is sure, why wouldn't you. We're here to make money and get margin and grow our business beyond $3 billion. And the way to get there is intelligent CapEx. We've demonstrated you our willingness. Our Board and Mr. Adelson have shown willing to write checks to improve our products. The Parisian opened up and it's a good hotel. It just has more premium mass demand and we have rooms to give it. So we got the 300 or 400 suites and that thing grows to $500-some-million-dollars and $600 million, gee, I would think we definitely think about more conversions, of course. But one thing I would mention to think about... Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: And my follow-up is, could you tell us a little bit about the opportunity to expand your room product in Singapore, because obviously that has been what's hurting the growth over there? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I'm sorry I missed that, Anil. I just want to say one thing just follow up on that, the one thing you should think about with The Parisian is it's going to benefit by its proximity to the conversion of the Four Seasons products going forward when we finish those 300 suites. So you can walk out of that Four Seasons product into The Four Seasons or The Plaza or you can walk into The Parisian, it may be that between the 300 there and the 350 at Parisian, we may have enough. But just to make that clear. Your second question was about MBS? Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Yes. So at MBS, is there an opportunity to get more room product now that the moratorium is up in Singapore? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We can't, at this point, comment on that about, if it's an opportunity now. We like to believe there is at some point but we can't discuss that today. Clearly, we have maxed out the occupancy from a cash and comp demand. And, clearly, at $4.8 million a day, we have tremendous demand for that product, but it's not worth discussing at this point today. That's also true in a gaming capacity issue as well but nothing to discuss at this time. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Did you have another question? Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Operator, let's take one more question. Operator : We have a question comes the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hello? Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Hello, anyone there? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Operator...? Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Okay. So apparently, we don't have any more questions. We appreciate your time today. Thanks for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another great quarter. Hold-normalized adjusted EBITDA reached $1.27 billion, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Our Macao Operations once again performed exceptionally well with hold-normalized adjusted EBITDA growing by 18% to $754 million. We experienced strong growth in both the VIP and mass gaming table segments enabling us to again outperform in the Macao market, while growing our market share of revenues. We also achieved record hotel occupancy of 96% at our Macao portfolio, all the properties at 96%. Our hold-normalized EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points to reach 35% for the quarter. The Venetian Macao continues to be the iconic must-see destination for every segment of visitor to Macao. Gaming and non-gaming revenues both grew in excess of 20%, while adjusted EBITDA was up by 30%. The strong financial performance of The Venetian contributes to our unwavering confidence in the future of Macao, which will continue to benefit from enhanced transportation infrastructure and investments in the Greater Bay Area. We are steadfast in our conviction that Macao will realize its vision and evolve into Asia's greatest leisure and business-touring destination. Given our confidence in Macao's future, we have elected to meaningfully increase our planned investments in the Macao market. We will increase the breadth and scale of our offerings to the Londoner, Four Seasons Tower Suites and St. Regis Tower Suites. We will also expand our entertainment, convention, and non-gaming attraction across our Cotai Strip portfolio. These important projects will come online in phases throughout 2020 and 2021. We believe these increased investments will allow us to generate strong returns on invested capital and visit, while helping to contribute to Macao's economic and development objectives of diversification, economic growth and leadership in MICE and entertainment. Now, I'll move on to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We've continued to generate stable cash flow in Marina Bay Sands with EBITDA of $419 million for the third quarter, both our hotel and our overall non-gaming revenues increased by more than 12% over the prior year. Our retail mall sales per square foot increased by 22% over the last 12 months. Marina Bay Sands continues to serve as the powerful reference site for emerging jurisdictions that are considering large-scale Integrated Resort developments. With the successful passage of the IR Implementation Bill in Japan earlier this year, we are continuing to pursue what would be a unique opportunity. Now, let's move on to my favorite subject, the return of capital to shareholders. Yay, return of capital. The Las Vegas Sands' Board of Directors has increased the recurring dividend for the 2019 calendar year to $3.08 per share or $0.77 per quarter. That marks the seventh consecutive year we have increased our recurring dividend. We also returned $300 million of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases during the quarter. In conclusion, our cash flow generation continues to be strong and predictable. We are increasing the scale and breadth of our investments in Macao because we have a long-term and unwavering commitment to Macao and complete confidence in Macao's future as Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. We look to the future with unwavering confidence. We have a strong organic growth outlook. We are strategically reinvesting in our existing assets, while also pursuing new development opportunities, and we have both the intent and the financial strength to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. With that having been said, I want to thank you for joining us on the call today. Now, we'll be happy to take some questions. Operator : First question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks so much and good afternoon. Sheldon, I do want to touch on the expansion of your CapEx program in a moment, but I did want to start with a different topic because investors have been focused on mainly two things over the past few months. First, there's been concern that the trade war-related slowing Chinese economy is going to affect demand in Macao and then also the political tensions between the U.S. and China increases the risk that the U.S. concession holders have when their concessions come up for rebid. So, we've been having those conversations a lot with folks. So I was wondering if you or Rob can address both of those. So, and Rob particularly on the demand side, what are you hearing when you talk to your customers? And I'm most curious, if you can segment that out by VIP and mass, because is the mass player somehow more insulated from the economic ebbs and flows? And then regarding the concessions, what can you say to alleviate investor concerns? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. As you know, we've been in Macao since 2004, been there 14 years. We've invested $13 billion, and we've seen it all over the years. We've seen these restrictions, union pay issues, junket difficulties, border restrictions, the Great Recession. And we are in 2018 and we're probably going to deliver over $3 billion of EBITDA. And we keep growing. We keep reinvesting. We have a highly diversified business which is number one in virtually every segment there is from EBITDA to mass revenue, to premium mass revenue to slots, hotels. Our business is stable and strong. And we always believed and we still believe there'll never be another market as powerful as Macao. I think Sheldon referenced in the call, we're going to spend $2 billion in the next couple years. If there is not a vote of confidence than that, I don't know what that is. I was simply telling you that we believe strongly today, we believe strongly tomorrow, we believe our concession renewal is not at risk. And more importantly, these third quarter numbers, if you earn $3 billion in the current run rate, our business looks very good over there. In fact if anything, the growth in The Venetian, year-on-year, Q-on-Q, the growth on our base mass business has soared. Our retail business has never been stronger. It's incredible what we are doing. It's the highest sales per square foot we ever had and we're about $2.7 billion. I just don't know what else we can do. We run our business properly and we're doing that. We're doing it very, very well. And these numbers are indicative of a very strong business that's diversified. It's a very large footprint. And so, we talk about concessions and what we are expecting. All we can do is, what we're told and addressed by the government of Macao. They have asked us over the years to invest heavily in non-gaming assets. Well, we built 13,000 sleeping rooms. We built over 2 million square feet of retail mall. We built millions of square foot of MICE space. We basically we built an arena when people thought that was a crazy idea. I just don't know what else you can do, but do what you're told to do, and we have done that. We're big fans of China. We're big fans of Macao. We've been wildly successful and our $2 billion statement that Sheldon made in the call to bring Londoner to fruition and the Four Seasons and the St. Regis is proof positive. Actions speak louder than words. Those are our actions and that's what we're doing right now today in the third quarter of 2018. If that's not a firm belief how we feel, I just don't know what else is. And our business, despite the stock market, our business sales are very good over there. We're growing in every segment including the junket segment. So, I don't have a crystal ball nor does anyone else I know, but we feel very bullish on the market and we feel very bullish about our license renewal. And we understand there's a trade war and there's issues going on, but over the years we've seen all of that. We've seen, God, in 14 years what we haven't seen. I don't know what else they can throw at us. Yet, we're resilient. We're strong. We're making lots of money and we're investing in our firm belief that we'll be there today, tomorrow and many years to come. And we're very privileged to be in Macao and we're very excited about the future. That's why we're building Londoner and Four Seasons and St. Regis. That's the best I can do in answering that question. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No, that's helpful. And actually that's a good segue to my \u2013 sorry? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: This is Sheldon. Would you mind repeating? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I will repeat but I would bore this group. But all kidding aside, we spent some time preparing for this call and the more I look at our actions, I don't know what else we can do and our business today is just exciting. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We spent US$13 billion or US$14 billion and that's for new construction, never mind the cost of maintenance CapEx, never mind all of the non-gaming assets that we've installed and continue to deploy. Never mind the, what do you call it, the arena. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yes. The arena, the MICE, the hotel. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We might build another arena. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We love to build more. Sheldon has authorized us to keep going. Yeah. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We're putting aside some land that we're going to put aside for placement of a wave pool, but now, somebody else has got a wave pool. It's not that unique anymore, so I think we can afford to use our land for that. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I also think you should look at Macao. We came there in 2004. The market in 2005 was about US$5 billion. This year it will approach US$38 billion. Mass market in 2010 was $6.7 billion, it's $20 billion. You have to invest long term. You can't let the cycles bother you or frankly stock market prices bother you. You've got to stay committed. You've got to hire great people to do great things. We have done that. And you got to follow the advices of the government and we do that. We just are very, very positive about this. And again, I think the $2 billion-plus investment we're making for the years ahead reflect that sincerity and that belief. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. And that is a segue just to my next question, which is a little bit of a housekeeping one. Of the announcement that you made today in terms of expanding these projects, if we spread the numbers correctly, which we did very fast, so we could have made a mistake. But it looks like from what you announced previously, there's slightly under a $500 million increase and then there's some additional projects which are now a little over $500 million. So just maybe you can just touch briefly upon the new stuff that you are adding and why? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think I'll take that as well. We are spending more money and it's based on two different reasons. Number one, we see growth in Macao in all segments. We see our hotel rooms are knocking out numbers we never anticipated. We think there's a demand in that market from all kinds of different things including quality hotel rooms. The Four Seasons will benefit dramatically by having a 300-suite facility that plays right to premium mass and to junket. We're going to give that property that additional space. We've upgraded our game there. We're building better suites. We're building better lobbies. We're basically trying to compete in a very, very good market. Ritz-Carlton is extraordinary product. The Wynn product is very good. Our Venetian product is very good. We weren't happy with the level of finish. We upped our game. We're glad we did it. We're adding gaming space in that building. That same thought process applies to St. Regis. We weren't happy with the quality. We went back and said, look at the competition, not just in Macao, but regionally. To keep growing, our goal is to go beyond $3 billion, beyond $3.5 billion to $4 billion in years ahead. To get there, we need great product for premium mass and for the junket business. The Londoner might be the greatest opportunity we could have. Macao simply is the best market in the world bar none. And SCC simply trailed The Venetian in virtually every segment and yet it's perfectly located. Now, it's got a neighborhood with Wynn and MGM; has 6,000 rooms. It should compete neck and neck like The Venetian. The Venetian is the $1.4 billion \u2013 probably going $1.5 billion, maybe $1.6 billion building. There's no reason why the SCC with double the rooms and the kind of \u2013 with our new Apple Store opened up, our new retail segments coming on line, there's no reason why we can't grow our EBITDA dramatically. We took our case to Sheldon and the board and they said we believe in this project. We want to be very well done and execution of these flawless. So our goal is yes, we're spending over $1 billion at Londoner, but I believe the returns will be far outsized any other investment in the globe we can make today. So, this is a dedication to quality, a dedication to diversification, a dedication to Macao and making sure that our footprint remains the biggest and the best in that market to maximize our growth. We are growing in every segment, every day and we are going to keep growing. And this is a commitment to that quality and to that growth. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: You would think that our competitors would see what it is we're doing and trying to compete with us. Right now they can't because they don't have the land to implement the changes that we've made. We started out with a complete unequivocal Integrated Resort model and that's what we did. We stuck with it. Every one of our properties is an Integrated Resort model and people, we used up all the land. Now, we even used up more land than what was allocated to us. And our competitors in Macao don't seem to understand that. But I don't want to convince them all to do exactly what we're doing as this is sort of counterproductive. However, it should be pretty obvious that if we've been doing it in the past year after year after year since 1988. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: But Macao 2004. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Macao 2004? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah, right. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: But I mean we've been building up the staff. We've been building up the business model. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yes, we have. Yes. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: And it works. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: It sure does. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Year over year. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I know the numbers in the stock market don't reflect it. We look at this quarter, there's growth in virtually every segment of our business, especially base mass growing to over $700 million with ridiculous margins in our retail business. If that doesn't tell you something good is happening in Macao, our sales per square foot are spiking double digit in every category. I don't know, it's hard to explain the disconnect between what's happening in the stock market with our business in Macao, but we remain very committed to what our business is producing and growing it. So, we want to grow to $800 million and beyond per quarter, $900 million and beyond. We're dedicated to doing that and these investments are simply reflections of that commitment and that belief in Macao. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you. I guess two follow-ups to Felicia's questions. You mentioned having conversations with the government in Macao. I guess has there been any color on what the concession renewal process may look like? And then given your confidence in the forward trajectory, what is the tolerance to consider accelerating return of capital even beyond what you've done and or taking other strategic actions if the stock stays under pressure? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Stephen, it's Rob. We have never had any real conversations with the government in terms of what the concession looks like. There's been a lot of chatter out there and we listen to the chatter like you do. And we're staying firm in our commitment that we're doing all the right things, which is what Sheldon referenced in terms of non-gaming core assets. When you look at what we've done in that area, it's larger than all of our competitors together. No one is even close to what we've done. I guess I take solace in the fact that we've done everything since 2004 to the current, every yesterday in our board meetings, when we talked to the board of approving another $2 billion. No one flinched. No one even thought twice. In fact most of that commitment is non-gaming. It's really a focus on more hotel, more quality. So, we can't tell you what the government's thinking is vis-\u00e0-vis re-license your bid process how it happens. We just remain confident that we've done all the right things we can do and we remain confident Macao will make the right decisions as it relates to our licenses on a go-forward basis. We're looking beyond 2022. We are very confident, very comfortable. I'll turn to Patrick on the issue of reinvestment and buybacks. Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We've been very focused on the return of capital and capital allocation, something the board focuses on every quarter. Our Chairman is very focused on and the management team is very focused on. As you can see this quarter, we saw significant value in the equity. And as we described when we raised the $1.350 billion at the U.S. Restricted Group level, we would deploy that capital or certain capital to shareholders and we've done that. And so our intent is to continue to be aggressive in the market as we look to grow our cash flows and as we can return capital in a favorable way. So you saw the increase in the dividend. Our board has been very good about that, raising dividend each year for the last seven years, in order to focus on the cornerstone of our return of capital program which is a dividend. We feel very strongly about that and its long-term nature. And at the same time as we have the opportunities to use our balance sheet, as we have opportunities to use cash flow generated from the business as Macao grows, as other components of the business grow, we'll be more aggressive and look to the equity markets to return capital markets \u2013 to return capital that way. So you saw the result this quarter. We returned $300 million through share repurchases and we'll look to be aggressive again in the future as we have the opportunity to do so. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And I guess the very quick follow-up on that. What's the upper bound on your leverage ratio kind of ex any major construction projects, let's say in Japan? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think, we're going to be consistent with what we said both the agencies and what the Chairman has communicated previously between two and three times. We're very focused on maintaining our investment-grade rating. We think that provides a long-term competitive advantage, gives us very strong access to the capital markets and it's worked very well for us as you can see in the completion of the SCL offering. So from our standpoint we think we have a very strong balance sheet. It gives us a very strong competitive position, allows flexibility for new growth development, as well as to return capital. You saw in the last quarter when we raised the money at the U.S. level and we're buying back stock now. So I don't think leverage is going to go above what the Chairman said, but obviously we need to leverage a little bit as our EBITDA grows. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. So when you look at your Macao business, you'll see on slide 11, so the premium mass revenue growth is slowing, while the base mass business is accelerating. Does that feel like how the market feels? And then how do you adjust your strategy to adjust for kind of the current market environment? Thanks. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Right. So, I think we're \u2013 two thoughts here. One is we're unique and we show you the base mass business is growing materially. And I think that performance makes us feel very that we're doing the right things vis-\u00e0-vis base mass. We have on the other hand, I think we've seen \u2013 I wouldn't call it slowing, as much as flattening out. The deceleration is obvious in our premium mass business the last three quarters. But I think you've to realize we grew from our premium mass base back in Q3 of 2017 was $499 million. We're now running at $616 million. I guess all trees don't grow to the sky every day. There's got to be some adjustments. So we grew from basically $500 million up to $616 million in one year. You're correct as you note that the decelerating in the premium mass. However, we have, again our diversification, our portfolio enables us to be in a different business here as well. So look at our base mass on the slide, I think, it's 11, growing to $705 million. And again, our margins there are spectacular. So not to make short shrift of the premium mass business, it appears to be flattening out a bit albeit one year year-on-year looks terrific. Q-on-Q doesn't look so terrific sequentially. But I think that business will keep growing. That's why we're investing in quality product suites. I also believe that business will grow as our junket business gets stronger because there's a relationship there. And lastly, I feel very bullish about our base mass business. It just keeps getting better and better. And to be blunt about it, that's our sandbox. No one else plays in it. No one else has the room capacity, the gaming capacity, the retail capacity to compete for that base mass high-margin business that's fueled a lot of this quarter's success. This quarter at $754 million, even if you lost a pivotal weekend, which could be worth, I don't know, $15 million, I don't know what the number would be, but clearly lost EBITDA indicates how powerful our business is. Others have to stay constrained to premium mass and junket. We play in a lot of different places. We play in retail, base mass, and so we \u2013 and we grow in junket. So while we recognize the deceleration last few quarters, we also note the year-on-year growth and we note the base mass acceleration. If that can keep growing, that's a pretty good place to be. So, no refuting the comment, but our diversification kind of pushes back on that issue. And honestly deep down we believe base mass and premium mass will keep growing in Macao. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Rob. And then just a quick follow-up. Are you willing to talk at all about how October Golden Week went? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No, we don't talk about current quarter. We'll talk to you in three months. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, that was worth a try. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Good try, and we respect that effort. What's next? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anil Daswani from Citigroup. Sir, your line is now open. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus a little bit on VIP. Given the softness that we're seeing in the VIP market, you guys have been very aggressive in expanding and probably have some of the nicest new VIP facilities that we've seen across at The Venetian. Do you see yourselves taking share in this business from the other operators or growing the market in VIP is my sort of first question. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: That's a very good question. I don't want to address it. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Just one from each caller. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Well, Sheldon. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: (26:23) That ends up with a net sheer increase. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We'd like to think we're growing the market, but let's be blunt. We don't have a crystal ball into other people's numbers yet. I would say this though very bluntly, we have always been the market leaders in premium mass, base mass, slots, ETG, EBITDA. We run the table here in terms of leadership and yet our junket business has been really subpar and at times very disappointing. We've committed ourselves to spending capital to fix those rooms you addressed. We're very proud of where we're going. These rooms when they get done, and they keep happening, are going to be spectacular. We're adding more junket rooms. We're adding more junket tables. We're dedicating more suites to the junket base. So while we've looked good on 24% year-on-year growth and 15% sequentially, the truth is we were going from a very low base. There's a lot more running room in this company to do a lot better in junkets. We like the junket business. We like our junket partners and we've woken up to the fact that we've left a lot on the table in years past. So I can't speak to whether we grow the market or steal share. I hope it's a little of both, and I hope it's a lot more growth in the market, but there's a junket business out there. We're seeing it this quarter. We're seeing it in the future. But keep in mind our base in this area is not all that high, so the growth numbers maybe look a little larger than they should be. But again, we're committed to this segment and growing in it. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thank you. As my follow-up, just a quick one on The Parisian. Obviously, The Venetian has done incredibly well with EBITDA of over 30%. What happened at The Parisian that's sort of dragging the performance there a little bit compared to its peers? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, one thing we should be blunt about year-on-year is, we had an incredible amount of very concentrated high-end play at The Venetian in the premium direct business. And to be very honest and complete transparency, we ran into some extraordinary business last year that lifted The Parisian numbers, it shouldn't have been at. And I think that's part of the story. The other part of the story is, as a year-on-year that growing business looks like it's slowed down terrifically, it hasn't. But the other thing about the \u2013 you should know about The Parisian is that all the rooms, the conversions we referenced in the past are now coming online and that is the big driver in The Parisian's future success. We've going to have 300 totally renovated keys there. That I think will be very impactful as we go forward. And I think that's part of the story that we believe we can grow that. This is 20% inventory in terms of the premium suites. But we like The Parisian business. We underestimated the premium direct demand and the junket demand for it. So we really think there's brighter days ahead. We like to pass $500 million annualized and keep growing there. We missed it at the opening and we corrected that. So all segments are starting to come in the right direction. Again, the only miss there was the premium direct year-on-year is somewhat last year's performance was not sustainable and pretty amazing due to very few players. Anil J. Daswani - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd.: Thanks for taking my questions. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, everybody. With respect to the increased investment in CapEx at Sands Cotai and the hotel tower suite at Sheraton and Four Seasons, do you anticipate any incremental renovation disruption as a consequence? I know in the past you said the initial investment there you thought you can manage around and doing it through seasonally slow period. Is there any change in your thoughts on that front? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. There's going to be disruption, Joe, I think at The Londoner, that we don't believe there'll very much disruption at all at the Four Seasons because it doesn't exist. It doesn't \u2013 it's not connected to existing building. So that's not an issue. We don't believe Four Seasons is impactful, nor St. Regis for the same reason it's not connected to a building. The Londoner will be a long project. It's a year and three quarters. So of course there's disruption and there's noise, etcetera. You can't avoid that and there's going to be a lot of construction. So we're not ready to qualify or quantify how we see that, but we acknowledge there'll be some disruption. But again, I think like all things in life in this if you do it properly the end result will be Londoner should rival The Venetian being an incredible product that can make a lot of money for us. Imagine having Venetian side by side with Londoner and creating that kind of EBITDA opportunity. So will there be disruption? Yes. How much? We have no idea and we have two properties that I think will not be that impactful. So I'd say, wait and see. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then my follow-up is with respect to your focus on the VIP segment in Macao, do you anticipate investing additional or injecting additional liquidity to the junkets? And then with respect to the 3Q results, I know you don't want to talk about October, but with respect to the 3Q results how much of the VIP rolling win was a function of your increasing more liquidity junkets? And are you getting more requests from junkets more recently? Patrick Dumont - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: So, we don't \u2013 hey, Joe, it's Patrick. How are you? We don't comment specifically about our credit to junkets, but I will tell you that we've been very consistent in the way that we work with them over the past couple of years and we don't see anything changing. So we provided them with significant opportunity to grow their businesses. We provided them with better space, as Rob referenced. And we feel very confident about our credit exposure there, as well as the fact that they have the liquidity they need from us in order to conduct operations successfully. So we're not going to really change anything that we're doing at this time. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I think, virtually every question is related to \u2013 mostly to Macao so far. So maybe just to switch gears for a little bit. Could you just give us maybe the latest high-level strategic update on what's going on in Japan? We see a lot of press reports, some renderings crossing different jurisdictions, but just maybe your latest thoughts on kind of how you see the process or any deadlines that are upcoming, playing out? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Shaun, I'll just open, then Sheldon will close on Japan, because he's been doing business there for a long time. We're in the hunt in Japan. We're trying to do our best. It's a long race. It sure isn't a sprint. We're there quite frequently and we're assessing the value of each of the potential cities and we've been on the ground there for a long time. We hope it materializes as it's been represented over the next year or two. It's obviously a fast-lane market and we're doing our best to get a license there. And that's all I'll say about that, because there isn't a whole lot more to talk about in Japan from my perspective. Sheldon? Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: We've been lobbying there for 10 years. My lobbying rises out of the fact that I have a previous business experience in Japan, particularly in the MICE business. I designed and helped to build, advised on the biggest MICE facility in Japan before the present site in Tokyo, the big site, was conceived. The site that I advised on was called the Makuhari Messe and they took that from \u2013 they took the word Messe from the German meaning of fairgrounds. So there's the Frankfurt Messe, and there's a Hamburg Messe, et cetera. It's \u2013 there is \u2013 everybody in the industry believes that if anybody is going to be selected there, it's going to be us. And we even have our competitors coming to us, and seeing whether or not we can share some opportunities. I'm not sure that we want to share them with our competitors. As we may \u2013 we may already been sharing with the nationals, with Japanese nationals. So, if we do that, I think, it's all set. Yes, we do have some partners that are recognized as good partners. We do have some expressions of interest from people that want to go in with us. And they all know that our background, particularly my background in the field of MICE is what is flowing grassroots. They're watering their grassroots, and I think that looks very good for us. And we'll see how it comes out. We all know that Japan is not known for working very fast. Then again, a lot of countries aren't. I hope they're working very fast. So, if we move along with them at their rate of speed, we will then have the opportunity to grow with them at their rate of speed. So, I think, what we ought to do is we ought to wait, there's a happening that will happen on next month on November something that will be the World Expo, and if the World Expo is awarded to Osaka that the federal government in Japan will provide the capital for infrastructure that is lacking in Osaka. So, if you look at all \u2013 if you add up all the pieces together, I think we look very good and I'd like to make a bet on it. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. And then maybe just as a follow-up and to switch gears again to kind of get your latest thoughts on Las Vegas. There's been a lot of concerns around the operating, and particularly the hotel pricing environment there. I think, your RevPAR was slightly negative, but it's also a very, I think, well-known \u2013 it was a tough convention quarter or event quarter in the market. So what's kind of the outlook that you're seeing in Vegas right now? That's it. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. I've heard some about that. Vegas had tough third quarter especially in the group and MICE segments, and we participate in that as you reference to RevPAR. Fourth quarter is better. It looks actually pretty good and we believe we'll go back to over 800,000 room nights dedicated to the convention space in 2019. There was a blip in the third quarter. From our perspective it was a blip. We don't have the scale like some people do as far as rooms, but pretty confident fourth quarter resurrects. And next year looks like a more typical 2019, solid MICE business, solid rooms business, so not much concern in Las Vegas. So, we're going to run $450 million of EBITDA, very comfortable with our business here. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Dan, can I make a quick note on one call. I'd like to jump in here. On one question that was asked about The Parisian, I failed to mention that we have 600 rooms out of commission this year for renovation. So, this quarter about 20%, 25% of our room inventory was off the market. And it certainly has an impact on our Parisian business, so just wanted to note that. I think, it was Anil Daswani who made the comment. So, I missed that and I apologize. Daniel J. Briggs - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Sir, your line is now open. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. It looks like from some of the detail in the slides with the budget for The Londoner, maybe almost doubled since you last put numbers out for it? Can you give a little bit of color on what that \u2013 that is just a pretty significant incremental spend? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Robin, it's just the same story we mentioned earlier. I think we looked, we jumped into The Londoner and it was so compelling to begin with when we first looked at it because look at what The Londoner does or the current SCC as opposed to The Venetian. It's somewhat confusing to see if the hotel makes about $700 million to $750 million, where Venetian is going to go double that. So, we started. We put a plan together. The more we delved into it, the more opportunity we saw to spend more money intelligently and create a product that could be with The Venetian. And our goal is to create book-ends. We want to see two buildings that throw off $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion side-by-side. We also love the geographic location with Wynn right behind us and MGM. And the more we got into it, the more we saw compelling opportunities to invest in things like from an entertainment perspective, enhanced room perspective. And we convinced ourselves that this is a great place to invest capital. It's really that simple. We saw and the board saw yesterday and Sheldon saw, when he first saw, the opportunity to make this product much, much stronger is there. 6,000 keys, centrally located, right across The Venetian in every category from retail, base mass, slot ETG, junket, premium mass, we can grow considerably. Our retail sales I think are 25%, 30%. We do it at The Venetian which is crazy. The Venetian is $220 million retail environment. And we're seeing crossing 60%, if that goes up 100%. That's pretty \u2013 that's a big consideration. Everybody likes that building as far as the rooms. They don't like the physical, the external and the casino is just somewhat confusing. It lacks an identity. The Londoner will give it a very clear identity. And we believe when it's done, it's going to be a force to be reckoned with and the same vein as The Venetian. So hence, we decided to invest more capital and everyone in this team from both an executive and board position has reviewed it and agreed with that. And that's the simple answer. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. No, I was looking for if there was some maybe a specific feature or something just with that budget increment, but it sounds like it's got a lot going. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: No. There is a lot. There is a St. Regis feature, there's an entertainment feature, there's a retail feature, there's incredible. There is some ceilings that are being raised. When we get done with that thing, I think the theming will be pretty extraordinary. And we're hoping the results, the comp and the EBITDA results will be extraordinary too. There's not one, there wasn't a problem; there was just the commitment to spend more capital and make the place much more impressive. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then if I could just follow-up on a topic that with in terms of VIP trends, maybe if you could just give us your take on what is it that maybe drove some of the more recent period to not look as strong and how do you \u2013 is that something that you \u2013 how do you feel about that as a kind of long term versus immediate term, when those trends might turn? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: When you say VIP, are you talking premium mass, you talking junket? How are you thinking about that? Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : I mean really VIP more than \u2013 not more than the premium mass business, which I realize is only 8% of your EBITDA in Macao, but just can you kind of see trends? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Yeah. Unfortunately there's only \u2013 well, we're a little different in that we did grow sequentially in year-on-year strongly. And so perhaps our visibility to VIP is a little different than others. We see growth in those segments, but we've been a laggard and we're replacing that approach with a much more aggressive one. And so we're seeing VIP trends continue to grow aggressively double-digit and we're thrilled about it. I can't speak to our competitors, but I think again our dedication in capital and suites and gaming capacity will fuel, we believe we have a lot of running room left in VIP, a lot of running room and not because we've \u2013 I think we've done so, had weak performance relative to the competition. So our hats off to competition, but we're enjoying the party and try to do a lot more business in that VIP segment. We see the benefit in that segment to us is both the profit we make, but also the residual effect, the spillover effect into premium mass and other categories. So I can't speak to the rest. We don't see problems in Macao for us. I can't speak to other companies, but for us VIP looks like a growth segment, a considerable growth segment and we dedicate the capital and the gaming space and the tables, and of course, the suites to accompany that. So we're growing our business aggressively in that segment. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Sure. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Rob, quickly. In terms of the bridge opening, I haven't heard you guys kind of discuss it much. But could you talk a little bit about maybe some of the benefits that you see coming from that besides the obvious. But levels of magnitude in terms of what you think that could potentially do, whether that help comes more on the VIP side, the mass side, premium mass side or mix? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: I think we all believe, I think I speak for the industry or maybe at least for this room, but we believe it's a mass phenomenon, it's going to drive a lot of mass. We also recognize it's not there yet since infancy, so the impact we shouldn't think about that for a bit. But I think it's unequivocal that the potential of that bridge to drive more people into Macao is terrific. And for us, has the biggest footprint, it's more terrific than others. So I think we're very excited about the bridge, it's an extraordinary architectural feat. I've been watching it for years and I'm always amazed by it. And to see it actually open is exciting. But it's early yet and the impact is negligible for this quarter and probably for the next year. It may kick in who knows if it's 18 months away or whatever it's going to be, until it really kicks in. But I think we all believe it's more of a mass-based phenomenon because it feeds our rooms, it feeds our retail, it feeds our base mass. And, again, for us base mass is a big business. I mean, with $700 million a quarter in tables, with $150 million in slots and growing. So we would like to see it grow our base mass into a $1 billion plus a quarter. That bridge is going to be the catalyst to get us there. We are huge fans of it and we can't wait to see it ramp up. But that's not happening today. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. With respect to Marina Bay Sands, obviously first quarter, tremendous margins; the last two quarters, margins under pressure a little bit. I know you guys obviously have lapped some of the commission stuff that you did on the VIP side. But is there anything else that's kind of influencing the margins there, or is that just really boiling down more to business mix on a quarter-by-quarter basis? Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Business mix is always important at MBS, but I got to take a moment and just say that we \u2013 I think it's a misunderstood product and there's our profit drivers there. Our first driver there is as you know is base mass. And that's premium mass, slot ETG. It runs 60%-plus quarter-after-quarter. We wish we could make more money, but we're capacity constrained unfortunately. But that is the number one, it's $1 billion of contribution plus. And so that's the number one thing. The other business which drives like crazy is hotel, food and beverage which runs consistently $95 million with again extraordinarily good margins. Our retail business which is $160 million, $170 million, again, the retail business is always a high margin business. The outlier is the VIP business. And what's ironic as they go back and do some work and what we're doing there as a team there has effectively grown the margins by double from a 15%, 16% business to a 30%-plus business. The struggle there is growing the top line. And so, as you know, we've struggled there, and we're going to keep struggling. It's not a growth business in terms of the rolling business. But I guess we're proud of Macao, we're got the margins that roughly, we think they're exceptional, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion $1.7 property is hard to find, not many others around. So we're thrilled with that business. We wish to get more ability to grow it. And we wish but we can't raise rates a whole lot more. We can't \u2013 when we're winning the slots, something like normal slots are up to $800 a unit, I just don't know anything else we can do at Marina Bay Sands, but we'll take $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion. As Sheldon says, it's a living. So we're trying. But I think our mix is, knowing that those four segments that is vulnerable to margin pressure is the rolling piece. We're consistent every other business from retail, hotel rooms, food and beverage and base mass and rolling. So, great business, we just need to get more capacity. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Sheldon G. Adelson - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Just like the joke, right? Two guys are on a rowboat, somebody falls out and the other guy yells out, Joe, where are you, where are you? I can't see him in the dark. He said, I'm here, I'm here. He said, are you okay? He says, yeah, I make a living. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Well, it's like that. Yeah, we're thrilled with MBS but it is what it is. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Robert G. Goldstein - Las Vegas Sands Corp.: Thank you, appreciate it. Operator : And that concludes our conference call.

Finally, for those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone an opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sheldon is not joining us in the call today. He's a little bit under the weather. We met with him yesterday. He's taking some medications making him a bit drowsy, so we decided this morning take a rain check on this one. He looks forward to speaking with all of you on upcoming calls. He did, however, have a message for everyone. That's great quarter, yay buybacks and yay dividends. Well, let's go to our financial results. We had a very good quarter. In Macao, our adjusted EBITDA was $786 million. We achieved record mass revenues. We increased our market share of revenue in our most important market. Our growth in Macao is coming from every gaming and non-gaming segment. Margins in every segment in Macao are stable or growing during the quarter, with the exception of our rolling premium direct business where our low hold negatively impact our EBITDA. The strong top line growth in our rolling business of 34.6% over the quarter will positive contribute to our bottom line as hold normalized in that segment. In 2018, our Macao operations delivered an adjusted property EBITDA of over US$3 billion, an 18% increase over 2017. Overall, Macao market showed strength in 2018, growing GGR by 14% year-on-year. Our Macao properties generated 17% growth in GGR over that same period. It is clear, the Macao market's evolving in Sheldon's vision more than a decade ago to create the critical mass of our hotel, retail, entertainment and MICE offerings, positions us perfectly for future growth. The opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge is a major milestone that will help Macao grow towards the MICE business in the years ahead, an Engineering feat of unprecedented scale and creates a direct connection between the Hong Kong airport, one of the largest and most important transportation hubs in all of Asia in Macao. We couldn't be more excited about our plan $22 billion investment in our critical mass, hotel room, retail, entertainment offerings in Macao. We look forward to participating in the benefit and the growing infrastructure in Macao that will continue to increase leisure and business tourism visitation from China. Looking ahead, we believe that there's no better market in the world than Macao with regard to continued deployment of our capital. Look forward to making additional investments in Macao as we contribute to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Let's turn to Singapore, we enjoyed a very strong cash flow, however, VIP volumes and hold were lower this year. We still remain capacity constrained in Marina Bay Sands and hope that the opportunity in the future to make additional investments in Singapore as that's a very strong market, which simply runs our rooms and gaming capacity there. Las Vegas also a good quarter led by strong convention exhibition business. Before to adding additional incremental entertainment offerings in Las Vegas and the positive impact of the MSG steer at the niche which is under construction as opposed to open in 2021. Finally, we turn to the increase of capital to shareholders. We raised the annual dividend for the 2019 calendar year. We repurchased $430 million of stock during the quarter. We see meaningful long-term value in the LVS and SCL equity. We thank you for joining us on the call and let's now take the questions Operator? Operator : Yes sir. Daniel Briggs : Let's begin the Q&A session. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Mr. David Katz of Jefferies. Rob Goldstein : Okay. David. David Katz : Hi, afternoon. And it is a nice quarter. I wanted to just touch on Singapore if I may, which candidly came in a bit below what we were forecasting. If you could just talk about the different forces on the plus and minus side, I heard your commentary about it being capacity constrained. But just talk about the core a little bit and what's -- what went well and what's maybe challenging you or creating opportunities? Rob Goldstein : Sure. First let's begin by recognizing this is an iconic destination. This made off a lot of company for this company. We're really proud definition of an IR It's exemplary in every way. Its biggest challenge, David, by far, is its capacity constrained both from a lodging, from a gaming perspective. We just don't have enough slot machines, ETGs, rooms. We have demand. We don't have the supply. We'd also look to see more entertainment in the region in Singapore to drive a more premium mass play. We have alluded to in the past and continue to reference the frustration and there's a money movement into Singapore is very difficult. Our rolling business there has been limited for a number of years now. The growth that remains in primarily foreign tourism into the market for the premium mass segment. And again we just can't create more rooms right now and more gaming when we can. So, that's the frustration. We played a little bit unlucky here in there in every quarter -- but the margins remain strong. The primary difficult market is capacity constrained. Very proud of the asset. Looking for the chance to invest more in Singapore and grow margin lodging and gaming perhaps in the future, but that's the long and short of it, I could -- I can't tell you how frustrating it is that it's such a wonderful asset that could grow, but right now is not able to. David Katz : Thank you. And my one follow-up is a Macao-related if I may. For sure we would all likely agree that the long-term outlook there for that market is quite positive. But just thinking about say the remainder of the year and what we would call -- we don't ask about a quarter, but we can ask about the recall of the medium-term. There are certainly a lot of inputs that we're trying to process whether those are macroeconomic or company-specific et cetera. Help us think through what the rest of the year looks like or what inputs we should be contemplating as we model for the rest of the year for LVS in Macao specifically? Rob Goldstein : I think you look \u2013 I think the best way to look forward in Macao is look backward. 2017 \u2013 actually let's just go back to 2016, we were hovering around $2.3 billion or $2.4 billion of EBITDA. I think Wynn was opening. We were opening Parisian as \u2013 the Studio City probably opened up, MGM was the horizon. A lot of people thought Macao has seen it\u2019s best days and we will be share givers and the market would just dissolve into its competition. We fast forward; we've now grown to $3 billion EBITDA a few years later. We've been share takers in virtually every segment, in fact in every segment. It's a very simple market to understand. It's a mass \u2013 premium mass market driven by scale. The VIP segment will continue to be challenging I believe. The mass and premium mass will be the driver. I was there last week walked all the gaming floors, drove the bridge back and forth to Hong Kong. It's an extraordinary place and it's an extraordinary market. It's just starting to touch its potential. To think about this for a week or for a month or for this issue, that issue will probably drive me crazy, but if you think about it in the big picture, we grow our EBITDA back to almost the highest level ever despite its huge decline in VIP since 2014. I think we've done there, which is build scale. We're building more rooms today. We'll were building more retail today. We're building more everything today. I believe that that market will continue to grow. I think the best way to look at our enthusiasm and our focus is our activities. We\u2019re underway with Londoner, the St. Regis, the Four Seasons. We're a strong, strong believers in Macao, and we're investing for long-term. Yes, there's always -- it's a smoking issue today or a blip in the economy. There's always something to worry about. We get that. But look at this magnificent market in the last three years what's done. It's absorbed all kinds of capacity and still grown. We're just very bullish and we are blinded by the extreme size of Macao in terms of the market today, but more important tomorrow. And look at the rest of the rim, look what the bridge has done, the bridge is a game changer. It's a magnificent achievement that accesses all China. All the airports in China can now land in Hong Kong and get to Macao in a car. The boat is not necessary. If you want to take a boat you can. Even from Central Hong Kong it's almost as quick just to take a car to the new bridge. The new bridge is incredible chilling. It also opens up the rim. So we're long-term thinkers. We're long-term believers. We don't think there's a market like it in the world anywhere as better place to deploy capital. We're fervent believers on license in 2000, whatever it is 2021, 2022. So I think your best from my perspective, look at this the mass scale market that's room dependent. Those without rooms will have a difficult time growing their share. Mass demands rooms. Non-Guangdong visitation demand rooms. This is a very special place. It's very unique and we are delighted to be there and investing today. And so that's the best answer I can give you. If you worry about this Tuesday or next Friday, you'll probably have some sleepless nights. If you think about long-term, you're going to sleep very well and be very well rewarded. Patrick Dumont : There's been a lot of commentary about the upcoming year. And I think one of the thing you should look at and we spend a lot of time on this in the earnings is that trying to display it different ways, the infrastructure of investment to Rob's point going into the area that allows for the bridge to be effective, it allows for tourists from deeper into Mainland China to actually access Macao and access the growing tourism and any infrastructure that's there is only improving And as you look -- we have Page 15 in the slide deck that shows the amount of growing visitation from China into Macao. And you'll notice that the rate of growth is accelerating. And so, if you think about the upcoming year and the upcoming several years what you'll see is that the infrastructure improvements will allow tourists to take advantage of Macao and grow the mass business, right? And growth is very solid high-margin mass business as they look to use the non-gaming amenities that are turbine designed a decade ago. And you think about that amazing press vision where he laid out a plan for this non-gaming amenity system that really creates this tourism drive and that really speaks directly to the mass business. So if you look at the infrastructure improvement, again it's in the earnings deck and go through those slide we view the mass business as a very strong catalyst for growth for the company for this year for the years to come. And there's been indications of that in the past and we see a very bright future for that segment because of the infrastructure because of the nature of the business and because of the tourism desirability of the assets that we and others have built in Macao. Rob Goldstein : One of the ironies of the market for me is that, couple of years ago I was concerned too many rooms being built and today everybody wants more rooms desperately. And the fact is it runs incredible occupancy. Demand is there. Demand will keep growing. David Katz : Got it. Thank you for your answer. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Good after. Hi, how is it going? So just quick numbers question. You said in Macao your rolling direct business had low hold and that impacted to EBITDA, could you quantify that? Patrick Dumont : No. We're not going to address it specifically. I don't -- I think we've put out enough information about the business to throw a number out there. We just add to the quarter. I think from our standpoint and Rob will address this further. We have a different margin structure within the premium direct and chunk of businesses. And sometimes based on the nature of the hold and the difference in hold between those two businesses, our normalization on an active basis doesn't need to happen, but it actually needs to happen on an individual basis. We had this happen a couple of quarters ago. And so from a margin basis because of the nature of that structure it impacts the aggregate margins of the business. That being said, our mass margins are as strong as ever, right? And so I think when you look at the structure of the business, the cost structure of the business, the cost control that we put in place, our ability to get some operating leverage of business that will continue. I think in this particular instance because of the adjustment methodology and the overall aggregate amount of rolling vine that we had you see some margin change because of that mix. Rob Goldstein : Tom as we held within normal range across rolling segment for the quarter for the company in the portfolio, but the mix was not in our favor. As you know we have a very strong rolling direct business which held under the expected range. And this segment is much more favorable in terms of margin to us. We did hold above the range for the rolling junket business, but conversely we have a much lower margin in that segment. So in summary we definitely left some money in the table this quarter it -- significant dollars because we had hold within the range of the direct business. It's a shame, it was in the flip side, it would have been quite a quarter, but it wasn't. The volumes are there. We keep taking share. We keep growing our rolling business. People for years -- we are ill-equipped to compete in that segment, we just keep growing share. It's really it's sad because we had a amazing quarter had we held up, it didn't. But our focus can't be on the rolling and appoint it to a luck it has to be on the mass side and that's where you sell and grow and I think that's where the story resides for us. A quarter here, quarter there, a point of luck to point it to a luck is an insolence. It's long-term, it's about the right assets for the mass premium mass and the growth there is extraordinary. Thomas Allen : So, that's a perfect segue into my next question. So page 14 on the base mass. That's the premium mass performance. Obviously looking at year-over-year, looks like base mass is outperforming premium mass, but then quarter-over-quarter you saw some weakness in premium mass in the third quarter and then that bounced back in the forth. Can you just talk about underlining trends for those two markets? Which one do you think is going to be stronger in the future? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Well, it's a good question. I wish I knew the answer to that, but we'll tell you both are awfully good. We had very strong fourth quarter. We achieved record non-rolling drop in Wynn, 13% growth in premium mass Q-on-Q despite a lot of new competition I was in New Morpheus last week, which is quite a property, impressive hotel. Macao by the way just gets to be more and more impressive if you go back to the world-class product. We're looking forward to showing you our new Four Seasons product, which is going to be pretty special. We don\u2019t know exactly what the market grew at in Q4 until all the operators have reported. But we can say, we outgrew the market in non-rolling tables in the first nine months of 2018. We outgrew the market in full year 2017. So our outperformance in premium mass and mass is not about one quarter. Our outperformance has been achieved consistently, cumulatively for the past seven, eight quarters and we've achieved this despite having the biggest base of business and despite a very intense and very good quality of competition in Cotai. We couldn't be happy about our position in the market, but we don't stand still. We intend to get better because the competition there is just too damn good and the market opportunity is just too damn big and that's why we look forward to executing completing on the Londoner, the St. Regis, the Four Seasons. Our position has been simple for over a decade. We believe in the mass and premium mass. Our assets, our arena, our retail, lodging, our gaming is positioned to put us at the top of the heap and grow to $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion. We believe mass is a $30 billion business. I'm not capable of telling you what the breakout is the premium versus base. We'll take it all and we have the assets to take it all. And I think those who don't have rooms, those who talk about building rooms are going to struggle. Those who have rooms, especially great rooms like we're building are going to grow. And so I think this quarter, we have a few points below the growth maybe, but in the aggregate our numbers are pretty exemplary and we're delighted where we're heading. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mr. Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open sir. Stephen Grambling : Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, as a follow-up to the first couple of questions on Macao. On slide 19 you highlighted additional investment in VIP in 2019 as you seek to grow fast in the market. I guess, how do you think about that segment longer term? And I get the math component, but just thinking about drivers there and how you want to position? Rob Goldstein : It's a more challenged market and it's obvious you can read all the information out there. There's been crackdowns recently. There's all kinds of issues on the VIP. But \u2013 and I think we're more confident of the sustainable growth of the premium mass, mass short term, but I wouldn't rule out VIP. This has proven me very resilient over the years. We've really \u2013 I've made mistake of counting out a couple of times, but I\u2019ve been wrong. That market is going to bounce back. Again the penetration in Mainland isn't complete yet. This airport, I mean having driven to the bridge last week and going to the airport, it's just going to change the game for Macao. So this fiscal asset to drive more high end not just from China, but throughout the Pacific Rim into Macao was there. Macao is the world-class facility of Asia. There's just nothing like it. And honestly there's nothing \u2013 there will be no place like it. It's just too good, too far ahead of the competition. And so I think whatever VIP business is in Asia will continue to mostly go to Macao. We will participate. We've dedicated ourselves to better rooms, better suites, better gaming operations, better relationships as evidence on our numbers. I would not be comfortable, however, if you're solely dedicated VIP or if you -- income comes from VIP. I think you need diversification in the premium mass-mass to take advantage of this great market. We'll be there. We'll probably share takers in the near future again this quarter. We keep growing the VIP business, but I think it's more challenging in the short-term than the premium mass-mass. That's where the strength resides short-term and long-term. Again, I wouldn't count out VIPs. It's proven to be very resilient and again, market penetration both the non-Guangdong numbers indicate, there's a lot of potential out there in China and the Pacific Rim. If you haven't been there recently, if you've been to the bridge, the full impact and the full potential of the bridge is unrealized once they open that thing up totally functionally to let it do all it can do. It's a pretty -- its very impressive piece of work. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. And then maybe an unrelated follow-up turning to the U.S. I guess there's lots of the noise consolidation talk in the space, I guess, how do you think about M&A as part of your capital allocation framework versus reinvestment in Macao versus expansion in new markets? Rob Goldstein : So, it's interesting there's always a lot of speculation, particularly, in our industry about the opportunity for acquisition. I think if you look at the portfolio that Sheldon designed and built from the ground up, we believe we have the best assets in the business. And for us, we think investing in those assets are the best way to create long-term shareholder returns. And we've demonstrated that over the years. When our Chairman has a vision, it's been proven that it creates tremendous value for shareholders. And so we've invested in the properties that we have billions of dollars of additional CapEx in order to keep them fresh, keep them relevant including the junket opportunity prior question. And in our mind that's the best way for us to grow our business and enhance our return of capital as our cash flows grow. And for us, M&A is not really something that we would look to unless it was unbelievably compelling and we felt would simply augment the strategy and vision of the Chairman that we've set out on. And so from our standpoint, if you look at our balance sheet what are the strengths there, look at the way we handle our return of capital, the way we handle shareholder returns, we're very much geared towards our dividend which is the cornerstone of our return to capital policy, very much geared towards share repurchase. We bought $403 million this quarter because we have liquidity and we were confident in our future ability to grow cash flows. And really we've got our $22 billion program in Macao. So, when we look at those things and you look at the way we're allocating capital, I think we've made a pretty clear statement about how we feel about the business and about where we want opportunities to exist. We've never really bought anybody and so I don't see that changing unless the Chairman has a different view about the opportunities that an M&A transaction may provide. But from our standpoint, we've been pretty clear about our strategy, about his strategy and that's how we intend to execute. Stephen Grambling : Awesome. Yay dividends, yay buyback. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Next? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Anil Daswani from Citi. Sir, your line is now open. Anil Daswani : Hi, good morning guys. Rob Goldstein : Good morning Anil. Anil Daswani : Thank you. Just wanted to touch base on the premium mass standout performance that you guys had in the fourth quarter. How would you attribute that? Is that driven by the bridge? Is that driven by the new suite that product that you opened in the Parisian? Is that driven by higher spending? And consequently, how do you think the further improvement in infrastructure with both the opening of the LRT as well as the pension extension of the high-speed rail? Are those drivers as significant as you guys have mentioned do you think the bridge is? Rob Goldstein : A couple of things there. First of all, the bridge at this point, we don't think is that impactful. It's more of \u2013 having driven last week, it's unfortunately underutilized. There's not a private car licenses to maximize what's going to be a vast potential. It will be a driver in the future, it\u2019s not today. It's more about busting a daytrip, still taking out the tables the driver. What's driving our premium mass business is better product. We have a real mantra around here that I think better the aesthetic appeal of this company, we're getting there. We walked last week to our new Four Seasons suites, our new St. Regis, our new Londoner suites, all being under design and construction. Look what happened to our Parisian property, it's just terrific. The returns on that investment, just can't do better. Those rooms we reconfigured, reconstructed have yielded terrific results. Parisian is now at a run rate of 130. Who knows where it goes to? Our Venetian core suites, the premium mass are just delivering, which we had many more of them. It's a suite-driven quality product market. And it's not just about quality of product, it's about quantity. So it's great to have a small hotel just can't get enough. You need more. There's not an operator over there, not a one that would like to add more top-tier suites and we're building them and everyone wants them. I think the evidence of more you'll see \u2013 the success in the Wynn is evidence that quality wins and scale wins as well. We have both the quality and quantity. We also have a hidden \u2013 everyone in Macao knows it about a hidden secret, but our arena, our Cotai Arena built back in, I don\u2019t know 2007 with The Venetian, which people thought was pretty funny at the time is probably one biggest drivers of premium mass business in the market. Last week we had a great Asian entertainer there, packed the city, packed our hotel. Our numbers on Saturday was an incredible numbers for a Saturday. And the fact is that that's a tremendous asset that people want to see the star entertainers be it U.S. stars or Asian stars. That is a 40-week a year events we have on Friday, Saturday, Sunday with top-tier stars, top-tier acts that people cover those tickets. And whole town if you talk to other operators will tell you, what happens as we bring in these kinds of acts. It makes a whole different weekend, a whole different agenda. And you can see that our numbers are popped. So entertainment, suite product, quality suite product, quantity suite product. By the way retail asset last week walk in the Four Seasons, I got knocked over by people trying to get to the stores. It's an amazing thing to watch. It's experiential. These young excellent people come from further away. They stay longer. They want better things in their life. They want entertainment. They want to stay in fancy rooms. They want to buy fancy clothes and they're having a hell of a time over there and we provide that experience. That is the advantage we have and we have it both in terms of quality and quantity. And that is driving our business. Tomorrow that bridge will be a big driver for the entire market, but today that's what's driving it. Anil Daswani : Thanks. And just one quick follow-up on Singapore. Do you guys feel that you're losing a touch of market share, or is it the market that you're seeing that's getting a touch weaker? Rob Goldstein : I don't know. I don't think \u2013 we're very comfortable with our performance over there. I just \u2013 I can't speak to \u2013 look at profitably more than market share will fix it and making money here. If we can extend more credit or do more things to create more market share and profitability, I'd be in favor of that. We feel we're maintaining our market share and more importantly our margin profitability. Again our focus over there is trying to figure out how to get more capacity like Macao, wish we have built a couple of St. Regis or a couple of Four Seasons properties, because it had the demand in the foreign markets around Singapore, have outsized demand and an outsized MICE demand. I just need more rooms and more slots and more of everything to take advantage of it. Anil Daswani : Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Hey, good afternoon, guys. My first question on Macao relates to your mass customer behavior within the fourth quarter. Was there any or much of a difference in behavior say at the beginning of the quarter versus the end of the quarter? And where I'm kind of going with this is, maybe \u2013 am I being overly optimistic that maybe the average mass player visited more confidence throughout the quarter. And then I have a follow-up also related to Macao. Rob Goldstein : Joe, I can't give you color there. I don't see that in our numbers. I don't see a elevation or decline. I think it's pretty consistent. I wish I \u2013 I'm not sure I can give you a good answer than that. We don't see a whole lot of differentiation from October to December. Joe Greff : Okay. And then sticking with Macao. Since the smoking ban earlier this month on the VIP side, can you talk about what sort of impact you're seeing? You are the first guys to report, so you're the first guy to sort of talk about it. Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Right, right. We walked to there last week. We spent a long very productive week and we walked all the properties and hours over the properties and looked at everything. My belief is, the smoking issue is a small speed bump to this market. It's a speed bump that will disappear. Areas that had smoking previously may suffer, because the smoking rooms now become the new predictor of where you're going to gamble. So example, if table A had smoking, but table B didn't, but has a smoking attached to it now, B will be larger than A's performance in the future. But between all the smoking, what you're seeing in the market, we had -- most of us are open already and most of then acted very well already for smoking, plus the outdoor space which always having some buildings, I don't see this issue as being \u2013 if you're really worried about it, you shouldn't be. This is a short-term issue. It will resolve without material impact. The smoking rooms, the outdoor space, the demand to gamble. I know everyone's worried about January, but we walked around Macao last week and if that\u2019s reason for worry, it looks pretty good to me. Smoking will dissolve and disappear. I think those who take it seriously should move on and find something else to worry about. It's not going to be a long-term impediment. Joe Greff : Great. Thanks a lot. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Sir, your line is now open. Chad Beynon : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First on, speaking with Macao, your retail segment, I guess both on Macao and Singapore, it appears that the sales per square foot increased in the fourth quarter. That's evidenced in one of your slides and then also in the slide that you talk about turnover rate. And this is different than what we heard from some of the luxury retailers that have reported and highlighted some weakness in Macao, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia as well. So can you maybe just elaborate on this? And if this could potentially affect 2020 base rents or turnovers, just some more color on the strong performance. Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Well, you looking into slide, I'm not sure I miscalled that, business is booming. I walked through The Venetian last week and I don't know if we had a sale going on or something, but it's truly incredible to see the people there. My sales \u2013 want more these kind of numbers. We did 17.46 a foot. The Four Seasons is now back at 58 heading for 6,000. Honestly, I went to the Four Seasons though I didn't understand that the amount of people on a Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday, it's just extraordinary. I don't know what you're hearing, but we're awfully happy our retail numbers across Asia. And again, this decline bringing more declines. Extraordinary tenants want more space. Our retailers are extremely happy with our numbers. Our team -- our retail team has done a hell of a job over there and I think it's clear showing ahead we see no decline. In fact if any strength goes to strength, maybe it's about again scale and you walk through Venetian and The Four Seasons, you have this incredible assortment of land of the tendencies that cumulatively give you the most amazing indoor shopping experience. And the faces of the people there, young, affluent -- I made a comment to one of our team members, the Chinese consumer looks so sophisticated, so fashionable and frankly, so fluent and they're buying and they're buying with both hands and we couldn't be more pleased with our retail performance. I don't see any slowdown. I think it's going to keep booming. Chinese New Year's ahead, it's very positive and very exciting across our portfolio retail it gets better. And keep in mind that's one of the reasons they stay with us, they eat with us; they go to our entertainment facility. We've got this ecosystem of shopping, eating, entertainment, gambling, it all looks in tandem. And when you see it on the ground last week, we were there for four or five days, it's pretty exciting to watch and it's not going to change my opinion. That success in our retail is here to stay. Chad Beynon : Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up just when you're speaking with your junket partners and talking to them about how they're handling credit during this China slowdown and trade war situation, did you see anything more pronounced in the fourth quarter with maybe some of your junket partners pulling back on credit extension? And when the trade war is resolved, do you think that could be -- maybe a positive with some more credit coming into the market? Rob Goldstein : It's really tough for us to comment on global macro versus the activities of our junket partners week-to-week. It's very hard to make that connection and sort of add any commentary there. What I would say is that we've been pretty consistent over the last year with the way we work with our junket partners in terms of prioritize extension -- that we have extended to them. What I will tell you is we've been investing in the segment. I think we've been reestablishing and strengthening the relationships that we have with our partners over many years. We've been investing in their spaces, investing in amenities and service those spaces and investing in the team members that help service them. So, we feel like the segment is a powerful one. We think it's something that has a lot of opportunity. We've grown in the segment the last couple of quarters and I think from a credit standpoint, we've always been very prudent and been very measured and I think we'll continue to do. And I think we have a good dialogue and it's an active dialogue with them to get our ebbs and flows, but it's not something that we can look to a global macroeconomic effect and make any connection to. It's really sort of dealt with on the ground as we operate the business dealing with competitive forces. Chad Beynon : Okay, appreciate it. Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Thanks Chad. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mr. Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to kind of go back to the sort of mass customer segmentation and what you guys are seeing there. In one of the slides you guys kind of showed the -- a very modest decline in mass spend per visit and I think you noted a pretty big uptick in daytrip visitation. Can you just give us sort of your outlook for what kind of customer as you guys are seeing in the market? Is this sort of the new normal? Is this being driven by infrastructure and some of the changes there? Sort of what's driving it? You continue to see, obviously, very healthy visitation numbers into the market and is the sort of the new normal, or do you guys expect us to kind of balance out or change over time? Daniel Briggs : So Shaun, its Dan. If you look at page 15, I think and Rob has referenced this earlier. Guangdong province that first line, 10.5 million visitors from the adjacent province plus you've got visitors from Hong Kong. The bridge makes it easier for people to get over and back over time. It runs all night, not to worry about a boat. At the bottom of it \u2013 of the chart you've got 14.7 million visitors from Guangdong. The issue that the market is going to have is without more hotel inventory. All the hotel rooms will be taken up by wealthier and wealthier people, which is great for premium mass, but it also causes a squeeze effectively where people can't find a room if they're just coming over. So that makes a great market in the base mass It makes a great market in the premium mass. And for the future to get the $30 billion of mass revenue in Macao, more hotel inventory must be built. So the market will continue to evolve. The customer\u2019s cell will evolve, but what's crystal clear is that without more hotel inventory, there won't be enough capacity for everyone who wants to come. So that creates the opportunity for us on both sides of the chart of the previous chart on \u2013 the previous chart on page 14. They are both going to continue to get better and better over time. The growth is great in both places and we're very happy to have daytrip visitation. We're very happy to have premium mass visitation. We're happy when the Chinese people get wealthier. There's no way that any of this won't continue as long as more hotel inventory gets added to the market. If no new hotel inventory ever gets to build, the market becomes more top-heavy, which would be unfortunate and it would limit growth. But we don't expect that to happen. We expect more hotel inventory to come in. Rob Goldstein : We love to grow more rooms today if we could in non-gaming hotel room. We would love to be investing more money in Macao. We've made that clear with the government. We are such staunch believers in the atrium where sleeping rooms for every segment, MICE, leisure, gaming, it's what Dan\u2019s pointing is so evident when you're there in January and you can't get a sleeping room, it's clear everybody needs more sleeping rooms in that market. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. And just a quick follow-up, switching to Vegas. Any color you can provide on just sort of the cadence of how you guys are expecting RevPAR to play out as we're seeing through the balance of the year? Just \u2013 or what you're seeing on convention side and convention mix? It looks like 4Q is quite strong but we saw a bigger volatility in the market broadly in 2018 than what we're used to. So just sort of, kind of the health and maybe again cadence of what you're expecting to see there? Patrick Dumont : So we had a tremendous quarter. It was a great result from the room revenue side. We're very pleased with our operations there. Our revenue per occupied group room night's incredibly strong. And we see that continuing. So far things have been very good. As you know we don't give RevPAR guidance, but we're very pleased with the progress that we've made in the Las Vegas market. Rob will probably talk a little bit about the room night, the group room night expectations, but it's a practical matter I think we're very pleased with the operations team here. They're doing a great job, growing different segments of the business, including our boat rock drop, which we're very pleased with. But again it's highly volatile and some of the non-gaming business, which we believe we can invest in the future to grow. But from a standpoint of Vegas, it's been growing well and we're very pleased with the quarter and we think some of the tailwinds will be helpful for us coming up. Rob Goldstein : Team here is going to be very bullish in 2019 and group volumes and feel very strong about how the market is progressing. No fears for 2019, strong group market. We'd like to win a batting cage in the casino. Other than that our lodging and our -- if you walk around this town in January, the CES and the shot show which is happening it's pretty impressive place Las Vegas, especially in January. So we feel very good at our prospects in 2019 as well as the entire Las Vegas marketplace. Patrick Dumont : In terms of our Venetian Palazzo property, we've done a lot of reinvestments here. If you've getting you've seen some of the results. We're very happy to floor space that's been renovated. We've got a lot of new restaurants on offer. We've made significant investment in the rooms and other spaces that we feel that it will continue to make the property competitive to position us well for future growth in market. Shaun Kelley : And probably a lot warmer than New York too. Thanks a lot guys. Rob Goldstein : That\u2019s a rumor, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Hi there. Some of you also sound sick, so I hope everyone is well tuned. Rob Goldstein : We anyway sound that way. Felicia Hendrix : Yes, so Rob look you talked a lot on this call about what you've been seeing in mass and VIP. But on this VIP side, you just -- you outperformed so significantly, I just wanted to continue to dissect that a bit. Just wondering on the VIP side, so given that outperformance were those unplanned for you, or do they surprise you as well? And I'm also wondering is the strength there that the driver for the decline in EBITDA margins in the quarter? Rob Goldstein : Well, I think we alluded to earlier the mix on the -- our rolling business both direct and junket was very strong. As you know our rolling business direct is very strong there. Our margins are much higher in that piece of the business. And we have played lucky in the wrong side of the equation. The junket played strong and the rolling direct played very weak and it cost us real dollars. As far as our commitment that we've always been a believer that important component is not the driver, it's a small portion that roll profitability. But we enjoy the growth and we believe it's important to keep competitive and we've done a very good job creating a better aesthetic in the junket rooms and the rolling rooms. We've built these suites which we have plenty of. The entertainment obviously is an unfair advantage. It drives amazing amounts of rolling business direct and junket. I think we just continue the course. We will be subject to the market's ups and downs as it relates to money flow and all the challenges the market face. We can't work around that. So our base business, the premium mass, mass remains our -- the money part of our EBITDA the strong part. But we're happy to participate in junket growth. And now it's planned -- the team is very, very focused on trying to get more competitive with the right spaces, with the right junket arrangements and it's paying off. And frankly, we have the advantages anyway of the entertainment, the suites all the good stuff we have, why not just deploy it further into that segment and add to our profitability. And so as part of our entire EBITDA ecosystem, it's helpful. It won't drive our business to 4 billion, that's where the mass -- premium mass comes in. But it was a planned strategy, it wasn't luck solely and this quarter was unlucky. But it will bounce back and I think you'll see some very good news ahead in the future of 2019 for our rolling business. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. And then just staying on that, I know you gained a lot of share on the VIP year-over-year, but quarter-over-quarter it looks like it's down about 100 basis points. So is there any way to tell this early in the game who you -- who might have taken some share? And again, I know the overall market VIP number that you put in the deck is that -- is a guest, but\u2026 Rob Goldstein : Yes. The problem, I think the world you can't \u2013 trees don't grow straight to the sky. There are some ups and downs and, yes, a little blip there, but overall there got to be performance the last couple of years. I look at the last two years, what staggers my imagination. I sat with rooms of people who told me we would be under $2 billion of portfolio EBITDA in \u2013 by 2019. We would fall, we'll loose share and we'll be falling apart and the world comes to an end. And here we are sitting on $3 billion a year, 18% growth, material impact in all segments. And I just couldn't be more proud of our team and our focus. And we just keep growing in the right direction. And for those of you who are in this for the long term, like we are, I think you'll be very, very well rewarded down the road of our performance. We are in the right place, right time, right assets and we'll take on all comers in terms of segmentation, junkets included, rolling direct. So very bullish. A blip by 100 basis points, I wouldn't get too excited about. Not material. Felicia Hendrix : Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. Rob, you mentioned earlier in the call. You've been talking about growth and you said the Londoner is underway. I wonder if you could just give a little bit more specifics about the timing of\u2026 Rob Goldstein : Sure. Robin Farley : And potential disruption? It seems like it could be hard not to have it, and so just to manage expectations about it. Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Sure, sure. No, a very fair question. First of all, I want to make sure everybody understands. We developed about 70 million square feet at LVS over the years, between all our different properties. So I think we're \u2013 I read some notes, people are concerned about what's happening to Londoner. Don't be concerned. It's going to be a magnificent success story that we'll be opening probably late 2020. It's underway already. It's a big challenge. We're taking a 1,200-room hotel and making into a 600 rooms all-suite hotel in The Londoner. There will be some disruption, Robin. And we'd be silly to say it wouldn't be. But it's a weird process in that and we're making progress in design approvals. We're continuing labor. We're making progress on our quotas. The government support is there. And I think the truth is, we're going to have an interesting process here whereby we're running \u2013 still running a major casino there under the SCC umbrella, while we're developing Londoner, we still have Dragon\u2019s Palace open the entire time. We will open the St. Regis before The Londoner opens up. It will be a work in progress for the next 18 to 24 months. And there will be disruption. I'm not prepared to quantify, I just can't. We will not lose a table game or a slot machine in the portfolio. We have the ability to transfer assets in the SCC as well as on to other gaming floors if need be. I think some of the people in our team are pretty astute. And I think we're able to move our assets around to make sure we maximize them. I'm pretty confident that the disruption is going to be not as bad as other people anticipate. I'm also more confident that at the conclusion people who are kind of making these comments about, gee, how can you take away a property making $800 million? Well, when it makes a whole lot more than $800 million, perhaps long-term investors will recognize, there is no better way to invest our capital than the SCC transformation in Londoner. Some have referenced earlier to Patrick about M&A. There is no M&A that compares to this transaction. The return on this invested capital will be breathtaking. And I think those who are questioning that should look back at the Parisian which has now past 20% return on invested capital. Look at The Venetian now steamrolling towards $1.4 billion $1.5 billion. I think someone's got to pay a little attention to our past successes and give us some credit for Londoner. Yes, there'll be some disruption. We recognize that. Perhaps that EBITDA will transfer along those gaming assets to other properties in the portfolio and limit that disruption. But in the end, if you're a long-term thinker, you want to make money for long-term, this is a game changer for us. We're going to take a property that's been subpar and make it the equivalent to a Venetian-style property except on a twice as many sleeping rooms and fully-themed and fully-authentic London-style. And I think the result is going to justify the investment and the time and the effort. The disruption we'll have to wait and see how bad it gets. We're pretty confident that our team there is pretty astute. So, that's our take on Londoner. Robin Farley : No, I appreciate that. And just one clarification, it's not a question whether you'll get a return on investment; it's just literally trying to think about what expectations should be for this year. When do rooms start coming out of service? And kind of what percent of rooms will that be, like just to think about maybe that's when we'd see some impact? Rob Goldstein : So, post-Chinese New Year's will start -- by the way St. Regis will open up to support this share to the public to open that building up and sort of have access to the casino that way, but post-Chinese New Year, you start seeing. The Four Seasons is going to open up in the fall of 2020. Londoner comes out of -- The Londoner transformation -- from the current holiday [indiscernible] happening in March and April, the full transformation and it will be down for the 12, 14 months where it's going to take to transform it. But the most of the property, again, the Conrad remains intact. The St. Regis Hotel remains intact. We are building a new St. Regis behind the current St. Regis that is under construction. Dragon's Palace remains intact until the end. So, again, if there's different dates, the one thing does come down, we complete close before the holiday in 1,200 keys post-Chinese New Year. We open them probably late in 2020, that's the biggest single thing. Patrick Dumont : Keep in mind too Rob that that -- those 1,300 hotel rooms like Holiday Inn are the least productive hotel rooms that we have in the entire portfolio. They are great for families. They're great for people who come over. The product they were creating is going to be even at much more productive, the same way that we saw at the Parisian taking smaller rooms out and creating larger suite. We expect to see the same kind of accretion. So, we're not losing that much when we take those hotels out of service on the gaming side, in particular, and so there is a big benefit that we get and a small kind of degradation, but you get a big outsized benefit once you're completed. Rob Goldstein : What I don't know Rob is what's going to happen around the properties as we start tearing things down, the facade on the strip there that's going to be disruptive and all that. But we have alternative ways of accessing the building. So, we're going to wait and see how we run this thing, but a lot of confidence the team there is really skilled at wanting to transfer people. And, again, we have lot of the properties we can move the demand to. So, hopefully, we can limit disruption as we build this thing for the future. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Mr. Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hey guys. Thank you. Rob just quickly on kind of better understanding the VIP strategy right now. In terms of where you're seeing the majority of the growth both on an absolute basis, obviously, revenue up significantly this period. Are you seeing it more through the junket channels or more through your direct channels? If I recall -- and I'm not sure you're going to provide color on this, but if I recall, your direct mix maybe used to be closer to 30% several years ago. And is that roughly the same and where is the growth coming from? Rob Goldstein : You're right the first time, I'm not going to provide the breakout, but I appreciate the question. The answer is both; we're getting strong, premium and direct play and premium, rolling, direct and we're also getting strong junket. Our junket partners have been terrific. It's coming both ways. And I think that the point is we're number one in premium direct in the market and growing. And the truth is that's a very simple equation is back the same old story assets. When you have the best entertainment in town, you have these magnificent shows they want to see, when you have these junket rooms that are getting better and better. And more important, again there's a problem over there. There's just not enough sleeping rooms or quality of these high roller type customers be it direct or through junket. And as you know because you understand this well than anybody, the junket business has evolved where the customers dictate where they want to stay now. The old days of the junkets being in command of where people gamble that's over. So the better products, the better properties, the better entertainment facilities, the better retail places attract the customers. So we're getting a lot of that business from both direct and from the junket partners. And as you know they feed off each other and they complement the non-rolling piece as well. And again our ecosystem with retail, entertainment, too many suites for anybody else, I mean, we just have much more product than anybody else. And as a result, we're going to keep growing that. The only downturn as you know is the frustration, the macro frustrations in the market as it relates to that segment and that we can overcome. But assuming the business is there, the economy is healthy and the customers are showing up, we're going to keep gaining outsized share of that segment. The same we're getting outside share of everything else. I think the short-term views of Macao has always been a mistake, this is a market fueled by product, by quality and by scale and we had that in space. And I think as long as that holds up along with our stellar management team, we're going to continue to be a very strong force in Macao on the road to $4 billion. Carlo Santarelli : Great, thank you. And then I just want to be mindful of the time, but in terms of your buyback activity in the quarter, could you just talk a little bit about the thinking that that went into, obviously, accelerating your pace of spend? Is that, hey, we find valuation attractive? We have, obviously, a very strong balance sheet, or kind of what was different in the 4Q with respect to your approach to the buyback relative to prior quarters in the year? Patrick Dumont : I think, yes, to your first two statements and I think we have raised liquidity earlier on in the year for the purposes of returning capital. And we felt very strongly that we have a growth of potential. We're investing $2.2 billion as Rob has been laying out in the Londoner as well as other high potential projects in Macao and the Four Seasons and St. Regis. We see a lot of long-term value in the equity here. It's plain and simple, but Chairman sees a lot of long value in the company, believe that it will continue to return capital in meaningful way, and we have the liquidity we want to take advantage of. And so that's the nature of the repurchase that you saw in this last quarter and we'll look to be aggressive again in the future, because we feel very strongly about our returns and the potential of the investments that we're making. So that's the result of that Rob Goldstein : To put it to simple, gave buybacks. Patrick Dumont : Gave buybacks. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Thank you, guys. Rob Goldstein : Thank you very much. Appreciate your time, Carlo. Daniel Briggs : Thanks very much, everyone. Operator : Thank you all for participating. That ends today's conference call. You may now hang up.",

First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs. Daniel Briggs : Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides in our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question so we might allow everyone with interest an opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you know Sheldon is still receiving medical treatment, so he will not be on the call with us today, but we look forward to his recovery in due course. He did, however, want me to pass this message to everyone; amazing results this quarter; great news on the Singapore expansion; and of course, yay new developments, yay buybacks, and yay dividends. Let's turn to our financial results. We had an outstanding quarter, especially in Macao. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion. In Macao, adjusted EBITDA was $858 million, up 9% over the prior year. We achieved record mass table revenues which reached $1.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-on-year. Our profitability continues to lead the industry with EBITDA margins of 36.8%, up another 30 basis points year-on-year. The Parisian had a record quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $163 million with mass win per table growing by 21% year-on-year, aided by the introduction of our renovated suites. Next month, we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Sands Macao opening, which marked the beginning of Macao's transformation into a world-class tourism destination for leisure and business travelers. Sheldon's vision more than a decade ago to create the critical mass of integrated resource in Cotai with hotel, entertainment, retail, and MICE facilities positions both the market and our company for future growth. We look forward to making additional investments in Macao as we contribute to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. With the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the ongoing development of the Greater Bay initiatives, which we believe Macao has the potential to become the MICE capital of Asia and we fully intend to contribute to that goal both to our existing assets and future investments. In Singapore, MBS delivered $423 million of EBITDA. This is consistent -- this consistent strong cash flow generation was driven by mass win which reached nearly $5 million per day. The iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel continues to enjoy near full occupancy. Retail sales exceeded $1,900 per square foot. And we recently opened last week the Marquee, a Las Vegas Sands nightclub that is unique in Asia. We look forward to the contributions from Marquee as well as exciting new retailers in the near future. Over the past several quarters, we had commented on our capacity constraints at Marina Bay Sands and our willingness to invest additional capital for expansion. We are very excited. We are thrilled. We recently reached an agreement with the Singapore government to invest an additional $3.3 billion to develop a new iconic hotel tower with premium suites, a state-of-the-art entertainment arena, additional MICE capacity, and other amenities including luxury retail. Marina Bay Sands has already established itself as an iconic tourism destination. With this exciting and multifaceted expansion, we are confident Marina Bay Sands will continue to grow Singapore's appeal as a leading leisure and business tourism destination in China. We are truly grateful to the Singapore government for their support and as Sheldon said a few weeks ago, Integrated Resort development in Singapore is a tremendous example of government and private business working in tandem to maximize an opportunity that benefits all those involved. Finally we continue to increase the rate of return, rate of capital to shareholders. We raised the annual dividend for the 2019 calendar year. We repurchased $174 million of stock in the quarter. We see meaningful long-term value of the LVS and SCL equity. We thank you for joining us today and now let's take some questions. Daniel Briggs : Operator, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon everybody. We look forward to hearing Sheldon hopefully soon. Rob Goldstein : We do too, Joe. Joe Greff : Rob when we look back was it the 1Q in Macao I think what surprised us was the premium mass growth exceeded that of the base mass growth. I think that's kind of contrary to what we would expect just given maybe perceptions of the market dynamics. And can you talk about what drove that and how much of that was the renovated suite product at The Parisian? I guess how even was that relative growth throughout the quarter and do you think that's sustainable? Rob Goldstein : Well, Joe, if you're looking at your deck, turn to page 11, I think it's the nicest slide I've seen in a long time. It illustrates our growth in both base mass and premium mass. And the numbers are just extraordinary, almost $19,300 coming out of our tables from the premium side and $8,600 from the mass side. This was a challenging quarter in Macao. The comps from 2018 were strong. The smoking ban, obviously, began this quarter. China macro concerns are out there and VIP clearly is softening. And yet against this backdrop, we delivered our best quarter since 2014. And our non-rolling table revenue that you alluded to was our best in history at $1.52 billion with strong margins. The landscape in Macao has changed dramatically since 2014. This is a market driven by mass and premium mass. And as we said previously and we'll say again, we have the scale and the quality of rooms, and suites, and retail and gaming and entertainment to excel in this environment. It's just not scale for us though. I think what you have to roll is quality. And that's why we're building 1,300 new suites as we speak at the Londoner and Four Seasons. It's a lifestyle commitment by these customers. This complete package enables us to earn beyond our fair share in Macao. We believe the rolling market will resurrect it has in the past, it will in the future and we're prepared to accommodate that segment as well with our relations with the junkets, our relations with the better room quality in both the suites and the junket rooms. But I think this quarter signals our ability to perform exceptionally well in mass and premium mass and we look forward to return in the rolling market. As to where it came from, obviously you know we've told the story about The Parisian and The Parisian we converted 600 keys to 300. And some people thought that was -- might be a good idea, it might not be. It's trying to be a very good idea. The Parisian delivered an outstanding quarter driven by huge growth in the premium mass business and I think it's going to continue. The truth is that this is a market that's driven by product, by quality and by scale. We have all three. And we don't want to cede control of our junket business. We don't want to give that segment up. We plan to be a player in that. But this quarter was powered obviously by these base mass win and premium mass win and by better room product and better product in general and that's always been our calling card and it will continue to be. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. And then, as my follow-up question and I'm not sure if this one's actually been posed to you at least anytime recently, but maybe Patrick you can chime in here as well. Maybe you can just give us your updated views and involved views on M&A as a way for you guys to grow maybe in light of what your neighbor up the street potentially did. I just want to make sure we're kind of current on how you're thinking of external growth opportunities versus what I understand and I appreciate there's a lot on your plate with Singapore, The Londoner and then a newer market like Japan potentially. And then, if M&A is some sort of potential growth driver, under what criteria would you engage in M&A? And that's all for me. Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Joe. It's Patrick. I think I just want to highlight something that I think we said in some prior calls. Our highest and best use of capital is having our Chairman develop new high-growth properties. And so, we kind of look at everything through that lens. And I think as you look at the expansion Singapore that we've been very fortunate to reach agreement on, and you look at the investment that Rob just spoke about regarding some of the new developments that we're doing in Macao, activating some old assets as well as refreshing the SCC building into The Londoner, we think new development and renovations in very Taoist, very positive growth markets is the best way for us to deploy capital. I think for us it's really tough to get comfortable with an M&A opportunity given how successful we have been doing what we've been doing. I think it's hard to look at those opportunities and say that there are a better use of our capital than what we can do with our development capability as well as returning capital to shareholders, either through the dividend program or through repurchases. So our focus is on development of our existing markets in Macao, which has been a tremendous market for us historically and we believe will be even stronger in the future as well as in Singapore as well as in some of the new jurisdictions in Asia. So that's really where we're focused. I don't think you'll see us do M&A in the near term. Rob Goldstein : Joe just to add to Patrick's comments you and I have been doing this for a long time, but there seems to be a lot of people who are just buying things and selling things as valuable. We've learned over the years that buying a few things, really focusing and getting it right, and having long-term growth in markets and finding the right opportunities to have that at mode approach is much more effective than just buying and selling. I think we want to grow. Singapore's evidence of that. We have a few things that we're looking at right now that I think are extraordinary opportunities for the company. But it's hard to emulate Macao and Singapore and perhaps Japan. These are extraordinary opportunities. Joe Greff : Thank you for the thoughts. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks. I guess starting on Singapore. Can you talk to the returns on invested capital there? And maybe some of the specifics around the build-out and the customer you are trying to go after there especially that I think you referenced say VIP could be a little bit softer in Macao. Does that have spillover have any -- does that factor into your thoughts in terms of what you're doing in Singapore? Rob Goldstein : Okay. Let's take a crack at this. MBS has been an extraordinary story, which is authored by an outstanding government and a visionary company and founder. It's one of the greatest development stories in the history of this industry. And tourism has soared and benefit -- tourism has soared in Singapore and we benefit as well. But Steve, when we designed MBS about 15 years ago and we built the usual thing at that time, we built nice suites at the high-end, we built a top-tier hotel as everybody else, we just couldn't have imagined that time the incredible power of the emerging premium mass segment. And that segment is demanding and they should be. We just delivered about $19,000 almost $20,000 win per table from that segment in Macao this quarter. We did it for the first time almost $5 million MBS primarily from that segment. That's where the growth is. But this opportunity in Singapore is so much bigger than even that. I mean, I think $5 million is a nice starting point. We didn't build the right room for this segment. We didn't give the premium mass, the entertainment product they wanted. This segment wants it all. It's a lifestyle segment. And with this expansion, we take dead aim at that segment. We're building 1,000 suites roughly at 1,000 square feet roughly, basically the best product we've ever built bar none any hotel in the world. We're building a large arena and partnering with the smartest and best entertainment people in the world to ensure week after week that Macao -- excuse me MBS and Singapore will become an entertainment powerhouse. And we couple that with our Cotai Arena in Macao. We have synergy there and we've become an important part of any touring entertainer's plans. The synergy from Macao and Singapore is exceptional from an entertainment perspective. The target for this audience is affluent foreign tourism in Singapore, where they want the best suites, we'll get them; the best entertainment check; the best rate there we already have it. We opened Marquee last week to an amazing response. This is a voracious consumer that wants it all and MBS will deliver it all along with a one-of-a-kind 54 -- 5th-floor gaming salon more slots more ETGs. We can't fill all the rooms when we have those days. We can't fill up the rooms of premium mass. The suites will be sold at remarkable high rates to non-gamers. The same with the MICE space, it will enable us to achieve the highest rates we can get for our 3,500 rooms and suites. This project will take Singapore and MBS to a different level to a different gear. Our industry is product driven. Look at Cotai. Does anyone believe Macao could achieve its current success without Cotai? I was there. It was a vertical building property. It was all tall buildings pinned with small acreage, few rooms, no entertainment, no retail no spa, no MICE. Macao has become supercharged by an extraordinary product. $20,000 win per unit per day in premium mass this quarter or $19,500. Look what happens if you bring Bruno Mars or Jacky Cheung or BTS or Maroon 5 or Celine Dion to Macao revenues explode. In Las Vegas, entertainment drives room rate. In Macao, it drives gaming revenue. It explodes game revenue. This will happen in MBS. It's always about the product and our business. The market for Singapore premium mass is there. It needs to be exploited. We need to give it what it wants to come. And in addition, let's mention our competitor, Genting will invest I think $4 billion or $5 billion, the same dollars to create a new product to further enhance the destination. Changi Airport already an exceptional airport just opened another key expansion. Singapore is an extraordinary place and its growth will keep coming. The government made a wise choice to enable this to happen and we couldn't be more grateful or more excited. Stephen Grambling : Great. And changing gears to Japan, I guess. And maybe it's still too early, but how do the development products you have underway and these other markets compare to what you think is possible in Japan? And maybe what are the puts and takes to ROIC to think about in that market? Rob Goldstein : Well, Japan is still as you know a ways out. We are deep into it. We're committed to it. We have a team on the ground there. And I think you'll see us do something in the same fashion we've done in Macao or Singapore. Our goal is -- we're looking at decades of investment investing many billions of dollars. But we don't go into markets and look for a cheap way to do things. Sheldon's approach has always been scale. It's been dramatic. It's design driven. It's a very, very special way of approaching a market. To the M&A question a few minutes ago, M&A doesn't offer the opportunities to us that Japan could or other markets could. So our commitment to Japan is immense. It will be lots and lots of rooms many, many rooms. There will be lots of retail. There will be lots of MICE, far beyond what people understand we're thinking about for Japan. The government understands that. But we are fully committed to be in Osaka. We're fully committed to make a commitment to do very well there. And you'll see us invest a lot of money to create an extraordinary product that lasts for a long time and we'll get great returns as well. Stephen Grambling : Thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Hi, how are you? So a few questions on Singapore. So VIP revenues or rolling volumes were up about 5% quarter-over-quarter. Have you seen any life there? And then your mass table revenue was up a lot and your slots were down. Any like rationale for why that -- for that dynamic? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, I'll start with VIP, Tom. As you know we're not big believers in huge growth. It's volatile. It's driven by -- it's a very -- it's a market we've always believed could grow but it's got impediments that we find very difficult. I don't think our biggest growth opportunity will be in VIP. Could it slide to $8 billion, $9 billion, $10 billion in one quarter? Yeah it could. Could it fall back to $6 billion, $7 billion next? It could. I think we're looking basically the playing field's stable and that's about all. There is growth. There's real growth in the premium mass side and we're seeing increased tourism, foreign tourism. Again comments on the last question why we're committed to spending a lot of capital in Singapore. We think it's well underserved. I mean $5 million a day is a nice number to get to. But Macao we did $1.5 billion for the quarter and there's just no question that we can get further there in terms of the premium mass table play. Slot capacity is constrained. We are having trouble growing it. It has grown I think 650 annually. It was 675 or -- but we have had trouble growing it. We need more slot machines. This will fix that issue this expansion. There's no question it's one of the world's great slot ETG markets and there's no question this will serve us well. So the growth is there in Singapore. The growth is there in tables and slots, more on the premium side than the rolling. It's -- again it's concentrated in the rolling side. It's more difficult there, but yet the premium mass side looks like its gotten vast potential from our perspective as does the slot growth. Thomas Allen : Powerful, thank you. And then did you change the name of the St. Regis Tower Suites to The Londoner Tower Suites? And then if you did why? And then did the timing of that just dropped a little bit? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, we did change the name. We've decided we'll keep the St. Regis name on the current building. It's there and operating very well. We decided to be more of -- again it's more of a lifestyle brand decision on our part to focus on our own brand as part of The Londoner umbrella. We're going to control 95% of the product there. Anyway it won't be for sale. It will be comped if we're successful 100% of the time. We probably could do a better job controlling it that way and putting it under The Londoner umbrella. We are really enthused with what's happening in Londoner. We feel this is going to be a very, very successful product. And it's got focus again take dead aim at the premium mass customer in Macao, and so we thought we had better control by converting that back to The Londoner umbrella. We will retain and we're very enthusiastic about our relationship with St. Regis on the current St. Regis hotel as part of The Londoner theming. But again we thought we could do better and we're trying a different approach and you're exactly right we did. Thomas Allen : Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon. Rob probably for you, but maybe to stick with Sands Cotai Central. Some of the results there have been actually holding in, I think quite strong if not better than we expected. Could you just talk about the outlook there for the property given some of the potential disruption that you get into the -- some of the more aggressive renovation phases throughout this year and early next what people should anticipate? Or can you maintain some level of activity given what you're doing in the premium mass casino areas there? Rob Goldstein : Right. So Sheldon's theory is people want to see it before we get rid of it, which I think, is a funny theory. He said the more we talk about this, the more people keep coming. We've got a great quarter at Sands Cotai Central and I think what is remarkable is that we are in the construction there and it will worsen. I'm not prepared to define the level of disruption, because I just don't know. I mean, very candidly, I just don't know. Macao is an extraordinary place and people seem to cope with extraordinary circumstances, but we will -- we are continuing to build Londoner rooms. They are under construction currently. The process continues. The project may be -- the exterior will start happening in the summer I believe. So there will be construction. There is bound to be some disruption. I'm not prepared to quantify what that might look like. You're right though. The 200-million-plus quarter is kind of comical. Some people give me a hard time about that, and say, why get rid of something, that could make $1 billion to turn when it's growing. But I think the answer is because it probably could be closer to The Venetian. That building was 6,000 keys and we do it properly. And Shaun, we're doing it properly. The team, our design development group has really evolved and the stuff we're doing is pretty special. I'm very excited to see it open and just share it with you and the investment community. It will offer more keys than any place double The Parisian key count more suites, more theming. It's just pretty special what's going to happen there. And we're very confident that it can grow immeasurably. We talk about the M&A question. I don't think there's a better investment out there. We're going to invest dollar-wise our return there. You can't touch any place in the world, because this is going to do very, very well. I can't tell you it's going to hit Venetian numbers. That might be a little too ambitious. But it's sure going to improve a whole lot and we're extremely enthused about it. Again, don't want to speak to disruption, because I just don't know. I've been -- the consumer over there thinks differently is different. They love the room product in some of the hotels. I think the Holiday Inn conversion will mimic The Parisian. And that conversion is 1,200 keys. The 600 suites is going to be an unbelievable statement. The rooms look extraordinary. And so we couldn't be more enthused about what's going to happen as the transition evolves. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thanks for that. And then as an update a follow-up to an earlier question just on the overall market growth you saw on premium mass. Can you just give us your kind of latest thoughts on kind of the cash comp dynamic for what you're doing with rooms? It's obviously a huge advantage for you guys given what you've got on all the product out there. Are you continuing to bump up what you're able to do on the comp side just because you see that kind of gaining demand or just what's the latest on market environment? Rob Goldstein : Actually, we're -- I'm not sure I understand the question. Are you asking, we comp more rooms to get more demand? Shaun Kelley : Or -- yes. Basically are you comping more rooms to drive the premium mass side? Rob Goldstein : We'd like to comp them all, Shaun, but we don't have the demand yet. We're at 55% I believe portfolio-wide. The truth is, I mean, that's -- you cannot get -- there's no customer in the world that pays the kind of rates you get from a premium mass gaming customer. And our goal is to keep moving towards more and more comped rooms. That's always been the goal. We do have MICE demand midweek. Sheldon's prophecy is coming true. MICE demand certainly picked up. The bridge is going to be a major driver. We're going to have a great problem someday in Macao. We already run in the 90s, but the truth is Macao needs more rooms. We have huge competition in this segment. Cash business there is booming. Comp business is picking up. Premium mass is showing strong. MICE business is evolving. The bridge will change that. I wish, we just had 5,000, 10,000 more rooms because we could use them painfully so. Patrick Dumont : And the environment there Shaun, just to add onto that has been very stable. In fact, on the same number of rooms we're using for comp, the cash piece of reinvestment is actually decreasing as a percentage of revenue and you see this kind of growth, which is a pretty extraordinary performance by the team there. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : So you guys okay, if I ask a question about Las Vegas for a second? Rob Goldstein : Sure. You can ask of any one Felicia. Felicia Hendrix : Thank you. Well, knowing the side of this is part of your business. But I just -- I was wondering, especially since you guys are the first ones to report how the quarter progressed January through March, because we know that the January and February market RevPAR was strong, clearly March not as much given your RevPAR is up. So I wanted to know, if you could just talk about that. But also February was a tough baccarat month. We saw that in your numbers. Wondering if you've seen the demand for the Chinese high-rollers pick up? And then finally just on this Las Vegas question. You said in the last call that you were well positioned for a group in the year. So is that still the case? So overall like barring all this volatility, how do you think Vegas in general and your property performs for the rest of the year? I thought it was really interesting in the deck that you said that one of the opportunities you see in Vegas is the opportunity for room pricing increases, especially when there's a lot of investors that leads people to think it's getting more and more challenging to raise rates in Vegas. Rob Goldstein : Well, obviously, we're different than some other people in Vegas. Firstly, we have a different campus and I think that we're structurally different. And when Sheldon built this place, we're the only people in town I think to have this kind of campus, 7,000 keys all suites. We're in the epicenter right in the middle of what's happening in Las Vegas. We have all those convention and MICE space, which Sheldon again 20 years ago told people build it and some did, some didn't. So we're a little bit unique. And this quarter is a good quarter for us. Nothing exceptional in terms of the -- nothing happened here in the gaming side, so we held within the range, which we hadn't been doing recently. Our baccarat business had been decent. I think Vegas will be fine with baccarat, but I wouldn't expect there to be a growth engine, because honestly as Macao gets better and better and those lights seem longer and longer, I think the -- all the Asian customers may opt to stay in Macao. And if you look at our campus in Macao, it's so damn compelling what they're offering. So I do think you're going to see a challenge to Vegas baccarat growth potential. On the room side, we're very fortunate. We had an extraordinary room\u2019s quarter. And I think this -- I know we're not saying what the rest of the industry is saying. We're seeing strong group demand. We're seeing a strong FIT weekend. I think George and the team here has done an exemplary job of maintaining rate and margin. And I think it will get a little bit different than the other people in town. We have a very strong room product. We're underpinned by convention and MICE space. We have strong FIT demand. This quarter is just a good quarter, because we held within the range. And the rates were strong. RevPARs are strong. We may or may not be indicative of the -- I wouldn't call us a barometer though for the Strip. I can't speak to other people. And again, our product is very top-tier. So we're very happy with our Vegas business. If we can keep having $125 million, $135 million quarters, it would be a very nice year for us. And I think we will feel good about it. From our perspective, Vegas is just fine. Patrick Dumont : I think it's \u2013 its Patrick. One other thing about Vegas, I think we're a firm believer that, if you reinvest in high-quality product, you'll be able to drive value and drive returns and that speaks through the ADR. So if you look at what we did in the last quarter, our ADR was up 2.3%. Incrementally, if we keep doing that eventually over time we'll head in the right direction assuming our investments continue, right? So we've done a lot to reinvest in the campus here as Rob mentioned. We have an unbelievable asset hopefully coming online in a few years, with the Sphere that's being done with Madison Square Garden one of the leading entertainment companies in the world as you know. So we think our trajectory for Vegas is actually incredibly positive. We like the expansion and some of the development that's going around us. We think that will help us. The retail has been performing well in the building. There is a lot of things that are now firing on all cylinders with George Markantonis following Sheldon's original vision. Yeah, the critical mass does work. So our ADR is just visibility into the success of the overall property. And I think one thing that, you'll see in the future is that our convention business will continue to grow, but our FIT business will continue to be powerful as we get additional amenities online. And so that's why we have this view, and we'll continue to deploy capital against this asset because it's a great asset. Rob Goldstein : One thing, I would add you touched maybe two points I wanted to just sort of articulate further. I should have referenced the Sphere, which I think is a game changer for our building. I apologize. I missed that. Sorry, Jim Dolan. Sorry MSG. It's going to be a very, very different place in a couple of years, when the Sphere gets opened as far as entertainment and driving ADR. Second thing, I think what's important is to realize Vegas is as you know CapEx-strong. You've got to invest dollars just stay in the game. Now, you look around this town. I visited the Palms recently extraordinary with the \u2013 what the Fertittas have done to the Palms. You walk through these buildings you've got to have an appetite for excessive CapEx to stay in the game. We've done that. We've invested heavily in Vegas and the fasts point had paid off. But it's not in town you can let things erode or you will erode quickly. And we've reinvested over the years and we keep reinvesting, but that's a key part of our strategy here is to stay current. Felicia Hendrix : Thank you. That's really helpful. And then just kind of switching gears to your retail business in Macao. All those sales per-square-foot numbers continue to be helpful. I appreciate it. I'm not sure, if we'd make anything of it. There was a slight decline from the TTM fourth quarter to now the first quarter. Just wondering, if there's anything to read into that especially given China macro or if it's just I don't know really nothing? Patrick Dumont : I think we have \u2013 I think you're referring to page 34 and 35 in our deck. If you kind of look at the performance in Macao, we're very proud of these malls. We don't think there's any issue with global macro. I don't think you'll see malls anywhere in the world grow like this. And if there are some just point us out, point them out to us. We think this retail story of Macao is extraordinary. We think it speaks to Sheldon's original vision of building critical mass of retail of MICE of entertainment and bringing high-value customers into beautiful premium mass suites really driving this retail experience. And so these revenue numbers, we think will continue to expand over time as we continue to remix tenants, as we invest more in the malls, as The Londoner mall opens up refreshed, and as we get some other remixing done we'll start to see additional upward pressure on our revenues as well as on our rent rolls. So we're very pleased about the Macao story. I think Rob has some comments as well. But this is really just another example of the critical mass story that Sheldon authored. And we're very proud of the offerings that we have there including the tenant mix, which we think is unique to shopping experiences throughout Asia and the world. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that was our retail malls although they make a lot of money obviously is demonstrated by these sales per-square-foot. They are part of the overall lifestyle packets that makes this property and all these properties in Macao and Singapore so compelling to consumers. You walk through the Four Seasons you walk through all these very high-end high-street stores full of very chic people dressed very well, buying with both hands. They're packed to the gills in The Venetian. It's just \u2013 honestly, it's an extraordinary part of what we do. And we already have that piece in Singapore as you see $1,900 a foot there. The Venetian which is not necessarily the highest in the market doing $1,700 a foot obviously luxury at Four Seasons $6,000 crazy numbers, but the point is these numbers won't go down, they're going to keep going. And as part of our story, part of our life, the whole feeling of the lifestyle that you get in Macao, if you hadn't walked through it recently, you should, because the quality of merchandise that we have achieved, the quality consumer and the way that fits in with all of them, you guys \u2013 I was there just you watch these entertainment packages show up at weekends, they will packing the malls, it's all part of the approach where gambling is obviously critical in Macao. But we're starting a lifestyle over there and it's an essential part of who we are. And I don't think it's going to diminish, I think it's going to keep growing both in Singapore and Macao. Felicia Hendrix : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anil Daswani from Citigroup. Your line is open. Anil Daswani : Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the Marina Bay Sands. Could you comment a little bit on the time lines of when you expect the project to be able to open? And also could you give us some more color on the option for the additional 2,000 square feet of gaming area? Will that be focused on premium mass rooms in the new tower? Or are you going to focus everything on the existing casino? Patrick Dumont : Hey, it's Patrick. Thanks very much for the question. I think there is two things to think about. I think there's a lot of work to be done on the front-end. This is a very, very significant investment and a very meaningful project for Singapore. And like the initial Marina Bay Sands development, there is going to be a lot of review. Our goal is to have this thing open as quickly as possible. Our Chairman's view is that everything should be opened as quickly as The Venetian, which I think was 18 months. Is that right? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Patrick Dumont : So we're going to do our best. As a practical matter on page 16, we have a CapEx slide that you can see. We kind of laid out our preliminary views based on our development team's initial works. I think we're looking to open this thing by the end of 2023 although hopefully we'll be able to get it sooner. For those of you who remember, the initial Marina Bay Sands development had some interesting in-ground issues related to water, sands, mud and a whole bunch of other things. So hopefully, we've learned from that and we can move a little more quickly. But we like to believe that this is something that by 2023 we're open and trading. And I think the \u2013 sorry, what was the second part of the question? Rob Goldstein : The gaming piece. Patrick Dumont : Oh, the gaming piece, sorry excuse me. The gaming piece. So all of the benefits associated with this development that we may receive are dependent on us achieving certain milestones. So this is something that it effect when we do the development and complete these milestones, we'll have the ability to access some of these benefits to the gaming. Anil Daswani : Okay. As a follow-up on the premium mass player that we've been seeing and the strong growth that you guys have been experiencing in premium mass in Macao, could you comment on whether it's best size or the sheer number of players that are driving this business for you guys? Rob Goldstein : Interesting question. I don't know the answer on top of my head. I think it's -- for sure it's more players showing up. That's a given. I'm not sure it's bet size as much as it's just a lot more people showing up. And again, I think, it's about where you sleep depends on where you gamble. And since we have most of the better rooms and scale in Macao, be it the Four Seasons or The Venetian or The Parisian, you tend to get the lion's share of wallet when you got the suite they want to stay in. They may wander off to another campus, but the truth is, in our buildings they have the shows they want, they have the food they want, they have the retail they want, they have the spa they want. So we get an outsized wallet share and I think visitation is up on that premium mass segment. There's no question it's growing. I don't think its bet size. I have to ask around on that question in detail, but I think it's more about the amount of customers showing up and they're sure showing up, again, $1.5 billion this quarter. It's just a spectacular number when you think about the margins against that segment. And we were built for this segment and this segment is coming on strong. Anil Daswani : Thank you for taking my questions. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Arpinae [ph] on behalf of Robin. What is your view on Macao VIP and particularly on Q1 VIP declines? Do you feel like that was sort of trade-related -- trade war-related? And do you see that improving as you look into Q2 in terms of overall market declines? Rob Goldstein : Clearly, numbers speak for themselves. There was a decline and I'd be foolish to guess exactly why, is it macro, is it China macro, is it trade war. I think that'd be silly to opine on something I don't have real visibility into. I want to tell you though that having been in Macao for a long time, I can promise you VIP will resurrect and it's still an important segment and it trades in tandem with the very highest end of the premium mass market, the super premium mass and probably trades in sympathy with those kinds of people. Yes, I think, we believe VIP is worth investing in. We're doing that right now. We believe it will come back. This quarter was obviously disappointing for the market in terms of the decline. And, again, I won't speculate on whether it's the economy, where this is smoking, or there's a trade war. I just don't know the answer to that. What I do know is, it will come back. And I do know we're going to invest heavily if we want to get our fair share, because we think it's an important segment to be in, we think our products are made for it and we think our new VIP rooms and our better relationships will enhance our ability to get more of that share when it comes back. But that's the best I can tell you. The market speaks for itself and you draw your own conclusions based on Macao as for the decline. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on a good quarter. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. David Katz : I wanted to just ask about your impressions of the economic context or the economic backdrop in China and how that's playing into the Macao business. Having made a recent visit, having seen some of the -- heard some of the commentary and seeing what the numbers today are, how are you thinking about the rest of the year? Rob Goldstein : Well, we like to see -- look, they were not experts in the economy and I think, again, I'll be remiss to talk about how we view a huge nation. I will say, again, tourism and premium mass appears to be outbound towards the strong. The premium mass play into the town is strong. Base mass is just volume. We don't try to pretend we're seeing the macroeconomic climate in China and give an opinion on that, because there's so many different points of view and it changes so rapidly. But I will tell you that I think, again, Macao is showing real strength as evidenced by our numbers. And all I can point to is our success. I can't see the entire -- the other people's numbers how they did. But our premium mass, base mass and demand for rooms is very, very strong. It's excellent and it's evidenced by the $858 million quarter. And that's all we look at, how we see it. It's a day-by-day week-by-week things that there are in mark-to-market. We don't pretend it will happen six months from now. We all know what the impact would be if the trade war's resolved. We just don't know the answer to that. All we do is run our business, look at outbound tourism. It's strong in Macao, it's strong in our buildings and I'll stop with that comment. David Katz : You've said it. My follow-up is, under what circumstances -- are there any circumstances, where you would consider pursuing any growth or development in Las Vegas? Patrick Dumont : Well, I think -- it's Patrick. I think we spoke about this a little bit in a prior question, but we're investing heavily in Las Vegas. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars of CapEx in room refresh, the casino refresh and we're doing our restaurants and entertainment spaces. We feel very strongly about the trajectory of Las Vegas and the potential, particularly with some of the investments we have coming in as we mentioned and as Rob mentioned, the MSG Sphere which is going to be the most technologically advanced arena in the world, where we can see it's going to be an absolutely stunning investment, because it will be completely unique, like a must-see globally. We're very excited about this stuff. So we continuously reinvest in Las Vegas to improve our offerings, because it's competitive out there. I don't know that we're interested in doing a ground-up development because we have such a great asset base already where we sit. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it today. I don't know Rob if you have any other comments. Rob Goldstein : I think to Patrick's point, the returns here, it's a lodging-based market. Let's not look otherwise. It's a great place to live and work and we've made a great -- our buildings have performed very well. The problem for us, Dave, is the returns outside here is far greater. I think this Singapore project is going to be extraordinary. If we get it right, it's going to shock a few people. And over the years we've made some pretty good bets over the years with -- in Macao and Singapore. This one I think is going to be a very ,very good investment and will surprise a lot of people. Obviously, Macao is the same way. We're deep into this circa [ph] situation. We have few other jurisdictions we're looking at, which we won't tell you which they are. But we are always looking and the problem is, Las Vegas doesn't have the return that we get in other markets, except for our own building. As Patrick alluded to, we'll invest heavily in The Venetian and Plaza. And we are making some very large bets in this building to make it better and improve it and stay current. But I don't foresee us investing in Las Vegas, because everything's out there and the rest of the jurisdictions are so much better in terms of return on our investment. And again, Singapore is a very large bet, but it's also a great investment. Q \u2013 David Katz : Thank you, very much, appreciate it. Operator : Our last question is from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Jared Shojaian : Hey everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about hold on the mass side? Obviously VIP was above the range, but it seems like you're non-rolling chip win rates were a bit higher than normal too. Anything different operationally or that you saw in terms of play? Or do you think that's sort of simply just holding better on the luck side? A \u2013 Rob Goldstein : Probably, we held it in the range. I think I would say that is we held it in the range. Let's begin there. We held the high end of the range, but within the range. And again that's just one indicator. Drop is one indicator not a perfect one or volume. The base mass business and premium mass business is growing very, very strong. The weakness in the non-rolling business resides at the super premium mass, again which trades kind of in tandem in sympathy with the junket segment. All I'd say is, we didn't hold outside the range which is good. If we only could make $6 billion this year and normally we're not going to be happy, I'll leave it there. It's not an exceptional result. When we hold 2021, we don't call it out and say, we were held a few points at the low end of the range. So you can make an argument that premium mass helps us and we sure get our fair share of really high-end premium mass play and lots of it and perhaps that helped this quarter, but it could be down next quarter. When it's all said and done, it's not an event, it's not going to matter at the end of a day, but a $1.52 billion result in non-rolling tables is just a great quarter with margins to match, so we're very pleased. Q \u2013 Jared Shojaian : All right, thank you. And then just switching over to Singapore again. Can you give us some sense as to what percentage of your GGR is I guess coming from guests that are exposed to the entry fee? And then in the near term, puts and takes, obviously you have the higher entry fee, but then you get the additional slots later this year. How are you thinking about Singapore in terms of the 2020 net impact? Is it EBITDA positive, neutral, negative versus what you were thinking before the announcement? A \u2013 Patrick Dumont : So we don't really get into the details about splits of EBITDA from locals. I think the key thing here is this is a great investment for us and a tremendous investment for Singapore. And we work very closely with Singapore to establish the program and to decide exactly how to do this. I know that other co-concessionaire did as well. This is a massive amount of foreign investment going to Singapore that's going to fundamentally allow for a step function and growth in leisure and business tourism. This is a very big deal for us and a very big deal for Singapore. We're very proud and very lucky to be able to do this. And I think in our minds, this is something that over time will be a very favorable long-term investment. We don't know the timing of everything yet, so it's hard to answer your question about cash flows, but we take a very long-term view. And over the next 30 years, this is going to be a great investment for us and a great investment for Singapore just as the original MBS building was as well. And so I think, on page 27, we kind of lay out the investment case for Singapore a little bit. We have a couple of slides where we show the growth in tourism. We talk about some of the investment that Singapore is making in Changi Airport. How that infrastructure addition is going to help tourism growth? And just we address some of the themes around why the IR expansion will deliver, what we all hope it will deliver. We're very focused on this arena. We have great success with our arena in Macao. It's something that we feel like LVS will be the Asian leader in live entertainment with the ability to program these two great venues. And we think it will be something that will really benefit Singapore and benefit us, mostly from the desirability of our resort as well as our ability to fill our hotel rooms. So from our standpoint, it's hard for me to answer your question, what's going to happen and timing of cash flows because we're not really at close yet. What I can tell you the long-term thesis is a strong one. We're very enthusiastic about this investment. We feel it's a great one for the company and will produce good returns as well as the fact that it will enhance the overall attractiveness of the MBS asset as well as drive additional leisure and business tourism in Singapore. So from our standpoint, this was tremendous and we're very proud about it. We're very excited to do it. But I can't give you specifics about exactly the timing of cash flows or the slot machines or entry or tax increases because we're not there yet. A \u2013 Rob Goldstein : One thing I will add to Patrick's comments though the answer to your question about local versus foreign, it's clear when you build 1000 square-foot suites and you build this kind of arena, you're focusing on foreign tourism. The growth here will come from premium mass people outside of Singapore. That is where the -- that\u2019s where the growth resides. It's all those people in countries around Singapore. That's why we're building this thing. If we didn't see that kind of growth we wouldn't build all these keys and build this arena. And we believe there are so many drivers of profitability from the ADR, from the gaming side, from the retail side. It's a wonderful opportunity. But again, the laser focus is premium mass foreign tourism. Q \u2013 Jared Shojaian : All right. Thank you very much, Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Las Vegas Sands Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Daniel Briggs, you may begin your conference. Daniel Briggs : Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides in our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question so we might allow everyone with interest an opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today. We want everyone to know that Sheldon is doing fine. Patrick and I were there last week in Israel and he's in great spirits. We look forward to him rejoining our next conference call in October. Let's get to our results; we had another strong quarter across all of our markets. Company adjusted EBITDA was $1.27 billion. In Macao, adjusted property EBITDA was $765 million, up 2% over the prior year. We grew our mass table and slot revenues by 6% over the prior year with record volumes in the base mass table segment. Our market share for the quarter was approximately 23% consistent with prior year. More importantly our profitability is to lead the industry EBITDA margins at 35.6% up another 20 basis points year-on-year. The Parisian Macao had a strong quarter with the adjusted EBITDA of $139 million, with mass win per day growing by 27% year-on-year aided by the introduction of our new suits. During the quarter we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Sands Macao opening, which marked the beginning of Macao's amazing transformation. Sheldon's vision more than a decade ago to create the critical mass of integrated resorts on Cotai with hotel, entertainment, retail, and MICE facilities positions us well for the future. There is no better market in the world than Macao with regards to continuous deployment of our capital. We look forward to making additional investments in Macao as we contribute to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. With the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the ongoing development of the Greater Bay initiatives, which we believe Macao has the potential to become the MICE capital of Asia. And we fully intend to contribute to that goal, both through our existing assets and future investments. Let's turn to Singapore. Adjusted EBITDA was $346 million. Proven MICE EBITDA was consistent with prior year at $384 million. Growing volumes increased by 23% over prior year while mass win per day was consistent year-over-year in Singapore dollar terms. The hotel continues to enjoy strong occupancy and the retail sales per square foot increased by 10%. Our Las Vegas operations had a very strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $136 million. During this quarter we completed the sale of the Sands Bethlehem. This project has been a great success for the company not just financially but in terms of its positive impact on the wider regional economy and local community. It's a great example of how our developments can drive economic growth for our host communities. I like to thank all the team members for their dedication and professionalism over the years, and wish them the best of luck in the future. Finally, we see to increase the return of capital to shareholders. And just like your dividend, we repurchased $180 million of stock in the quarter. Thanks for joining us today. Let's go to the questions. Dan? Daniel Briggs : Operator, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : I mean, good afternoon, I'm pleased to say good morning. I think it's because the new fonts on your deck through me, Dan. So just looking at your mass results with the base up almost 15% and premium mass down about 4%, Rob, just wondering if you could talk about the complexion of the premium mass declines? Was it mostly in the supreme mass or was it across the whole segment? And also, just wondering if you could talk about the performance fees of either ramping premium product in the market? So, I'll stop there and then I'll ask my follow up. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Felicia. Apologies for Dan's thought. I share your pain. Let's got to our base mass and premium mass segments in perspective, our drop in the second quarter I think was about $6.1 billion. That was up year-on-year and also quarter-on-quarter. So, think about that for a second, our second quarter drop has succeeded our first quarter, despite Chinese news and the seasonality issue. I think you all know that Q2 is typically our weakest quarter. We have the largest base mass business by far in Macao. And this quarter's performance was exceptional. On the largest base in the mark we do know the 14.7 year-on-year. I think the bridge has been helpful. But the real story here resides in our capacity in lodging, gaming, entertainment and retail assets. We dominate the base mass segment and our competitive advantage is undeniable and it will live on for quite a few years, I believe. So, I've looked at our premium mass business which you reference as well. Again, we have the largest premium mass business in Macao and the largest margin in that segment. Volumes were consistent and that's with Q1, our miss came in the whole percentage not in the volume. The volume was there, the whole percentage wasn't. Put in perspective, our mass business and premium mass business exceeds $25 billion a drop annually based on current run rate, so a miss in whole percentage point or two or perhaps three creates a massive impact on our results. I guess this is demonstrated by the results in this segment from Q1 versus Q2. You can do the math and realize the swings here are in the hundreds of millions of dollars on an annualized basis. So, let's discuss what we're doing about it in the next couple of years. While others are talking about what they're going to build down the road we are building, we're building 1200 exceptional suites for Londoner and the Four Seasons. And these are large, very large, stunning suites the highest quality will open throughout 2019. Some open actually this fall throughout 2020. And these suites are laser focused on the premium mass customer at the highest level. Our suite product will exceed most of our competitors till key camp by the end of 2020. Macao rewards quality product and scale. And we have the product to drive exceptional premium mass play as a result of our products. We expect to dominate that segment in the same manner we dominate based mass play. The future Macao today and tomorrow is mass and printing mass. And we believe rolling in chunk of business while with helpful the real future lie \u2013 our growth relies on mass and premium mass growth. The profit drivers remain these segments and the actual driver of these segments is product. Product is scale and quality. We made on this phone call a couple years ago, a very large strategic bet on the future Macao. And we decided to invest over $2 billion US at a time and others were unwilling uncertain. We made that bet. That decision we front and center next year as we complete the Four Seasons suites. We'll have approximately 3000 suites in Macao and that excludes the 750 square foot suites at the Venetian. If you include those our portfolio is over 5500 suites. Macao's future growth will be in the mass segment, our structural advantage already evident in the base miss this will not change. Our goal is to extend the advantage in the premium mass segment. In the next 18 months, we'll see the introduction of a product that's superior from a design perspective, but also from a scale perspective. And that will be proven out the next few years our performance as we get stronger and stronger in this premium mass segment. And we're very sure about how we feel about this product and how it will perform the market. So maybe that adds some color to the volume issues as well as the whole percentage issue Felicia. Felicia Hendrix : Yeah, it is. And just the kind of follow up on that, I mean, you guys actually did come in on the mass side better than we were expecting on both mass \u2013 and both the volume and the whole or the win rather. But just kind of looking sequentially both at your mass market share and even your VIP share, it looks sequentially like you did lose some share. And I'm assuming that is kind of what you were alluding to in those comments on that premium mass side and on the VIP side there's some new products now and you're rolling yours out next year. So maybe you could just \u2013 Rob Goldstein : I think to that point, we \u2013 again, to be real clear about this, our successes quarter 14% year-on-year growth in base mass shows the power of these products we have currently in the market. But I think our future success will dominate base mass, I think for the next five years, I don't see anything else happening in the market, it would really hurt us in terms of that growth. But we really want to focus and be laser focused on that premium mass customer. We believe that customer response to product. So, you open a Londoner with approximately 5800 keys, a brand new fa\u00e7ade, a brand new casino floor, you get that Four Seasons building open with 290 super large suites of quality, the same thing with the suites inside Londoner on the APEC side. And all of a sudden you had a product that probably is undeniable to our suite capacity, and all the retail and the other price we have in that market entertainment. I think it puts us in a position for the future that is dominant. I just believe that \u2013 I think the success at Macao in Morpheus is evident. We see that time and time again, product works in this market. And we're dedicated to giving not just large scale product, but great quality product. And I think our success attrition as evidenced by the comments in the opening, we opened that hotel to about $100 million run rate per quarter, it's now morphed to 140, 50, 60. It's a $600 million store performing very, very well. And the growth there comes out of premium as in that new suite product at the present. We expect the same to happen. We've seen it at Venetian; we've seen the Parisian they will happen again at Four Seasons. Think about a brand new Four Seasons building with gaming capacity, 290 exceptional suites. And then on top of that, we open Londoner. Our portfolio is going to be in a very different place inside the next 18 months. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, but for this quarter what place are you in just in terms of some of the competing product that's out there. Rob Goldstein : Well, I think you see that we're still \u2013 we're number one in the market in both base mass and premium mass. The growth again this quarter, for the lack of growth is more tied to \u2013 our volumes were fine, we're consistent, Q1 was consistent with Q2 which I think is a great statement. Where we've missed is in the quarter where you weren't called normalized whole percentage and how you address that these days is confusing that's evolving that whole situation what you think is it 22, is it 24, is it 25, people raising their estimates, but our miss again is tied to our whole being different in Q2 than Q1. And that's the whole difference. Our base mass was extraordinary. It's our premium mass that missed and especially the [indiscernible]. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, great. Thanks for all that color. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Another question from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Good afternoon, so just on Singapore a bit. The increased entry libraries went into fact in the beginning of April, how are you seeing that effect play? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Yeah, it's negative in terms of \u2013 we've had some pushback against the levy but hasn't affected our volumes very much. It's been \u2013 it's phenomenal, you would expect the price increase to see some pushback and has been from the low end of the customer base. It's already stabilized and probably the upswing. Now, the impact is negligible. It's a few points maybe of drop on the non-rolling. And I think you'll see a comeback in Q3 and Q4. Like anything we price it up there's going to be initial negative reaction, no one's celebrating the increase of HTC. But it's not material and that impactful. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thanks and then just in terms of Vegas, your baccarat business was really strong in the quarter recognizing you had a soft 2Q 18, but it just stands out where it was strong in the face of the market weakness and some of your peers talking about weakness in that segment. Can you just talk about how \u2013 your perception of what's going on there. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Sure. We're very proud of Vegas performance. I think it's the best known history are not as close to it. Everything worked in this quarter from a gaming and lodging perspective. The race was strong, the occupancy, our business was very good. The baccarat grew and I think again we'll use the term highly concentrated. Our future in Las Vegas, I think is less and less dependent on the super high end and more dependent on slot, ETG and premium mass kind of mimics was happening now with it. Again, as you know, this is primarily lodging mark, we remain strong in lodging piece of our business quarter after quarter, we faltered in the gaming point, a lot of volume in someone's been holding percent this quarter we held okay, our volumes are better. I wouldn't call it a trend. I wouldn't try to extrapolate how it plays across the market in Las Vegas. I think this mark remains \u2013 you can make a lot of money here as you focus on the hospitality piece and if you have the right gaming mix and you run your full property, watch your cost. And we are good quarter and we're very proud of that we have like in the first half the retracting I think it's close to 270 EBITDA. So, we could have a record year here in Las Vegas. But again, I think on the baccarat piece Thomas, less inclined to believe that's going to be a trend that we're going to see quarter after quarter of strong performance. I do think we'll see our overall table and slot business ramp up especially in the premium mass side. We're building product for that. We're just not in the casino floor. We're very \u2013 we run our business very close to the vest, look at everything we can do on the floor to maximize profitability in this quarter it really paid off and it will pay off the rest of the year. Patrick Dumont : One of the things to note is that we have been reinvesting significantly in Las Vegas over time. So, we'd like to believe that through those investments, both the room product and the casino floor, both on the Palazzo side, food and beverage operations as well as the rest of the campus, that you see some growth in cash flow. So hopefully this can continue because we're going to continue to invest and hopefully grow the market. Thomas Allen : Makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Joe Greff : And good afternoon, guys. Rob, my question really relates back to the Macao premium mass results. Just I'm understanding all your comments which we appreciate. You're saying premium mass volumes in the 2Q were consistent with the 1Q, so I'm presuming you're saying that flat sequentially, what we're doing in that \u2013 Rob Goldstein : I think it's down 25, 3% if I recall. Joe Greff : Okay and what would it be on a year-over-year basis, so just not taking into account variations and whole percentage. Rob Goldstein : Yes, and a premium mass drop in Q1 of '18 versus \u2013 Q2 '18 versus Q2 '19. Patrick Dumont : Correct. Jeff, that's not really something that we put out publicly just in terms of the way to compare it with that breakdown. So, I think just in general, you should look at the wins for guidance and just see that. The business itself is healthy. In the long run, it's going to continue to grow based on the investment that Rob referenced in the earlier question around how we see the business and what our positioning is. And in the long run, this is something that will do quite well, right. I think the key thing here is if you look back as the best that the Sheldon made more than a decade ago, this brilliant bet to invest in scale, to invest in non-gaming amenities, to really create the critical mass that allows people to show up and have a lifestyle type experience. So, they can go to a show, go to retail, go to the best restaurants that they've been to, and then stay in some of the highest quality suites that are offered in the world. You're going to realize that with the additional suite products that Rob referenced, we're going to have premium mass growth. We're going to see the best customers available come to us because of the amenity mix, because of the experience we offer to them, because of the high quality gaming environments that we have. So, we don't typically get this granular on premium mass drop in the way to split is because at the end of the day, the business is managed, in aggregate from the standpoint of production on return on invested capital. And so, when you look at our results over time, we think we've been very good at capital allocation, we think we've been very good at investing in the right assets to the right quality level, we're getting better at it. And we think this next step that Rob referred to is going to really leverage the initial bet that Sheldon made years ago and scale and propel us to the next category. So, I think you look at this year-over-year and 2Q '18, you see that we \u2013 our mass table win was 663 million, it's a great \u2013 it's a \u2013 it's a spectacular number. And then we did 635 this quarter again, there's some hold in there, there's some other factors in there. But as a practical matter, the business continues to be very healthy. So, I think you have to think about this as a long term business. And you have to think about it the trajectory that we've experienced over the last couple of years, particularly as the inbound or the outbound tourism growth from China has been [indiscernible]. So, we feel very strongly about. Rob Goldstein : So, I think that \u2013 just a comment further on the ecosystem we have there besides the new Apple store, the theatre and the retail and the endless advantages we have. I do think you have to pay attention in suite mix in Macao. Again, a lot of people talking about they're going to build this and build that. I don't blame them. The most coveted asset in Macao today is rooms and suites. The one thing everybody wants more of is rooms and suites. And I think it's clear to see where our trajectory has been last four or five years in that segment, we just keep growing year after year, whether we missed by a quarter by a point or two or grow by a point or two the fact is we're approaching this year, probably $25 billion in those two segments base and premium, you put that against anyone else's business, there's no comparison. When we get lucky where we hold at the high end of range, we have $800 million, $900 million opportunities, we don't hold lucky we hold down the 750 or 740 range. But in the end, if you look at where we're going with our product offerings and our suite and table, our entertainment our retail, scale and size and quality, I think it's undeniable we're going to go in this premium mass segment. We won't be able to dominate as clearly as we do with the base mass, but I think we'll come off to close. Joe Greff : Got it, it's helpful. And then just my follow up, I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to get clarification from you guys. When I'm looking at Sands Cotai \u2013 Sands [indiscernible] performance in the 2Q front, would you say anything that was being negatively impacted by any renovation disruption or any pre planning or anything related to the Londoner? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, you've got \u2013 you've 1200 keys we're ripped apart and being transformed into 600 keys, you've got a massive problem in terms of just it just happens. You can't do it quietly. Then you have the disruption that Conrad as a result of the transformation of forest of the holiday into the Londoner suite product and then the facade issues are sort of happening out there. I wouldn't call it national problems, but I'd call there's absolute disruption to some degree coming out of the transformation of Holiday into Londoner, and the Jason Conrad, the noise et cetera. Yeah, it's still a 1200 room transition 600 as a lot of banging and hammering. And this will be upset about it. You can't avoid disruptions when you're transferring your building like we're doing that it's going to get worse, I think, as we get into this further in the year. Joe Greff : Great, thank you. I appreciate the comments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Rob sorry to beat the dead horse on this a little bit, but just on the on the premium mass side. I mean, I think we all have a pretty good feeling for how concentrated some of the VIP businesses especially in market like Singapore and Las Vegas. Can you just give us a little more color maybe at a broad level on the customer base that you're seeing in premium mass in Macao and just \u2013 you talked about the sensitivity around how important a couple point to hold here can be. Is it just a fragment of the customers that are able to move the dial across the whole business or kind of how concentrated is it just to give us a little bit more color in terms of what to expect from a volatility perspective going forward? Rob Goldstein : Let's begin with apples and oranges. You've heard the expression apples and oranges, VIP in Las Vegas and VIP Premium direct rolling in Singapore is night and day apples and oranges versus premium mass and Macao. Macao is a mass premium market with thousands and thousands of customers. In Las Vegas, I say concentrating \u2013 I mean, concentrated, especially in the baccarat Asian piece. That's a very different audience. Same thing in Singapore, I wouldn't mix those two up. It's very important. What you see in China \u2013 in Macao is extraordinary. It is a think about the comment, in all the years I've done this. There's never any market and never will be a market. That one company has $25 billion of roll of drop in a year think about how staggering that number is $25 billion in premium mass and mass. It's not one, it's not 10, it's not 50, it's thousands of people coming in. That's why we're building all these suits and all this product that's laser focused on getting our fair share in fact beyond our fair share, we want to punch above our weight. And so, in Singapore that's the game plan there as well. Be very careful when you allude to VIP because when I think of VIP in Singapore, I think of a very concentrated direct rolling customer. Premium mass is a horse with different color and that customer we are targeting with our new expansion in Singapore, but our \u2013 so you know how we're thinking about this is clear. We want to be the dominant player in Asia, in the premium mass baccarat and mass baccarat business. These assets we're constructing or designing for that audience. We've already because what Sheldon did a decade ago, the scale business, we dominate that, that's pretty clear from the numbers, 15% growth on a huge base mass platform. But to have this thing, these suites especially in Singapore as well as Macao, this is not a small market. This is a very large pool of customers coming out of China, but also from the rip and so I wouldn't worry about. And my point of whole percentage is just that \u2013 my point is we don't know what the \u2013 the whole percentages are moving. I mean, people are constantly updating their whole percentage formula. And it's a very complicated, evolving process in Asia, especially in Macao. It's a fascinating market, but it evolves constantly. The Chinese customer makes counterintuitive bets in my position. They play longer. They have a different exit strategy than other customers. Large players oftentimes make \u2013 that's not discipline but play their proposition play some long hours. The market mix in Asia, in Macao and in Singapore is so different than the US. And of course, gambling in Asia is not as frequent as ever available as is the US. So, when they come to Macao or Singapore, it's more of a \u2013 it's like Vegas was 30 years ago, it's unusual, it's unique, so they stay longer, they play larger, they don't run for the table and they get a head. They bet counter-intuitively. This is a very different audience, but please be careful when you make that comment about is the same as Singapore in Vegas high end, no, it's not. It's a pool of probably 10s of thousands of Asian people who play at that level and it's the reason why Macao is so incredibly important to the data product to address that. Shaun Kelley : Perfect that that definitely answers the question and then the other thing I just \u2013 for my follow up wanted to touch on to hit on the capital you guys are investing to target this customer war, I believe you mentioned a couple of times, both in comments and in your prepared remarks that some of the suite product for the Four Seasons is going to open in the fall. Is that new? And can you give us a little bit sense of how much capacity could come online? You sort of a little bit more about how many rooms and what the timing of that might look like? Patrick Dumont : Hey, it's Patrick. I think if you turn to page 16 in the deck, what you'll see is a slide consistent with one that we've published previously, where we lay out exactly the timeline that we see right now, around these new suite product coming online. So, if you look at the Four Seasons, we're talking about sometime towards the end of Q1 and our goal is Chinese New Year. So that's when you should really start seeing the impact of the Four Seasons suite product. Shaun Kelley : Okay, sorry, I thought I heard something about fourth quarter, but I appreciate that. Thanks, Patrick. Patrick Dumont : No problem. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Anil Daswani of Citi. Anil Daswani : Thanks for taking my question guys. My first one is on the VIP segment, now some of your competitors have opened new VIP products and have actually managed to do the opposite of the market trends. Is there anything you can do different to your product on the VIP side to try and take some share from some of your competitors? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, two slots in there \u2013 we went \u2013 I was there last time in Macao, we toured the new product lead, it was at Macao and also when I believe and they're great salons we're opening the Londoner and Four Seasons brand new salons. I think there'll be very competitive and open next year and they're great product and to your point yes, we can open salons. However, I would be careful in terms that we look at the numbers in those salons and the junk of business in general of the margin and the flow through. We as you see it more deck somewhere represents for sub 10% of our business comes out of the rolling especially junket segment. You know we want to be in that state we always say will be in that segment will spend the capital, we'll compete and we'll compete favorably. But I would caution people to look at the flow through and the margins coming out of the junket business. With the erosion of that segment up with the margins it's less appetizing for the market, but having said that we'll certainly participate. Our new salons at the Four Seasons and at the Londoner will be very competitive and we plan to participants. Yes. Anil Daswani : Thank you as a follow up, could you also tell us what the plans are for the expansion at Marina Bay Sands? Is there a timeline that you can share as to when the new VIP stuff or premium mess stuff in Singapore will be coming online? Rob Goldstein : So, you're pointing to the actual project itself or the stuff that we mentioned in Tower 1? Anil Daswani : I guess something you mentioned in Tower 1 as well as the expansion, please. Patrick Dumont : Yeah, I think if you go to the deck, we've included this slide that we included previously about the Singapore expansion starting on page 22. I think the way to think about it is, as we said before, our goal is to kind of open by the end of 23 kind of be an operation, January 1, '24, we'll see if we can get there. We're working hard to do so. And I think we don't have a precise timeline yet, for the Tower 1 activities. So that's going to be dependent on obviously, the required approvals and some work to get done. We just have to make it happen. So, it's probably going to be a year or two before that comes online. So, nothing near term, we just have to work through that and get the necessary approvals before we can say. Rob Goldstein : Yeah, I just \u2013 to follow on Patrick's comments, what's happening in the so, I should mention to you that our mass casino floor is going through renovation currently and will open renovated by summer of 2020. The new super premium mass levels level two open early 2020, H levels two and three in 21. And keep in mind we're adding additional slot machines, late '20 and another 400 roughly in the balance in '21. So, 500 more games to the floor in '21 and so the market does 700 to 800 hours per unit per day is pretty impacting. Anil Daswani : Thanks for taking my questions guys. Patrick Dumont : No problem, thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Rob, could you talk a little bit on the VIP side as to where you guys kind of are? And I know you're not going to give specific numbers, but where you are with respect to your direct mix of VIP relative to your junket and maybe just benchmark that against prior periods in the history of you guys operating in that business in Macao. Patrick Dumont : Hey, it's Patrick, one thing we don't actually provide that breakdown, we kind of view VIP as a whole as a way to kind of think about the mass win in that business. So just as a practical matter, I think what you'll see is that we're kind of following the trend of the overall Macao market for VIP. And unfortunately, we witnessed a little bit of a contraction in that business. I think the prior question was about our products. We feel like over time as we continue to invest the substantial capital over deploying in Macao that will be much better positioned to grow VIP when there's a rebound the future. This is a business that's seen some cyclicality across years, seen some challenges in the way, customers utilize that type of business and over time, it's always been resilient. And so, we'd like to believe that we're poised to take advantage of the return when it occurs. And in the meantime, we'll keep servicing the customers there as best we can. But in terms of providing specific breakdowns, that's not really something that we're going to we're going to provide at this time. Carlo Santarelli : Understood, Patrick, and maybe if you wouldn't mind. Could you comment a little bit about how you see kind of the junket business shaping up here over the medium term just in terms of consolidation that's occurred within the junket industry and whether you see that kind of continuing or you see that the market may be starting to become a little bit more fragmented as we look out over the next two to three years? Patrick Dumont : It's hard to take that. I don't think it's hard to predict. Obviously, junkets are going to a very, very interior with what's happened in the last month or so. Yeah, it's hard to predict what the junket business ends up being. We're hoping for a resurrection to come back, as we always done that in the past, I assume we'll have a future as well. But there's other markets out there and some of the structures and some of the ways they can gamble makes it hard to figure out how Macao figures into that. I mean, it's confusing. The things that are allowed regulatory wise from other jurisdictions, it's hard for us to really ascertain where the junkets want to go. You know, they want us to redirect our efforts to other jurisdictions. I think that's the biggest question, I think mark will be there, demand is there. I assume liquidity will be okay. But where the customers want to go and where the junkies want to send them. And so, it's hard to say. We always know in the end it's driven by \u2013 product is essential, we'll have the product, but the reality is, I mean, it's a low margin business, and it's challenging. And I think again, it's been challenging structurally from Macao to compete, if other jurisdictions do things and Macao doesn't allow and I applaud the efforts of the Macao regulators to keep it the way it should be, which is done with the integrity in quality. The Macao people, I think have stepped up and done the right thing. And we applaud their efforts. It's quite note \u2013 it's noble to run the business properly and not allow things happen that have been happening. So, we're hoping for a comeback in Macao. So, we have a product ready for that come back. But as you alluded to earlier, we have another side of our business interacting, and that customer adore our salons our suites if in fact the junkets don't participate. But I think we both know Macao is still a very desirable jurisdiction albeit regulated, regulated properly. So that's the way it should happen. Carlo Santarelli : Great, guys. Thank you very much. Patrick Dumont : Thanks Carlo. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I just wanted to see if you could comment on \u2013 I don't know if you have any expectations for the timeline for rebidding on concessions in Macao to stay expectation when might be our fee in the next 12 to 18 months, anything along those lines. Thanks. Patrick Dumont : We currently don't have any information and we're eagerly waiting what we should do. But that being said, we're very proud of the investment that our chairman made when he first started building in Macao and how that blossoms into the largest portfolio of non-gaming amenities. And we also believe that because of our strong relationships and support for small and medium enterprise, we're very well positioned to continue. So, we feel like we've been a very good corporate citizen, we've contributed meaningfully to the economy there. We've done the things we've been asked to do to diversify the economy away from non-gaming. And we're prepared, so we think we have a great case to make for the future. And we're just eagerly waiting. Robin Farley : I guess one of your other concession holders have talked about big non-gaming investment may be added to their \u2013 not necessarily anything that would have to be added before a concession renewal would be known about. But do you have \u2013 you're obviously investing tremendously right now in your Macao properties. When you look out a little further, are there additional things that you think about doing or even have room to do that could add as well outside of what you've already announced for the next two years? Rob Goldstein : Hi, Robin its Rob. I think about it every day. We like to invest with both hands in non-gaming assets because I think if you look our history, we've done it without being really \u2013 they asked us to do things and we over responded. And you see the investment made there with the hotels and the entertainment and the retail and all the things that people thought were crazy are not crazy today. But we like to invest with both hands and the future Macao. We are such believers in the juice. We're proud to be there. I think Pat alluded to what was done 15 years ago, I remember watching it and thinking to myself with this payoff and obviously Sheldon's scale thought process paid off beyond my understanding, it continues to pay off. And I think we would be thrilled. Sheldon, if you ask to invest many more billions of dollars would ask how fast can you get there. And so, we're eagerly waiting for the government\u2019s advices. We are very, very proud of what we've done in Macao. It's been one of the greatest experiences I've ever had in this business. And the government's been nothing, but supportive or proudly part of that process there. We're very proud to be part of the \u2013 we talked about our points of view, which is clear, we'd like to see it evolve even further to maybe the greatest non-gaming jurisdiction. Our retail business there, our entertainment business, our non-gaming lodging business, it's just \u2013 we are huge believers. And we think we're at the beginning that the end of Macao success. So, all they have to do is tell us how much is where and Mr. Adelson will be the happiest guy in the world to write a very big check. Robin Farley : Okay, great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Just to stick with the premium mass theme for a second, I know this might be a hard question to answer. But do you think the conclusion is that links of play is down from 1Q to 2Q? And then as I think about a normalized run rate for mass win percentage, do you think 1Q was more of an anomaly or do you think 2Q is more of an anomaly? Patrick Dumont : Good question, Justin, good question. Well, the first question you asked about the time play I don't think that's worth worrying about. We don't see any evidence of that, if anything this market. If you haven't spent enough time there watching the way these customers come and gamble and again, the only legal jurisdiction available to close to mainland China is Macao. And in case you haven't been there recently, it's extraordinary place. I mean, it's evolved to a place I think one of the reasons Vegas will have a difficult time in the future is it's such an attractive environment for gamers. And it's got all the bells and whistles, all the dining and retail and entertainment if you want right across the bridge there. So, it's pretty extraordinary and the bridge, of course added \u2013 it gilded that already big lily. So, I don't worry at all about Chinese people gaming longer. That's not a problem at all. As far as you know, that business where it goes just gets bigger and better. And I wouldn't worry at all about these people coming in and that business growing. As your whole percentage question, I think I alluded to it earlier. It's fasting and the Chinese market is somewhat counterintuitive. Having grown up in places like Atlantic City and Las Vegas and in Chicago and even the Caribbean, you have this belief that the larger bank rolled customers would gravitate towards the \u2013 it's called the better advantage bets, but the Chinese are counterintuitive. And they make that one proposition bets they play sometimes only proposition bets, they play far beyond the time you think they would, with most customers you worry about with you adequate time to qualify for complimentary or discounts. The Chinese just wonder if they're going to leave the table. They're a much different profile and I think that lends itself to confusion about whole percentage. We held, I think it was \u2013 what it was 25 or 24 something in Q1, I don't think there is aberration at all. It's just a question of how to mix your bets. When you have a \u2013 it all comes down to how they bet the game. So, this is this is a math business and when they make these bets that help the household higher, you're going to hold higher. And what we saw in Q1 is not aberrational. In fact, I could make the argument that the whole person is gravitating towards the higher end 24, 25, 26 versus 21, 22. The premium mass customer stays longer, has a very confusing exit strategy. They make bets that don't seem to on the face wouldn't be the right thing to do. So, I think you're going to see as premium mass get stronger whole percentages trade up. Am I prepared today was 23 versus 24 versus 20? I don't know. And I think again, depends on the mix of bets events. They bet pairs and ties; they don't go straight bet \u2013 bank player over there. They bet the lucky six, they bet things that we find somewhat confusing as operators. But it's an incredible market. Also, they come from faraway places and they stay longer. And so, when they get to Macao it's not just, they're going to go back to their home city no place the gamble, so they have an outsize gaming appetites, but clearly, it's a mathematical equation that we can always gauge. But I don't think anyone's prepared to take exactly as a 23s, 24s, 25, we do know things are trading up though the whole markets moving towards a higher whole percentage category which is helpful to us and our fellow operators, competitors. So again, as the market mix changes, players come from further away, more premium mass. I think you're going to see whole percentage trade up. Is our first quarter repeatable? I believe it's absolutely repeatable. I think this business is going to evolve further, but no one I've met can tell exactly what the whole percentage numbers should be. Jared Shojaian : Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then can you just talk about the promotional environment on the junket side and specifically if you've seen any changes in commission structures from any of your peers? Patrick Dumont : Now, I don't think that's an issue today. I think the junket business in flux, but I don't believe it's about as promotional, I think it is more about where the customers want to go, what the better products are and frankly it's a jurisdictional decision. I mean, I think some customers are moving towards \u2013 maybe promotional in other jurisdictions offer better bet or better circumstance than we do in Macao. But again, I think Macao will stay \u2013 it's the gold standard for the regulatory environment there in terms of keeping it consistent, keeping it accurate. I think what they've done is exemplary. And I think we're lucky to be part of a jurisdiction that runs that business in the manner the Macao does right. I don't think it's about promotional within Macao. It may be promotional outside of Macao, other jurisdictions that could be hurtful to the junkie revenues. Jared Shojaian : Excellent, thank you very much. Patrick Dumont : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of David Katz of Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask about, one of the areas we're constantly trying to monitor is the Chinese economy and the degree to which it is helping and hurting business and quite frankly we've seen some mixed signals in that regard. If you could share whatever perspective you might have in that regard. And my second follow up is, as I look at the capital that you've laid out between Macao and \u2013 assuming that you were successful in winning a bid in \u2013 with the winning bid in Japan, we've gotten so used to a pristine balance sheet. Where might you see that going and where would you be comfortable leverage wise as we look out over the next several years? Rob Goldstein : I'll cover that. Patrick Dumont : Fine, why don't we address the capital structure first? If you look at our capital structure, and you look at the nature of the way we borrowed, I think the key thing here is that we've been very conservative with the anticipation of having the opportunity to develop in Japan. So, we always wanted to make sure that we had ample balance sheet capacity to be able to fulfill our chairman's highest and best use, which is deploying capital in new projects. And so, we would only invest in something that has a high return threshold that meets his criteria and the board's criteria. And so from that standpoint, I think if you look at the timing of Japan, look at \u2013 you referenced both Singapore and Macao, you look at the timing and delivery of those projects, and the potential cash flow growth that Rob alluded to out of Macao and some of those investments and what our view is on what the appropriate return is in Singapore. You see that the timing actually fits quite well for the growth in EBITDA and decrease of the balance sheet capacities in order to fund the development in Japan. And so, we're very much looking forward to the opportunity. Unfortunately, the timeline is not so obvious and it's also not so short. It's possible that it may take several years even before an operator is selected. So, during that time, we'd like to believe that our assets in Macao and in Singapore will continue to grow their cash flows as they establish a stronger position in the market and enhance our already very strong offerings. And so, from our standpoint, we feel very strongly about our financial discipline and about our financial policies that we've addressed before. Our chairman has said that he's very focused on a two to three times leverage level, we're very focused on maintaining and upgrading our investment grade ratings, this is something that's very important to us for the long term. And we think it has very strong strategic advantages for us as a company. And so, we'll be very careful and very mindful as the board looks at these issues, to ensure that we keep our leverage level and our capital profile and our investment level and our assets to the right levels in order to ensure that we get the outcome that we're discussing. And so, we're ready for Japan and we're looking forward to the opportunity. It's just not super near term. And so, with that, we think we'll have plenty of capacity to get it done and stay within the levels that we've discussed. Alright, and I think I'll turn over to Rob a little bit for the Chinese economy question. Rob Goldstein : Yeah, David we're here anecdotally, I don't want to say this is anything to take too seriously. But we are actively from our people work in the casino that customers are concerned with trade war is impacting some of their business thing or the entrepreneurial people probably affected more at the higher end. People own their own businesses or work for companies that are being impacted by is not a good thing from their perspective. We hear very positive feedback to why can't this war be resolved, but we don't have \u2013 based on our base mass growth and base we're seeing in general, the callous like it's doing just fine. I wouldn't want to try to put the trade war in the front and center of any real concerns other than anecdotally, occasionally hear from a VIP customer. I heard it from my customer here in Las Vegas recently Chinese customer that it's really impactful, but I don't have to clarify that or put a real number that makes any sense against the business again. When you wrote 15% your base mass and the premium mass business, we're going to have record levels this year. How do you complain? How do you really find concern? This is \u2013 now, maybe we're wrong, maybe this will ware will be resolved shortly. I see that there's a couple of things happening in the headlines and maybe have an impact to your business. It can't hurt us. It would probably help us once it's resolved. It's a positive for China, positive for the US and we're hopeful it gets resolved, but to give you real other than occasional anecdotal feedback would be incorrect. Yeah. David Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now all disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, and thank you for joining us on the call today. With me on the call today are Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Finally, for those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Mr. Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you Dan, and good afternoon everyone. As you all know, I've missed our earnings conference call these last few quarters. So, let me begin by saying I feel good, I'm very happy to be here with Rob, Patrick and the team and I look forward to our discussion today. Let me also say that I am extremely touched by all the calls and emails I've received over the past several months. It has been remarkable to hear from so many people, including many of you joining us today. I deeply appreciate the well wishes, and everyone who took the time to reach out to me. It certainly means a lot.  With that, let me tell you about our strong financial results, and our unique strategic position. Our company is today as strong as it has ever been. Our balance sheet is robust as evidenced by our investment grade credit ratings, at both Las Vegas Sands and Sands China. I want to point out to you that S&P included us in the S&P 500 as of October 3rd. So, we\u2019ve been part of the S&P 500 for about three weeks. Our cash flow generation is unmatched in our industry with annualized adjusted property EBITDA of over US$5 billion. I think it's nothing to next. Our development pipeline at both Macao and Singapore is exceptionally exciting with over US$5 billion of capital projects coming to fruition in Asia, over the course of the next few years. These investments will further strengthen our leading position in the premium mass, MICE, entertainment and other non-gaming segments in Asia. At the same time, we will continue to enthusiastically pursue the right development opportunity in Japan. Now, let's turn to our financial results. We had another strong quarter across all of our markets. Company-wide adjusted property EBITDA was US$1.28 billion. In Macao, adjusted property EBITDA was $755 million, consistent with the prior year. While overall Macao gross gaming revenues declined for the quarter, the mass-market continues to experience robust growth. We grew our mass-gaming revenues by 9% over the prior year with strong growth in both mass tables and slots, and in both the premium mass and mass segments. Most importantly, our profitability continues to lead the industry, with adjusted property EBITDA margin at 35.7%, up another 70 basis points compared to the prior year. We're certainly more excited about our ongoing investment of US$2.2 billion to expand our critical mass of non-gaming offerings in Macao. Various components of these projects are already underway, and we look forward to giving you further updates in the coming months. We remain steadfast and I believe that Macao is the best market in the world with respect to the continued deployment of our capital. We look forward to making additional investments in Macao as we contribute to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. With the opening of the Hong Kong's Zhuhai Macao Bridge, and the ongoing development at Bay initiatives, we believe Macao has the potential to become the MICE capital of Asia, and we fully intend to contribute to that goal, both through our existing assets and future investments.  In Singapore, adjusted property EBITDA was US$435 million, up 4% over the prior year. Rolling volumes were strong and/or above the level of the prior year. Mass win per day remains solid. The hotel continues to enjoy near full occupancy and retail sales per square foot increased by 10%. Our Las Vegas operations had another good quarter with adjusted property EBITDA of US$93 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year. Finally, we continue to increase the return on capital to shareholders. The Las Vegas Sands' Board of Directors just approved an increase in our annual dividend for the calendar year 2020 to $3.16 per share or $0.79 per share per quarter. A: dividends. I guess you missed that. Thanks again for joining us on the call today. It's really great to be back. Now, let's take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hey guys, thank you and Mr. Adelson welcome back. Maybe, this question is best for Rob, just in terms of obviously what you guys saw in the 3Q, it looked like you saw some strength in both the core mass segment or base mass segment as well as a little bit of a pivot in the premium mass segment, which also grew fairly well. Just wondering, if there is any dynamics that you're seeing that are changing, as obviously VIP remained a challenge throughout the 3Q, and I guess it was a little bit surprising to see the premium mass perform the way that it did. Rob Goldstein : Yes, nice surprise. So, as you know, I mean Macao is the world's largest gaming market and the current, future growth of that market is predicated on the mass market. If you look at Page 16 in the deck, you can see the continual year-after-year growth of this segment, and this is the segment that matters, let's be honest. And we are the market leader in those segments; mass to premium mass and slots. And that segment depends on rooms and suites and gaming capacity. Even though, we lead the market in rooms and suites, the completion of the Four Seasons, Londoner will put us in a more stable position than ever. Its quality, its quantity will enable us to dominate this critical segment for years ahead. When you couple that with our retail entertainment product, our competitive position is kind of hard to beat and we're very fortunate.  As you referenced, our rolling segment results were softer, but this segment represents less than 10%, I think Dan said 7% or 8% of our cumulative EBITDA composite. The other 90% plus is reliant on the mass segment. And to your comment that mass win for the quarter reached $1.6 billion, base mass was at $762 million, I think that was all-time high. Our premium mass grew to $674 million, which is $16,000 plus per table and the slots went to $160 million per quarter. As our future and the future of Macao is mass, and visitation continues to improve, the quarter for us was very, very positive except for the softness in the rolling segment. But our game plan as you know we said quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, our game plan remains the same. It's more product, we're spending $2 billion plus at Londoner Four Seasons, quality product. The quality we're doing at Four Seasons Londoner will surprise everybody, it surprised us actually. It's pretty spectacular. And so, we don't see a whole lot of changes in this quarter. It's business as usual. It's reinvest in the product, focus on the high-margin mass business, grow our fundamental advantage, which is more retail, more restaurant, more entertainment and most importantly more lodging. So, no real surprises. We're very pleased with the results, especially as you referenced the comeback of our premium mass segment, in particular. Carlo Santarelli : Great, thank you Rob. And just the quick follow-up on the conversion right now, and obviously VIP volumes and lower hold there is kind of making it harder to see straightforward in the results. But when you think about the work that you're doing currently and kind of where you are in the transition, how much disruption do you think is net leaving the system? I know it's probably not easy to handicap but I'm sure you're capturing some of the disruption at your other properties. Do you feel like there is leakage outside of the system from some of the work that you guys are doing there? Rob Goldstein : I think there is going to be disruption, but your reference point is spot on. I think we can capture if the team does their job, capture some of that disruption over region in Four Seasons and in Asia, I'd like to think we can. Having said that, it's a massive project underway. I mean \u201820 will be a disruptive year SCC, there is no denying it. We're transforming a 10-year-old product into something much more desirable for the market. So, there will be some disruption. I'm hoping the team and they claim they can do it, we'll move most of that business over to Four Seasons, Parisian, our other products. Obviously we can do it, where we've got the room capacity, lodging capacity or the gaming capacity. And frankly, we also have the ability to direct people who come for the entertainment product. It's a big positive. As you know, that's a unique differentiator for us over there. So, hopefully when the premium mass come to town, every week we've got a terrific show in there, they can push that customer away from SCC if they so desire. But, I think as we've said repeatedly, the end result is well worth it. What we're building at Londoner, we can't wait to show it to you, we can't to finish it. And the same thing with the room product, we saw a few months ago at the Four Seasons. It's exemplary in every way. Only time will tell. We can't quantify level of disruption. Yes disruption, how much we layer off in other properties? Time will tell. Operator : The next question is from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Thank you, and echoing Carlo's words, hoping you a speedy recovery Mr. Adelson. So, just around sticking with Macao, does it feel like the market is getting impacted by the Hong Kong unrest, and do you feel like your properties are feeling it? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : In Macao, as you know, Thomas, is the mass segment that drives growth, it's that simple. In this challenging macro environment, we just continue to see it grow and grow. And that business revolves around lodging, retail entertainment and we continue to see the numbers to grow in all these areas. The mass keeps growing, premium -- even with our large base, our slots and premium kept growing. And with our CapEx position, it just gets better and better. I also think with our 39 new suites at Londoner and Four Seasons, it just will get better next 18 months for us, especially for family travel, length of stay, our great non-gaming product.  One thing we should reference is, the base mass, the continued improvement in transportation infrastructure connecting Macao will drive growth in visitation, and we can capture a large share of that growth. We're having iconic destinations and our theme resorts like Londoner, Venetian et cetera. So, in this challenging environment, we are really pleased with our results and just see it getting better down the road. Thomas Allen : And then two more specific questions. It seemed like convention, retail and other revenue at all your properties was down a lot. What was driving that? And the second question is just, I know you've been mix shifting, your Macao tables away from base mass to premium mass. Could you just talk -- I mean recognizing that premium mass revenue was stronger this quarter, it has been more choppy. So, just wanted to hear the rationale behind that. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Just on the shift -- I think I heard you say the shifting from base mass to premium, I hope we are -- hope we did, obviously, that's our goal. Our goal always is to -- there is many premium mass customers in there, and move away from base as we can. But that's a challenge when you have so many tables. Very, very pleased with how that's happening and you saw the results in this number we came up with for the premium mass quarter, nice recovery from Q2 where we had it bounce the wrong way. Yes, I just think our structural advantages there are so damn strong, it's hard to refute where we're going. I don't think anybody can argue, with all our keys and not just having quantity, but quality, all the entertainment, the retail as you saw the numbers, I think it's on Page 27 we referenced the retail numbers, it's just -- our advantages here are good and they'll just get better with time. You referenced to... Patrick Dumont : One thing, you mentioned the convention and other. One thing to note is that is also where we have ferry revenue, and so there's been a decline in ferry revenue year-over-year. So that's what's driving that. The majority of that is related to ferry. Okay? Thomas Allen : Makes sense. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Yes. Tom, just a follow-up on that slide, you referenced, it's the growth from $434 million to $450 million, which is accompanied by an increase to $674 million total win, $16,200 per table, yes, it's a good trend, the right direction, and I hope we continue that way. I love they end up with a double premium mass tables that we have the demand to make it happen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Could you all talk to the decision to walk away or I should say redirect your focus from Osaka to other markets in Japan, and then maybe just talk to any other markets that you do have your eyes on for development? Robe Goldstein : Sure. We looked at Osaka and we think it's a wonderful market, a wonderful city. We had a great experience there. But in the end we felt our strengths and our -- what we do for a living so well is better represented in the opportunity in the Tokyo Bay region in Yokohama. And as you know, it's very competitive there. It's a very interesting market, a lot of capital required, a lot of thought process to make sure the numbers work, and we just thought Yokohama was just a better fit for our skill set. We're hard at work. The government has issued the RFC, we're hard at work at that right now and we'll see how it comes out. It's -- I think there is some time to ponder how Japan plays out in the end and we hopefully right in the middle of it and make the best decision for the -- our company, our shareholders. Stephen Grambling : And can you just remind us of how to think about the amount of leverage that you'd be willing to kind of flex to, should you pursue that. And if you don't, it still seems like you're running, I think you're at 1.5, where could that move as you start to pursue the other development opportunities, and where do you think about the right level longer term? Patrick Dumont : So, I think this goes back to the original fundamental story of the company. One thing our Chairman has been expert at and the company has been very strongly supported by is allocation of capital. And so, if you look at the developments that our Chairman has pursued, they've always been large scale with very high returns. And so that underpins any decision we make about any new potential new jurisdiction. Conveniently, it also works hand and glove with our ability to return capital to shareholders over time as our CapEx rolls off. So, this is the framework that we use when we look at any jurisdiction. So, to think about it in terms of leverage, as the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, we have an investment grade balance sheet and that's been a work in progress over many years. So, very proud to achieve the levels of leverage that we have today, with our prudent financial management that we've exhibited has produced results, and gives us a lot of flexibility to pursue really any jurisdiction that comes available. From that standpoint, right now, if you go to Page 8 in the deck, you can kind of see a snapshot of where our leverage is. On a total consolidated basis, we're 2.3 times, on a net basis 1.5 times. So, it really depends on the timing of cash flows. We've built some developments recently, the Parisian, you can kind of see the development schedule there. We laid out in our last quarter's presentation how we would handle Marina Bay Sands expansion. That kind of gives you a sense of how we would look to spend capital, as we create a new development. But as a practical matter, given some of the growth that we anticipate from the CapEx that we hope to spend over the next three years, we hope to maintain leverage levels in our current context.  I think particularly when you give credit for pro forma EBITDA as the developments get closer to fruition. So, when you look at what we're doing really, this is a transformational story of our company. This is the second leg of a very large investment scheme. We're expanding in our two best markets, we're deploying billions of dollars of capital into Singapore, deploying billions of dollars of capital currently into Macao and opening probably our most competitive and best prepared product.  So, we're very excited over the next couple of years and hopefully that will provide an additional natural deleveraging and facilitate additional capital return. Stephen Grambling : One very quick kind of quantitative follow-up. Can you just remind me, what was the total room count year-over-year I guess in Macao? We're trying to back into it, it seems like it's down, but I don't know if you have that number handy? Patrick Dumont : So, if you go to Page 61 in our deck, I realize it's way in the back. We are actually laying out all the -- we actually lay out all the hotel rooms, including new capacity which we've highlighted. So that should probably \u2026. Stephen Grambling : Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue. Best of luck and best wishes Mr. Adelson. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Joe Greff : Sheldon, good to hear your voice, and you stand 100% versus the last call. So, glad you're on. Sheldon Adelson : I\u2019m running again 95%. Joe Greff : Just, Rob or for anyone there in the room, if I'm doing my math right, it looks like in Macao in the 3Q, your mass table hold percentage was a little bit higher than where it's been or where we would maybe deem it to be at a normalized level. Are we looking at that right, and was there anything with table hold on the mass side, and obviously that's maybe why premium mass grew at the higher rate that it did, and maybe you can kind of help us understand maybe what was going on there, whether it's mix or changing some of the tie bets or something else? Rob Goldstein : There's been a lot of talk about Lucky 6 in the market, all you guys have written about it. I think that is starting to have some impact in the Macao market or even in Singapore. Yes, we're touch above, Joe, Q2 it's not material and we're actually a couple -- a few points above it in terms of the Q3, it's not material. I wouldn't consider it important. Again, in our business, half a point or quarter point with all this volume is -- it's just not relevant. I do think, as you know, baccarat like all of our businesses, it's mathematical equation, as the customers opt to play different proposition bets, be it Lucky 6, pairs and ties whatever, it plays to house advantage. And I do think you're seeing baccarat -- changing the baccarat, I start with long time ago, it's evolving to a different place and it's helpful, the industry -- as these different bets evolve. As you know, the flat bets or the bank player is not as advantageous to house as pairs and ties in that Lucky 6. So, hopefully, we'll see a trend up to 25, 26, 32, 67. But the truth of matter is we're delighted to see, the volume of play we've got, the whole percentage wasn't material. But I think, it's material to keep your eye on what's happening in the baccarat business since that is the predominant game, and the game's diversification into more proposition bets is very healthy for the house, not just our house, it just so happens we have more house than anybody else over there. So, the benefits flow to us. But as far as it being materially different from the quarter before, it's not. It's pretty much the same range. Joe Greff : And then switching over to Singapore, as my follow-up. Rob, do you think you're getting a lot of business from China go into Marina Bay Sands that otherwise for whatever reason right now might be hesitant to go to Macao? Rob Goldstein : No. I don't think that's an issue at all. I think, the customers we've gotten to Singapore, it's foreign-based, as you know. Our growth proposition is interesting as we look at that business in Singapore. When we built that -- when Sheldon really developed that 13, 14 years ago we sat in this room and penciled that. And one thing we did, we couldn't have seen the dynamic growth Joe in the premium mass -- super premium mass that comes from all over the rim, and so we built a typical very nice hotel, but with lots of suites for high-rollers or rolling customers and lots of typical guest rooms for other. The evolution of the premium mass, especially the super premium mass from all our places, all over the rim, not just China has really changed the dynamic and that miss on our part, which we couldn't have seen it, we just were blind to it, it didn't exist. But that's why we're doing number four to make that tower really target specific, high level of focus on the premium mass customer that we don't get enough of them, and that's where the growth option resides in, in Singapore. The other piece I think we add to the Singapore discussion, this arena we're building, people don't quite understand the importance of that arena in Macao is breathtaking. When you look at our business, week-after-week, month-after-month we just can't get enough arena business there because the casino wants it so badly. It drives customers' decisions, when to come, where to stay. It's a ridiculous advantage that we don't have in Singapore and that will correct in a few couple of years, we opened four. But I think in Singapore, it's not about more business coming from China or less, it's about that property to achieve its total potential, taking the CapEx dollars we're going to deploy and being laser-focused on the segments that drive it, and that's the miss in Singapore in terms of -- we make a lot of money there, we're very proud of the operation, but there is so much more growth opportunity when we get the suites and rooms right, the entertainment right. It's going to be -- I think surprise people how much upside there is in Singapore. Very desirable place to visit, very safe, very user-friendly, enormous retail.  Our mall just continues to -- we were there last month, it's shocking how good it looks and feels. Our new nightclub business there. I just think we just have a lot of growth potential in Singapore, and it's going to be the entire rim. Wealthy people, affluent people who want an exceptional resort experience will come to Singapore. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Good afternoon and welcome back Sheldon, it's super nice to hear you there and comforting as well. Sheldon Adelson : Super nice to hear me too. Rob Goldstein : Always good to hear from you Felicia. Sheldon Adelson : I haven't said A dividends for a long time. Felicia Hendrix : It was nice to hear. So, just switching gears to Vegas, lodging is not a big part of your business in the chart, in the deck it showed that your table drop was down year-over-year in kind of both of those segments, for the market, we know that baccarat drop was down quarter-to-date through August, but mass drop was flat. So, just wondering on the mass side, was September down in the market or was that due just more to the types of conventions or groups you have in your casino, and I think in the past you've discussed that trying to improve that mix, so wondering where you are in the process. Rob Goldstein : Not a specific answer for September. But, I will tell you that we are focusing on getting more of this mass and premium mass business in our building again with 7000 plus accommodations, we should be getting more of it. We're looking -- we obviously keep focusing on the room product, the suite product, more attractions more F&B. I'm very pleased where our casino is going. We've seen nice baccarat play throughout the year, it was a soft quarter you're right, relative to the previous but the mass and pre-mass growth opportunities are here, but I think as you know and you referenced earlier, Felicia, it's a lodging dominant market and will continue to be. Vegas is more -- from when I started in Vegas, it was gaming-centric, now it's lodging centric. And the guy who sits next to me, has a lot to do with that. But, I think the best days Las Vegas are ahead of us in terms of, as more MICE space comes to the market, as more things happen here, we welcome the competition, welcome all the wonderful things are happening all over the town. And so, we're not going to -- I don't think you can focus on Vegas gaming for a quarter, for a week or for a month and get too excited of the way, it's going to be a steady grind to a better place. We're not going to see -- I do -- I don't think you'll see as much Asian play in Las Vegas, as you've seen in the past, because the options in Asia are so damn good that it's hard to -- we still see great players show up occasionally, but the days of us dominating Asian play, I think is over and the days of Vegas becoming probably the greatest lodging market in the world are here. And we won't be part of that transitional shift, since Sheldon authored it 20 years ago with the convention based focus. That's where I put my attention as I was looking at Las Vegas. Felicia Hendrix : That makes sense. Thanks. And just switching gears to Japan. Just I think conventional wisdom, is that an integrated resort there would cost about $10 billion. So, I was just wondering if we can get a reality check on that. Rob Goldstein : Yes, I am like, I am doing it right. It's a big number. Yes. Patrick Dumont : Might be light. Felicia Hendrix : Well, that's kind of what I'm wondering, is there any way to kind of... Rob Goldstein : Don't wonder too hard. Patrick, and I spent way too much time in Japan in the last 6 months. I feel like I could write a guide book. I'll say this about it, it's extraordinary place. We really enjoyed going there, but to your point, sometimes I come back and to pinch myself, I think back to the days when we developed, The Venetian with Sheldon in Las Vegas 20 plus years ago, and I remember saying to myself, my god, I am part of a $1 billion development, and it seems kind of comical thinking back on it today that you can nearly build a nightclub today for $200 million in this town. So, the reference point that you make is very, very well thought out, $10 billion, $12 billion, it does give you pause and no matter -- I once came back from a trip, and I said to Sheldon, we were having coffee, I said think about it, you could spend the equivalent of what Sheldon has spent in China for many casinos and retail malls, you spend that in one building, one IR in Japan. No matter, how good you are at this business, that must give you pause and stop and think, is that prudent? Can you really deploy, can you get the return? We've had those discussions, and we've had them with the Japanese government. And so, our Chairman and our Board will make that decision ultimately, but we and -- Patrick and I, we have learned a lot, but that's a very fair question to ask, if any operator, not just us. You know we have the balance sheet and the capability and the skill set to do it. The question is, can we get a return that -- the guy to my left is going to endorse and his Board, and we're working through those issues right now. I think $10 billion is the starting point. And I don't think anybody's going to do for less than $10 billion, unless you're going to do something, sub par. So, it's a fair question to ask. Patrick Dumont : Just to be clear, the $10 billion is likely in the prime city locations are being discussed. Right, there may be other locations in smaller cities besides the main cities of Japan, where the investment entry cost would be lower. Rob Goldstein : But we're not in that business. We're not going to Hokkaido, we're not going to -- we're going to be in a top tier city which would mandate $10 billion, and that may be light. I mean the cost of building in Japan is a big issue and the way the deals are structured, it's a challenge. And we're the guys who -- we spent $6 billion years ago and we spent 13 or 14 and 15, we were used to writing big checks. But, all that money one IR does make you stop and pinch yourself and say, can you get the returns that your shareholders deserve. Felicia Hendrix : So, there's kind of a cap and obvious follow-up to that, it seems like there could be a scenario where you guys just say, overall we're not going to get the kind of returns, and we'll let someone else participate in Japan? Rob Goldstein : We're not there yet. It's always fair, anything we look at, we look at, in the end it's really Sheldon and the Board to make that decision. But, everything we look at is predicated on return on invested capital. We have a great balance sheet, the reason why we don't do the things just to do them. We do them because they make great sense for the company and I think Macao -- by the way, it's hard to be the opportunities we face in Macao and Singapore. Those two growth opportunities, we're spending billions in both -- but it's money that's so well spent. Our Macao results, I hope I can't wait for a couple of years now to see the results we're doing in the Macao, both in the Londoner and the Four Seasons . I can't wait to see the result of all the infrastructure, the government's doing there is exceptionally good for the market. It's been a great, and very enjoyable to watch Macao from a infrastructural development. The new trains coming to Gongbei, all the infrastructural improvements there are really helpful to the market, and as we have tip our hat to the government for doing that. Same thing in Singapore, what we're building there with that theater, and those new rooms is going to be a very, very good thing for this company in terms of invested capital returns.  Japan will take a little more thought process. We're starting, not writing off, we're deep into it and we'd like to be there, but to your point, we've got to make sure, at the end of the day, it's prudent and the returns Sheldon's always said 20. So, it's going to be a big number to make it work. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon everyone and pass along my best wishes to you Mr. Adelson as well. Just wanted to touch on a couple of things. One, was just in the detail around the expansion that you're planning for the Cotai Strip. It looked like perhaps the timing or for the opening on the Four Seasons slipped a little bit, I think we've heard plenty about construction challenges in the market there. But, can you just give us an update on just general construction progress and timeline for some of the things that are scheduled to open and any chance at the Four Seasons or you do you have some rooms available for Chinese New Year? Rob Goldstein : Shaun, that thing's referenced page 19 ongoing strategic reinvestment. Page 19 gives you a great snapshot of our timing on this thing. You're right, we had a little delay in some of the issues in the Macao, but I think we're going to get to these timelines that we feel pretty confident. That Four Seasons, pretty much -- there is gaming happening as we speak today in the Four Seasons Macao. There is a new gaming salons -- I think 13 tables open. We are working through the room issues. The rooms, by the way, there is 290 of them. These are immense 2,000 square foot to 4,700 square foot, so these are mind-blowing suites relative to the market today. The Londoner, again -- there's rooms open -- about 150 open currently already. The gaming salons have not started nor the facade, that will happen in 2020 and into 2021. There has been some slippage due to the process there, but it's moving ahead.  We have rooms opened in the Four Seasons? Yes, we will by Chinese New Year have some rooms open. But fully complete it probably, unfortunately, it will be second quarter of \u201820. My mom used to tell me, all good things are worth waiting for, they'll be worth waiting for. It's going to be a game changer; Four Seasons is a whole new place, a whole new world that will be the best product in Macao in terms of size and quality, and I think Londoner will be a very strong sister to the Venetian. So, that page is very -- it says it all. Tells you the dates and times, and it answers all your questions. Shaun Kelley : Great, thanks. Thanks for the detail. And then, just as sort of a broader follow up and I appreciate that VIP remains a smaller and smaller portion of the business, but Rob, could you just give us your kind of color or thoughts on, specifically some of the -- we know about some of the challenges around, maybe specific junkets and some of the kind of credit policies, as it might relate to broader China. But your thoughts, specifically on some of these frontier markets because we hear that come up from time to time in our conversations with investors as well about, the Philippines and Cambodia and some of the competitive offerings there. So, just kind of what's your take from all the time you spend on the ground, and the market? Rob Goldstein : Well, the numbers speak themselves in Macao. It's been challenging there, and I think the government will deal with those issues in the Philippines, etc, is not my area to comment on. I think whatever happens, you can read about it like I do, in terms of the Chinese government's take on all that, and we'll leave that to the government. As far as Macao, we've been doing this a long time. We've watched that market ebb and flow, and we're certainly in a difficult time period. I'd like to say, it always resurrects, and it always seems to have in the past I believe will get better. I just don't know when, I don't know how. As you referenced, it's about 7% or 8% of our composite EBITDA. But yet, it does have a value to us, we love to pick up some more profitability there. One thing we are doing by building the Four Seasons product, and even the Londoner, our portfolio is just tailor-made now for that junket space of the junket resurrection, if and when it happens. I really don't want to pretend to know, how and when that comes back. I've been wrong in the past, thinking it will be a difficult time, and they were on some life support situations a couple of years ago and they climb back up the hill, all the way. I'm rooting for them, we want to see it get better, but it's hard for me. We spend a lot of time in Macao, listening to a lot of people, there is a lot of divergent opinions. I would say, we're rooting for that segment. We believe that segment will get better, but I just don't know how to be -- give you insight, that's valuable as to when and how it resurrects. So, without avoiding the question, that's an honest answer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you Sheldon, glad you're back, nice to have you back. Two questions. One is on Japan. There are some others that are talking about consortiums and partners in Japan, so I'm just wondering what your latest thoughts are on that and then I have a cash flow question. Patrick Dumont : Sure. So, in Japan, we are very confident in our ability to execute in a rate of resort there, to the standards of all of our other developments. I think, it would be helpful for us to look in the Japan market and find partners that could be useful to assist in the overall development, and that could be partners that we trade with, that could be partners that invest with us. We're really meeting with people now, attempting to understand the dynamics of each individual market and looking to develop relationships to see how we can be helpful and they could be helpful to us. So, much like some of the other potential concessionaires in the market, we're looking around to see if it's viable, how it might work and what the mechanics would be, but it's something that could be very helpful if we come to the right structure and the right set up. Robin Farley : Great, thank you. That sounds a little bit more open to partners, maybe than what we've heard before. That's helpful, thanks. And then my other question is on share repurchase, just looking at the amount of share repo in the quarter, it's like a bit lower than the run rate in the first half of this year and in 2018. Just what are your thoughts on share repurchase, what we should expect going forward, if there was something different about this quarter just getting more cautious because of VIP business or that kind of thing? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : So, I think when our Board meets quarterly and when our management team talks with the Chairman, we really think about total capital allocation, and one thing that's been a hallmark of our Chairman's activities and developments as I said before is really that capital allocation. You can't just think of the share repurchase without considering our CapEx and our dividends. If you go to Page 29 and you look at the remarks that the Chairman made at the beginning the call, you'll see that we in effect committed to spend north of $5 billion over the next couple of years. And so, we think reinvesting in the business is a much stronger indication of our view of the potential growth that we have, versus return of capital through share repurchases. We've always said that the cornerstone of our capital return policy is the dividend. You see that the Chairman raised the dividend $0.08 for the upcoming year, which we're very excited about, we think it's very shareholder friendly. And, if you look at the capital expenditures that we intend to make this year, and in the years coming up we feel very strong, these will be very high return projects. And we think these projects will facilitate a much greater level of capital return over time. So, we're being very cautious with the way that we purchase shares, and as we said before, it's something that we would modulate as our cash flows become available. So, what you're really looking at is a holistic view of capital investment, the dividend cornerstone program and then excess cash flow being returned to shareholders through repurchases. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : And just to echo everyone's comments, Mr. Adelson really is great to see you doing better and to hear you on this call. So, just sticking with the VIP and the mass trends here. If I look at Slide 36, the VIP contraction has taken a step down obviously it's getting worse, but if I go back to slide 16, the mass GGR is actually accelerating here sequentially. So, I'd love to just get your thoughts on why you think mass has decoupled so significantly, why mass has really remained insulated from a lot of the -- some of the macro weakness we've seen in China? Rob Goldstein : First of all, thank you for pointing out slide out, it's my favorite slide, I could look at it all day long. I think what you've seen is this become, I mean the investment proposition in Macao going back to beginning, was always 1 billion there or so people at your doorstep, that was always the whole idea of Macao, and all you're seeing now is the maturation of that thought process. VIP has created all kinds of headlines and all kinds of stops and starts, but the one thing that's always been true is -- the one thing that Sheldon really did when he built this thing, we built all these casinos back in the day, people just didn't understand it, well, how many do you need. While other people were thinking about it, we were building them. As people were talking about what they were going to build some day in \u201823 or \u201824, we're building it now.  So, we've never been reticent to spend money in Macao. We've always believed that the engine here would be, and should be, all those people across the border. And so, as we see this, this kind of makes us feel validated, and that slide you point out indicates the steady march towards \u201820, \u201822, \u201825, \u201830 who knows when it stops? My guess is, it doesn't stop. The only thing preventing more mass growth in Macao is infrastructure, which the government has done a great job. The trains are now going to soon -- at the end of the year more trains going right into the city. I mean, they're there bypassing Zhuhai into the Gongbei border crossing. More avenues are opening up. The infrastructure, the airport. So, it's no big surprise that the Chinese -- the mass business is growing and premium is growing. It's a very different business than the junket and the rolling business, always has been, which is much more capital dependent and money movement dependent and has all kinds of issues with it. So, to my way of thinking, this is the natural evolution of this market. Think of -- it's got a back -- we always say gambling is local, the only good thing in Macao is the local market's called China. It's a big local market back there, it's not California. And it's a growth market. This is a very simple story; Chinese consumer, Chinese march towards success and middle class status is happening as we speak every day. That's why LVMH -- luxury companies can't wait to get there and have been getting there for years. That's our story, the growth -- the reason we're going to keep growing to $3 billion $3.5 billion and $4 billion is because we're building product to address that market and as the government gives us the infrastructure and gives us the airport and trains, we build the rooms and give them all the things they want. There is no reason why it shouldn't keep growing, it is growing and that's why that's where we're focused. The junket business and the rolling business was always a wonderful side business, it's always been helpful. We welcome it. But you're not going to -- the margins there just dictate that you can't invest too much capital, and expect it to make a great return. Our business as you see, even with all the macro concerns in the market today, our business keeps marching forward 8%, 9%, 10% 12% growth quarter-after-quarter.  The slide you referenced indicative of a backyard called China, and the backyard people are getting richer by the day, they want to gamble and -- by the way, if you've been to Macao recently, it's more from a place that wasn't so terrific to an incredible place to visit now. The people want to come because it's great. The rooms are great, the food is great, the retail, the shows, it has at all, and I think that's why it's happening. It's not going to stop, right. We're at the epicenter of that. Our investments -- what this Board authorized a couple of years ago to put a few billion dollars more into Macao, we want to invest more money in Macao. We're complete bulls on the growth and future of Macao, that's why Sheldon and the Board said, do the Londoner, do the Four Seasons, keep building more. When we get the green light from the government, we love to build more sleeping rooms, and more retail, and more restaurants and more entertainment, because that's the future Macao. It's not going to stop. I mean Macao has proven to be very resilient, and to your point despite the -- it's decoupled, it doesn't stop growing. In fact, the decoupling is accelerating. And also, you should know that the driver of that premium mass customer is a younger, more affluent, lifestyle driven person he or she is 35, 45 50 years old, they want the best things, they want the rooms, they want the entertainment, they want the food, they want the retail that we offer.  It's not simply a gambling play and that customer is not capital dependent on the junket side. They're very independent of the junket. So, it's both a higher margin customer, it's growing by the day and there is no reason to stop. In fact, just the opposite, it will keep growing and that slide is why that's the powerhouse of Macao. The growth is just incredible, it's just -- $15 million, $17 million $20 million, $22 million. Why would it stop? It won't. So, we're very pleased to see it. Our products speak to it, we keep investing there, and we're very grateful to be there. Operator : And with that, we have reached our allotted time for question.

Finally, for those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Mr. Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a great quarter and a great year across all our markets. Company-wide adjusted property EBITDA for the fourth quarter was USD1.39 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Our cash flow generation is unmatched in our industry, with full year 2019 EBITDA of USD5.39 billion. Nobody's ever heard that before in this industry. The capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore are exceptionally exciting, with over USD5 billion of capital projects, which will be completed over the course of the next few years. These investments will further strengthen our leadership position in the premium mass, mass and non-gaming segments in Asia. Let's now turn to our financial results by the region. In Macao, adjusted property EBITDA was $811 million, USD811 million in the quarter, an increase of 3% over the prior year. In contrast to the 8% decline, that's a 3% increase for us in contrast to an 8% decline gross gaming revenue in the Macao market overall, pretty good. We grew our managed gaming revenues by 3% over the prior year, with growth in both - in non-mass - with growth in both mass tables and slots. Retail sales remained strong, growing by 11% over the prior year. Most importantly, our profitability continues to lead the industry, with EBITDA margin reaching 36.2%, up another 140 basis points compared to the prior year. We couldn't be more excited about our investment of USD2.2 billion to expand our critical mass of non-gaming offerings in Macao. We believe there is no better market in the world than Macao with regard to the continued deployment of our capital. The initial trial results at both the London hotel and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons have been very promising, and we will update you on our progress in the future. We look forward to making additional investments in Macao as we contribute to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. I would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of dollars to expand our hotel entertainment, retail and MICE facilities in Macao. I believe Macao has the opportunity to become the greatest business and leisure tourism destination in the world and the MICE capital of Asia. We stand ready to make substantial additional investments to contribute to Macao's future success. In 2019, over 900 MICE events were held in Sands China's properties in Macao, with the participation from over 900,000 - sorry, 800,000 attendees. This is by far the highest number of MICE events and attendees that are hosted by any operator in Macao. And indeed, we estimate that we represent as much as 90% of the MICE market. Entertainment is another area in which we contribute to Macao's growth and diversification. We continue to lead the Macao market in this respect as it continues its development as the premier entertainment center in Asia. In 2019, we brought 45 different events to Macao in our Cotai Arena, featuring top Asian and western artists. Our leadership in MICE and entertainment are just two examples of our firm commitment to supporting the government's objective to diversify the economy of Macao. Our market-leading investments in non-gaming facilities, including hotel capacity, large-scale retail malls and our themed tourism attractions are designed to attract the widest possible range of visitors to Macao. Having made the largest investment in this economic diversification, we will continue to invest and to work to support the business [ph] for Macao in the future. Excuse me, I've got a cold today. With the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the progress of the Greater Bay initiatives, we truly believe Macao has the potential to become the MICE and leisure capital of Asia. We fully intend to contribute to that objective through both our existing assets and potential future events. Let me also address another topic, the evolving situation with the coronavirus. The current situation is unique and serious. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and guests, and we are doing everything we can to support the government both of Macao and China. Our Sands China team is in close consultation with the relevant health care and public safety authorities in Macao, and we have implemented significant procedures and safeguards. We will continue to implement measures in line with government direction and hope for a swift containment of the virus. Now turning to Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands' adjusted EBITDA was USD457 million. Rolling volumes were strong and was 16% higher than the prior year. Mass win per day remains solid. The hotel continued to do - to enjoy a strong average daily rate and occupancy. At the same time, annualized retail sales per square foot increased to more than USD2,000 per square foot. Singapore's leading tourism infrastructure continues to receive significant investment, and we are excited to be a part of Singapore's continued growth as a leading business and leisure tourism destination as we develop the Marina Bay Sands expansion. The expansion will include a 15,000-seat, state-of-the-art arena for live entertainment events, a hotel tower designed to set a new standard of luxury in the region as well as an additional MICE offerings. We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion and we'll provide additional updates in the future. We will continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience in advance of the expansion. Now turning to Las Vegas. Our Las Vegas operations had another great quarter, with adjusted EBITDA of USD120 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year. The hotel convention and slot segments offset yearly [ph] revenue records, leading to a record adjusted property EBITDA performance in 2019 of USD503 million on a whole normalized basis. Regarding U.S.-China trade relations, Phase 1 of the trade deal between China and the United States has been completed. The United States and China coming together to work collaboratively on the future of global trade is good for the U.S., it's good for China and it's good for the rest of the global economy. Finally, we continue to increase the return of capital to shareholders. The dividend remains the cornerstone of our strategy for the return of capital. The net dividend has continued to grow. For 2020, the Board of Directors has increased the dividend by $0.08 per share to $3.16 per share. At the same time, we repurchased USD300 million of stock during the quarter. Yay dividends, yay buybacks. Thanks again for joining us on the call today. Now we'll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. Sheldon, good to hear you again. My first question is going to be probably an obvious topic and to the extent you can talk about it. But just with regards to the coronavirus, if there is going to be a lengthy impact at the Suites' visitation and spend both in Macao and Singapore, how do you manage to fix the operating expense there? How much flex is there in both respective markets? And then my follow-up question is relating - looking backwards, relating to Macao in the fourth quarter, if you were to parse through, maybe you look at it because you have monthly numbers that we don't have access to, but how much of an impact do you think Hong Kong protests had versus the travel disruption related to government visit in December? And that's all for me. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Hi, Joe, it's Rob. I'll take - I want to take the first part of the question. They are 2 different markets, Macao and Singapore. As you know, Macao visitation based on public reports is down as much as 80%. It's not nearly as dire in Singapore. There has been some adverse impacts but nowhere near the same level of problem in Singapore as Macao has [ph] there. As to our operating, you know our business is revenue dependent. There's no way to hide from the fact we employ tens of thousands of people in these markets. And it's an expensive business to operate. And in the same way operating leverage swings your direction when volumes are good, it swings again too at times like this. And we're going to do our best. We'll do all the paid time off, all things we can do to mitigate but I think it would be silly to think that we can make a material impact on operating costs. They're real. And they -- and that's the problem with these businesses when this kind of thing hits. Having said that, we've been - just before, we've been through a lot of years of problems in Macao and Singapore and Las Vegas when things like this happen, and this storm will pass. We don't know when. We do know at best is we'll be first in line in each of our markets to be the biggest investor, most aggressed in Macao. We've shown our strength in our things of that [ph] market, extraordinary market. When it returns, we'll return with it and do very, very well and keep investing. But I think it would be foolhardy to think we can reduce costs enough to offset what's happening in the - if this 80% decline continues. That's a real problem for any operator. Your second question, I didn't address, but I'm trying to get\u2026 Daniel Briggs : The pace of how October, November and December went. Sheldon Adelson : Oh, okay. Well, October was a terrific month in Macao, extraordinary month in Macao. It decelerated, as you might imagine, with the visit from the President, as it has in the past, no surprise there. Deceleration really happened in December, I think that's again, predictable. So I guess, you'd look - the month is - the quarter is October extraordinary, November strong and December was soft. No big surprise. I think we'd reflect the market in that respect. A very different place in December than it was in October. And I think that's all I can say on that issue. It's pretty clear to everybody. Joe Greff : Got it. Thanks, guys. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Hi. So just sticking with Macao and focusing on premium mass, you had really strong premium mass results in the third quarter and then they were down. In the fourth quarter, do you think that was just mostly a function of President Xi visit? Or something else going on there? Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Yes, yes. So let's break it apart. We had a great base mass quarter, I think up at almost 9%, 8.9% or something like that. So base mass, we were - I think our strongest base mass performance in our history, which we were delighted with and that remains a core part of our success. You're right, the premium mass business was not as strong but still not a bad performance. I think what really is happening here, I wouldn't blame on what happened in the market as much as we are under construction in Four Seasons and in Londoner. And I think - as you know, this market is based upon product. Like most gaming, especially Macao, better product wins the day. We're soon going to open up all the suites of the Four Seasons, all the suites of the Londoner by the end of the year and St. Regis. And I'm pretty confident we'll not just be the leader in premium mass but, by far, the leader. I think the success of the other products in the market demonstrates what happens when you build a quality product in Macao, people show up for it. I think our Four Seasons product, which is extraordinary, 290 keys. Base - the size of room between 2,000 and 4,000 feet. St. Regis, equally powerful, and Londoner. I think we're looking at a whole new offering from SCL once these things open up. So I'm very confident our premium mass business will reflect as our [ph] base mass business, strong growth in the time ahead. As you know, we're the biggest investor in Macao, we're the most committed. And these $2.2 billion worth of investments that Sheldon and the Board authorized will pay off enormously in '21 and beyond, and '20 as well. Thomas Allen : Thanks, Rob. And this is my follow-up. Vegas revenue was really strong, your strongest quarter of the year, but margins were a little light at 25% versus first half is 29%. Was there anything unique going on there? Robert Goldstein : No, I just think we're seeing a shift to more -- I mean our business, as you know, is driven by - we have a gaming component but the non-gaming is powerful. If we can make $500 million a year in Vegas every year, I'd be okay with that. The margins fall a few points. I think what you're saying is - one thing you should realize that our business is that we are driven - I mean the - forget the rooms and the slot machines and the gaming business but look at our revenues coming out of convention center, almost $200 million this year of revenue coming out of banquets and convention-related services, which is extraordinary. And I think that's becoming more and more indicative where our business is heading. So I would gladly, as we keep going, and I think we will keep going towards $500 million and beyond, I would gladly trade a few points of margin for more growth in non-gaming. Our gaming performance is good. But as you know, visitation from the -- from Asia is not as strong at the super high-end baccarat, which has been one of the strengths of Las Vegas. But again, we're overjoyed [ph] with the $500 million a year. And if we trade a point or 2 of margin here and there, we're pretty happy. Nothing extraordinary, nothing out the ordinary. Thomas Allen : Thanks, Rob. Robert Goldstein : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, good afternoon, guys and thanks. Sheldon, for the first time that I could recall, at least, you talked a little bit in your prepared remarks about the trade war and, obviously, the signing of Phase 1 of the deal. Is that something - and I don't know with all the other things going on right now in the market that it's - it would have been discernible. But do you feel that was something that maybe has provided a little bit of a governor on results in Macao and something that you're optimistic as the resolution of Phase 1 and potentially subsequent phases play out, you will start to see maybe a better cadence of business across the high end for the market? Sheldon Adelson : I think that it's the perception that the China - the trade negotiations with China and the contradictions that are inherent there are just perceived. I don't think that they're doing very much. I think people think that if President Trump puts on tariffs on different imports from China that - and then China reciprocates by putting tariffs on the stuff in from the U.S. I talked to my friend, Steven Mnuchin when I was at The White House for the signing of the China trade agreement. And he says that they're moving forward, probably moving forward faster than what the people would expect for Phase 2 of the resolution of the so-called trade war. So although it's perceived to be a problem, it's - in reality, it's not causing much of a problem. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Robert Goldstein : Carlo, I just -- Carlo, it's Rob. Let me jump in and just echo a comment on that. No question, we hear from customers in Asia, the importance of resolution of trade war, especially for entrepreneurs and business people who reside in the provinces in China. I think it's very helpful. The war comes to an end. We'll see more confidence. We'll see more growth in their businesses. It translates across all segments but primarily in the premium mass segment, which is so important to success in Macao. So it's very, very helpful and bodes well for the future of our business and our competitors in Macao. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, both. And then just as a quick follow-up. Obviously, the situation right now is difficult to handicap with everything that's going on. But in the event Macao were to decide that maybe the best approach would be to close the casinos temporarily until things stabilize, my understanding is that maybe business interruption insurance wouldn't apply here. Do you guys kind of have a view of how that potentially could play out if that were to be the path this followed? Sheldon Adelson : Well, I'll ask Patrick to respond to that. Patrick Dumont : So a -- I appreciate the question. I think right now, it's too early to say. I think each operator has different risk management programs, and so I'm not sure where you have the information coming from. But I think it's something we'll take a look at. Hopefully, that's not something that it ever comes down to. We do have a very robust risk management program here. We're actually one of the largest acquirers of certain types of risk products in the market or in various markets. So I think we're very proud of that. I think we try to protect our balance sheet, try to protect our operations. That being said, I don't think we can comment specifically on the clauses of our policy and the likelihood of that type of event or the coverage that we have but we are prepared. The other thing to note is we're very fortunate to have a very strong balance sheet. We're very fortunate to have liquidity on hand. And I think we're looking to manage through this in the best way that we can and support whatever initiatives from the government that we need to. The other thing is I think in the long run, we're very cautious with our balance sheet, and we expect variability in our markets, and this is something that unfortunately, comes up periodically and we have to deal with. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Thank you Patrick. Sheldon Adelson : I hope we don't have to answer the question. I hope it goes away and resolves quick enough. It's not an issue for us. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. For sure. Thank you, guys. Sheldon Adelson : Thanks, Carlo. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, one other follow-up on the coronavirus. Is there any way to frame or is there any impact that we should be anticipating as it relates to the construction projects that you have underway now? Or is that still something that we should generally be thinking is on track or regardless of the current disruption can be still accelerated to be on track? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Steve, it's Rob. We don't anticipate any slowdown as a result of the virus. Obviously, it depends on what happens in Macao but as we speak today, we saw no indication of all of that. And we're full speed ahead on all of our projects in Macao. Stephen Grambling : That's great. And then one other quick clarification on Singapore, obviously, very strong results. If you look at your customer database there, is any of that -- or can you tell if any of that is folks that are transitioning out of Macao to - because of the Hong Kong disruption or otherwise? Or what do you think is kind of driving that underlying strength? Robert Goldstein : Great property and great management. No, I don't think we have it -- we really can't determine... Sheldon Adelson : Not to mention our good looks. Robert Goldstein : Yes. We really can't determine that. I think it's -- I think Singapore has always been, for us, a - it's such an interesting place, great country to visit, culturally in sync with the foreign visitation. As you know, the visa - the increased levy entrance has made us pivot more and more towards foreign visitation, and we continue to grow that property in terms of quality of product and entertainment and service to make it more desirable for that customer. So whether - I don't know what - they're pivoting at any place, but I think we want to make that product so damn good that people want to come more often to Singapore. It's an incredible product in so many ways, a great country to operate in, very favorable to foreign visitation. So we're very pleased about it. And I think our strength there, I believe, will continue to grow. I think as we invest more - again, we - our history has always been the same. We invest heavily in the right places. And Singapore is the right place. We're making a huge commitment, both in Towers 1, 2 and 3 as well as our new addition, the Arena, et cetera. So I think our future in Singapore is very bright and that's why we're putting billions of dollars to work there. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. That's super helpful. Thanks so much and best of luck. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, thank you so much. So Rob, just digging back into the premium mass performance in the fourth quarter. If you look at your premium mass growth year-over-year in like each month of the quarter, would it be fair to say that December was the major driver of the year-over-year decline just because of the visitation decline? And then the - so the low kind of - around the - President Xi's visit? Or was it similar throughout the quarter? And then I was also wondering if there's any way you could share with us how things were going the first 19 days or so of January prior to the outbreak? Robert Goldstein : Sure. To your question, December clearly was the problem child in the end of the quarter. I think that's true of all of our competitors in the market as well. Now it was a great October, we thought we were heading for a massive quarter and then it slowly declined as the quarter went on. As for the - we didn't see any effect from this virus. The first 21 days was a pretty - if this call had been a week or 2 ago, it would be a whole different type of conversation. But very strong in January. I think the market was strong, visitation was good. So it's a real comeuppance to have this whole thing, the visitation being down, I think it's 80% market-wide at this point. But there was no signs in early January of this disruption. It's a recent occurrence. Felicia Hendrix : Yeah. And can I - and I know you guys focus - is mainly on the mass side. But just within those first 21 days, did you see any like change in behavior on VIP? Like is there any reason why we should think once we get past this outbreak and all the kind of stuff that you could - we could see some improvement in VIP year-over-year? Robert Goldstein : Yeah. Felicia, we don't get into that. We don't want to break out the first 21 days other than say visitation was strong and it reflected more of a fourth quarter trend. VIP, as you know, is an enigma. We don't know when it gets better. I've been wrong so often, particularly its demise, I won't make that mistake again. I think VIP will resurrect. I think Sheldon's comments about the trade war are indicative of the market that the entrepreneurs who populate the VIP segment, be it junket or an ongoing [ph] direct are influenced by their businesses and their success. And I think there's a day in the future where premium mass will blossom, keep blossoming, but it's more product-driven. I think the trade wars resolution will be very helpful in China and very helpful for Macao in general. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. So just to go back to the coronavirus and a few of the prepared remarks, Sheldon, I think you mentioned that there - you're implementing measures in line with government policies. You - could you just give us maybe a little bit better sense of what some of those policies or contingency planning looks like at this stage? I mean, again, I think we all know they stopped short of ordering full closures. But just kind of what's the interaction been with the government? And how are they kind of helping to smooth over [ph] and work with you on the situation right now? Sheldon Adelson : Well, the government wants us to measure the temperature of the visitation and to see if there's anybody that's got the virus. And they requested that we put masks on all our dealers, everybody in the casino, we've done that and whatever else, whatever other details. Robert Goldstein : That's -- Sheldon's right. Across the board, all of our employees now have masks in all the areas. And to Sheldon's point, screening is part of our business now today. And Wilford and Grant and the team are in constant contact with the government. We speak daily. And the government - we - our job is to protect our employees, our team there and to help the government every way possible to be good corporate citizens in respect to people of Macao, respect to people of China and be as contributory as we can to the resolution of this crisis. And we've done that. We're there. We've actually -- we're looking into our contribution, a monetary contribution into helping into China and Macao, protecting our dealers. So that's job one, and we are in constant communication to mass... Sheldon Adelson : When I walk in here, I take one in a - in an operating room [ph]. Everybody's got masks. Robert Goldstein : Yeah. It started with dealers, but then we went to everybody and masks are in short supply. We're trying to get more supplies to make contributions. And Sheldon and the family have asked us to look into what else we can do to help Macao recover and help the government. Shaun Kelley : Great, thank you. Thank you for the color. And then just as my follow-up, but just switch gears a little bit. The -- obviously, there's been plenty of questions about the impact on just the financial performance from President Xi's visit, but it felt like a pretty big policy shift that he really, I think, shined a pretty positive light on Macao's future role. Could you just give us maybe a little bit more color on your take on kind of how that commentary went? Any conversations with the new Chief Executive, just how the -- just general tenor of policy is moving forward with Macao under the -- kind of the new administration? That would be great. Robert Goldstein : We - so we don't - I'll say this. We've been there for what? 18 years, 19 years. And I think Sheldon's contribution, this company's contribution is a - as the biggest investor in Macao speaks for itself. We are - we're raging bulls on Macao's future. We think the last 20 years were great. We look forward to being the biggest investor in the next 20 years. And our goal is to invest billions of dollars in Macao. We have had conversations with the government repeatedly about our desire to invest heavily to make Macao everything it can be. It's already the most important city in the world, in the gaming world. We want to see it become the most important city in the MICE, leisure destination business. We like to see more families, more kids, more everybody. And that takes more rooms, that takes more MICE space, that takes more retail, more leisure activity. This city has the potential, with the airports and the bridge, the infrastructure to become the most visited city in the world. It could happen. It had the rooms, the demand is there. The supply has to grow. Sheldon Adelson : We had 40 -- 39-point-something, almost 40 million people come in, in 2019. Robert Goldstein : Yes. I mean Sheldon's been very vocal about his willingness to invest heavily. He -- we've spoken with the government over the years about that. There's no surprise that we feel. And as the authors of the current - the Cotai success story, I think Sheldon has listened to pretty well. We can't speak to what the government plans to do. We don't know. We simply wait for their advice and their direction and we adhere to that. But we've been very vocal on our willingness to invest. We want to see Macao reach full potential. I think that Macao is - it's in its infancy. Vegas, in the mid-'90s, we built The Venetian was considered a mature city. And it turns out, the next 25 years are way better than the first 25 years. I think Macao is in that same point where as good looks today, Macao has so much potential to do so much more. And we have been raging components of that city's growth and that city's maturation beyond gaming into a non-gaming destination. That's our hope. That's our desire. We await the advice and direction of the government, but Mr. Adelson and the Board is excited to invest in Macao's big, big future. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about Singapore, just thinking about how -- I wonder if some of that increase was helped by the slowdown in Macao in December. Can you quantify or just in some ballpark term, was the December increase in Singapore up a lot more than the other months in the quarter? Robert Goldstein : I missed the last part, Robin, but I don't think we can quantify. It's very hard to sit there, very honestly, and tell you that the downturn in Macao drove customers into Singapore. I think what drives people into Singapore is Singapore. It's a very desirable destination. It's a very desirable building. We think we can continue to grow foreign visitation. We continue to invest heavily in making the product better in terms of service and quality of room. So I don't look to Macao's demise to help Singapore's growth. I think... Robin Farley : And I didn't mean - I just meant there was - to some degree, was the month of December in Singapore up more than October and November were? Robert Goldstein : We don't want to break it out, but I think we'll treat the quarter as a whole. I don't think - I wouldn't break it out. I wouldn't do it anyway, but I don't think you need to. The quarter was solid across the board. It was - Singapore had a nice, solid, rolling business, an ongoing business, a strong visitation. It's just a good month, a good quarter in Singapore across the board. I don't think Singapore - you might look at - obviously, as this virus continues, that might be an interesting thing to look at the future. But we believe Singapore, unto itself, is a powerful product in a powerful country that will prosper and grow as we reinvest heavily in it. Robin Farley : Okay. Sheldon Adelson : Look at the mall in Singapore. If that mall were in the United States, it would be the highest grossing mall in the country. $2,000 a foot. Now we have a mall in the Four Seasons in Macao that does like $5,000 a foot in U.S. dollars in sales. So it's been around the other malls on Orchard Road. Robert Goldstein : As well as we've done over there, we think there's a lot of room to grow, though. We honestly believe we can do a lot better in Singapore and that's why we're investing in the future of Singapore. Robin Farley : Okay, thank you. And then just my follow-up question, and I feel like Dan is going to say the answer to this is buried in Slide 84 or something that is like hard to get through all in 10 minutes before the call starts. So... Daniel Briggs : We apologize for all the trade news [ph]. Robin Farley : Well, no, no. I -- it's great. But I hope if it is buried in there that you'll be kind. But the question was just thinking about the pace of the quarters this year and the potential disruption at the Londoner, just how should we think about like when to expect like maybe more disruption versus less disruption in the quarters? And actually is a slower environment right now, a time to accelerate some of the disruption and say, \"Let's get that out of the way?\" Sheldon Adelson : That's a great - the second part of your question fascinates me. I am curious if there's an - we don't have the answer today. But I've asked the team to explore that very question. Is there a chance to accelerate construction process in Macao during this slowdown? I don't know the answer to that. So I won't represent. I will tell you, having been there a couple of weeks ago in the Londoner, walked through it, it was comical. And I thought of people on this call as I walked through dust and jackhammers and construction everywhere and the customers and staff, the multitude [ph] playing like crazy. And I did laugh myself. I said, \"I feel like I'm making up a bad story here to say disruption will happen. I think it will happen. I just don't understand why people keep coming. I guess the rooms are so valuable. We're right now in the middle of building 10 new restaurants, we're in the middle of blowing up a casino over there and redoing it, in the middle of - all the Londoner rooms are in construction, St. Regis. There's a lot of people in that building working on it to make it disruptive, and yet, they're not being disrupted. We keep getting visitations. The quarter was very, very good. And I hope I'm a liar and wrong that this market will eventually stop coming to the SEC as it transitions into Londoner. However, having been there and saw with my own two eyes, I had to stop and chuckle, how busy it was and the rooms remain -- again, Macao is underserved from a lodging perspective. You realize that when you walk to Londoner, you realize people are sleeping manner. They're not necessarily coming for the properties. It's not a destination property, but they're sleeping there and they're gambling there. And it's just extraordinary to watch. If that building were in Las Vegas, there wouldn't be a soul in there. But in China, it was a much different story. So we continue to tell you, when you build a brand-new casino, brand-new facade, redo 1,200 keys, build the St. Regis, rip the facade off, someday, there will be some disruption. I just don't know when. Robin Farley : Okay. That sounds great. Robert Goldstein : I know Dan is going to address that. Dan would have had a slide, but we didn't think of that. Robin Farley : Thank you. Robert Goldstein : All right. Thank you, Robin. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks to return. In terms of the visitation declines, are you seeing that more on the mass side or the VIP side? And then for my follow-up, I know the coronavirus is quite unique. I don't know if there's any precedent or anything historically that would suggest, call it, onetime interruptions normally lead to pent-up demand. Is that something you're thinking about? Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Sure. Two things, we cannot -- at the level of visitation decline we're experiencing, I think it would be silly for us to break out. If all 80% of the market, it's -- every segment's being affected. Let's not be - let's not try to be cute about this. It's across the board. Every segment is in decline for every property. There's no way to be any more honest than that. As for pent-up demand, I'm a big believer in pent-up demand. The fact there - and in fact, this is killing Chinese New Year, so I think we'll - when this does resolve, whether it's next month or next quarter - I don't know when it will resolve. I don't want to pretend to know. There's a very good article in the journal today about the history of these viruses in the last 60, 70 years and they get solved. With the Hong Kong flu, the Russian flu, the Asian flu, the flu I had when I was 12 years old, they resolved. And they will resolve this time, whether that's February or March, I don't know. But when it does resolve, Macao's going to be very, very, very busy because whether you know it or not, these folks like to gamble. And we have the biggest and best properties in Macao. They will come back in force. And it's a very, very wonderful market. We're delighted to be there. It's a very strong government that we like working with, and I think the brighter day will come very quickly for Macao. We just don't know when that happens. But you can count on pent-up demand. Believe me, you - there will be a lot of people there the day that virus is resolved, and we'll be happy to serve them and welcome them back. So it's a fair question, a good question, and I have a very strong answer. Yes, pent-up demand's a real issue in a place like Macao. Jared Shojaian : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope all of you, your friends and families are in good health during these challenging times. The COVID-19 pandemic is unlike anything I've ever seen in my business career. While this pandemic brings many challenges, it also presents each of us with an opportunity to make a difference and to provide assistance to all those who have been impacted.  Our company is fortunate to have the financial strength to enable us to focus our efforts on the safety and security of our team members and customers, and are making a difference to those in need in each of our host communities in Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas.  We don't know how long this pandemic will last, but we are confident that travel and tourism spending in each of our markets and around the world will eventually recover. As surely as day follows night, people will travel again, shop again, come together again to enjoy entertainment and social interaction, to exchange ideas and to conduct business. Focusing on the support for our team members and communities today will position us to recover more quickly as the impact of the pandemic eventually subsides; it is also the right thing to do. Our optimism about an eventual recovery, coupled with our financial strength enables us to continue the execution of our previously announced capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore. We believe these investments will strengthen our leadership position in each of these markets and will provide a larger platform for future growth with travel and tourism spending eventually recovering.  In Macao we are making great progress in our $2.2 billion capital investment program with The Londoner Macao and The Grand Suites at Four Seasons. In addition to these large projects with which you are already familiar, we\u2019re moving full speed ahead with a number of other investments which we think will increase both the effectiveness and the diversification of our integrated resorts portfolio.  Now is not the time to pause or slow down investment in Macao. We see the opportunity and possess both the financial strength and the strategic commitment to make additional investments. With our effort to accelerate investment in Macao, we intend to play our part in supporting the local economy in the short term and ensure we are in the leading position to capture the eventual recovery in tourism spending. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the opportunity to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world, and the MICE capital of Asia.  As I've said on many occasions, we welcome the opportunity to invest billions of dollars and additional investment and contribute to Macao\u2019s diversification and evolution into Asia\u2019s leading leisure and business tourism destination.  Turning to our investment in the expansion of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore, we remain excited to be a part of Singapore's continued growth, as a leading business and tourism \u2013 and leisure tourism destination. We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion. We\u2019ll provide additional updates in the future. We will also continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience in advance of the expansion.  Finally, turning to Las Vegas, the eventual recovery could take more time here than in Asia, but we are confident that Las Vegas\u2019s best days are ahead of it and that Las Vegas will remain the greatest leisure and business tourism destination in the United States.  Let me now spend a moment on capital allocation. Maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great business sense, while we weather the storm caused by this pandemic. The balance sheet strength will enable us to invest in promising future growth opportunities and we\u2019re positioning our company to deliver industry leading growth in the years ahead.  While we have suspended our dividend program, we remain confident that the recovery in travel and tourism spending, and the strength of our business model will enable us to deliver both growth and the return of capital to shareholders in the future. I assure you I have not said \u2018yay dividends and yay buybacks\u2019 for the last time. I'm looking forward to saying them again and hopefully very soon. Thank you for joining us on the call today and now we\u2019ll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. You may now ask your question. Joe Greff : Good afternoon everybody. A - Sheldon Adelson : Yeah, hi Joe. Joe Greff : Hope all of you and your families are well and healthy. So my first question relates I guess to things that we would Macao travel impediments or restrictions, IBS, Airlift, Ferry, the quarantine imposition by Guangdong. I know this is a tough question, but do you have a sense of when those things start to get relaxed and then maybe more importantly than timing on those four buckets, more on how those things will eventually roll out. A - Sheldon Adelson : This is Sheldon. I can only quote some of the rumors that we've heard. We have nothing positive and nothing definite, but the rumors we've heard that it's going to start in sometimes the middle or end of May. Robert Goldstein : Joe just to elaborate. I think to Sheldon's point, we follow the same sources you do, perhaps ours a little better. We do believe there'll be some opening in May perhaps or June we're hopeful, but as you know it won't be a flick of the switch and it\u2019s all different timing to which provinces. We\u2019re hoping for first the IBS is reinstated, that\u2019s pivotal, and then the 14 day quarantine for re-entry into China is equally important as you know. I think the IBS, the first place in the 14 day quarantine, the first place we\u2019ll see some bright lights will be in Guangdong and then provinces will follow throughout the summer. It won't be one flick of the switch and all provinces open equally. I think though as you know Guangdong is pivotal. Once that's open, it opens the door for others to follow. It will be a gradual process and the one thing we're grateful for is that the majority of our income is derived from Asia, which as you know has been through these situations, be it SARS or be it Swine Flu or in the past they are more conversant with the problems and so we think the recovery there is going to be back to gambling, back to visitation, will come rather quickly, but it will come in gradual phases throughout the summer. It will be Guangdong and then other provinces to follow. Airlift maybe still muted for a while in terms of how much - I think trains will be running.  We feel pretty confident we\u2019ll be back to a much better place this summer and then a much better place in the fall, and we have seen evidence of pent up demand like crazy from our customers who are asking when and we talk to them pretty regularly. So we feel pretty good about the return of Macao first, far beyond what we're going to see in the U.S. Joe Greff : Excellent! Great! And then just another question related to Macao and maybe this is a question for Patrick or Dan on the call. Thank you for including in the slide deck the monthly OpEx for Macao, the $110 million. How much of that $110 million relate to the premium and base mass segment? And so in other words, you know when that \u2013 those segment's come back, you're looking at incremental margins much higher than say the 35% to 36% that the margins are overall. So in other words, what would those margins be at that 35% plus be without those fixed charges that you're currently sustaining without much revenue growth or much revenue? Patrick Dumont : Hey Joe, it\u2019s Patrick; thanks for the question. I think if you look back at our margin over the last couple of years, as the premium mass and mass business grew, those margin areas are probably appropriate for a recovery under normal run rate conditions. And so if you think about our expenses broken into categories, our largest expense is really gaming tax, which is variable, followed by our payroll which is not, and then a whole host of other things related to property operations, fixed property costs and things related to just general consumables.  And so some of those things are variables, but it will be very hard to characterize and say a particular market segment would result when it started back in you know call it higher margins because of this trough. And I think the way to think about it is, we've been very focused on managing towards margins over the last couple of years anyway. And so the team there and through our work together, we've been very focused on increasing our cash flow as we grew revenue in higher margin segments.  So I don't think you should look at a rebound through a particular segment and say that will expand margins. I think what you can do is take a look at this and say our business already had plenty of leverage in it. We have plenty of liquidity to manage through this very difficult time, and then when things do rebound we\u2019ll continue to be focused on margins as we were before and look to control the costs that we can control. And I think to look at it on a segment basis would be difficult, because in reality we have to open the properties.  And so you know we're going to have strength in every segment. I'd like to believe that when things recover we're going to see that strength that we saw in 2019 and 2018 and the years before. We had a great trajectory heading into 2020 and I'd like to believe that we\u2019ll continue to maintain the very strong operating leverage that we had on a run rate basis when things recover. Joe Greff : Great, thank you so much guys. Patrick Dumont : Thanks Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. You may now ask your question. Felicia Hendrix : Hi! Thank you so much. Great to hear you all, and Sheldon, definitely wanted to thank you and the company for all you've done to get important PPE to the healthcare workers out there. So Patrick\u2026 A - Sheldon Adelson : I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear what you said. Felicia Hendrix : I just \u2013 I was thanking you for all that you and the company have done to get the important PPE to healthcare workers. A - Sheldon Adelson : Great, thank you. Felicia Hendrix : Yeah, thank you. Sheldon Adelson : We\u2019re still doing it. We got a plane \u2013 we have sent four more 747 trips to go to China to pick up more of the masks and PPE. So listen, something we do like that potentially saves lives and it's nothing for us, particularly the fuel \u2013 the cost of fuel is nothing. So we could fly over there and come back at a very low cost. Felicia Hendrix : That's great. Patrick, just to stay on the topic of the OpEx and the monthly cash burn, one of the things that we've kind of struggled with as we\u2019ve tried to model in you know a gradual recovery is kind of how to flex that cash burn. So you know obviously you're not going to go from 110 back to your full run rate, right, and it's going to ramp up. So is the right way to think about it is just kind of like \u2013 and I know that most of its \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s variable, so the way we\u2019re thinking about it is like to just kind of like pro-rata, like run it, rate it versus in terms of how like you're ramping up. So is that the right way to think about it and more importantly I'm wondering you know, as you kind of work to really mitigate costs as you've been in almost like shutdown mode, are there things that are going to kind of stick or are there going to be cost mitigation efforts that you've made now that are going to benefit you in the future. Patrick Dumont : So, kind of a two part question there. You know, I appreciate the detail. I think the way to think about margin recovery is that when you look as it part of an uncontrolled operating expenses, you know call it across \u201919. That represents a little bit more than 60% of our total expense structure. And so when you think about that and you think about sort of our controlling operating expenses, that was kind of in the 38% context.  And so what you'll see is that those uncontrollable expenses which are mostly gaming tax, which actually was about 60% of that, you know of that little more than 60, about 60% of that is gaming tax, that's really going to drive the way the margins look, because we will start getting operating leverage. So if you think about that other 38% that's controllable, some of that\u2019s variable.  Our payroll, although you\u2019d say that it was something that is under control, you know we've taken the [doctor] [ph] and that we want to keep our team together, and so that's something that we're very focused on. So when you think of our two largest expenses as the gaming tax and as the payroll, you can kind of walk into what that margin might look like during this, call it transition period of ramp up. So will we run, you know call it the 33% EBITDA margin we were running before right out the gate? Unless there's an immediate snapback recovery, that might be a little challenged. But when you look at the expenses that we have controlled and you look at the marketing expenses and the way that we look at the other parts of the business, we've been able to control costs in a very disciplined way. You know we went \u2013 you know the business has experienced other troughs before and we've always managed expenses to ensure liquidity and to ensure the proper recovery when it comes around.  And so I think, are there some margin opportunities? Sure, but I think it also depends on what segment comes back and when. As you know that the junket segment is obviously much lower margin and less contribution, providing then the mass and premium mass segment. So if we get huge volumes of mass business, our margins are going to look tremendous right out of the gate.  So I think for us a lot of it depends on what segment of the business you call the recovery on first. So I think given that expense structure, given the \u2013 your view that you may have on recovery of the business, you can kind of formulate a transitional margin process for the business. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, that's really helpful, thank you. And Patrick, this is probably also for you as well. You know obviously you guys have been doing a lot of stress testing on the company, led you to the dividend decision. Just wondering, you know how deeply have the stress tests cut into the liquidity cushion, and would you be willing to take on more debt? And if so, where would you see that maxing out and then what milestones would you have to reach to reinstate the dividend? Patrick Dumont : So I'll leave the last part of the question for the Chairman, since that's really something that falls to him, but I think the key thing for us here is that as we mentioned before in prior earnings calls, is we\u2019re very focused on looking at the liquidity of the company; very focused on looking at the long term objectives of the Chairman.  Our highest and best use of capital is reinvestment in high-growth projects, and if you look at our track record on return on invested capital and the projects that our Chairman has led, it's tremendous. And so our goal is to preserve that liquidity and also to continue and invest in our key markets to drive that high ROIC, and so if you look at the Chairman's notes and the strategies he\u2019s laid out, we are continuing to invest in these markets to ensure that we get the high returns going forward when the market does recover.  That being said, we look at a variety of scenarios. We have a lot of different downside cases, a lot of different liquidity scenarios, a lot of different CapEx scenarios, so that we ensure we can analyze things to a satisfactory in which the Board feels comfortable making a decision with the Chairman and that's what we've done here.  So if you look at page eight in the deck, you can see that we\u2019ve laid out the cash and available liquidity. You can see that right now under the current conditions as we presented them, we can go more than 18 months and invest in completing the projects in Macao and continue along with Marina Bay Sands new developments, and so that's very encouraging for us. We feel very strong about our balance sheet position, our Board feels very confident in our ability to weather the storm.  And that being said, if for some reason we felt like we needed access to the capital markets, we spend a lot of time working to ensure that we had access to the most deep and most liquid market in the world, which is the high grade bond market, and so as an investment grade company, the investment grade bond market opened very quickly after the impacts of coronavirus hit the capital markets, and issuers do have access, and we feel very comfortable at our ability. We feel great about the high grade markets and at some point if the Board makes a determination with management that it makes sense to raise additional equity, we\u2019ll have the ability to do so, we're very confident about that. But at this time we're very comfortable with our liquidity on-hand; we\u2019ve shown the analysis on page eight and you know we're looking forward to a strong recovery, so we can benefit from the huge CapEx developments that we've been undertaking during this time.  And then one last question, I think the second part of that, was that you directed something that would probably best be answered by the Chairman, which is kind of view on dividends and when the dividends may come back and what that looks like. And so if that\u2019s okay, Sheldon, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you. A - Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Patrick. We will reinstate the dividend after discussing it with the Board of Directors. When things get back to where we were, it\u2019s very simple. I don't think it's a long time away. If the rumors are \u2013 Macao is a big percentage of our, both GGI, Gross Gaming Income and our EBITDA, and I think that is the level that will come back first. Then probably Singapore and Vegas, in that order perhaps. So if what Rob says is true, the people are dying and anxious to get back to \u2013 no, we don't want them to die \u2013 get back to Macao to enjoy themselves, then it should come back sooner rather than later.  Listen, I'm the largest shareholder, my family and I, and we want the dividend reinstated more than you do. So if you could see the amount of money that we're not getting, I would certainly like to have that in our savings account, so we\u2019ll reinstate the dividend as soon as we get back to earning some money. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, thank you very much. Sheldon Adelson : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line as Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question. Thomas Allen : Thank you. So I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out what the business is going to look like in the future when things come back. Macao reopened at the end of February and there were a couple weeks there before the travel restrictions went to place in Guangdong and got stricter Macao. Can you just qualitatively talk to us about what business was like then and how social distancing measure has impacted your business?  And on a similar vein, can you just talk about how Singapore was performing? I know you put the monthly numbers on slide seven, but just qualitatively how social distancing measures were impacting Singapore during the time period before it closed. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thomas, it's Rob. I think in Singapore social distancing did have an impact, because we\u2019re limited there in terms of size of the operation. I think we\u2019ll have an impact on Singapore in the future. The question is how long those social distancing [inaudible] stay in place and we just don't know, but it will have an impact, negative in terms of Singapore. In Macao I think we\u2019re in a much different position because the scale and size of operations enable us to \u2013 we have so much square footage there and so many more slots and tables that I think we can do much better business in Macao than in Singapore vis-\u00e0-vis social distancing. But I think that the area you talked about, the time periods obviously were impacted not just by social distancing, but you know demand slowed because it was more difficult to get there and there was more concerns about access and it was a confusing time in both markets in terms of visas getting in, getting out of quarantine. I don't think it's an adequate snapshot when rebound comes. I think once in Macao we opened the doors back up in the 14 day quarantine and the IBS team is back in place. I think we'll be able to do quite well and the social distance will have a minimal impact in Macao, again the size and scale of our operations in the numerous table slots and square footage.  I think in Singapore we\u2019re going to have a lot of demand. I spoke to the team this morning and they were laughing about the amount of people calling to complain about the fact we\u2019re closed and want to come gamble. I do believe we'll see a lot of demand in Singapore. I am concerned that may have a negative impact. I cannot tell you obviously what that'll be, but I think we\u2019ll have more demand come this summer, especially come fall, and Singapore could be adversely impacted by social distancing, so it remains to be seen. Thomas Allen : Nice job. And then just as my follow up, when you announced the dividend cut, in the prepared commented it said miscellaneous [ph] and I think you wrote, \u2018I see many strategic opportunities for our company precisely because our financial strength.\u2019 Could we just have some more detail on this comment? I think some people are interpreting it to imply that you would be interested in M&A. Is that the right perception? I think Patrick talked about high growth opportunities earlier. I just want to clarify those comments. A - Sheldon Adelson : I'd like to reaffirm what you're thinking. It does mean that we're interested in M&A. One of the reasons why we're the biggest and we've got the best balance sheet in the industry, our market cap up until this \u2013 till this virus came, was equal to the combined market capital of all our competitors in the U.S. combined. So it's \u2013 I'm not going to give up on developing integrated resorts. I'm going to add on to our strategic thinking or strategic priorities that we can acquire, because most of the other companies, one, don't have the balance sheet that we do, and they don't have the potential market that we do, and we can go in and acquire one or more operations that if \u2013 of course the price has to be right and so are now taken on the strategy of both acquiring and building and developing. Thomas Allen : And if I can just quickly follow up on that, any changes to your views on what markets you'd like to be in? Sheldon Adelson : Not really, but we've always wanted \u2013 we\u2019ve always said that Asia is the best place for us. Because number one, in this virus shutdown the agents have been through this for a long time, for several times, so they are used to it. And when it opens up again, they're just going to come back and continue, maybe at a higher pace to make up for lost time that they have experienced. So Asia has got the population, is the most inclined to play, to gamble than other populations. So it looks like if we can find something good in Asia we'd certainly like to do that. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : Either to acquire or to build. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. You may now ask your question. Steven Wieczynski : Yeah you guys, good afternoon. Rob so maybe you can help us think about the Vegas market a little bit at this point, but obviously with what's going on, you probably have seen a drastic slowdown in convention traffic. But wanted to you know understand what you're seeing in terms of the folks that did have convention meetings on the book. Are they willing to rebook at a later date or are they holding out at this point? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, good question. We see a different path in Vegas than in Asia. Again, Sheldon referenced not the comfort, but the exposure Asia\u2019s had to the viruses and these kinds of things. As you know when your applying to Asia, you know temperature testing and mass are kind of the way it works over there anyway. So I think that the U.S. has never experienced on our shores these kinds of thing. So as it relates to the group market, I'm surprised. I just talked to George this morning, who runs our building here, George Markantonis. He's saying strong demand in August from multiple groups and he feels the demand is there. The question is going to be Airlift in the Las Vegas. I don't know how Airlift will look in the 90 days. I don't know how you know the economic impact in terms of how Americans will spend money to think about being here, but group business appears to be out there for August and into the fall. They are not canceling the 21; they are rebooking into late summer and fall. I think demands there \u2013 I spoke to some of our competitors, the same thinking applies there.  I don\u2019t think Vegas has a problem with getting whose back into place. That we have the proper social distancing, the proper etiquette in place to protect people, and I think that's going to be, it looked like Asia which is a lot of social distance, a lot of controls to make sure it's as safe as we can make it, cleanliness and etcetera. But apparently George thinks the demand is there and I've heard that from multiple companies in town. I thought they\u2019ll push back in \u201921, but they haven\u2019t. Its August, September, October and November pretty strong demand, so\u2026 Sheldon Adelson : I can tell your coming from that business myself. This is Sheldon. They can't \u2013 a lot of the companies, both private and association wise are relying upon their shows to expand their own businesses and to do what it is they usually do with the show; research, recruitment, etcetera, and so they don't want to give up on that. It\u2019s not - we can only have it at this time, and we can \u2013 if we don\u2019t have it at this time, we are not going to ever have it again, that's not the case at all. We don\u2019t have it and make up for the loss of time as soon as they possibly can. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, got you. And then Patrick, you give a lot of color around the dividend, the dividend cut and maybe this is for you or Sheldon, but was there ever the thought \u2013 I mean it seems like your liquidity position is very strong, your balance is very strong. Was there every the thought of keeping some small dividend in place just to maybe keep a little bit of a different investor base included in your stock for the time being or is it always just kind of 100% cut or keep it? Sheldon Adelson : This is not \u2013 this is Sheldon. We haven't eliminated the dividend, we\u2019ve just suspended it, and yes, we could come down to a cut rather than a total suspension. We'll see what happens; how fast we open places and what kind of income we are going to experience.  Listen, I\u2019m in your \u2013 we are all in the same boat. As I said, I own the largest amount of stock, my family and I, of anybody and I want to see the dividend recover and to maintain it as long as possible. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks guys, I appreciate it. Sheldon Adelson : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. You may now ask your question. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon and I want to echo the sentiments that I hope everybody's safe and healthy. Just wanted to follow-up on maybe the Singapore recovery, because this market is \u2013 you know it's relatively unique to Las Vegas Sands. I appreciate all the extra color and disclosure you gave there. Can you maybe Rob give us a little bit more color on just sort of the current customer mix there and how you expect maybe that to trend as Asia kind of reopens, maybe between you know kind of your VIP customers and a little bit of the mass market there. Where's it coming from and how do you think the source markets are going to react in that market. Robert Goldstein : Well, currently as you know the customer mix there is zero since we are closed till June 1. The team is pretty confident that we'll get opened in June. It doesn't pretty much concern that it will be extended beyond this. They seem like they can \u2013 had you saw the journal this morning, the majority of the problem is in the \u2013 has been isolated. I think Paul and Andrew and all the guys there told me this morning, they feel pretty confident we\u2019ll open in June. So local market was thriving and they think we\u2019ll thrive. In fact they were talking about the amount of people calling to complain that they couldn't gambles. We feel pretty confident that the local market will bounce back immediately, and be pretty strong actually because it's an activity people enjoy being part of in Singapore and we are very confident that rebounds really quickly in June too.  The local market, these foreign local markets, meeting Indonesia, Malaysia, I\u2019m not too strong on, because I think that those countries are facing challenges. I'm not sure the borders will even be open to those people, but I feel less aggressive in terms of rebound of our local market thus far and meeting again the countries nearby. Indonesia, Malaysia, a bit of struggle right now. I think we\u2019ll be slow to see t that return. I think we\u2019ll be quick to see return to China, if we get open, the border is open and the Chinese are able to come. I think that will cover rather quickly.  I think Singapore becomes positive right away in June, and then ramps up throughout the summer, but it will miss some key elements of local foreign markets surrounding the neighborhood.  I don't think Malaysia or Indonesia will be simple to get back to Singapore for the summer. I do think China and local play will be strong. I know local play will be strong because it drove our business prior to closing and we hear anecdotally that people are really frustrated and want to go back to gambling in the casinos.  Well, also as you mentioned, you know Shaun you know, you've been to Asia enough, but the idea of wearing a mask or social distancing or thermometer checks will not be difficult for the customers in local Singaporeans, nor Chinese's visitors, they'll except it, they\u2019ll deal with it and as you know the high end bankrupt business anyway is people in rooms two or three and in large rooms, so no problem there.  The only thing I'm concerned about is, if we get into a mass business, there again quickly is what we may lose \u2013 the spread can be difficult vis-\u00e0-vis the main gaming floor, because we'll be social distancing the slot machines etcetera. But once again, like a lot of markets we have a lot of very high end who play both slot ETG and table. I think we accommodate.  We may be at risks where it relates to masses of people coming in and the slot machines not having enough capacity and saying the tables mass. No risk on the high end mass or risk on the mass.  And again, I think Singapore is going to be like Macao, quick to recover. Unlike the U.S. which I think is more drastic and slower. Their ability to acclimate to this environment has improved in the past. They've lived through SARS, they\u2019ve lived through Swine Flu, they\u2019ve lived through a lot of things and they always are going to come back and they come back much quicker than we anticipate.  So we feel bullish with the caveat that you know our foreign business around us, our neighbor's foreign business might be pushed back into the fall and not be there. We feel strongly our high end Chinese business will cover rather quickly. We know it will, because the demand is there. Shaun Kelley : Great! I really appreciate all the detail on that Rob. And then sort of the other way to split out the trajectory recovery in Macao, I think you talked a little bit about the restrictions there and the difficult read in March, but did you see so what we were able to see in March. I mean was it really that VIP was the only thing or was the primary market that was available at that time, just given the broader travel restrictions, is that kind of the way to read the data that we have thus far. Is that kind of what \u2013 a little bit of what you saw in that market just so we can characterize it for investors? Robert Goldstein : Yeah, I wish I can give you a better color, but we just saw such a turn down, now that the business has turned out. People \u2013 I read these things, at the high end people will come back first or the premium mass to come back to the mass mass. I don't think we saw evidence of that in those two weeks. I think is was so confusing and the restrictions etcetera.  I just don\u2019t think there was good evidence of what\u2019s going to happen in the future. What I do believe is that China is going back to work, they're going back to travel and when the IVS and the 14 day quarantine are taken away, I think all segments come back and come back rather healthy. I think by \u2013 you know by late summer, early fall we are going to see some nice profitability out of our Asia properties. By late fall, by you know thanksgiving or October, I think you\u2019ll see very strong return to a better time over there.  We feel just extremely confident that Asia gets better quicker and you are seeing already in China with the travel restrictions being eased. What I don't know is the province by province access into Macao, how that will happen, but it will happen and I think there's been a strong claim made by the Macao government to get started, they're hoping to see the restrictions eased.  I just don't think the two weeks, three weeks could be really a strong indicator of how it\u2019s going to come back. I think it comes back across all segments. I'm not a believer it's just going to be the high end. I believe it\u2019s going to need plenty of mass people as well. Shaun Kelley : Thanks Rob. The optimism is definitely refreshing, so I appreciate it. Robert Goldstein : Thank you, we're optimistic. The world will recover. Operator : Your next question comes from the line in Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Stephen Grambling : Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019ll eco the well wishes to all of you and your families and also Felicia\u2019s on the personal protective equipment as my wife is actually one of those healthcare workers needing it, so thank you.  My first question is a follow-up on the comments around M&A. Can you elaborate on the guidelines that may dictate whether you would pursue individual assets versus whole companies? How willing regulators may or may not be to these types of transactions and where you generally would expect the biggest synergy potential? Robert Goldstein : Sheldon, you want to take that or do you want us to take it here in the office. Sheldon Adelson : Take it there. Patrick Dumont : Okay. So its Patrick, and thanks for the question. I think you know one thing that you should sort of look at in terms of the lens we might examine M&A up through \u2013 it\u2019s just on our long term views on returns, and so you the Chairman has been very strict about the way we deploy capital in order to ensure that we get the right returns to justify things and that's always been true in developments and it will certainly be true through any M&A transactions.  And so I think the way we are thinking about it is, and from the discussions that we've had, just around trying to be opportunistic, we are looking to see high quality assets where they are in key markets where it may be cheaper to buy them to build, and you may find something that is attractive and fits into our overall strategy in the long run, and I think we're going to be very returns focused.  Clearly our industry is heavily regulated and we're going to have to ensure a proper compliance as we always do, and we are going to have to look very carefully at those opportunities in that context. And I think you know it's not as if this is something that will happen immediately. This is going to evolve over time and we\u2019re going to have an opportunity to take a very hard and disciplined look and see if any of those opportunities are attractive to the Chairman of the board. And so I think that's kind of how we'll think about it. Stephen Grambling : Thanks and then maybe a follow-up on Shaun\u2019s question around Marina Bay Sands. You talked to the revenue trajectory, but can you just remind us of the puts and takes that might impact that property's margins relative to others as we think about the reramp since it looks like you had very solid margins this quarter and it looks like even the OpEx per day in the zero revenue is better than peers. Thanks. Patrick Dumont : So I think overall in Marina Bay Sands, the margins in that property are really tremendous. I think a lot of that has to do with the original strategy that goes back to the Chairman\u2019s view that creating a very high quality with integrated resorts and multi-amenities to the highest level would produce high margins, and you see the results since the history of the opening of the property. That strategy has been spot on and it\u2019s really delivered. It's been a tremendous asset and has driven tourism and has really contributed to the market of Singapore, and I think it's been great.  I think to Rob's comments earlier, we know that there's a lot of pent-up demand and you know I think the opportunity here for us is to look at it for the long run. I think we're very focused on deploying capital there. We have a bunch of projects to help it enhance and improve the offering at Marina Bay Sands that we think will be margin enhancing and cash flow enhancing.  I think we're very focused on the development in Tower 2. You know the Chairman's vision there is great and we're very excited to get that arena open. We think that will add to the tourism offering of Singapore. We already have some market test about that, because we have the \u2013 you know we obviously have the arena in Macao that we operate and it's a great tourism asset and it works very well with the mass business and premium mass business. So we see a corollary there in Singapore where we can drive significant visitation from the around and catchment area out of that arena.  So I think if you look at Singapore over the next couple years, we're going to see what we hope is very high value returns on the new deployed capital, in a market that continues to maintain very high margin structure. And so, while we don\u2019t know exactly the pace of recovery that we\u2019ll see today, we do know that in the long run and as Rob said when things were covered because of the demand, we're going to be poised to take advantage of it and continue to deliver very high margins and strong cash flow. So that's kind of how we think of that. Stephen Grambling : Thanks so much for all the color and perspectives. Best of luck! Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. You may now ask your question. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, thank you. Thanks everyone for the comments. I think this one\u2019s probably best for you, as you think about kind of the near to medium term and maybe make the assumption that specifically in the Macao I would imagine the two sub-segments of your gaming business will ramp at different speeds. Have you guys adjust strategically at all to maybe pivot business over more towards a VIP customer that might be more pronounced [inaudible] or do not see it that way. Robert Goldstein : We had a little problem hearing you. Are you saying that \u2013 we couldn\u2019t catch all that. But you are saying that you think VIPs are going to ramp much quicker than mass? Carlo Santarelli : Well, I'm asking if that is your opinion and then if you came in the business at all differently. So I kind of wanted to read your perspective on that? Robert Goldstein : No, we\u2019re not going to think that way. We believe the mass premium \u2013 we believe the pent-up demand is real in all segments and if anything, I think it will be a mistake to think that way. We believe this is going to open up to a lot of business come this summer and the fall.  The social distance, we\u2019ll have to work through, but I think Asians and Chinese are as they open that market up, open their country up, as those quarantine barriers come down and the IBS comes up, I do think we are going to see a return on all segments. We are pretty confident the Macao is also making some money this summer, and a lot of money come fall. And again I'll be redundant here, but the Asians, we've never seen this kind of a virus on our shores here in the U.S. where we\u2019ve kind of taken aback and shell shocked by it. Asia has seen it numerous times, they understand it, they dealt with it.  You guys Hong Kong is open and operating. It never closed in terms of retail and restaurants and they're walking around with gloves and mask and sanitizers and temperature checks. Everything is open in Hong Kong in terms of the restaurants retail and I think their statistics are pretty excellent relative to the rest of the world. They can deal with it and Macao will deal with it and I think visitation will be \u2013 I think it'll be a mistake to try to handicap which segment is back first. I think they all come back and we're pretty anxious to see that happen in the 60 days with the first phase and then hopefully by late summer it really kicks in all the way.  Our job is to provide a safe environment for our employees and for our customers, so they keep coming and there is no reinfection. But again, unlike the U.S. which I think people are concerned, even Nevada are having a hard time getting opened again, because the people are so scared and don\u2019t have any idea.  Hong Kong, right now you can go out for dinner, you can go shopping. So they\u2019ve kind of come to terms with much more comfortably than we have. But I think it's a mistake to try to figure out which segment resurrects quickest. I think they all come back pretty quickly. Carlo Santarelli : Great! Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up as it pertains to Marina Bay Sands. It looks like just timing of CapEx has shifted a little bit up to where it was. Could you guys just kind of provide an outline for maybe the key milestones of that project and how you kind of foresee the construction process? Robert Goldstein : Sorry, are you referring \u2013 so page 11 has our CapEx expectations in the slide presentation. You\u2019re referring to the expansion, so the new Tower for Marina Bay Sands? Carlo Santarelli : Yeah, just in terms of the timeline of construction and what not. Robert Goldstein : So I think what we\u2019ve laid out here is pretty consistent with our thinking today. I think we're really not going to start any heavy expenditure until the back half of \u201921, and then we'll sort of follow as quick an execution schedule as we can follow. It's funny, the Chairman always says to us, \u2018You know I build a Venetian in less than two years. You guys should do the same.\u2019 So we are going to do the best that we can do to be as aggressive as we can be, because really we want to add these assets to the tourism portfolio of Singapore as quickly as possible.  Tokyo, I think if you look in Macao, and you look at kind of the trajectory of our latest projects, which was really from the ground up the Parisian, you can kind of see the distribution there in some of our prior presentations about how CapEx progressed. Some of that is influenced by labor availability. You know in Singapore we\u2019d like to believe that in this particular market we\u2019ll have the ability to pursue the schedule we\u2019ve kind of laid out there where the majority is coming across \u201922, clean up in \u201823 and then we'll see what happens. Maybe there\u2019ll be some in \u201824 as of right now, we're not sure.  So I think our goal is to try to get this thing open as quickly as possible once we get the proper approvals from the government of Singapore, you know with obviously with their support. And just to highlight, we do have a delayed draw financing for that project and so that project is financed in advance and it's the same bank group that we've been with for years that also holds the credit facility there in Singapore. So we're continuing to make progress; we are working on a time line there; we are trying to work as quickly as we can given the current environment and you know we'll continue to keep you updated in upcoming quarters, but we\u2019d like to pursue the schedule as aggressively as we can. Patrick Dumont : For what it's worth Carlo, we also built and when we do open-up this summer, our Four Seasons is fully opened, operational to a 90 keys and then by the end we\u2019ll have the London done as far as the outside and not the fa\u00e7ade. So we're moving quickly. We have 3,000 workers on site right now to finish those projects. Carlo Santarelli : Great! Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Instinet. You may now ask your question. Harry Curtis : Good afternoon everyone. First question had to \u2013 is with respect to building margins back in Macao. Going back to the old adage, never let a crisis go by without learning from it, as you look at your, at some of your larger expenses ex-labor. So for example, marketing food and beverage, are there opportunities here to tweak the way that you operate to bring your margins back faster, so that you'll be running actually more efficiently, even with fewer guests for example? Robert Goldstein : Harry, I guess my confidence may be misguided, but I believe business in Macao is going to be strong enough we don\u2019t have to worry about you know cutting some restaurant workers or cutting some \u2013 I just don't think there's enough margin in cutting costs if the revenues are there; I think the revenues will be there. I just feel like we're overplaying this in terms of how Asia thinks and how Asia rebounds. I think that's an appropriate commentary in question, vis-\u00e0-vis Las Vegas. I think it's a very fair question.  But in Macao and Singapore, I think we have great pent-up demand. We hear it; we feel it and we think that unless we\u2019re misguided in that thinking, it will be a mistake to pull back our F&B, pull back on a lot of things that we do there, because again you can't overcome the enormous top-line. These are top-line businesses over there in Asia and I think they need those kinds of services, goods and services to be successful.  I don't see and may be Patrick sees it, but I just don\u2019t see enough. Unless a business comes back to levels we believe this year, in Asia I think it would be mistaken to try to shave a few points of cost and drive margin, because the revenue should be there in my estimation. Patrick Dumont : And just one additional thing to think about. Before the start of this disruption, the beginning in the first quarter of this year, this was a very well-functioning, very well-oiled machine that ran high margins and was incredibly efficient and continually look to make itself more efficient each quarter.  And so I think we won\u2019t look at this purely from the transition standpoint. We're going to look at this from the way we always look at it, which is to Rob's point, we've got to grow revenue and we believe that it will happen, and then we're going to continue to manage the business in a very cost efficient manner, ensuring that we generate as much cash flow and keep our margins strong.  And so I think it's difficult from where we sit today, to tell you all the things that we\u2019ll do going forward, because we've looked very carefully at our business each quarter and we've taken costs out of it appropriately, and so I think we'll just continue to do that and try to run as efficient a business as possible. Harry Curtis : Fair enough. Let me move on to a broader topic that looks out five to 10 years and is tied to your \u2013 to Sheldon's comments about addition spending in Macao. There\u2019s a new Chief Executive. Some investors are questioning the relationship that the concessionaires might have going forward with the new Chief Executive, but it seems to me his most recent comments has actually been somewhat encouraging that the concessionaires have been positive for Vegas.  So my question of Vegas, Macao rather \u2013 so my question is, as you think about the future and spending in Macao, what partnerships might develop with the government or other companies or in the hospitality industry or in completely different industries that would position Las Vegas Sands to get a high return on incremental investment? Robert Goldstein : First I\u2019ll say \u2013 I\u2019ll repeat Sheldon's comments at the top of the call. We love to investment in Macao; we are keen to invest in Macao. I don't know you saw the Chief Executive calling us out for participating in the quarantine with our hotel rooms and commending our actions there, but we are pleased to see the recognition on that.  But I think we\u2019ve always been consistent and Sheldon has been consistent. We want to invest as much as we can in Macao, as often as we can in Macao, and we're anxious for that day to come Harry. The minute we get the go-ahead, I think Mr. Adelson and our Board would be predisposed to write very large checks very quickly. We've always been believers. We believe the market just has so much potential growth there. There is so much opportunity. You know the future of Macro is very bright and very diversified and we are very anxiously a part of that. I think Sheldon\u2019s always been unequivocal in his willingness to invest, invest, invest in the future Macao. Sheldon, do you want to echo those sentiments? Sheldon Adelson : Yeah, I\u2019ll echo those. Robert Goldstein : Echo. Sheldon Adelson : Ditto. Listen, we\u2019ve \u2013 Macao is, will be the best, if not one of the best. It will be the best and the best gaming and leisure destination anywhere in the world. So there's no reason why it should grow. While Rob was taking, I was thinking about potentially it could only grow as big as Vegas does. It actually \u2013 the population that it serves is much greater than what Vegas serves and it could grow into that, but it will take a long time to go into that. We\u2019ve got 150,000 rooms. Its only about 35,000, 40,000 rooms in Macao. So it will take quite a while for it to grow well beyond that. Harry Curtis : Okay, thanks very much everyone. Sheldon Adelson : It certainly has the growth potential. Robert Goldstein : Thanks Harry. Harry Curtis : I appreciate it everyone. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. You may now ask your question. David Katz : Hi! Evening everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just go back to the reopening and trying and envision, and Rob you touched on this on the mass side. You know what operationally it could look like from people taking ferry, border crossings etcetera. You know, are we envisioning gloves, masks and you know temperature. And I suppose I would ask the same question about Las Vegas, and you know given as you point out aptly we may not be as used to it here. What that potentially could look like, we saw some release from the Nevada Gaming Commission this afternoon. Robert Goldstein : Right, right. David, I think if you look at \u2013 I think I turn to Hong Kong as a guideline. I think the Asian people will adapt. Well yes, the answer is there\u2019ll be temperature checks, there\u2019ll be masks, there\u2019ll be gloves. We are going to do whatever we can do to ensure our employees and our customers are in an environment they can have fun in and visit us and all that, but they are not going to be at risk as best we can prevent that. The rooms will be clean beyond clean, the wiping down of surfaces, the social distancing. They're doing it in Hong Kong.  I think the last time I looked Hong Kong had less than a dozen deaths and again, retails are opened. You go into Hong Kong; the restaurants you sit in are five to 10 feet apart. You get a temp check coming in, you wear gloves, wear a mask and it\u2019s a different world, but the Asians are \u2013 there\u2019s all kind of sanitizer, but they're doing it as we speak in Hong Kong today. I envision a similar environment here in Las Vegas and in Macao. The difference is going to be the ability to acclimate is much higher in Asia, because for years I've been going to the airports via Tokyo or Hong Kong, Macao. When you do a temperature check and people are wearing masks, it\u2019s not that far in that thinking. So I don't think the Asian people have a problem at all. In fact I think they are going to welcome it and be anxious to get back to having fun in casinos. I believe that from the bottom of my heart the recovery in Asia is going to happen rather quickly. I'm not as comfortable and Vegas one of the reasons I'm concerned is because this foreign door thinking, this is I've been wearing a mask now for a while and its different, you know it is different, and I think it will be a little bit difficulty. I also wore it at the Airlift and how the airlines will be able to fly into Las Vegas, because the Airlift is an important part of our success. So although it's going to take some time, some comfort to get people to acclimate, I think it's going to happen and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem at all that it\u2019s going to happen in Macao.  The minute they open doors in Macao, we're ready. We have the gloves, the mask, the sanitizer, the temperature checks, but I think your best example is what's happening in Hong Kong as we speak. It\u2019s pretty amazing. You can go shopping, you can go eating, you can do a lot of things there and life there is not usual, but it\u2019s ongoing and that\u2019s what we hope we can do in Las Vegas as well and adapt to the new environment until the day comes when a vaccine or cure, I believe that's going to happen.  How did we live through so many of these things? The stock market crash in \u201980\u2019s to 2001 to 2008, 2009 to SARS. People will say, \u2018Oh! That\u2019s going to change everything. It\u2019s going to be all different. It\u2019ll never be the same. I\u2019ll agree. I think this thing will get fixed at some point. There will be some remedy, be it a vaccine or be it some way of getting \u2013 the medical people, there\u2019s too many smart people out looking, but I think the world will return, but Asian will return quicker and will rebound much faster than here and there'll be no aversion to wearing a mask and gloves and social distancing. In fact they\u2019ll welcome it as long as they can come back to Macao and Singapore. Sheldon Adelson : Rob, you\u2019re not old. You remember all those past times. Robert Goldstein : What\u2019s that? Sheldon Adelson : You are not that old that you remember all those incidents in the past. Robert Goldstein : I was much younger, so I remember them. David Katz : Dinner out sounds great. Be well everyone and thanks for taking my question. Robert Goldstein : Thanks David. See you one of these days. Operator : Thank you presenters and thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining Las Vegas Sands, first quarter 2020 earnings call. That concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day!",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs. Daniel Briggs : Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Mr. Adelson. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these challenging times. While the company is facing COVID-19 challenges, we're excited that we are seeing the first signs of recovery. We're happy to report that Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is now open. And that since July 15, certain visit is returning to Guangdong Province from Macao and no longer subject to quarantine. This is a critical first step towards the relaxation of quarantine restrictions in provinces outside of Guangdong, as well as the eventual resumption of tourist visa issuance to Macao. While the recovery in our local communities is now in its early stages, we will remain steadfast in our commitments to the health and safety of our employees and customers and to providing assistance in our host markets. We remain confident that travel and tourism spending in each of our markets will eventually fully recover. My 70 -- my over 70 years of business experience are the basis from my unbridled optimism that people will travel again, shop again and come together again to enjoy entertainment and social interaction, to exchange ideas and to conduct business. Our optimism about an eventual recovery, coupled with our financial strength enables us to continue the execution of our capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore. We believe these investments will strengthen our leadership position in each of these markets and will provide a larger platform for future growth as travel and tourism spending return. In Macao, we continue to make great progress in the execution of our US$ 2.2 billion capital investment program for the London and Macao and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons. As we complete these and other capital projects during the year and in 2021, we will be introducing a variety of world-class integrated results of elements. This includes three new all suite hotels, more than a dozen new restaurants, additional retail and new MICE and entertainment facilities. We're very confident that these new developments will help Macao to recapture and overturn increase its share of leisure and business tourism from China and the rest of Asia. We remain unwavering in our commitment to long-term investment in Macao. The scale of our existing and ongoing investments enables us to play our part in supporting the local economy of Macao today, including our support of local employment, as well as our support to small- and medium-sized businesses. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the potential to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world and the MICE capital of Asia. We would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional investment dollars and extend our contributions to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Now turning to our investment in the expansion of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We remain excited to be part of Singapore's continued growth as a leading leisure and business tourism destination. We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion. We believe that delays in the timing of the project are likely to occur. These delays are principally related to the impact of the pandemic, and we will provide additional updates in the future, as conditions are continuing to evolve. In advance of the expansion, we will also continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands, to enhance the customer experience and the tourism appeal of the resort. Finally, turning to Las Vegas. The eventual recovery could take more time here than in Asia, particularly because of our reliance on group meeting business. We remain confident that Las Vegas will remain the greatest leisure and business tourism destinations in the United States. Regarding our balance sheet, maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great businesses, where we weather with the storm caused by this pandemic. Our balance sheet strength enables us to invest in promising future growth opportunities, and positions the company to deliver industry-leading growth in the years ahead. We're deeply confident that the eventual recovery in travel and tourism spending and the strength of our business model will enable us to deliver both growth and the return of capital to shareholders in the future. Thank you again for joining us on the call today, and now we'll take questions. Faith, we're ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. My first question relates to Macao. I was hoping you could give us some sense of your anticipated benefit and what you have seen over the last week or so since the Guangdong quarantine requirement was lifted. So a two-part related question. One, do you think this travel easing if isolation, so without any other travel restrictions, easing, new visa issuance can get you to EBITDA breaking even in Macao? And two, when you look at -- second part of this question, when you look at the last 8 to 10 days, how similar was this period's performance to the performance just over between February 20 when the casinos reopened and March 20 when Guangdong initiated quarantine requirement? And then I have related follow-up. Rob Goldstein : Yes. Joe, hi, it's Rob. I think there's a big difference between the dates you mentioned in the current period. We believe Macao is our biggest upside potential, but I think it's critical to realize that I think you know that without the IVS, Individual Visitation Scheme, being resurrected, there's not much hope for the casinos to come back. The visitation is, I think, 2,000, 3,000 -- there is three steps. We took the first big step for the quarantine being taken away. The second step will be the IVS resurrection. Hopefully, that happens we don't know when, but that's critical. Of course, then finally beyond Guangdong, we need to see the other provinces open as well. It's not really that impactful financially, or the income of Macao, the quarantine disappearing without a reservation of the IVS. And I think that subsequent, the Guangdong will be helpful. But as you know, we need other provinces come back as well. So I don't think there's much use to compare the period you mentioned. And today, it's very different. Only left is non-expired IVS, and those are dwindling. So the impact is negligible. I think the victory is puric in terms of the financial results, but very helpful in terms of once the IVS comes down or it comes back, and of course, more importantly, that we get beyond Guangdong since Macao is the only provinces that contributed to its income. So we feel -- we're very excited about the potential. When it does happen, we're still strong believers in the pent-up demand theory. We're still strong believers that our business will come back quite well. The problem is I can't nor anyone else give you a date certain. It could be next month. It could be in the fall. It could be late in the fall. So we have to remain patient. We remain steadfast and I believe the business will come back, and we'll wait for that day. Sheldon Adelson : So those -- this is Sheldon. Those who believe that it'll take a couple of weeks for each step, the Guangdong waiver of the quarantine upon return of Guangdong Province might take two weeks and then they'll open up another province, and they'll do it gradually until we get to most or all of the provinces. The IVS game, they know -- the Macao government knows that the IVS game is important and that we need that. So we're also hopeful that, that will take place in the -- sooner rather than later. But there's no guarantee, but it's our hope. Joe Greff : Great. That's helpful, Sheldon. Thank you. And then sorry to ask the Las Vegas question so early in the queue here. But Rob, can you give us a sense of group and convention, activity cancellations, attrition rates for the fall and the rest of 2020, what you're seeing for the first half of next year and then maybe, importantly, what you're seeing with respect to Las Vega your airlift capacity for the end of this year for October through December. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Sure, Joe. As you know, we're running three very different businesses, very distinct business to Singapore, Macao versus Las Vegas, of all of them, I view Las Vegas lease favorably. And for the reasons you mentioned, Las Vegas, especially our company, but the whole city, is dependent upon group and convention and banquet segment return. I see nothing indicates that 2020 would return at all. There's nothing in the horizon group here, group there, but nothing of consequence. And we cannot -- Las Vegas cannot perform without return of these segments. It cannot make money with limited hotel occupancy or in negligible occupancy midweek, maybe 50% capacity weekend. In essence, we're running a regional casino predicated upon driving businesses. We have airlift somewhere around 40% of what it was. And about 40% the occupancy, the plans is much less than it was previously. So we're in a world of hurt here in terms of Vegas. As far as looking ahead, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball into 2021. I remain pessimistic about group and convention. And the reason I say that is, if you believe in a -- if you believe in a vaccine or you believe this thing will eventually just burn off, whatever you believe. I still think the longest -- the slowest return of our business will be large deal group business because it tends to skew younger, it's more tech driven, and those people are more reluctant to travel. So I think we have to take a zero, in my opinion, for the rest of the year in terms of the return on group business and banquet business or any consequence. Could it be a one or two here and there, yes, but nothing material. I don't want to predict 2021 because I don't feel I have enough insight into what might happen to the vaccine or the virus and no way to forecast that. But I would be less than honest if I didn't tell you that Las Vegas is in a very difficult place. Unlike Macao, where there's a real, real strong desire and belief that we'll see things return much quicker in Macao this fall and I feel -- well, Singapore will talk about shortly. But Vegas is dependent on airlift, it's dependent on group and convention. It's not a casino-driven market anymore. So we're struggling here. I think I speak for Las Vegas Venetian and Palazzo but I assume that may translate to other properties as well. It's an amazing transition from -- we're making $0.5 billion a year, and we are hitting on all cylinders. And today, it's painful. And I think it remains painful for the immediate future. 20'21, I think you have to look to that as the turning point, and that would -- that depends on how you view this virus, vaccine situation. But I also caution you that large-scale businesses, like we are big-box businesses, may be the most troubled in terms of the customer consuming us to return to it. So in all the years as I've been here in Las Vegas, I've never felt more gloomier effect [ph] about what's happening in Las Vegas short term, hope. Long term, we can see a better day. Joe Greff : Thanks, Rob, thanks, Sheldon. Operator : Your next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. On last quarter's call, you had expressed some interest in potential M&A activity. And I just wonder what your current thoughts on that are? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Rob, do you want to take that one? Yes, sure. Rob Goldstein : Please. So as we've said, as a consistent theme over the last quarters, we're very focused on returns. Our Chairman is a very returns-focused guy. And I think his mandate has always been to maximize those returns. And I think you heard him on the last earnings call, and he's here today, so we'll probably have some additional commentary. You mentioned M&A, but I think that was done in the context before the benefit of the massive government stimulus programs were seen. And there was a belief that there might be an opportunistic way to take advantage of the environment and capitalize on great assets that could be purchased perhaps below replacement cost or perhaps in a cyclical trough where the acquisition could make our required returns work. And I think in this environment, given where we are today, there aren't a lot of those opportunities available. That being said, I think we'll continue to look. I think we have an opportunity if something comes around, and we'll continue to keep our eyes open. But at this point, we're still very returns-focused. I think we're not going to be an M&A driven shop. But at the same time, if something comes up that's incredibly compelling; I think we'll be happy to take a look at it. Robin Farley : Great. And I appreciate that. And just as a follow-up question. Just given how disruptive the pandemic has been, is your expectations that concession in Macao will be extended for a year, that the whole process of the rebid would be pushed out? Is that something that -- do you think maybe likely or has been communicated in any way to you? Rob Goldstein : Robin, it's Rob. Nothing has been communicated by the government, whatsoever. And we'll remain -- waiting for their advice and counsel. But as of this time, nothing all has been said about extension or timetables. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Sheldon Adelson : I want to bring up something from two questions ago. The withholding of the groups was a non-attendance of the groups is both the state and a federal requirement. The state and the federal could say, you can't have a gathering of any more than, say, 50 people. You can't have conferences and trade shows with gatherings prohibited of more than 50 people. So we got to wait until the state and the federal government opens the door for that. Operator : Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey guys, thank you very much. Rob, on the last call, you talked a little bit about the cadence of how provinces would come online, and I was just wondering if anything has changed with respect to your, you talked it about being a staggered province by province, IVS, kind of release, so to speak, or if there's anything further beyond Guangdong. I know you touched on it a little bit earlier, but is it still your expectation that it will be a staggered process? Rob Goldstein : Yes. Again, I don't have the insight beyond what it's all hearsay. Just be clear, we're not getting official words from the government. But the consensus among those who seem to understand how the government thinks about this is, obviously, we're much more careful than we are here in the U.S., the tolerance is much lower for the spread of virus. But what we hear from various sources that the IVS, when it happens, it stays limited to Guangdong. And then the eventual movement into other provinces will gradual throughout the course of the fall. That's what we're being told. It won't be a green light and all thing opens up onetime. I think they're going to -- I think they're doing very orderly, and you see that with the quarantine. I think the IVS will be the next issue whenever that happens, hopefully soon later. But yes, I believe it's staggered throughout the fall, perhaps even beyond the fall. But I don't -- I've never even say this will be lights go on one day, and boom, China opens up to Macao. We've never heard that from anybody, and we heard from a lot of people. Sheldon Adelson : Rob, I'll give it a try. Rob Goldstein : Yes. Well, you got one, please click it quickly, Sheldon. If you want more of the advice, bring all -- get your bazooka and click it. So, look, we're hopeful, Macao -- I think of all the places we operate, Singapore is one in the middle. Vegas is in the deep part of the pool. But Macao is such potential, we believe. So we're so excited to see that light switch go off and -- but we have to be patient and just wait for that day. That's one thing we should -- I mean, I think I'd say the obvious to you is because you've followed this space forever. But again, this is the world's greatest regional market. It's not air dependent. We don't need airlift. There's 10% of the customers come from air, the rest is sea and land. So, it's fascinating to me how people -- I mean, Macao is so accessible by land and by sea and not air dependent. In essence, what you see in regional markets, which is a quicker recovery, mimic, so I think you'll see in Macao. The minute those barriers come down, I think you'll see a lot of people coming in. They don't need airplanes. They'll need the social distance on the airplanes. It's a huge advantage of Macao, especially when the governments feel comfortable opening the borders. Next question? I'm sorry. Carlo Santarelli : Sorry. I just -- as it pertains to Marina Bay Sands, obviously, you guys -- really when everything is clicking, I mean, it's just a cash flow machine. And right now, given some of the limitations of the social distancing aspects and, obviously, the airlift into Singapore and that being somewhat compromised, do you guys feel the property right now is able to with kind of the patronage that you presumably will get before things change more broadly is able kind of get to a breakeven? I think the operating loss was something like $65 million a month is what you guys had in the slide deck. With maybe what you expect to see now that development are coming back online, is it possible to get that property back towards a breakeven level in the near-term? Rob Goldstein : Yes, it is. Very much so. I mean -- but we're hoping -- just to be clear, you may have know this, but the casino is open, you know that. Now, we're handicap, in a sense, there's only 300 live table games and 1,500 slot ETGs. But we reclaim all that is happening on the 27 this month. Obviously, we're -- that's a market hampered by airlift because -- it's kind of -- it's a hybrid market. It's got this local business because of all the affluent foreigners who reside in Singapore, which there are many, fortunately. Singapore being such extraordinary country to live and conduct the business, we're very fortunate of a strong foreign clientele that has PR status inside the Singapore borders who reside there permanently. Having said that, we love to have more airlift and love to see Malaysia come out. But yes, to answer your question, we feel very, very lucky, very fortunate what's happening in Singapore as we speak. The casino seeing customers, our occupancy was driven by -- mostly by casino next month. And obviously, a very strong casino occupancy month, and there'll be some cash demand as well from staycations from Singaporeans. The border is still closed to Malaysia, except for limited high visibility business folks. So, Singapore has handicapped, but they can make money. And it will make money. It's going to be a nice turnaround, more premature very fortunate that Singapore is coming back online. It's our most -- our best prospect as we speak today, a much better position than we are in Las Vegas. So yes -- but obviously, the maximum potential of that property to get back to $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion days. We need to see the airlift return. We need to see the casino fully operational. But we feel positive about what's happening in Singapore. We feel very fortunate that we've come out of this, and we're open and operational. And we're seeing customers, and we feel good about it. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you very much guys. Operator : Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi everyone. Rob, maybe just a follow-up on Singapore. I mean I think it's a little harder for us to track just some of the local policies in that market about the reopening and what needs to be done in the airlift side. So, anything you could point to as it relates to either agreements on creating local travel bubbles, be it Malaysia or China? And could you just remind us of what are the key source markets that you really need to see open up to make that property look a little bit more like normal? Rob Goldstein : Yes. Well, we need -- the first thing obviously is the airlift, which I don't have any color -- any insight to help you with it. I hope it opens up. I don't see airlift being a real help to the Singapore property probably for the balance of this year. It remains pretty much a market within the borders of Singapore. There is a chance Malaysia opens up. They have COVID under control because they're very similar measures to Singapore. Given the relationship between the JV board and the two countries, there's a possibility of some limited leisure business travel opening up probably in Q4 to Malaysia. I don't see Indonesia. There is talk -- there's hope that they can open some business lanes up through China, but that's not happening today. But I will remind you, we're fortunate again, have a very affluent clientele of foreign people live in Singapore. I think we'll be pleased with the results of Singapore in the fall. But I don't see 2020 being a lot of air traffic in Singapore, foreign visitation. It doesn't seem to me to be in the cards for the foreseeable four or five months. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you. And just as my follow-up, as it relates to Las Vegas, obviously, one of the biggest questions we get is on the corporate and convention side across the whole global hotel business. And I was curious, as you talk to some of the bigger convention and groups or you break down your own business, just any thoughts about some sort of structural change as it relates to any of that activity? I mean, there\u2019s so many barriers that it\u2019s really hard for people to probably extrapolate too much right now, but just any thoughts you have about just demand levels more permanently changing due to conference calls and activity levels or just how do you think about that? Sheldon Adelson : No. Rob Goldstein : We'll get first Sheldon on that. Sheldon Adelson : Thank you. This is Sheldon. Having been in that business in the conference and trade show business. It's a staycation [ph] business for 40 years, I could tell you that there are different constituencies. There were associations that run the events, there are private entities that run the events and there are companies that run their own events. One of our biggest customers is a company that brings several big conferences to our properties in Las Vegas during the course of the year. They can't give up on that. The fact that people are working from home and communicating from home, that is never going to give up on the trade show business, to meet people, to do research, to do recruitment, to announce -- to make announcements and product introductions. There won't be a substitute for that. Shaun Kelley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, thank you so much. First, just wanted to touch on your CapEx. It looks like spend on the London are seems to have been pushed out. So I was wondering if you could walk us through that. Rob Goldstein : From the timing of the financial side? What do you want to hear? Patrick will take you through the financial side. On the timing, we are moving quickly on getting it completed, Felicia. It'll be pretty much done. Four Seasons done this fall. London are done interior wise Q1 of 2020, but a lot more work on exterior wise and there's other pieces to be done. We're going as fast as we can with the constraints of COVID. We've not pulled back in terms of trying to get it done. We're not holding back. We just have some constraints construction wise, but perhaps Patrick will take you through financial side. Patrick Dumont : So there's a couple of things here. Some of this related to permitting, but I think the key thing is we've completed the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, so that's done. The London hotel, which is 580 suites, excluding some high-end suites is done. And then between now and the end of the year, we're going to complete the Londoner Macao, which is 368 suites together with gaming and restaurants. The Londoner casino will be done at the main gaming four level. Paiza gaming will be done. We'll finish the rest of the high-end suites for the Londoner. And we're going to add the Crystal Palace space, which is like the wow space entrants and then 10 new restaurants. So we'll also, throughout the rest of -- part of '21, which is what you see in the CapEx schedule that's in the presentations on Page eight, is really external works and effort to share, Big Ben, some retail areas and some other public spaces. And then -- so I think that's really the shifting in the CapEx that you see was related to permitting. But the project from this customer standpoint, aside from the exterior works still continues to be on the schedule that we expect. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Okay. So the $100 million shift from '21 and then the roughly $700 million shift from '22 that you would say most of that's permitting and maybe some COVID-related delays? Patrick Dumont : That's right. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Helpful. And then just on Vegas and full disclosure, we may have completely modeled this strong, but -- because you've given us the cash burn for property. But even like knowing that, you still did better than we expected in Vegas in terms of costs. I mean we're all looking at big negative numbers, so either take that. But just wondering, was there anything like surprising in Vegas where you were able to just mitigate the lower revenues or anything that kind of came up in the quarter that you may not have thought about? Patrick Dumont : I will take the different side of that I'll turn it over to you. So as they kind of look at Page 5, it's really a near 0 revenue scenario. So when we're making revenue, we're actually able to benefit a little bit. So that's what you saw in Las Vegas. And so we were able to take some cost side of the business as we continue to focus on costs. As a team, we've been very focused on trying to reduce costs across all of our jurisdictions during this time. And we were able to make certain headway in Vegas. But as a practical matter, it's really just based on the revenue that we achieved during the quarter. Felicia Hendrix : Yes. It kind of sounds like, we're just going to ramp up that -- ramp down the cost as much, so thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thank you for taking the question. I guess on -- I was hoping you could give a little more color on margins in Macao. And given you expect some pent-up demand in the market, how are you generally evaluating marketing and/or lending to coax the customer back? And where would you see the health of the junkets are as we prep for an eventual recovery? Rob Goldstein : I think the question about what you market, the building is just open the doors and watch the customers come in. I feel very confident that pent-up demand will cover a lot of our marketing. We don't think an incent or do much more we've ever done. Macao is a frothy market when the barriers come down. So I don't see that need to incent or do things differently. There's open the doors, let it come. As far as the junkets remains a question mark. What does happen there, there's been all kinds of things, there's been issues that you read about in the press and you've covered in your discussion, Steve. And I think it remains to be seen what the trends that junkets to what the demand is. I know this is not the common thinking, but I'd want to believe the average customer, the mass business and pre-mass will come back strong and heavy from day one. And as the junkets will -- just let the market show us what it has and what the customer demand is and how much the junkets want to participate. I think that remains a question mark in my mind. But we are really confident that this is a market that doesn't need airlift, just needs to open the doors and watch people come back in and we can't wait for that day. Stephen Grambling : That's great. And as you learn from ramping down, I guess for the change in demand, are there things that you maybe will keep holding back as it relates to costs that could influence margins versus where they used to be on the recovery? Rob Goldstein : I think the door is open. I think once you see a demand, you can make this -- in the blind that taking visibility as to how strong it comes back. I wouldn't do anything to execute demand and what it looks like in Macao because again, we have one advantage as no one talks about, but the Chinese customers not -- doesn't have optionality in terms of coming to the U.S. or going to Europe. So even leaving -- Singapore, so I think Macao, it becomes even more desirable in terms of the Chinese visitation. I wouldn't try to figure out the market until I see the demand side and the customers. Once that happens, they will make decisions. Patrick Dumont : So just one comment on the margin structure, if you think about the run rate business prior to COVID, more than 60% in Macao of our expenses were really variable, gaming taxes and sort of things related to the activity of the business. And so when you think about our controllable operating expenses, we have taken cost out of the business, but the margin structure you should expect is going to be related to the mix of business more than it is on the incremental costs we've taken out. So if we can start achieving the premium mass business that we think we can achieve with the opening of the Londoner and the Four Seasons and grow that business with this new product that is incredibly compelling, the margin structure will improve just because it's -- it will overweight towards this high-value customer. So I think I'd like to believe in the long run that the base mass business comes back and the premium mass business comes back, and we get this volume that takes advantage of some of the benefits that we've had in the margin structure. But the long run rate margins should look similar to what we've done in the past, assuming the business returns as normal. Stephen Grambling : Super helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Thank you. So you obviously have one of the leading mall portfolios in the world. Can you just update us on your conversations with the tenants, both in terms of rent payments and renewals? And just help us think about that for the future. Rob Goldstein : Patrick, you're right -- what do you want to? Patrick Dumont : Why don't you start, and I'm happy to add if there's anything that's helpful. Rob Goldstein : I think, we've worked very well with our -- Thomas, to your point, our retail portfolio is a very important part of the mix of our business. We remain believers and that will come back in a big way in Asia. But MBS has started to ramp already. Obviously, Macao is not. We've been very -- we've worked very hard to foster strong relationships with the tenants in both jurisdictions, and we did rent reduction, et cetera. We'll take a wait and see attitude once again. The tenants have worked hard to be - to work with us and not -- we all try to work in the same manner, a fair, open dialogue about how we see the future. I assume that this will mimic the casino hotel demand. As Singapore gets stronger day by day, the tenants are coming back. We've had a lot less business than we wanted to have, as compared to Orchard Road. That's sort of change. Now, the mix is coming back to us now the hotel is open. So I think it's very simple. We have 200-plus tenancies in Singapore. I think 800 tenancies in Macao. We take them one by one based on how we see the market treating them. There'll be some casualties. There's been some casualties already in some of these places, because of, obviously, the shutdown. But just like we will at the gaming side and the hotel side, I'd like to wait and see what demand looks like and until we renew those relationships, sort of, base rents, percentage rents. But something tells me that in both markets, we're going to see return to normalcy rather quickly. I think it mimics again what we're going to see in the gaming side. And as long as that hotel is still up, it will take time, especially, I think, in Singapore, because without the airlift, it's a local retail market. I think Macao will come back much quicker, because the airlift issue, once the borders open up, I think Macao should return to normalcy rather quickly. Patrick Dumont : And just one other thought. We've spent a lot of time with our tenants in order to help -- get them through this time, which is unprecedented, with the goal of having them be able to trade again when the recovery that Rob was just discussing comes to fruition. So from our standpoint, we view the mall as a very important asset, very important for our customers' experience. We have relationships with some of the leading brands in the world and in Asia. And we want to ensure the continuity of those relationships, and we've been working with them to ensure that they continue to trade in the recovery. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. And then, respecting that your Asian properties aren't as MICE intensive as your Vegas properties, it does seem like there is some signs of recovery in group business in Asia. Are you seeing that in the bookings heading into 2021 through Singapore, Macao properties at all? Rob Goldstein : We're seeing -- there's still things on books -- we see Singapore as a starting point. We are seeing demand in Singapore, but I think people are very tend about committing. People are call -- there is inquiries, there's definitely bookings. But the caveat being that they can -- they can bow out within 90 days, there's plenty of room to quit, if they don't see demand. So I think the group is different. Corporate stuff is different than obviously the large-scale groups that require attendees. And I think what we're seeing is people are tend to be putting a foot in the order. But even Singapore, since you can't get there, how do you really make real commitments? I mean, if you want to come to Singapore with a large group, you can't fly into Singapore. So it's a Singapore-driven market only at this point. I think it's too murky, too unclear to talk about 2021 in Singapore. And same applies to Macao. Macao has a short booking window. And as you know, the challenge in Macao is that the gaming piece goes back strong, and I anticipate it will. It negates the need for much MICE business. If anything, it's an impediment to MICE because gaming demand is so strong. It takes the majority of the rooms. You can't put large-scale groups in Macao, because of rooming capacity. Our competitors won't participate anyway. So I think it's unfair to -- this far out to say what happens in Singapore without airlift being determined, I still think it's too early to call that situation. Yes there's inquiries. There's people talking to us, but everyone's scratched their heads saying what does happen, how do we get there, when do we get there? So I think it's too early to take the call. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Sheldon Adelson : Thanks, Thomas. Operator : Your next question is from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about what's changed over the last few months in terms of your thinking on Japan? And then I guess going back to the M&A topic. I mean, have you had any inbound calls, any substantive discussions with anyone? And in your slide deck, you list Macao, Singapore and South Korea as areas of potential development interest. Are you kind of agnostic to location? Are you more focused on the return? I mean, how are you sort of thinking about that? Rob Goldstein : I think Japan, no one wanted to be in Japan more than Sheldon and the team here. We were very bullish in Japan. We spent a lot of time and money, and we're very hopeful. But the environment there just wasn't suitable to make kind of investment that this company demands in terms of returns. It didn't make -- we couldn't make it work. We sure tried. We spent endless time and endless dollars pursuing Japan. We wish we could have stayed. We wish the construct was more welcoming to the investor, but it wasn't. And I feel comfortable that we made the right choice. I think Shel was extremely -- the business there for decades was the biggest proponent. We're all disappointed, what's happened in Japan. But it didn't make economic sense. So, we're keen to invest. Obviously, when this all works out and things get better, especially in Asia, we're keen to be back looking for opportunities to be in Korea or other countries. We'd like to be investing. But it has the right environment. It has to be a country wants us to invest and wants to do the model that Sheldon has -- well, he's authored is a unique model. It's a unique -- it's a huge capital-intense model. It calls for a cooperative government understands all these investments and the needs for return. So, we continue to look at everything in Asia, and we're keen to do it. Sheldon, do you want to comment? Sheldon Adelson : The regulations that were promulgated by the Japanese government that went through the dialog were not conducive to attracting the kind of investment that it requires. The cost of construction and the cost of land in Japan is very high. And it didn't justify if it was down, like another jurisdiction. If it were down to $3 billion, $4 billion, it's -- well, I'm not sure that it would have -- that would have made much of a difference because some of the rules, they're talking about withholding income tax from foreign winners. So, player comes in from another country, he wins. They want us -- the government wants the operator to withhold the taxes to pay the Japanese government. That will never attract one foreigner. So, the taxes were 30% gaming taxes, 30% income taxes, and there was no assurance that they won't raise the taxes from there. So, there were just too many negative regulations that we couldn't live with. Listen, if they change it, our mind is open to go back. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you. It's very helpful. And then just going back to Las Vegas, realizing it's obviously, much smaller piece of your business, but can you talk about what type of customer you're seeing initially, would say it's primarily a lower-yielding drive to customers? Anything you can share there? And is there a revenue percentage you need in order to get to breakeven? Rob Goldstein : We need more, more customers -- we need lots more. The truth is the hotels are running in this down mid-week, 20%, 25%, 30%; weekends, 50%, 60%. That doesn't work. They are only coming unless you can drive in market, so along the markets, such as international, but throughout the U.S. -- actually, we've had a very high-yielding, very strong customers because our marketing team has incented. We bought some great business in using our airplanes and our marketing, our lists. We see actually a very strong high end play in both slots and tables. Extraordinary amounts of players gone through here. The problem is, as you know, it takes a lot of different segments to make this company make a $0.5 billion in Las Vegas we did last year. We don't have any convention business, there's no yield on the week -- mid-week on the rumor side. You're seeing strong FIT demand weakened, but there's nothing else in there but FIT. Strong high-end casino demand. Our numbers might surprise you because you know how good they are in terms of the slot machines and the table yields. We're not -- yes, there's things in driving business, which is not very high demand gaming side. But again, Vegas has morphed into a hospitality-driven market. And I think a lot of people is confusing. Even people operate here surprised me sometimes that they're surprised how soft it is. Without the hotel being full, without the convention driving the rates midweek, without the bankrupt piece, we did here almost $200 million in banquet sales and massive margins. It's just very hard for our model to work, and I assume that's true in the entire marketplace. If you're running a large-scale building, like most of these buildings are, you're not getting by on gaming win, no matter how good it is. You're not getting by with 30%, 40% occupancy. If you're making money on a weekend, which we can, you're losing it back midweek, which we all do. And I don't think that picture is different from most. Just this company has been such an incredible success story in the convention banquet segments. We've driven so much business here. I mean, last year, again, I think we broke a 0.5 billion of EBITDA. But to do that, you can't run a hotel with these kind of occupancies. You can't run a no banquet facility. You can't rely on high rollers. It just doesn't work. Those days, in 1967 left. And so this is a new business in Las Vegas. And what allows you to build these multibillion-dollar buildings is the true IR nature of what Sheldon authored 20 years ago. I mean this town has moved away from the gaming dependent to a very diversified plan. And I don't know how you fix it until you get airlift that enables you and groups that feel comfortable coming back here and banquets coming back here, and that's just a fact of life, and I don't think we're alone in this thinking. So we remain hopeful that things will turn. But the Las Vegas year in July of 2020 is a very difficult place. And I hope it gets better, but that's the truth of the market today. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We're now down to our last question of the day from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi, good morning -- good afternoon, I should say. Look, we all may have our own set of beliefs as to why the demand will be there once the access is available. Can you just talk about what discussions, or any data you've collected? What -- why you're convinced that the demand will be there as many of us are? Rob Goldstein : Are you talking about, David, Macao? David Katz : Yes, in Macao. Rob Goldstein : Look, you're talking to -- has been going to Macao for almost 40 years. And I don't think anybody is going there and see what I've seen could have any other rational belief. There's a number of factors. One is the propensity of gamble remains among the highest in the world. Two, Macao is a very seductive place. It has all the things you want. It's got high quality retail, high quality restaurants, high quality lodging. It's got enormous casino. They're plentiful and diverse. It's very accessible. And they can't go anywhere else. I mean, frankly, they're locked down, just like we are. No one's going to Europe. No one is going to the U.S. So if you're an affluent Chinese person, and Macao is such a -- it's become such a compelling place to visit. I mean, when I went there in the 1980s, it was all different world. In 2019, it's a stunning world of opulence, food, entertainment, retail. It has all the things that are seductive to tourists. So I have no doubt in my mind, not a -- I always doubt that Macao, when those doors open up, we'll see a lot of crane towards come back. The only good point to is do you believe the economy has weakened the consumer's ability to gamble, that's the call all you can make individually. I believe that will come back strong, again convinced Macao reservoir\u2019s quickly. Also, you should be advised, and I think you know this, that this virus for the U.S. is very difficult, I hear all the time, Americans wearing a mask, having your temperature, it's all so foreign to people in the U.S. It's so confusing. I was -- the story of there was that we got mask, they may put a mask, particular Walgreens was wearing mask and she was screaming about her first member right. It was a bizarre situation. It's not the case in Asia. People are very comfortable in mask, it's normal part of life there. So you have that factor, which is they're more comfortable with this virus environment. They've lived through it. They understand it. They wear a mask to comply and walk around Hong Kong today. So I think that bodes well as well. But again, I would land on Macao itself. It's such a wonderful place for the Chinese tours. They offer so many wonderful amenities. I have no concern at all, saying that wall comes down, that border wall comes down in terms of IVS, and they allow provinces open back up, I remain completely convinced that, that business will come back very quickly, and it'll come back in multiple segments. The two caveats, I think, would be, one, higher view of the junket business is a bit confusing right now. And two, do you believe the consumer has adequate spending money in their pocket to partake. I think they do. So I feel very -- as good as I feel about Macao, I just wait for that day to happen to be validated. But that's one person's opinion, but I believe it's a shared sentiment among those who have been to Macao many, many times and watch that place in action. David Katz : And, as I have and I would agree that Macao is far more exciting than Walgreens. If I can just follow that up and -- if there are ways in which you're discussing what the new normal will look like or any aspects of the business that may change, that may have an impact or benefit on your ability to operate once it does open, that may incur some costs or maybe not, I'd love your updated perspective on that. Rob Goldstein : I think it will look like a lot of things here in the U.S. Won\u2019t look that different, will it. You'll see we're wearing masks. You're going to see temperature checks. You'll see extreme cleaning. But by the way, it happened pretty much -- it's been happening for years in Asia with the -- since the SARS times. It's a much different -- one of the most fascinating things I ever saw in Macao was, the smoking rooms. When I first went there, everyone was worried smoking would decimate the market and you can't smoke. They're not going to come, and everyone's was convinced. Well, what's hilarious to me was, they all stood in the smoking room smoking, making best of smoking room, dictating to a guy, that, this, that, that. It didn't deter Macau people from gambling. It didn't deter the Chinese consumer. The COVID virus, they'll accept the fact there's risk, they\u2019ll wear the mask, they're very compliant and they'll do right thing as far as being respectful of social distancing. It may be impactful in terms of the table counts, table occupancies, and that will be an issue. We're fortunate we have 1,500, 1,600 table games there and thousands and thousands slot machines. So, do I think it's going to be hurtful? Maybe in weekends when we're full capacity, and the place is jammed, yes, possibly. But I look forward to addressing those problems when they happen. David Katz : All right. Thank you for taking my questions. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

I hope that all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. While the business volumes continue to be impacted by the pandemic, we are pleased to see improving operating results, especially in Asia. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands had a profitable quarter as operations progressively resumed across the resort during the summer. In Macao, operating losses reduced sequentially over the second quarter. The third quarter results, however, are not representative of our current business trajectory. As the resumption of visa issuance across all provinces in China only commenced toward the end of September, the initial stages of recovery since then have been very encouraging. During the October Golden Week, we saw meaningful recovery across the different segments of our Macao operations. Importantly, business volumes in the Premium Mass segment enjoyed the most significant resurges. This vital segment is central to our ongoing investment program in Macao and has been leading our revenue generation at this stage of the recovery. We expect the base mass market to recover as visitation to the market increases. Consistent with the recovery in premium mass and overall domestic China consumption trends, we also experienced strong recovery in our retail malls with the Luxury Retail segment enjoying the strongest performance. We continue to make excellent progress in our US$2.2 billion capital investment for the Londoner Macao and Four Seasons budgets. The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, the largest all-suite Four Seasons hotel in the world, is now complete, licensed and hosting customers in the Premium Mass segment. These gorgeous full-suites have been receiving great customer feedback since the Golden Week. We will be introducing a variety of additional world-class integrated resort products and amenities as we complete the Londoner in Macao and other capital projects. The Londoner will include two new all-suite hotels, more than a dozen new restaurants, additional retail and new MICE and entertainment facilities. Our unwavering commitment to significant ongoing investments in Macao enables us to play our part in supporting local employment and the local economy. It also ensures Macao will be even better positioned to recapture and, over time, increase its share of leisure and business tourism from China and the rest of Asia. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the potential to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world and the MICE capital of Asia. As I've said on many occasions, we would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional investment dollars and extend our contributions to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Now turning to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We encouraged that MBS was profitable in the third quarter despite the absence of overseas tourists. We hope to see the initiation of reciprocal travel arrangements in the coming months as health concerns permit. We remain committed to pursuing long-term investment in Singapore and our expansion of Marina Bay Sands, although there would be likely delays in the timing of the expansion given the challenges created by the pandemic. In addition to the expansion, we will continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience and the tourism appeal of the resort. In Las Vegas, we are pleased to report that the recovery is well under way. Weekend occupancies have been as high as 70%. Together with our state and local government leadership and the entire Las Vegas community, our team members are working diligently to prepare to safely host convention and group meeting customers from throughout the world, throughout the country and around the world. We look forward to once again welcoming these customers back to Las Vegas, which will always be the most important convention and group meeting market in the United States. As we have said in the past, increased airlift and the resumption of the convention and group meeting business are both critical components to achieving a full recovery in Las Vegas. Now moving to our balance sheet. Maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great business sense while we weather the storm caused by this pandemic. Our balance sheet strength enables us to continue to execute our capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore, which we believe will position the company to deliver industry-leading growth and profitability in the years ahead. We're as confident as ever in the strength of our business model and the eventual recovery in travel and tourism spending in our markets. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. Now we'll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joseph Greff : Good morning, everybody. Sheldon, your comments about recent trends in Macao on the premium mass and the luxury retail side are certainly encouraging. I was hoping maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on what you've seen since Golden Week. And would you say at this point you're \u2013 if you're run rating at these levels and these levels continue that you would be at EBITDA breakeven levels in Macao? Sheldon Adelson : That's what we're shooting for. Joseph Greff : But not currently there as of yet. Sheldon Adelson : The trajectory is heading in the right direction. Robert Goldstein : Sheldon, I'd like to make some comments. Joe, it's Rob. How are you doing? Joseph Greff : Hey Rob. Robert Goldstein : Let's begin with that. To answer your question, let's just begin with the obvious. Our confidence in Macao being the world's greatest gaming market and its principal source of customers coming from China, we know, adapting in China from a growing economy perspective, a favorable position vis-\u00e0-vis the COVID. The renminbi is as strong as it's been in many years. And of course, the Chinese consumer is not traveling to foreign countries. We think this fact pattern from a macro perspective is very favorable for Macao. And as you know, Macao has been a $40 billion to $50 billion revenue market for the past number of years and year in, year out performs. The COVID IVS obstacles are real. And we believe as they start to lessen, we'll go back to marching toward our goal of $4 billion annually. Our new Four Seasons is now open. It's quite a product. The Londoner will complete from the interior perspective by December. So we've never been stronger from an asset perspective. But there's no question, while demand from Macao is there, and it's there, we have big confidence. The visa and the testing issues have proven to be challenging and does limit the access. Now we are hoping the government will loosen restrictions and access to Macao will continue to improve. The truth is, the way Macao and China has handled the virus is very \u2013 is in a very capable manner. And Macao will be the beneficiary of reduced travel to other markets with Chinese consumers not traveling outside of China. So it's a domestic travel bubble we hope to be included in, surely. I'd like Grant to opine and talk about. I asked Grant to join the call and Wilfred Wong to give you color from the ground since we haven't been there in many, many months. I think they can give you \u2013 Grant maybe could begin by talking about your questions about October about profitability trends, et cetera. So Grant, are you awake there, Grant, in Macao? Grant Chum : We're well awake, yes. Thank you, Rob. Yes. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Yes. I mean, October was the first time since January that we've seen significant real business volumes in patronage. And as Mr. A mentioned in his opening remarks, premium mass has been the strongest segment by far, and that is really across all of the different tiers of premium mass. The patrons returning first to Macao are the high-quality, high-frequency customers. I think that reflects the pent-up demand that these guests have, and these are the ones who are used to staying overnight in Macao. They are used to having multiple-night stays in Macao, enjoying the destination, and these are the first customers to come back, and that's natural. In terms of the question about where we are on the volumes and profitability, I mean, principally based on the premium mass recovery, October month to date, our Non-Rolling drop per day is just over $20 million. That's about 30% of last year's level. And at this level of Non-Rolling drop, we are able to achieve and we are achieving a slight positive EBITDA month to date based on current cost structure and the business mix. I think what's particularly encouraging, to Joe's question about what's happening, after Golden Week, we had the expected lull in the second week of October, but then we saw a very notable rebound in the third week. In fact, in the third week, we are actually still averaging around or just under $20 million drop per day as well. So as Mr. A said, we are well onto that trajectory, and we hope we can maintain that. I think in tandem with the premium mass recovery, we've seen a resurgence in the retail mall sales, and that's especially true in the Four Seasons, in the Luxury Retail segment. The retail recovery actually began in September and has continued into October. In fact, some of our \u2013 a number of our top first-line brands within the Four Seasons mall is actually up year-on-year in terms of the retail tenant sales in the first two weeks of October. And obviously, in conjunction with that, at the Four Seasons, we've just opened the Grand Suites for Four Seasons. And these suites have received exceptional [indiscernible]. I think this is exactly the right product for this Premium Mass segment structurally. But also at this point in time, I think these Chinese consumers are looking for higher quality, looking for the premium experiences and also, obviously, in this time, an increased amount of personal space. So we're very happy of how that product has come through and, in fact, is really one of our best-performing hotels, if not the best-performing hotels, in October. The question on the other segments, I think base mass certainly is relatively low in terms of traffic right now. As you know, the overall visitation in Macao remains relatively low. And as Rob referenced, there are, obviously, impediments. Some are real, some are perceived, some more to do with awareness in terms of the policies. But obviously, there are some real logistical challenges relating to the COVID testing, as well as the visa application. But as the awareness builds, as the word of mouth spreads, as some of these visa application processes are shortened and become more abbreviated, some of these logistical challenges will be overcome or mitigated and we're confident that the base mass will follow as visitation recovers. As for the VIP segment, obviously, that's been slower in terms of the recovery. That's expected. A lot of those issues are well documented. But we are also seeing a reasonable amount of play coming through in that segment in October as well. So I hope that gives you some color on the October month. Joseph Greff : That's great, Grant. I hope you're on the next bunch of earnings conference calls. Just a quick follow-up. How much of your volume do you think are coming from outside of Guangdong since Golden Week? Or is it primarily this month all Guangdong? Grant Chum : Actually, the vast majority of the volumes and the room bookings are from non-Guangdong, but that ratio is actually consistent with what we saw in the past. So this is not out of the ordinary. Majority of the volume comes from outside of Guangdong, and that was the case in October already. But your question is still well made in the sense that, in the first week of October, I mean, a lot of these customers from outside of Guangdong either didn't have time to get the visa or they didn't want to leave their planning to such a last-minute time frame. So they already made alternative plans. So the nationwide visa resumption only occurred or started in September 23. So that really was not sufficient time or window for a lot of the customers to feel that they could confidently get the visa before Golden Week before the office is shutdown again for the holidays. So in that sense, we should hopefully be seeing the non-Guangdong visitation improve as the awareness and the logistics challenges are met and some of these people have time to get the visa to come to Macao. Joseph Greff : Great. Thank you very much everybody. Sheldon Adelson : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Thank you so much. And Grant, if we could keep you on the hot seat here, I think we are all excited to hear from you. So just getting back to some of the items that you just mentioned. On the visitation side, are you seeing any changes per se in the rate of visa application approvals or even the methodology? I mean, have the kiosks been coming back? Or is it still an in-person kind of more manual process? And on the testing, is there any sense that this will be extended to 14 days? I know that there has been some talk about that. Grant Chum : Sure. I think when the Guangdong visas resumed, I think most of the offices were operating on the physical application process and not using the kiosks. As the rest of the country has reopened for these applications, we see a variety \u2013 it's not uniform because different provinces have different procedures, and they always have had. So there are some significant provinces and cities where you can get a same-day application. But most of the others, I would say, range from \u2013 the manual process takes anywhere between three working days to seven working days, but there are a number of them that have a shorter application period. And then, I think going forward, hopefully, obviously, this gets smoothed out. And I think this is just part of the initial \u2013 I think quite rightly the authorities are cautious, and I think that's the right thing to do in the face of the pandemic, that we don't necessarily want a huge surge of people into Macao in a short space of time at the beginning. Felicia Hendrix : And then, just on the testing, do you think they'll extend that to 14 days versus seven? I know that's been a bit of a gating factor? Grant Chum : That has been discussed in Macao, and we are waiting for further development on that front. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. And then, just as my follow-up, and this could be for anybody, but on the VIP side, I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing in terms of junket liquidity. I know it's not a big part of your business, but junket liquidity is important for the market as a whole. So I just wanted to know what your thoughts were there? Sheldon Adelson : Grant, do you want to take that or? Grant Chum : Sure. I think some of the challenges in that segment are well documented. The segment has been slower to recover in this initial stage of the recovery. But at the same time, as you quite rightly referenced, it's not a significant part of our business, only 4% of our contribution in 2019. And in the meantime, we have, obviously, very strong performance in the premium end of premium mass both across gaming and retail. Felicia Hendrix : I was just wondering if you thought that maybe some of your premium mass might be benefiting from folks moving segments as it was before COVID, but maybe seeing that more accelerated now. Grant Chum : I think it's too short a time period to ascertain that. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Sorry Rob. Robert Goldstein : I think one is \u2013 maybe to point out to what Grant was saying, was I think the nice thing \u2013 it may not be important to our overall business but in terms of the synergies. But clearly, it is important to liquidity to marketplace. And I think what's nice to see is that the first segment out-of-box to recover has been premium mass. So there's speculation that it may be band-aided by liquidity issues. And what we're seeing in retail, I think Grant mentioned the strength of the retail premium; I was talking to our retail team this morning. It's hard to imagine that in this environment, our top six net new retailers \u2013 I won't name any names \u2013 and you imagine the French and Italian luxury brands are up year-on-year in total sales, which is kind of astounding. It shows the strength and liquidity of that premium mass segment, and it reflects both the gaming and the retail appetite. I think it's very exciting to realize that that segment is back, and that speaks to our Four Seasons and our Londoner. But also, when the day comes when they do lessen the restrictions and make it more accessible to base mass, you've got the two most important segments delivering. I think it's nice to see the current situation, premium mass, and perhaps the base mass is not too far down the road. Felicia Hendrix : Great. Thank you so much. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. It seems like there's been just more news and perhaps noise around overseas gambling legislation in China and some of the restrictions potentially there? What is your interpretation of some of these laws or legislation and the implications for both Macao and Marina Bay Sands and how that might change how you position or market LVS properties? Robert Goldstein : I'll just take the first point as it relates to Marina Bay Sands and ask Dr. Wong to speak to Macao. But the concerns there don't concern us at least in Singapore. We do our job as best we can, and we carefully monitor as best we can all the restrictions and all the issues, money movement, etcetera to our best of our ability. We take that responsibly very seriously and applicable rules. Singapore continues to, obviously, be upside, like all of Asia, were negatively impacted by the inability of the Chinese customers to get to Singapore. However, we do see the opening \u2013 the initiatives taken by the Singapore government to open to Hong Kong. And hopefully, that will be a catalyst for other jurisdictions, other countries, other airlines to open the doors to more travel into Singapore. Dr. Wong, would you speak to the issue of cross-border casino from your perspective as it relates to Macao? Wilfred Wong : Sure. We understand the National People's Congress is still debating the final form of that legislation. But we must remember that the main target is really gambling in foreign countries, including, particularly Internet and telephone betting. However, Macao has never been considered foreign in China. And all of concessionaires in Macao respect the law in China, and we never promote gaming in China, only our hospitality and MICE facilities and services. So we believe that Macao is \u2013 has a unique place under the one country, two systems in China and that we will continue to operate under the confine of the legislation. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. I'll jump back into the queue. Thanks so much. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Thank you. I just want to follow-up on I believe it was Felicia's question and talk a little bit about the VIP segment. And maybe, Grant, you're probably best positioned to answer this. But when you think about kind of the issues on the VIP side and, as you mentioned, kind of they've been well advertised, how much of it do you think it is a supply issue in terms of liquidity and supply of capital versus a demand issue? And I guess, part of that gets to some of the demand actually just showing up in your premium mass, which you kind of already addressed. So anything just on the supply and demand dynamics within the VIP segment? Grant Chum : Rob, do you want me to take that? Robert Goldstein : Grant, I want to finish a comment after you. If you're going to initiate, Grant, please. Grant Chum : Sure. Yes. I don't particularly see it as a demand issue. I think there are some issues specifically relating to that segment. But I think one contextual point is you have to remember that the system is \u2013 consists of the working capital cycle in that segment. And what we've had in 2020 is a seven-month, eight-month complete disruption of that business and that ecosystem with all the working capital issues associated with that. So we've never had that level of \u2013 essentially, the business stopped everywhere. But obviously, for that segment, given the particular dynamics, it's particularly damaging. So I think you're seeing some of the aftereffect of that disruption. But obviously, as gaming activity resumes and demand resumes, you hope that some of these issues will evolve in a positive way. Robert Goldstein : Yes, I've got to say this, and I'm saying the obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway. The aging customers, at least, our industry has the highest offense in the world. It's been that way for decades, and it will be that way for decades to come. I don't think the demand \u2013 the appetite of the consumer has diminished whatsoever. Obviously, the capital cycle's in jeopardy right now and will take time to adapt. But we've had this issue in the past years and back in 2014, and we know two things are intact. Demand remains intact, and that's a fact. And at some point, capital will become available again. I wouldn't count that segment out. It may be in a very, very tough spot right now. But again, demand will be there, and eventually, we'll figure out the supply on the capital side. We feel highly confident that's a fact. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, guys. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up as it pertains to what you're kind of seeing, obviously, in a reduced demand environment across the board to an extent but, obviously, healthier in the premium mass segment. Are you guys seeing anything unique from competitors in the market just in terms of the way they're going about their business and trying to drive demand at their assets? Or is it pretty much business as usual across the board? Robert Goldstein : Carlo, you're talking about Macao, right? Carlo Santarelli : Yes. I'm sorry at Macao. Grant Chum : Yes. Actually, it's business as usual. We don't see anything out of the ordinary. Yes, this is not really a business where people are going to go out and do silly things. I think it's pretty rational right now. Robert Goldstein : I would add one thing, though, that I think we all agree on, and that is that this market has not been irrational in the past, but it has proven to be very, very susceptible to great products. And I do think our new Four Seasons product; our Londoner product will prove to be very, very advantageous in the years ahead. As we move back toward our quest for $4 billion annual EBITDA, those products are going to take front and center. And that's what drives this premium mass customer, not silly incentives and poor marketing. Great product wins the day over there, and we feel highly confident we have built an aesthetic product that will be very appealing to this customer. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you both very much. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Your line is open. Steven Wieczynski : Yes, good afternoon, guys. So Rob, can I ask you a Vegas question? And can you maybe help us think about forward bookings for group and convention traffic in Vegas next year and maybe how those bookings at this point are shaking out by quarter? Robert Goldstein : Sure. We still see some bright spots in the Vegas market vis-\u00e0-vis convention and group business. There's demand, and there's some recent \u2013 it's there in the market because some of these large shows still want to come in Q1. We have a couple of major impediments that I don't know how we're going to correct them. One is, as you know, the governor has imposed group restrictions and size restrictions. So it's very difficult to overcome that. We're hoping to he'll revisit those restrictions and enable the market to talk to some of these large shows. The second issue, of course, is airlift. Airlift is still not near pre-COVID levels. So that's a challenge. But I think to the positive side, we're getting calls from the group market. We're getting inquiries from people from all different parts of group market saying we want to come back and we're looking at this month, that month, throughout \u2013 scattered throughout the year, I guess, there's three things. The governor will revisit his restrictions, and that's pivotal. The airlift \u2013 most of these people require airlift. It's not drive-in business. I think that will come back when the market demand is there. And the third thing, I think, to really fully populate the market with group demand again is a change in \u2013 a catalyst to change how the consumer views being in a place with 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people. It's obvious in Vegas that the weekend leisure market is surging, and we could probably get to 95% right now if we let it happen. We cap ours in the 65%, 70% range to keep Las Vegas safe, etcetera. But the leisure demand for Las Vegas weekend is very strong, not as much midweek, which has always been reliant upon more group. Also gaming, as you know, has come back to probably, I don't know, 75%, 80% of pre-COVID. So there's some bright spots. But to your point, that's what's really pivotal \u2013 the delta agreed in Las Vegas. We've got to see group come back. And there's just some impediments despite the demand, which seems to be growing. We get more calls every day for the group market, and people are itching to come back and be here. So I think both very large conventions, as well as small tech groups. That appears to be across-the-board demand is reoccurring for next year for 2021. And it's probably soft in April, May, June, and then, goes up the balance of the year. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Rob. And the second question, I'm not really sure how to ask this question. It's going to be a political question, so excuse me. But yes, I know. If you take your personal views out of the equation for a second, how should we think about the election coming up and maybe how each scenario might play out in terms of your China relationships moving forward? And I hope that makes sense. Robert Goldstein : I'm really not going to answer that question, with all due respect. I think it's \u2013 first of all, I don't know if there's a good answer anyone can give you since we don't have insight to the Chinese perspective. But I'm going to pass on that, respectfully. I don't know if Sheldon wants to weigh in, but I think that's the question I'll pass on. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Thanks guys. Sheldon Adelson : We don\u2019t answer political questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I have a question for Grant Chum kind of circling back to some of the discussion earlier, and Grant, it's so nice to hear your voice. Just your take on whether junket's ability to operate in Mainland China, their interactions with customers, would that be impacted potentially by the blacklist regulation in your view, not that players won't come to Macao but the ability for junkets to maybe be providing capital for players from the Mainland? And kind of looking at your economic crystal ball, how long do you think capital control in Mainland China may be kind of front and center? Thanks. Grant Chum : Rob, shall I take that? Robert Goldstein : Yes, please. Grant Chum : Yes. Hi, Robin, yes, I think we should clarify that there's always been a prohibition on gambling on Mainland China and solicitation of gambling in Mainland China. And I think those rules and regulations are well understood by market participants. And I think that's the way it should remain. I think the currency issue, I mean, these are big, big issues. We're not in a position to opine on that. But obviously, the market has been operating without any issues for so many years, and we don't see any particular issues in that regard as the market starts to come back. But obviously, like everyone else, we'll watch with great interest the evolution of the system. Robin Farley : Thank you. Maybe just as a follow-up and I don't know, Rob, if this would be for you because it's sort of broader. I think in prior calls this year, you talked about potential M&A activity or that that would be a little bit of a departure for LVS, having expressed interest in that? Can you sort of update us on your thoughts on that at this point? Robert Goldstein : Patrick, are you in the call? Patrick Dumont : Yes. Do you want me to take that one? Is that okay? Robert Goldstein : Sure. Patrick Dumont : Hey, it's Patrick. I think what we said before in prior calls is consistent, that we view capital deployment pretty consistently and so that we have a very high return threshold. When that original commentary was made by the Chairman, it was really regarding certain conditions that existed really before all the stimulus went into the market. And I think where we are today is we are very focused on maintaining our investments in our existing markets. We've deployed a lot of capital in the last 12 months into these markets. As Grant and Rob mentioned, you're starting to see the benefits in the return of premium mass in Macao today and these very high-value investments. And we're also looking to maintain liquidity to ensure that we have the ability to take advantage of opportunities in the future. So I think we're looking around. I think we're optimistic about the future of our key markets. If an M&A opportunity comes up, we'll look at it. But again, our return thresholds are very high. And as of right now, there's nothing that's really compelling. So we'll continue to deploy capital in our markets and hopefully get the continued high returns that we've been seeing previously in these markets, but no M&A as of right now. Robin Farley : Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thanks Robin. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Just following up on that last question. We've been getting a lot of questions about when you may resume your dividend. And would you go back to the kind of $0.79 you were paying at the beginning of the year? Can you just update us on your thinking there? Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Hey, it's Patrick. I think return of capital has been a cornerstone for our shareholder value creation program. And I think we're very focused on getting back to being a dividend payer. You've heard our Chairman say \"yay dividends\" many times. I think he feels \u2013 still feels that way. I think the company is very motivated to grow its cash flow beyond where it was in 2019 and ultimately return to being a dividend payer. But I think the key thing right now is that we're in the early stages of recovery of COVID, and we are going to see how that trajectory goes before we make a determination about return of capital. We're very focused on growing the business back and exceeding the prior levels, and we'll evaluate where things are at that time as things progress and make an assessment about sort of dividend payouts at that time. Thomas Allen : Helpful color. Thanks, Patrick. And then, just as my follow-up question, appreciate all the color you gave on Macao around Golden Week and how things have been progressing there? Can you give any more color around Vegas and Singapore? Obviously, sequentially, third quarter looks better than the second quarter, but was it similar in terms of a month-by-month progression? And have things continued to improve in October? And would you expect them to continue to improve? Or are there seasonal factors we should be thinking about, too? Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Do you want Singapore and Las Vegas? So in Las Vegas, I think things have \u2013 I'm not sure it's a seasonal issue. We're in a different place right now. I think it's not about summer versus fall. I think it's pretty much staying stable. But I'm curious to see what happens in the winter if the leisure business holds up as strongly. But I think things are staying where they're at until there's some type of a catalyst. I mean, we did see leisure travel, I think, getting stronger on weekends, not as strong midweek. I still think the airlift thing is very, very difficult to overcome. We still are operating as a regional market. I don't see how \u2013 like, the group business, I think there will be increasing demand, but how it'll get here and can it get here with the governmental restrictions. So I don't see a lot of change in Las Vegas for us until there's a change structurally and the governor's position, the airline position and the willingness again of consumers. I think people coming here on weekends and sitting in a room is one thing. But when they come with a 30,000 group convention or they come and watch a 20,000-seat hockey game, I don't know how people think about those kinds of large gatherings. So I think Vegas stays where it's at. I think that there's going to be demand, but we've got to change some things structurally to get people in the buildings. So that's Vegas. We're very encouraged with what's happening in MBS. We made some money this quarter, as you see. I think that will continue to grow. The growth in MBS will be contingent upon a few variables. For example, just in our building, we'll grow from 1,500 current slot machines to 2,000 as of the first of the year. The win per unit there is extraordinary. And that's driven mostly not by \u2013 people think it's a locals market, not really. It's a locals market for residents, Singapore residents. It's a very different thing because what we do mention \u2013 say that it's foreigners who achieve status as a permanent resident. That's probably the big driver of our very strong slot ETG win, not as strong on the table side, where the market is not as favorable with local residents. We need some airlift there. The other encouraging thing happening in Singapore, as you know, is the recent development with the Hong Kong airlift situation in the governments. We're very fortunate the government in Singapore is so proactive and recognized we need to rejuvenate our industry and its economy. That deal with between Cathay and Sing Air, I think, is very favorable. It bodes well for other jurisdictions to open up. The big catalyst for Singapore growth, obviously, is foreign travel, foreign visitation. That's necessitated by airlift, and that's lacking. But again, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, etcetera, Vietnam, as those markets open up, Singapore could easily grow from, right now, $25 million, $35 million a month to maybe $50 million or $75 million a month and keep going. It really depends on getting the airlift community for foreign visitation. We are comfortable in making money in Singapore. It's growing. October, Golden Week is \u2013 the business keeps continuing to feel better. It feels stronger. But the change will only happen there in a step-change way when you have access by air travel, obviously. And we're hopeful that in this quarter, we'll see some more developments, and we'll see even further as \u2013 again, unlike the U.S., the COVID situation appears to be pretty stable in most countries in Asia. So it makes us hopeful that more people will open their borders up and allow air travel. And that will drive Singapore back to the levels we're comfortable with. Patrick Dumont : And if I could just \u2013 hey it's Patrick, if I could just add one comment. I think it's an important thing to note that in Singapore, things really were opened in a phased way after the circuit breaker. And so we really didn't have our full hotel towers until August 1. And I think the other thing that's important to note is it did ramp across the quarter. So Singapore is slowly resuming operations in a more normal way, and we are starting to see the benefits of that as we resume the profitability. And so it was a ramp across the quarter in Singapore, and the trajectory is positive. Thomas Allen : Very helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. On Marina Bay Sands, can you tell us what percentage of your business historically has come from Mainland China? And then I guess, on the cross-border issues, I mean, is it possible that, for Macao, some of the cross-border issues, just the sentiment of that, could be a headwind in the near-term but potentially positive over the longer term if more demand ends up shifting to Macao? Robert Goldstein : It's not quite sure. We're not going to break out percentages as it relates to the profitability coming out of China into Singapore. But I will say it's a very important market for us. So there's no arguing that it's fundamental to our growth and our success as is most countries in Asia depending on China visitation. So it's \u2013 but we'll keep it at a very macro level. As far as \u2013 it's a double-edged sword, as I referenced, because I think it's very, very helpful in Macao that \u2013 the Chinese consumer. One of the reasons our retail business from the high end is booming according to our people on the ground is that they can't fly to France or the U.S. or wherever they travel to and buy their luxury goods. So they're buying it at home. And then, you see the surging retail numbers and the growth in the economy coming out of China. China's back to a pretty good place. Growth, I think, is back, and the renminbi is strong. And China is doing very well compared to the rest of the world, including the COVID situation. So that bodes very, very well. Once we can get inside the bubble, of the China bubble on the containment, I think our business in Macao is going to be just fine and dandy quickly. It's not so positive for Macao \u2013 I mean, for Singapore because there may be a hesitation of the meeting country to air travel. And I'm speculating, but we don't have any incoming out of China right now as far as opening up the balance of not just Singapore but Asia, Japan, Thailand, etcetera. So it will be helpful because demand in both gaming, retail, leisure travel will probably be very strong in Macao as those IVS and COVID barriers come down. And hopefully, it will come down because the health situation in both Macao and Mainland China is very positive. So it's very helpful in Macao, no question, and probably not as helpful in Singapore. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thanks Rob. And I'm curious, Rob, just to get your perspective on this. And I think I know the answer to this but curious to hear your response. Given that Vegas is recovering, we're a little bit closer to a vaccine today, hopefully. And Macao has been, I think, a lot slower to recover than people expected. Is it still your expectation that Macao could and should get back to prior peak revenue before Vegas? Robert Goldstein : I believe so. I think Macao \u2013 the countries are very \u2013 China is the market for Macao. China is in a very favorable position. I referenced earlier in the call the renminbi, the economy, the safety of COVID. They've done a great job and a sustainable recovery over there. And it feels that it's going to be transferred to Macao in the near future. I just don't know when. But I feel very good about the prospects in Macao in the future and hopefully in the near future. But we don't know. Again, it's not within our control. But I think the government took it slowly, and we got to hand it to the governments in China and Macao. They've been very \u2013 it's been frustrating, but they're taking it slow and you see them opening gradually. We see the recovery in premium mass with base mass to follow and probably junket after that. So Macao, I think, recovers quicker. Having said that, I, for the first time, feeling, Vegas has some bright spots, and we feel some \u2013 there's definitely leisure customer weekends, and it's packed here on the weekends, much more than had been previously. It's not so favorable midweek. But again, there's always a group area of strength. And we're seeing group calls. I mean, our team is getting response. People want to come back to Las Vegas. It just I think, takes longer. And as you referenced, I pray there's a vaccine for all of us. I do think that's the tipping point. The U.S. has to get healthy. We still have, what, 70,000 people affected one day last week. It's still staggering, the level of what's happening. So until people feel safe, they're not coming to Vegas. But when they do, they're going to come back, and we're very confident. But if I'm to make a bet, I'd bet on Macao, much quicker of a recovery than Las Vegas. Vegas has some challenges, where Macao just has to have that barrier come down and let people come in. That's all there is. Jared Shojaian : All right. Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi. Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to hear all of your voices and hope you are well. I just wanted to follow-up on the IVS circumstances. What we're seeing here is a negligible number of cases both in Macao and the relevant areas of China. What light can you shed on what the Chinese government and the Macao government might be looking for, for change to occur? Or is it just a function of taking the time administratively to convert back to the kiosks that we've known about in the past? Robert Goldstein : Mr. Chum, are you still awake? Grant Chum : Yes. Well, I think the way you have to look at it, and it refers back to what Rob said, what a great job I think the governments in China and the local government in Macao have done in terms of controlling the pandemic. But one result of that is, I think, each step of relaxation is handled very cautiously. So I think it's more the case that we need the passage of time where we can see that everything is working in order and there are no issues arising from people movements of large numbers. And I think your point about do they move from manual to kiosks, I mean, we already do have feedback from customers and consumers that, in different parts of China, you do have a much more abbreviated application process. So I think this will work its way out assuming that everything remains in order as it relates to the control of the pandemic. Wilfred Wong : Rob, this is Wilfred. Can I jump in? Robert Goldstein : Please do. Wilfred Wong : Now I think the current situation is the government know what needs to be done, including persuading the Chinese government to work on the kiosks rather than manual processes, extending the 14 days of validity of the test certificate. But we must remember one thing, what you want to avoid is a shutdown again. So that's why both the central government and Macao government been working very carefully because they don't want a resurgence or an outbreak of COVID in Macao, which has held its fort for so long. And that's why they're moving slowly, but surely. But what we are seeing is both the central government and the Macao government knows exactly what needs to be done and they're moving in the right direction. David Katz : Thank you for that. It seems like a fair plan. Sorry, go ahead, please. Robert Goldstein : No, I couldn't agree more. I think we're lucky that they're thinking long-term. It's frustrating for all of us who want it to happen yesterday. We want so badly to see this market open back up. We want to get back on track. And it's frustrating. But I think the comments of guys in Macao, it's going to pay off long-term with long sustainable growth and back to a better environment. It's hard for us in here to accept it without getting antsy. But I think when those restrictions are lifted or revisited, I think it'd be great for all of us. David Katz : I appreciate that. And if I can ask one detail follow-up. Within the context of the recovery in Macao, and I appreciate the color around October starting to approach or get to breakeven, how would you have us think about the Londoner and its ramp within the context of all that? Presumably, it's on a different track and a different trajectory given the capital. Robert Goldstein : Grant, why don't you take that now and [indiscernible]. Please take it. Grant Chum : Sorry, do you want to go first or? Robert Goldstein : No, go ahead. You initiate, Grant. Grant Chum : Yes. I think the first point is what Rob said earlier, that this is a product-driven market. And I don't know, it's hard for us to convey to you over the phone just how excited we are about the products that we are about to bring on. And of course, we have brought some of that on already through the Four Seasons, the new hotel at the Four Seasons. But obviously, the bigger piece will be the comprehensive product that we're going to put out there through the Londoner Macao. And I think when you think about the construction progress we've made there, obviously, we've taken full advantage of the pandemic cessation of some of this business in the SCC side, and we've accelerated much of our programming as a result of that. And I think when we see the segments that are recovering chiefly through premium mass, we really feel very good about the natural rollout progressively of a number of these new products. And that will start potentially toward the end of this year and will move on to the rest of the resort during the course of 2021. But we're very, very excited about what we're about to bring onto the market. Robert Goldstein : I just want to add one comment. We had the SCC for years. It was not a great product. It didn't deliver. And here, we've redone this product with 6,000 rooms and suites; a casino, if you can see it, the images are spectacular, a redone retail environment with the epicenter of the Cotai Strip across from the powerhouse, which is The Venetian, twice the key count. I don't think we couldn't be more excited to see it get fully open and operational. David Beckham will cut the key, and Sheldon will be over there hopefully to do this with him, and I think it's going to be an extraordinary product. And we think of how our products perform in the Macao it won't be a very underwhelming product to the one competitive to, I think, The Venetian. And we just we just can't wait to get back in Macao and see the impact. The same with the Four Seasons, which is now open, this is quite a product. And I think our future is tied to \u2013 not to overextending giveaways and promotions, but building great product that the customers in Macao come to. So we couldn't be more \u2013 I'm just very excited about the prospects of our new developments in Macao. David Katz : Look forward to seeing it. Thank you for taking my question. Robert Goldstein : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for squeezing me in. Really just wanted to kind of do two quick follow-ups on topics of\u2026 Operator : He got disconnected. Daniel Briggs : We'll deal with Shaun. It seems he got dropped off. We'll deal with him directly. That's it. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Daniel Briggs : Thanks so much for joining us.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The last two weeks have been the most difficult in our company\u2019s history as we mourn the loss of our Founder, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon, as you know, was a visionary. He led the transformation of not one but three integrated resort markets, that being Las Vegas, Macao, and Singapore. He offered the MICE-based Integrated Resort model in Las Vegas. He pioneered the development of the Cotai Strip in Macao and reimagined the skyline of Singapore to the iconic Marina Bay Sands. His audacity to challenge the status quo transformed the entire market. In Las Vegas, Sheldon originated the convention-based Integrated Resort model when no one, and I mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. Today, Las Vegas conventions are synonymous. In Macao community, it\u2019s not easy to forget how Sheldon\u2019s vision for Cotai defied the consensus thinking at that time. Every element of Venetian Macao is questioned by the skeptics, and I mean every element. A 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn\u2019t exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. The Grand Canal Shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail, a 15,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. He dreamt big but he also delivered, who * developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed. Before others had * even dared to dream, he completed the Venetian Macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company\u2019s 20-year concession. His determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in Macao, was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. Our total investment account today exceeds US$15 billion. We know that Sheldon was a big believer of a strong, healthy, and cordial U.S.-China relationship. He believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect. The company, the Board, and the family are absolutely committed to continuing Sheldon\u2019s efforts in this regard. Sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets, and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work. The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will remain ever-present. The company with the full and wholehearted support of the Board and the family will continue to honor Sheldon\u2019s vision to protect and enhance his legacy. We look forward to the future and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. While the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive EBITDA in both Macao and Singapore in the fourth quarter, and there\u2019s no doubt, in my mind, our business was down to pre-COVID levels in the future. In Macao, the Grand Suite Four Seasons is now open, and the first phase of Londoner Macao will officially open in February. We are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the Londoner Macao throughout the course of 2021. Sands China is well-positioned to capture a rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. We\u2019ve always believed there\u2019s no better market for our company to invest in than Macao. We will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to. In Singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in Marina Bay Sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. On a principal note, I\u2019ve spent more than two decades with Sheldon. And had both fun and pleasure of working for and with Sheldon. He was a great mentor, he was a great friend. And I guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the pandemic dramatically impacted our business. He was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we\u2019re closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time. In the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers and many of you joining us on the call today. We are touched by the outpouring of support, and we really appreciate that. I am honored to have been invited by the board with Las Vegas Sands and Sands China to become the Chairman and CEO of both companies. With the full support of the board and the family, I will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill Sheldon\u2019s extraordinary vision. I am confident, as Sheldon was in 1995 this company will go from strength to strength in the future. For one final thought before we turn to questions, I look forward to the day, we can say, yield dividends. Operator, * we are ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question, sir, we have Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. Before asking questions, I just I want to offer my condolences to all of you as well as the pair, man. Rob and Patrick, you were obviously particularly close. So it\u2019s a big loss and he truly was one of a kind. So my condolences. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Joe. We appreciate that. Thank you. Joe Greff : So my question and my follow-up, focus on Macao. And yeah, when we kind of look back at what\u2019s transpired with tourist investments from Mainland China into Macao, it\u2019s obviously been more slow \u2013 the progress has been more slow than maybe what all of us anticipated, though it has shown some progress. Other than the government having this intentional gradual easing of visas to obviously dealing with this little kind of thing called the global pandemic. Are there any other policy issues or things that are maybe weighing in on visitation other than just simplistically visas are kind of being granted in conjunction with infection rates and vaccination rates and the like? And when you talk to folks in China, what specifically are folks looking at or metrics and improving metrics to sort of see a further easing of tourist visas? Rob Goldstein : We\u2019re fortunate to have both Wilfred and Grant on the call. I\u2019m going to ask them to address that question, Joe. Gentlemen? Wilfred Wong : Yes. Grant, you want to talk first? Rob Goldstein : Yes. Why don\u2019t you guys take it? Yes, Grant and Wilfred. Grant Chum : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Yes. I mean, Joe, I think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late September, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. And the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail. I think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. So in December, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. We reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. And there were \u2013 the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven\u2019t done anywhere close to that since January. And if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. And by December, Four Seasons\u2019 retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. Actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in Four Seasons mall tenant sales. So that\u2019s pre and post-pandemic, a record month. So an issue here is what you referenced. There is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. So the base mass remains very subdued. Macao only had 20% of the prior year\u2019s visitations during the fourth quarter. So really, there\u2019s not a lot you can do about that. It\u2019s not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. And obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. So what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had a number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in China. And in October, November, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of [indiscernible] so the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high risk from a COVID perspective was relatively few. But from about, let\u2019s say, third week of December, the domestic cases started to rise in Northern China. And what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to COVID becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings. So from about mid of December, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in January and obviously, into Chinese New Year. Obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. So that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we\u2019ve seen, particularly in the Northern provinces. So with that in mind, it\u2019s not easy to see a relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. Joe Greff : That\u2019s helpful. And then I have a follow-up, just, I guess, more on \u2013 so it may continue, this idea of Macao policy, and maybe this is a question for Wilfred or anybody on the call can answer. But do you think either Macao or the Central Government in Beijing want Mainland Chinese companies getting involved? With Macao casinos, either by existing states or having board representation, is this something that\u2019s a priority for the government? So important? Have there been discussions? I kind of remember hearing something along these lines maybe a couple of years ago as this potentially happening on the ground in Macao a couple of years ago, but we\u2019re getting more questions and commentary on that of late. So anything you can shed on that would be interesting. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Wilfred, Grant, or Patrick, you want to jump on that? Wilfred Wong : Yes. I think the \u2013 obviously, we have not been told of anything at this stage. Consideration is now being given to what the conditions should be for the new concession. We have not picked up any nor have we been consulted on whether there should be the participation of Chinese companies. Now, but we have to bear in mind that Chinese companies are likely \u2013 I mean, real Chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in China is considered not legal. So there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. I don\u2019t think this really in line for their policy consideration. Whether private Chinese companies would be allowed to participate in Macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all. So the only thing I can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in Macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, so we are just the same as any Hong Kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors. Rob Goldstein : Joe, can I just jump on Wilfred\u2019s very, very thoughtful comments. We\u2019ve been going to Beijing for around 20 years in Macao, and having endless meetings. I know there\u2019s an outsized belief by some people who write these things, and they constantly opine their thoughts on how equity should be sold to Chinese companies, and they\u2019re jumping up and down. I\u2019ve never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered whoever said that to me or even made that comment, in fact, if anything, they kind of chuckle because to Wilfred\u2019s comment, there\u2019s not a big appetite to invest in gambling. So I know it\u2019s very prevalent in the market. I hear quite a bit. I know that somebody wrote to me recently about how we could guarantee our licensure if we sell x percent. It all sounded very good, but one thing no one\u2019s ever said that, the government to us. Never heard that from anybody actually understands how Macao and Beijing operate. In fact, I think what we do here, it is a complete affirmation of what Sheldon has always done, which is invest heavily, invest heavily in non-gaming activities, believe in Macao, support your employees, and think they can grow. That\u2019s been the exact direction for at least the last five years. And before that, we heard more from Macao officials. We\u2019ve never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the Chinese people or we\u2019ve heard please support your employees, Sheldon do that to achieve. We paid everybody through the pandemic. It costs a lot of money. We did it. Invest in the cap. I think Sheldon, we\u2019ve covered that already, $15 billion, invest in non-gaming. That\u2019s always been a direction. But not onetime, from no one I\u2019ve ever heard, oh, you\u2019re a cyclone. I want to hear that from these people who write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. I did once knew a very, very good person, a very important guy in the Chinese world, a businessman. And I suggest, so he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a Chinese gambling company whether it\u2019s Macao or Las Vegas because that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do. We found it kind of humorous actually. So I know that\u2019s a common prevailing thought. But we don\u2019t hear it. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next question, we have Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and I echo Joe\u2019s sentiments about the recent loss. Rob Goldstein : Thank you for your kind words to us. We appreciate what you said. It was very kind and thoughtful. Really appreciate it. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you, Rob. If I could, just very simplistically. To the best of your understanding, how should we expect the concession renewal process to actually get moving? What do you guys foresee at the time line to when potentially, we could start to see some announcements as to the process and the time line for the process and et cetera? Just in its simplest form. Rob Goldstein : I\u2019m going to turn back to the fellows in Macao. I think they\u2019re best suited to answer your query. Wilfred, Grant, help us. Wilfred Wong : Yes. We are as eagerly waiting for the government\u2019s direction. Because, as you all know, we only have about 17 months left before the concession expires. And we only know that the government is adopting a process, which includes public consultation on the performance of the concession is and the targets of achieving diversification, that amendments to the legislation have to be introduced into the legislative council, and then the bidding process begins. So it\u2019s a very tight timetable that we are running against. We also know that there is a legislative council election scheduled for September this year. So all these are coming into play, and we are coming up against a very tight timetable. We don\u2019t know whether this will begin very soon because right now, the government is all involved in the fight against the pandemic. As we all know, Macao cannot afford a single case because it was a public announcement by the government that if there is even one case, Macao would be locked down again. So the government is putting all their energy into the fight against the pandemic to ensure that visitors can continue to come. So we don\u2019t know. The short answer is we don\u2019t know. And when asked about this publicly, the Chief Executive said that anything is possible. I think he was asked whether there could be an extension or how soon can this be done. And his response was, anything is possible. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Obviously, last quarter, you guys talked a little bit about the Las Vegas asset, potentially being open to entertain offers to that asset. Rob or Patrick, does that influence potentially the timing of the return of the dividend? Or do you think more about the dividend from the lens of when Macao is back and Marina Bay Sands is back, doing what they do, you\u2019ll be able to kind of reinstitute that? Patrick Dumont : Hi. It\u2019s Patrick. So a couple of things. We have a very positive view in Las Vegas. I think long term, it\u2019s irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination. A huge amount of investment going into Las Vegas. We think there\u2019s a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets when there\u2019s been a return. And really, the restriction in Las Vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. On weekends, we\u2019re actually doing quite well. There are days where we\u2019re actually almost at 2019 slot levels. It\u2019s really an interesting thing to see, and I think we\u2019re very positive on Vegas outlook just generally. That being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it\u2019s independent of the dividend. I think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations. We\u2019ve had this discussion before on prior calls. We need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. You\u2019ve heard Grant mention the completion of some of the Londoner milestones. That\u2019s a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in Macao. So the way we\u2019ll look at the dividend is to evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of the business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. But we\u2019re very focused on the return of capital. We think it\u2019s been fundamental to our shareholder return story. We think we have a growth component in our key markets. We have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. And I think as part of that, we look very heavily toward the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. So we\u2019re very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see some positive in the upcoming quarters. We have some green shoots in Macao. We have some positive results in Singapore and some positive results in Las Vegas here. And so I think over time, we\u2019ll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. And then we\u2019ll make an assessment of the timing and the size of the dividend. Rob Goldstein : Carlos, I just want to follow-up with Patrick. There\u2019s one other issue with that. And that is the return of Las Vegas. There\u2019s been recent commentary, it\u2019s been fun to read about how Las Vegas will never return to pre-pandemic levels. The best days are behind it. I\u2019ve heard all of this before over the last 20, 30 years, about this town is right now on the back foot. There\u2019s no question about it struggling. But you can\u2019t help but think, there\u2019s this thing that is the vaccine or whatever it\u2019s going to take to fix this problem someday. Again, I want to reensure that we believe Las Vegas has plenty of gas in the tank. Our demand for 2022 through 2027 convention is unbelievable. Our customers want to come, and we remain very bullish on the return of Las Vegas. It may take longer than we want it to. It may take till the end of this year, as we see a visitation spike. But please don\u2019t be among those people who have these ideas that this pandemic would put a hole in Las Vegas. And just the opposite, the demand will be there. This is a unique town. We\u2019re going to have all the digital products out there you want. People want the visitation, and this town has a lot to offer. So we remain very bullish on the return post-pandemic. Carlo Santarelli : Yeah. For sure, Rob and thank you for that. And I understand that a lot of us on the call are looking forward to making our next trip out there. I know I am. So thank you guys very much. Rob Goldstein : You\u2019re going to, I believe. Looking forward to having you. Operator : Next question, we have Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Hey, and let me also send my condolence to you and the entire LVS and Adelson family. Mr. Adelson was a true visionary and his successes will never be forgotten, so\u2026 Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Thank you for your comments. Thanks. Thomas Allen : So there have been a number of reports in the media over the past few weeks and months about you looking to support saying online gaming opportunities. Can you just discuss your strategy there in a bit more detail? Rob Goldstein : Sure. We\u2019re looking at a few opportunities, a multitude of opportunities in both regional and the U.S. And yes, we\u2019ve looked at digital. And it\u2019s interesting, you can\u2019t deny the \u2013 what\u2019s happened in digital is quite a space. And we are exploring opportunities, looking at what might be out there. But with a caveat had, there\u2019s nothing to report today. There\u2019s nothing concrete. We\u2019re simply looking, learning, observing, and just \u2013 there\u2019s been some commentary that it\u2019s my suggestion. I want to assure you that Sheldon \u2013 this is another [indiscernible] Sheldon, who he was ethically, he understood digital, maybe too well before I did. And he believed in it. He just simply had this outsized ethical concern about people who couldn\u2019t afford it or people that were too young to use it. And he wasn\u2019t a believer in the technology could stop that. He never questioned the viability of it. He questioned the ability to police it properly. And so the same way he paid people, hundreds of millions of dollars last year because he wanted to. It\u2019s an ethical consideration to Sheldon. So we\u2019ve had this discussion prior to his passing, and we are going to explore it. And again, the cab is we are in the making-money business. So there\u2019s a way to make money, it\u2019s intelligent and prudent. And again, Sheldon would be in the room saying, I\u2019m laser-focused on returns and growth. As you know, his middle name was G for growth. He would have loved the opportunity whether it be in the U.S. or abroad to build more things and that we\u2019re not leaving the U.S. We want to build it. We\u2019ve been all over the paper, looking at different markets. So yes, visuals in the multitude of considerations we are learning and observing and talking to people. We are nowhere near a decision on that, and we will keep you apprised if something changes. Thomas Allen : Thanks, Rob. And then just talking about U.S. developments on the brick-and-mortar front there\u2019s been some chat about New York and Texas. What do you think the chances are of those States? And then how would you expect \u2013 how would you like to be positioned in those markets? Rob Goldstein : Well, we\u2019ve been looking at New York for about 100 years it seems like. We\u2019re having some secret, we\u2019re big believers in New York. We think it\u2019s extraordinary, the density of population ethnicity, like, it\u2019s a very good opportunity for anybody and you can see, I think almost, it\u2019s close to $2 billion right now just in the facilities are there, without table games or decent rooms and probably product. A good product there will be extraordinary. So we\u2019re definitely in the hunt. We\u2019ve been pushing it for again for four or five years. We\u2019re excited by what came out of the New York group last week in terms of what they impart considering. There\u2019s not a fly out there. So we\u2019re keeping hunt and looking seriously at New York on a whole bunch of levels. And it\u2019s still a long way to go before we understand where they want to build and what they want to build, but we are going to be fitters. If it\u2019s real and it\u2019s done properly, we think the returns could be Sheldon like. Okay. So that\u2019s interesting. On Texas, obviously, extraordinary market, we\u2019re kicking the tires down there too. And another extraordinary market, you can\u2019t deny the power of Texas and the size and scale. And then I was there last week and it was a fascinating couple of days. And again, we\u2019re having conversations. We\u2019re looking to kicking the tires, and we will advise you when something emerges infects us. It would be a great casino market for land-based store, whatever it could be a huge opportunity. So these are opportunities that we \u2013 with our balance sheet and strength, we would jumped with both feet. It was the right structure. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Operator : Next question, we have Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks very much, and just echoing everyone else\u2019s thoughts about how sad it is to have this call without Sheldon. And just a follow-up question related to the sale of the LVS assets the Vegas assets, I mean, not specifically to the dividend, but just kind of how much of a priority it is. Is it where you just kind of answering an incoming call? Or is it something where you see that there may be some strategic reason why you would sell those assets, I guess? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : So I think from our standpoint, we\u2019re very returns focused. So as Rob just mentioned, we\u2019re always looking at new opportunities and always looking at our portfolio to see how we maximize shareholder returns. And as an entrepreneurial company, we\u2019re always accurate. So I think we should just look at this as, if there\u2019s a way to maximize shareholder returns, we\u2019re going to do it. And we constantly look at the assets that we have in our portfolio. We look at new growth opportunities, as Rob just mentioned, and we talk about them. This is something that our team is very focused on. So that\u2019s really how we think about it. Robin Farley : I guess if I could push a little more and I guess, what kind of appetite did you sounds to me. You sort of publicly confirmed it, which maybe would invade some interest, what kind of appetite? And you mentioned being returns focused, but almost anything that you would be interested in New York or Texas or other places would be kind of project-specific financing, right? So it wouldn\u2019t necessarily \u2013 you don\u2019t need the capital to free up to sort of put in to use in any other markets. So I guess just trying to think about, what kind of \u2013 in this environment, what kind of appetite you think there maybe for the assets? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : So I think there\u2019s a couple of different question there. So first off, I think the way we think about our portfolio is, we sort of evaluate projects on a case-by-case basis. So Las Vegas is a standalone entity. We\u2019ve operated it for a long time. We think it\u2019s a great asset. We think it has a great future. So obviously, we\u2019re focused operating at this point. I think in terms of \u2013 if we have additional capital to deploy. As you know, we have an expansion opportunity in Singapore that we\u2019re very focused on. And we think Singapore is just a very special market. It\u2019s privileged the fact that we\u2019re there. We love Singapore and think the future for Singapore is very strong, both as a leisure and business tourism market. And we\u2019re happy to have helped the government there. support its goals and continue to invest there. So we have capital that we get deployed there in the near term. I think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that Rob is talking about, we also have return of capital consideration. So for us capital allocation is front and center. We have these discussions with the management team and the Board all the time. So it\u2019s something where we\u2019ll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. And we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting while transact, and otherwise we\u2019ll look to the sort of historical actions that we\u2019ve taken in order to enhance returns. In the near term, it\u2019s also helpful to have additional liquidity, right? So I think from our standpoint as the pandemic recovers, it\u2019s nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we\u2019re running the amount of liquidity that we have today, right? We want to make sure that we have the opportunity to do whatever we need to do during this unprecedented time. So I think from that standpoint, that\u2019s kind of how we think about things. I hope this answers your question. Rob Goldstein : Robin, just to piggyback on Patrick Dumont\u2019s thought. And that is obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet whether we sell Las Vegas or not. But we also have, I believe the next couple of years, as you know 2019, we did about $5.5 billion [ph] EBITDA, I know these miserable years of 2020 and perhaps even 2021 make that seem like a distant memory, but lenient comes back and comes back strong. And also, I believe when Macau makes his decision, there\u2019s going to be a requirement to invest more in Macau, which as Sheldon himself, well, I can\u2019t wait to invest $5 billion, $10 billion. That\u2019s a very \u2013 in my opinion that when the Macanese government makes this decision, ideally contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly what Sheldon is doing that with both hands. And that may be something else you think about it. There\u2019s just no place like Macau. I think Grant and Wilfred gave you sense of London in four seasons, I hope we can all visit and be there, that we would see, what that team has achieved. But we\u2019re not done in Macau. Leads can be there for many more years. And when all this gets to over, it goes away, probably later this year or next, whenever, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not going to predict because I\u2019ve been wrong before. It won\u2019t be wrong again because I won\u2019t make a bet. But I bet one thing will happen is that the Macau\u2019s government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macau. And we want to be there, be ready, Patrick referenced Singapore. I mean, these are not small investments. They\u2019re in the billions of dollars. So I think we have to be prepared for outsized investments in our best markets, which are Macao and Singapore for crazy growth. And then there are other possibilities in the U.S. to reference. So as strong as we are, we can get stronger in growth. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thanks. Operator : Next question, we have Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Thanks for the question and condolences to everyone on the line. My first question is on Singapore, as it continues to be remarkably resilient. What are you learning from the reaching of results about serving domestic crowd that might inform your renovation plans? And does this make you more confident, the potential ROI on these investments? Will that ultimately require a full recovery in China consumers? Rob Goldstein : Well, firstly, as we serve, we found as Singapore is remarkably resilient. You\u2019re right. And the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, it\u2019s getting closed. So we\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners, who were residing during the pandemic or full-time in Singapore. We have a lot of strong players inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble. And that\u2019s a very positive sign. You saw the numbers, if we can run. Even though it\u2019s not the $1.7 billion we used to be at, not going to $2 billion, $3 billion or $4 billion like to be at. It\u2019s still a run rate of the $0.5 billion plus dollars in the most dramatic times. All it does for me is reinforced us how being powerful on Singapore, how wonderful the asset and frankly, who wonderful the government is to work with there, in terms of \u2013 they\u2019re still willing to talk and work with us. And we\u2019re hoping to get actually know there in March to continue our discussion, how to get phase two going. But it reinforces the enormous size and scale of that market and to think about having no foreign visitation yet to make that kind of money and perhaps even more, it\u2019s very encouraging. On the flip side, it also makes you wonder how important the airlift is as an island. It\u2019s hampered by the fact, unlike Macao, which could open the doors up if the government so chosen to relax the visitation requirements. In Singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. So we don\u2019t see it coming back in the short term, I think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. And so there\u2019s no real growth opportunity, I think, to see until this airlift issue is resolved. But it certainly makes us very much want to invest in Singapore. It\u2019s a great place to do business. It\u2019s a great market. Obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it. But do we want to invest money in Singapore, we sure do. We should get our product better. We have a lot of work to do in the building right now. We\u2019re actually embarking on an ambitious reinvestment program in the current asset to bring it up to a better standard. And then we want to build our second phase and similarly resolve everything. So we\u2019re \u2013 just like Macao, we\u2019re lucky to be there. And the idea we did \u2013 we can do $5-plus billion post-pandemic is pretty encouraging. It can be more. We think it can be a lot more. Yes. Stephen Grambling : And maybe a follow-up on digital and i-gaming, and I realize it\u2019s still early, and you said you\u2019ve been studying the industry, but are there any initial thoughts on what you think the company can bring to the table different than the existing players? Rob Goldstein : I have very strong thoughts about it, but I don\u2019t want to talk about them at this time. I want to keep working towards our goals, which is understand, it fully complete the conversation, and frankly, we\u2019re undertaking to really understand how to get there. It\u2019s a very interesting business, as you know. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of money, but it sure has great valuations. The question is, can we bring something to the table to make a lot of money. And we\u2019re working through it, and we\u2019re exploring. It\u2019s best I can tell you. We have something of concrete to say to you at a certain point. But right now, it\u2019s simply exploratory. In the same way, we explore a lot of things all the time. You saw in Thailand, I think someone came out about the possibility of an opportunity to either in Thailand, we\u2019re exploring that as well. So everything is up for grabs. I think when we look at our company the balance sheet enables us to have a very curious appetite to grow. And again, we\u2019re going to adhere to the founders, Gary Growth Adelson, and he believed in it, and we\u2019re certainly going to adhere to that. And I think you\u2019ll hear some things from us, hopefully, in the next 12 months that will make you believe in that idea. Stephen Grambling : Sounds great. Thanks so much. Operator : Next question, we have Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I also want to offer my condolences to you, Rob, Patrick, to the whole Adelson and Las Vegas Sands families. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Appreciate, Shaun. Thank you very much. Shaun Kelley : So I guess I\u2019d like to maybe turn back to Macao for a quick minute if we could. I think Grant\u2019s comments start off as a little sobering about sort of expectations of when we can start thinking about a recovery relative to kind of what\u2019s going on with the pandemic in China. And if we step back for a second, maybe it\u2019s a little harder for us over here, sometimes to monitor exactly the nuances of some of the vaccine developments, but one thing that\u2019s increasingly separating the U.S. recovery narrative from overseas is probably that to some degree? So I\u2019m wondering, if we could get a little bit of thought around maybe some of the vaccination programs and what the expectations are around that for maybe within Macao, broader thoughts on the local area there, possibly Hong Kong, and then how that could branch out to China in terms of \u2013 is that what we may need to really see a more concrete reopening for this entire market at this stage? Rob Goldstein : Is the sobering Mr. Chum still awake? Grant Chum : Yes. Okay. Yes. I think, Shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic Chinese economy during the course of especially the second half of 2020. So it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. So this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. And that\u2019s obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. So as you look into the fourth quarter, you\u2019re getting the 6.5% GDP growth in domestic China without the vaccination. So that\u2019s a very, very strong outcome. And obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. So I think we have to look at China in a slightly different way. The strategy is to continue to control to basically zero local cases. And whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they\u2019ve already been doing. Clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. And that will enable travel to resume more normally between Mainland China and Macao. So I think that\u2019s the first and most important point. In terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you\u2019ve seen comments from the local governments of both SARs, both Hong Kong and Macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually three from three different providers. And both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. So the local populations in the SARs will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. But really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside China itself. And if Macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. And there has been progress. I think obviously, it\u2019s from a low base, but there has been progress. There has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter. But again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that leads to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in China. Then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to Chinese New Year, which is, as you know, a period of huge migration of the population in travel. So that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. So again, another important point is as the pandemic \u2013 obviously if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, then that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside China as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between Macao and Mainland China. Shaun Kelley : That\u2019s helpful, Grant. And then maybe just as a further follow-up, this is probably maybe more for Wilfred, if he is still on. But last quarter, there was a little bit of commentary about the overseas gambling law. And I think we\u2019re approaching a little bit more or a closer kind of the point of probably both where we know more things about that law and also its implementation, which I believe is set from March 1. So just wondering, do we know anything more about that today than we knew before, any changes or additions to that that we should be aware of? Wilfred Wong : Yes. Actually, the amendment to Article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. It was enacted about two weeks ago. And as you appreciate this law, this amendment deals with people organizing gambling, running casinos, and particularly organizing citizens of China to go outside of the country to participate in gambling. Now there were \u2013 the inactive version made two changes of the previous draft. First, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition was removed. So they just used a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. So this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net. The second change appears to be a bit positive, but it\u2019s still ambiguous for Macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan is generally considered within the country. But then they leave an ambiguity thereby putting the word, offshore, inside the bracket after, outside the country. Now this introduces the ambiguity, and I was discussing this with both our lawyers in Beijing and the local NPC, National People\u2019s Congress, people attending the session. And they said that while the central people\u2019s government recognizes the special status of Macao, they do not want Macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the Southeast Asian countries. And as we all know, the Ministry of Tourism has compiled and is compiling a blacklist of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from Chinese citizens. So to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. But at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use Macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned. Shaun Kelley : Thank you for that. Operator : For the last question, we have David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi. My condolences as well, and the best part of this job is always the truly extraordinary people we get to meet, and that he was certainly a treasure and fun for sure. Rob Goldstein : That\u2019s so true. People \u2013 one thing I miss with Sheldon is his humor. Everyone talks about everything else but he was \u2013 he loved a laugh in a good time. And he just would sing and this guy\u2019s humor. So what\u2019s your question, David? Thank you for your comments. David Katz : Look, I think one of the slides in your deck, it suggests or implies that some of the rolling volume that\u2019s gone away has been recaptured within the mass is premium mass. Among all of the unknowables that you\u2019ve done your best to address, are you able to look into what you have in the premium mass and measure how much of that is a recapture of potential VIP dollars? And what is your best guess about, if you were sitting down to model one to four years out, how you would think about modeling VIP, just given where we sit today? And that\u2019s it. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Grant? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks for the question, David. I think structurally \u2013 and this is not to do with the pandemic. Structurally, we\u2019ve seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it\u2019s pre-pandemic, during and after. And the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners or operators of these great assets. And obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we\u2019re able to offer is very, very appealing. So I think that will continue. So your reference to, is there a transfer from one segment to another? I think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. And that\u2019s one of the brilliant things about Sheldon\u2019s Integrated Resort model is that we can offer everything from entertainment to the retail, to the food and beverage, to the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. So that trend is structural, and that\u2019s why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment. In terms of specifically, what\u2019s happening now, the situation is \u2013 you referenced, it\u2019s more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes. And obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces and resumes in the coming years, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. That also is true. But I think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. It\u2019s just that what\u2019s happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend. But it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, David. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s all the time that we have for today. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Katrina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, Katrina. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call are Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chung, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements.  In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We will refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, and a very early good morning to our colleagues in Asia. Some brief comments then we'll [indiscernible] Q&A. Our results reflect the pandemic's impact. We did generate $244 million of EBITDA for the quarter. And we continue to have a strong belief in the Macao recovery because the March numbers were very different from those in January and February and the recent visitation numbers and [indiscernible] for April reflect continued acceleration. Obviously, we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it's underway and we will continue in 2021. At this time, Singapore is in the $500 million to $600 million range annual EBITDA. There is no visibility as to when air traffic will return to Singapore. And unlike Macao, it's more difficult to project additional or incremental EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of [material] [ph] air travel. Our investments in Macao continue to take shape as the market recovers, Four Seasons and Londoner will present, I think large growth opportunities for us, and we continue to have -- we do have the largest structure in this incredible market of Macao. And China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong [the premium mass] [ph] level for both a gaming and a retail perspective and referenced on Page 29 and 30 [investment] [ph] retail perspective, there's some pleasant surprises there. But again, we have no reservations on our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns.  Our company today is sort of divided in 3 different areas : The Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore. And while we believe Macao will accelerate this year and lead the recovery, Singapore follow-up on resumption of air travel and participate in the recovery as well, and we anticipate a return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future.  [On the sale] [ph] of Las Vegas assets enable us to have huge optionality to explore large scale land-based destination works in both United States and Asia. And finally, we have -- we're eager to have a material digital presence in the future. We are exploring multiple opportunities at the present time. This is obviously a departure from our historical approach, and we'll update you at the appropriate time.  So let's go to Q&A and have first caller, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First question, we have Robin Farley -- I'm sorry, we have Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Rob, I appreciate there's probably some sensitivity around it. But in your prepared remarks, obviously, you talked about some of the Asia opportunities. And clearly, upon the completion of the Las Vegas sale, which obviously came at a very nice multiple for you guys, and I'm sure you're having very nice proceeds coming out of it. How do you think about the use of those proceeds in light of some of the opportunities? You're obviously kind of eyeing in Asia relative to, obviously, the return of a dividend, potential for buybacks longer term, potentially owning more [indiscernible] in China, all of the above? How do you kind of prioritize that pecking order and acknowledging you could do several of those things kind of what the balance sheet position that it's in? Robert Goldstein : Sure. We're looking at -- obviously a great opportunity for return. I think we continue to believe there'll be something happening in Macao at some point in the future, which will enable us to reinvest in Macao on a non-gaming basis. We're hopeful that'll happen sooner than later. You know that our project in Singapore, our phase 2 project is -- we're still continuing to work through those issues there. We continue to look at other Asian -- large-scale Asian opportunities. And then, of course, we think in the U.S., there may be some opportunities for us here. And lastly, digital. I think we look at everything individually and look at the returns and -- but our priority remains getting back on our feet in Asia be back to a $5-plus billion EBITDA and maintain -- that's the backbone of our company. That's what we'll start first. If something opportunistic opens up in U.S., Bob is with the bat and if something opens up digitally, we're deep into a digital and deep dive to figure out -- have deployed capital and intelligently to get a return. And I think there'll be some nice opportunities in the future there. As far as the dividend, I like Patrick to address that issue and return of the dividend. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Sure. Thanks, Rob. So I think, as Rob mentioned, we look very cautiously at the way we deploy capital, and we're very patient and we look for the way to maximize our returns for shareholders. And so when we look at the dividend, it really was and hopefully will be in the future, really the cornerstone, and you've heard me say that before, of a return of capital program. And I think where we are today is that we're going to look for operations to return to a baseline level and get a sense of where those operations are trending and then make an assessment with the Board and with management looking at our long-term potential to where the dividend should be given our ability to reinvest and allocate capital to other projects that are higher growth. And so I think it's pretty consistent with what you've heard us say before in calls, and nothing's changed from that perspective. Carlo Santarelli : Great, guys. And then if I could, whoever kind of wants to take this, it's more of an opinion question than anything else. But obviously, There is some consternation in the investment community around the status of VIP in Macao and the direction of the VIP going forward in Macao, whether or not if there's a perception that, that will have a positive or negative impact on the premium mass segment. One could obviously make the case that VIP customers who are having a harder time accessing capital, who do like to go -- could obviously move into the mass segment or premium mass segment, which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen or the fact that maybe some of that still overplay from VIP, if the VIP is softer doesn't show up in mass. Rob, maybe what's kind of your view and a view from your folks in Macao on how that -- how they would expect that to play out? Robert Goldstein : I have a very strong view, but since I woke up Grant at 04 :30 morning, why don't Grant take that call. Grant? Are you there? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes. We're here yes. Sure. On the question of VIP and premium mass, I think you've clearly seen the segments have diverged in terms of the recovery. Clearly, premium mass is -- has made a very significant recovery and already approaching 50% of pre-pandemic levels. VIP on the other hand, is still struggling at around 20% or sub-20%. So the segments are actually following very different trajectories, and we would expect that to continue for the time being. And of course, your question about whether there's spillover, whether there's migration I don't think those dynamics have really changed since a few years ago that there is a structural change over time, where more of the customers and more of the new customers are dealing directly with the casino operators program. And of course, the great assets on the integrated resort that all of the operators, including us, we've built up, have attracted more and more of these consumers to the premium mass program, and we expect that to continue over time as these non-gaming lifestyle assets and products continue to attract people to play in our programs. Operator : Next question, we have Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : When you look at your advanced bookings for the Golden Week holiday in Macao, do these bookings suggest or imply a further acceleration in the visitation or mix quality might be tough on sort of spend or GGR level relative to April and March? And anything underlying that suggests that maybe people are anticipating any -- or Macao patrons are anticipating any further incremental easing of travel restrictions? Robert Goldstein : [Indiscernible] to share with you our bookings for Gold Week. I just think we look at the -- I think the best reflection in the market right now is the acceleration in April. I think across the board, both visitation revenue is growing. And we remain convinced Macao is in a recovery mode already. I think the term came in March, very encouraging. I think it's foolish for us to try -- again, call the shots, so to speak, as when -- as this thing grows. I don\u2019t think it might be a [indiscernible] to define it. I think, instead it's a slow process of gradual growth. And I think the market will be disappointed [indiscernible] inflection point was just like Golden Week pops the numbers to a materially different level. I think we're seeing a gradual growth. The easing restrictions, obviously, the government decision. People are getting there as evidenced by the numbers coming out of April and the revenues. And I think we believe that this will just continue to accelerate with the only caveat being -- hopefully, obviously returned any cases of virus. [Can you offer,] [ph] Grant, any thoughts on that? Grant Chum : Yes. I think what Rob said is absolutely right. The term really started in March. In March, we started to experience a pretty meaningful rebound in visitations versus January and February. And as you've seen from the figures released by MGTO, that has continued on a similar momentum in April with visitations reaching post-pandemic highs in the mid of April. So the acceleration is seen across -- very encouragingly across all the different segments, whether you're talking about premium mass, mass. But the encouraging thing is that since March, we've really seen an acceleration in the base mass as well as the leisure FIT guests at the hotel, of course, retail, especially at the high-end consumption end of things. And we've even had an initial resumption of the MICE segment activity in March and bookings for Q2 look encouraging for the MICE as well, which is a surprise. But I think what you can see is a broad-based recovery in the different segments since early March. Robert Goldstein : I don't think we're going to get very emotional if there's not as big a number comes out of the May. We -- I think it's more -- it's a slow but very steady road upwards. Here in Las Vegas, it looks like the weekend is pre-pandemic levels, it's amazingly busy year and demand is back. I think Macao is going to follow suit. Of course, Vegas is still leading to the return of the group business, but that's inevitable. I think the U.S. is obviously in a different place than Asia. But I think China and Macao are just going to continue to move forward, accelerate. I think you'll see a slow gradual return in the second half of the year it could be very positive for everybody over there. Joseph Greff : Great. And then my follow-up question is maybe for all of you, those in Las Vegas and those in the ground early in the morning in Macao. And I just wanted to ask a question about a topic you guys love to answer is sort of your thoughts on the timing or process for the concession renewals. And I think I'm going to ask in a way that's answerable. If the government was thinking of renewing or extending 12 months in front of that expansion, right? And we're knocking on that and even if that was an extension for relatively short periods, would they have discussions for that with you by now? And maybe I'll have a -- I'll let you sort of open-endedly answer that question. Robert Goldstein : Yes. Joe, I don't think we want to speculate because we don't know -- we're not [indiscernible] the government. We don't know what they\u2019re thinking. But as we said, ad nauseam in the past, we remain strong believers is our position there. The story about the [ASEAN] [ph] and what we've done in Cotai and the $15 billion investment and the non-gaming assets we built back. We just aren't that concerned about - when the government tells us they tell us, but we don't have the insight and nor do we have any idea when they're going to do that. But we feel renewals will happen. We feel very confident of our position. And other than that, I don't have any other insight, unless Wilfred, anything you want to add to that? Is that fair to say? Wilfred Wong : Yes. All the sixth concessioners are waiting eagerly for the government to make announcements as we draw closer to the expiration of the concession. But as ever, we stand ready to cooperate with the government once they announced the timeline and what they intend to do over the next 12, 18 months. Operator : Next question, we have Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : As a follow-up, I think, to Carlo's question on the proceeds from Las Vegas. I guess, where would raising your ownership of Sands China factor into that list? And can you just remind us what the process or limitations might be if you did want to go down that path? Robert Goldstein : Sure. Pat, do you want to grab that? Patrick Dumont : Yes, sure. So I think from our standpoint, we feel very strongly about the long-term future and success of Macao as the world's leading leisure and tours destination. And as Rob has said before and as you've heard on these calls, we're very interested in investing more there in non-gaming. We feel very strongly in the future of Macao. So it's definitely something that we think about and consider over time. I think where we are now -- we don't have the proceeds yet. We're looking at all the options, and we're going to consider everything. I think we're going to be very focused on returns. And so I think we're looking at new developments we're looking at how to increase and develop more in the markets that we're in. And I think that will be something that we think about. And I think really for us, there's a lot of opportunity in front of the company. And we're being patient. We're looking at it all. And we're going to look through the lens of maximizing return. So it's not something that I'm going to say we're going to do now, but it's something that is in the things that we consider as we look across the way we might allocate capital. Stephen Grambling : And so just to clarify, is there a maximum ownership percentage that you can go up to for Sands China? Patrick Dumont : So I think technically they want to have 25% of the float outstanding for the exchange, but there are exceptions. Stephen Grambling : Got it. Patrick Dumont : Grant, I want to make sure that, that makes sense. Grant I just want to ask Grant Chum, I want to make sure I didn't [indiscernible] thing there, but ... Grant Chum : Yes. Robert Goldstein : That's correct. You're right. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And then as we think about the model going forward, I realize that you broke out the Las Vegas assets within the EBITDA count. But is there any impact that we should be thinking about and it's more of a modeling question, but as we think about corporate expenses, going forward, is it basically what you reported this quarter kind of the right run rate to think about? Or is there other things that might be in there? Patrick Dumont : No. I think what you should see over time is that corporate expenses should adjust post sale. But I think in the long run, we will continue to have a corporate office that manages the activities of the enterprise as a whole. So there's nothing in there that's noise right now, but you should expect to see some changes going forward after the completion of the sale. Operator : Next question, we have Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : So just on Marina Bay Sands, the performance of the property improved quarter-over-quarter. Obviously, they're not getting any more Chinese visitors there. So can you just talk about some of the drivers of that? Robert Goldstein : Yes. Surprisingly, our slot business there are exceptional -- the biggest drivers are slot performance has been outsized. It's been -- I mean we actually are not up against pre-pandemic levels, the slot floor. I think that reflects the comfort level with the team and other for the ability the to buy slot capacity without having a feel uncomfortable. It's more difficult on the table side to do that there's more spacing on the table side, which makes it difficult. But as you referenced, not having that fond of station is very hurtful because -- Singapore traditionally, the residents there and the visitors and the current residents all. It was a slot -- strong slot market before we he got there, just has gotten better over the years with the -- our ability to provide a good quality product. But that's the driver, no question about it. But without that foreign visitation, it's hard to grow the premium mass in the high-end table business. So we convince struggle and I think we'll stay in this range until things improve. And unlike Macao, I think we're going to see a move in this summer and fall. I don't think you can see that -- any reason to believe that happens in Singapore. The neighboring countries are still struggling with the vaccinations, be it Malaysia or Indonesia or Japan, there's no real evidence that this is going to change in the short term. But it's a slot business over there that's been really exceptionally strong. Patrick Dumont : The other thing to note, and this is Patrick, is just keep in mind that while the pandemic-related restrictions has eased, the actual activity levels of the people in Singapore has gotten more back-to-normal over time across the quarter, right? So as people get vaccinated, as public health initiatives bear fruits, people who are in Singapore are more out and about. And so we benefited from some of that as well. So it's not as if there's a change, to Rob's point before, it's not as if there's a change in visitation, but there has been a change in activity in Singapore as things return more to normal there. Thomas Allen : Makes total sense. And then just as my follow-up, it seems like you're getting more and more serious about your digital strategy. Can you just elaborate a little bit more of that? Robert Goldstein : I don't see anything because we're not very yet, Thomas. We have -- we're like the new guys with locker, I think the game is just beginning. And we're looking at it from many, many aspects. We've been a lot of man hours, a lot of people looking at the opportunities. We have a big appetite, but as you know, that market is still developing be it -- I think we're looking not just in the sports or the game, but all aspects of digital. We find it fastening and very, very complementary to our land-based business. But we're just not ready yet to disclose what we're going to do because we haven't decided. So not much color there, but I think you'll be hearing from us this year and next year about the direction we're taking. Operator : Next question, we have Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : I just wanted to go back to the kind of question around some of the possible reinvestment back into Asia as you've got so much cash or liquidity available on the balance sheet and obviously heading into the concession process. So my specific question was that there was some press recently about possible investment in the broader Greater Bay area being a potential criteria or a potential result of the concession process? And I would just kind of peaked my thinking around, would that be something that LVS would consider potentially investing in non-gaming, let's call it, in the broader region, but outside of Macao directly? Is that something you -- how would you react to that? Robert Goldstein : Positively. And we are -- again, we're strong believers in the rebound of Macao. It's coming back and there are people who somehow don't believe it, that's -- we'll have to wait and see. But it's going to come back in a strong way. We'll be the leading site in that space, our Londoner and Four Seasons investments are going to be having very well received. If the government wants us to invest in the region, and it makes -- we'll do it. We have capital, we've appetite, and we remain committed to Macao in a big way. We believe it's going to grow and grow for us. And despite all the distractions and all the pandemic, all the issues, Macao still remains from a land-based perspective, the most opportunistic and advantageous market in the world. And we plan to be there for a long time and invest more capital. And again, the government's directions will be pound out to our thinking. Shaun Kelley : Great. And just maybe as a quick follow-up. potential reopening of Hong Kong, just kind of curious on latest there. I think the case counts have been, I think, very low. And there's some positive news there, but I think the vaccination rate is also very low. So just curious on color from that part of the market and that as a possible avenue for reopening some of the travel in the region. Robert Goldstein : Sure. Wilfred or Grant can grab that since you guys are right there at the middle of it? Wilfred Wong : Yes. I think it is gratifying to note that the cases every day has dropped to single digit. And I think yesterday, there was no home case in Hong Kong. The -- both governments of Hong Kong and Macao have announced that if there is a continuing period of 14 days of zero cases, they would open or consider opening the border between Hong Kong and Macao. And I think the Hong Kong government is working very hard to achieve that. And hopefully, that if that happens, that's going to help our business a lot. Operator : Next question, we have Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad Beynon : I know it's early on the Londoner opening of phase 1 here, but just wanted to ask about the makeup of the customer or how you guys are running that right now between Londoner and Venetian? Is there a major difference in terms of the customers that are visiting 1 versus the other from a base or premium standpoint? And are you deciding to comp certain players into 1 versus the other? Just trying to get some additional color in terms of how that's running since it just reopened? Robert Goldstein : Mr. Chum? Kwan Chum : Yes, yes. On the subject of Londoner, well, I think if you take a step back, we opened our first new product in the Four Seasons, the Grand Suites last year, and that has progressed exceptionally well in terms of customer feedback. And so clearly, that is more targeted at the premium mass and the long-stay leisure family guests. And then when we got to early part of 2021, as you referenced, we opened the first phase of Londoner. That's really the main Londoner hotel and the north side of the building with the Crystal Palace Atrium and some of the signature food and beverage outlets and some other tractions that we've opened up so far.  And I think it's important to remember that a large part of the building, namely on the south side, the Sheraton side, is still under heavy construction -- actually both on the interior as well as the exterior side because we have been bringing forward the construction works on that side of the building to take advantage of the low levels of traffic. So in terms of your question about segmentation, it really follows the trajectory of the initial recovery that we see in Macao right now. Therefore, not very much in terms of base mass traffic, and that's both because of the demand side but also the fact that the south side of the building is undergoing large-scale construction. And it's really focused more on the premium mass segment as well as the FIT leisure guest. We've enjoyed a resumption of the FIT segment in the various hotels that we have in the Londoner Macao. But clearly, there's a lot more to come in the remainder of the year into early part of next year in terms of the products that are coming online. We've got second all-suite hotel Londoner opening up later on the year. The Sheraton side, we're going to have the second wow space, atrium Shakespeare hall coming online imminently in the second quarter. Obviously, we still have the London arena. and another, call it, 6, 7, 8 food and beverage outlets, together with the theme attractions in the property as well as the retheming of the retail shops. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we are today. Chad Beynon : Okay. Yes, that's great. And then separately, just regarding your retail mall business in Asia, which is on Slide 29, you've outlined that rental concessions have come down sequentially, which should be a positive just in terms of the health of your tenants. Is there anything that's going to change dramatically going forward just in terms of a turnover versus base component of the makeup of this business or when visitation kind of gets back to more normalized levels? Do you still expect for the profits of the retail mall portfolio to kind of mirror what you saw pre-pandemic? Robert Goldstein : Yes, we absolutely expect it to be very much like the pre-pandemic levels. I mean what you're seeing now is similar to the U.S. outside spending by affluent people driving these crazy good numbers out of luxury Four Seasons and others. But I think we expect a full recovery. We have no concerns in trepidation that as visitation in Macao returns and to Singapore, our malls are going back to pre-pandemic levels and perhaps even beyond that. So we -- I don't think there's any concerns that you've seen the correction on the rent concessions, you've seen it go the right direction. But we're very pleased with the caveat that we want to see a return to mass traffic as well as various people driving these large performances.  But yes, we expect it to look a lot like pre-pandemic levels, hopefully, as the year continues. And in Macao -- Singapore, the more difficult because, but again, until the resumption of air traffic and foreign travel. I think Singapore is going to lag their pre-pandemic levels. And again, we feel much more aggressive in the return of Macao than we do at Singapore at this time because we don't see the vaccination kicking as large in the region, nor do we see air traffic -- any visibility in the resumption of air traffic. So it's hard to see Singapore getting back to pre-pandemic levels this year. Operator : Next question, we have Robin Farley from UBS. . Robin Farley : A lot of my questions have been asked already. But I'm curious on the online strategy. It sounds like it's going to be a little while from your comment earlier before there would be some announcement about LVS involvement. Is it fair to say, given that there's so much activity around getting market share when new markets open, that if you're kind of maybe coming to the online markets a little bit later than others that maybe your strategy would be kind of M&A focused rather than kind of building from scratch your presence in those markets. Robert Goldstein : Well, the thought is we can go either direction, we can go to M&A or we could build organically. But at this point, again, I think we'll lay low. I think the challenging businesses -- despite the valuation, there's still challenging businesses. And it's early innings maybe -- in fact national anthem on time in terms of some of these businesses. I mean online in the U.S. is still a very -- not online gaming, which has been the profited -- most positive still in a few states. And I think the sports betting remains a conundrum to some extent to what's really happening there. So -- and there's also a lot of movement outside the U.S., there's Europe and there's North America, there's all kinds of opportunities. So I don't think it'd be that long, we'll come back to you, but we're trying to again assess how to be smart and targeted, not just -- obviously with the kind of balance sheet we have, the optionality is endless. And we'll be careful and do it the right way. We really have the finest land-based business. So we want to get back and healthy. But we'll come back at the right time and the right strategy and right thought process. And then we'd want to obligate ourselves to say it's going to be organic or it's M&A, but we'll get there. I promise you that. We have a pretty voracious appetite to be in that world. And it may be different than you think it's going to be, but we'll let you know, and we're going to talk about it. Operator : Next question, we have Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : So the guys on the ground earlier in the call, touched on the favorable -- talked about the favorable case counts they're seeing in Hong Kong. But I guess the question is, can you guys provide any color around the actual vaccinations process -- or progress in your key feeder markets like Macao, Hong Kong, Guangdong? Obviously, it's very tough for us over here to get a good understanding where they are today versus maybe somebody like the U.S. is right now. So any color there would be pretty helpful. Robert Goldstein : Wilfred, Grant, can you help me on that one? Wilfred Wong : Yes. I think the situation on the ground in China, they have started the vaccination program, but there's no -- really no hurry for people to get the vaccination because China has been very safe for the last months. And for Hong Kong and Macao, Macao has no incidents for over 380 days. So the feeling of comfort is causing a lot of people to adopt the wait and see attitude. But it's getting there, people are slowly ticking up the vaccination. Same with Hong Kong. I think Hong Kong is -- there's, unfortunately, a few cases of people suffering after the vaccination so again, there are people adopting the wait-and-see attitude. But slowly, slowly, people are beginning to realize the importance, especially if they are thinking of traveling overseas that the travel bubble may require vaccination certification. So I think people are beginning to take up vaccination. Steve Wieczynski : Got you. And Rob, there's been some talk or some rumors out there about Macao potentially moving to a digital currency down the road at some point, try to combat money laundering. Do you have any high-level thoughts around something like that being implemented? And then if something like that would get implemented, maybe the impact you potentially could see across certain business segments? Robert Goldstein : I think a couple of thoughts to that. One is, I don't -- some people are concerned, we're not -- we think it's an additional form of liquidity into the market. Two, it won't preempt other currencies, there are ways of having funds to gamble. But also, I think some of the problem we have in our industry we think that everything is done in Beijing, they're actually thinking about casinos in Macao. I'm not sure if the case is a different thought process there. Sometimes we very limit our thinking. I don't think Macao is a target or as you mentioned anti-money laundering, much as a digital currency strategy by Beijing. And I don't think it's hurting Macao whatsoever. I think it's just a traditional liquidity. And Grant, do you want to weigh on this at all? Grant Chum : No. I think you said it well, I think it's a big and complex topic. It's really more about the digital currency strategy of China more broadly. And also how Macao can fit into that. So probably most helpful is to refer to the comments by the Chief Executive recently in the question-and-answer session in the legislature, basically, this digital currency China has been looking at since 2014. And so Macao will also adjust and adapt in order to accommodate this broader strategy on digital currency. But a prerequisite of that is also getting prepared in terms of amending the existing relevant legislation. So this is still an early stage process from the perspective of Macao. Robert Goldstein : I think the assumption has been by a lot of people, this is a negative thing. We view it as a positive as again, we would love to have more cross currency and more cross-border currency. So to me, the long to protect the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi, it's another form of currency. And I should only be concerned, our business is not built on money laundering or on necessary junket profile. We're looking to focus on the mass customer, premium mass -- that's our bread and butter, that's who we are, where we want to go in the future. And we can build a business that keeps growing on the back of that. More visitation more penetration in China, more ways we're getting people to gamble and visit Macao is we're looking for. [indiscernible] is another value add to it. I think it's positive. I know the common wisdom is always going to be turbulent. I don't want seeing people think that way. It's not an immediate concern nor I think it's a long-term concern. It may be a very positive thing for Macao market as it becomes more traditional, more integrated into China and more consumer-friendly, it will be very positive for us. Operator : Our last question is from David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : Rob, I just -- you used the term voracious appetite for digital before. And I wondered -- I appreciate it and wondered what intelligence you have or what survey work that gives you a sense that your people, your customers here in the U.S. or you have an audience in the U.S., particularly in the context of Las Vegas going away that, that audience is there for you? Robert Goldstein : Well, I think [indiscernible]. And Mike, I guess, more voracious is a description of how we feel about that digital market, and you look at it. You can't deny the cumulative power of all those different businesses. And I think we have to do know which 1 we want to enter, which few want to enter. I'm not that concerned about the fact where some people were late to the party or who don't have a sports betting presence because I don't think it's all that difficult to enter them. We want to buy something we could we want to build the platform could. But I think we're looking at -- right now, it's a good kind of to reflect on what's making money, what's going to grow. And I don't think it necessarily in our thought process -- just simply in the U.S., it may be outside in Europe, it would not be in Asia because we would not do something that upsets the governments we do business within Asia. But it could be in Europe, it could be in South America and North America, there're a lot of markets after -- beyond the U.S. And it could be in the U.S., it could be B2B, it could be B2C. I just think the market -- we are spending a lot of time leading and learning. And with our balance sheet with the sale of Las Vegas, again, we have outsized capital to look at these things. When we build organically or buy something remains to be determined. We won't do something just to do something. It'll be something that's intelligent, well thought out and profitable. And I think we all see -- not just LVS, but we can see the opportunities there for digital market that goes to 20%, 30%, 40%, who knows the numbers. The numbers keep growing in people's minds. And I think there is a belief that the digital market will become probably the hugely opportunistic for people like us, but we plan be part of that. But again, it's growing in each for us. We're just learning the business. And I don't think it's a question of selling Las Vegas takes off the table in fact. I think the sale Las Vegas puts us again even further because it provides the capital and the incentive to grow.  At the same time, I think people have this speed and work concept or if you're a land-based, you can't be digital, you have to be -- we're not either we're going to be a land-based player for years to come, making probably $5-plus billion in Asia in the near future. We're going to be a digital player and we'll still look at -- there's some speculation we want to lead the U.S. market, which is absolutely untrue. We just felt it was a better place to earn more returns on our capital then in Las Vegas. And we think we can be in multiple businesses. We need digital, land-based, Asia, U.S., where the opportunities grow that's where we'll grow. And we're not tied to any one strategy and one thought process. Operator : Everyone. That's all the time that we have for today. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, operator. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call today are Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we\u2019re making under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website and we may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of this call. And finally, those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, and a very good early morning to our colleagues in Asia. Just a brief comment then we\u2019ll go right to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic\u2019s impact. We did generate positive EBITDA of $244 million a quarter, about the same as the first quarter. Our Macao performance reflected sequential improvement, but pandemic-related travel restrictions continued to impact our performance. We do remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore, and we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it\u2019s underway and will continue in 2021. Singapore remains in the $500 million to $600 million range annually, although the second quarter was impacted by heightened pandemic-related restrictions for a portion of the quarter. We will also be subject to closures of both portions of MBS from today to August 5th as part of COVID-19-related protocols. This will obviously have a negative impact on Q3 results. In addition, there remains no visibility as to when air traffic will return in Singapore. Unlike Macao, it is difficult to project additional EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of air travel. Our considerable investment in Macao continues to take shape. As the market recovers Four Seasons and the Londoner will represent growth opportunities, and we continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong at the premium mass level for both in gaming and retail perspective you may want to reference Page 29 and 30 in your deck. We do have great optimism about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns, and our company is dividing into three areas, the Asian portfolio in Macao and Singapore. While we believe Macao will accelerate in the second half of this year and lead the recovery, Singapore will follow upon the resumption of air travel. We are confident we\u2019ll return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future. The sale of the Las Vegas assets creates liquidity and vast optionality to explore large land-based destination resorts in the United States and Asia. And finally, we\u2019re in the early innings of building out our digital presence. We\u2019re exploring multiple opportunities at the present and we are eager to have this effort become material to our company in the years ahead and we\u2019ll update you at the appropriate time. Let\u2019s take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on your announcement about your online strategy and kind of pursuing B2B investments? And just if you could help us think about kind of how the brand that you have would help in the B2B effort or how -- just in terms of what that does for Sands as well in a reciprocal way? And then also, if that -- is that going to be the full extent or are you still looking also at B2C options in the online market? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Pat, do you want to take that? Patrick Dumont : Sure. Happy too. Thanks, Robin. So a few points. I think our brand is very strong. I think we have decades of established brand and high-quality operations and a great relationship with customers. We think that\u2019s very powerful to your point. One thing we\u2019re thinking about is we\u2019re really investing for the future. We take a very long-term approach. We\u2019re still evaluating a lot of different opportunities. I think B2B presents a very significant opportunity for us. Davis has a great history and we\u2019re really looking forward to him getting started and we\u2019re happy that he joined us. I think we\u2019ll provide updates as we make progress. It\u2019s still very early stages. But we\u2019re looking forward to be able to deploy capital over many years and really look at this from the long-term and create a lot of long-term shareholder value. And I think in the future, you\u2019ll see us looking at other things and other opportunities. As Rob said on other calls, we\u2019re going to be very patient. We\u2019re going to be prudent and we\u2019re going to look for opportunities where we see ways to create real value in the long-term. So I don\u2019t think this is the last thing you\u2019ll see from us. But I think it\u2019s really just the beginning and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing this thing evolve over time. So as we make progress, we\u2019ll definitely provide more updates. Robin Farley : Okay. And I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s -- just as a follow-up, just thinking about the B2B, many of the B2B providers out there kind of working with those that would technically be your competitors in land-based. And so, I guess, how do you think about framing that, how they would see Sands\u2019 presence in the online business as somebody that they would partner with versus a competitor? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : It\u2019s a very fair point. And I think, interestingly, our company has seen a lot of changes in the last 12 months. And I think one of the things that we thought about when we considered this is that we really are conflicting. The operation, which we -- the markets in which we operate going forward are going to be Singapore and Macao. And so from that standpoint, it\u2019s really a limited universe of people who are our true competitive set clearly in some of the larger geographies where a B2B services model could really be productive. So I think from our standpoint, we are a little bit neutral. Like we believe we are from the sense that in a lot of the markets that we might look to target, we don\u2019t have any land-based operations and don\u2019t have any B2C operations where we could find customers from a B2B business model standpoint. So we feel pretty good about it. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Robin. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, guys. Nice to hear your voices. We probably kind of said it mostly, just in terms of Macao\u2019s reliance on travel and mobility enhancing measures and timing there. So I am not going to waste my time on that. But I think that the last call, Wilfred gave a decent amount of detail and I would say a decent amount of optimism in terms of your license potentially markets getting extended sometime middle of this year and that timeframe has sort of passed with it. But now I was hoping you could just give us an update on your conversations or your thinking renewal/extension process in Macao? Rob Goldstein : Wilfred, are you there? Dr. Wilfred Wong : Yes. Thank you. Yeah. I think the situation has not changed. The -- obviously, the extension, it\u2019s a very complicated issue. It\u2019s something that the Macao Government and the Chinese Government will have to look at very carefully. They also have their own preoccupation at this stage. For example, the Macao Government apart from still working very hard on making sure that Macao remains a safe city in all the precautionary measures against COVID. They are now preparing for the mixed legislative council election, which is due on the 12th of September. So the government is operating at a pace where they feel they want to launch the public consultation for the concession renewal towards the second half of this year, which we believe might mean that it will only happen after the legislative council election. Now I don\u2019t think the government is in a rush to renew the license, because they want to do things right. And as we all know, there are many legal issues they have to attend to such as the concession and sub-concession issue and this -- they can only go to the legislative council when the new council is in place. And then so, for -- at this stage, we are really focusing on doing our best, aligning our interest with the government, such as focusing on investment and reinvestment opportunities, building out our properties, improving our operational efficiencies, maintaining a stable workforce, which is very important during this pandemic. And I think that things will pan itself out eventually, because as we\u2019ve moved closer to the expiry of the concession, naturally that the extension of the concession is an option, which the government will have to look at. But at this stage, there is nothing official and we have no privy information. Rob Goldstein : And just to follow-up, Joe, on Wilfred\u2019s comments, we remain very comfortable with our position. We have to be patient, but there will be resolution. As you know, we\u2019ve said numerous times, we\u2019ve led the efforts in Macao for a diversified approach to development. We\u2019ve gone above and beyond. Sheldon was the guy behind the Cotai development. We invested US$15-plus and we continue to follow the government\u2019s advice and direction. So we remain very confident and very patient waiting for the government\u2019s decision. But no real change, nothing new, but we\u2019ve not altered our belief that we\u2019re in a very good position, very comfortable. Joe Greff : I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you, guys. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Good afternoon and good morning. Rob, could you talk a little bit about the project at MBS, obviously, 2025 is the deadline or, sorry, is the expected opening. As you kind of have this amount of setbacks and acknowledging that you guys kind of pushed it earlier, given COVID back in 2020. Does 2025 still seem kind of realistic as a target? And what are kind of the goalposts for some of the construction work along the way? Rob Goldstein : I am going to give it to Patrick, except for one. I\u2019ll say this before Patrick jumps in. We remain very committed to Singapore to withstand our presence and footprint. Obviously, COVID has thrown a monkey wrench, a big monkey wrench in this whole thing. But this is an extraordinary market. We are going to invest in Singapore. We\u2019ve done very well there and the addition is going to happen. I think the timeframe really depends on the ability to go back to work in the construction area and getting things back in line. I think we\u2019ve lost 2021, we\u2019re heading to 2022. So, again, we\u2019re committed and I\u2019ll ask Patrick to provide more color because he\u2019s dealt with the government directly. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. I think the key thing is what Rob just said, which is there\u2019s a certain amount of uncertainty around the timing and availability of when we can actually get things done. A lot of the early parts of this project required us to work with certain government agencies to seek their approval and to work with them collaboratively to ensure that we fulfill the obligations and their desires as well as part of this project. It\u2019s a very tight sight. It\u2019s eight acres. There\u2019s a lot of programming, a lot of density and a lot of things that have to be worked through, and a lot of things have to be integrated into the current environment to make it right. And so we\u2019re starting to work with some of those things. But as a practical matter, the nature of the construction project of this complexity and size would always be challenging in a normal environment. So I think we\u2019re just trying to be cautious and make sure that we understand all of the different parameters around labor and construction timelines before we say that this is a schedule that is not achievable or is achievable. I think a lot of it depends on the environment and how things go in terms of concession, excuse me, COVID recovery over the next couple of months. We\u2019ll have a much better view at that time. But right now, I think, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. We\u2019re going to continue to work with the government and hopefully have an opportunity to get going sooner rather than later. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thanks, Rob and Patrick. If I could just one quick one, has there been any thought, obviously, now given that the sale of Venetian Las Vegas and the proceeds that are on the comp for that, can you potentially revisiting the bidding process in Japan? Rob Goldstein : Not at this time, Carlo. We\u2019ve had inquiries from a lot of parties there. We tried very hard. There\u2019s a lot of money and a lot of human capital worked there in the last 10 years, 15 years and we left with a feeling that there was just too much uncertainty for us. We can always revisit something based on a change in circumstance, but at this point, we remain on the sidelines. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Thanks, Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks. Could you just talk a little bit about some of the different expansion opportunities for land-based resorts in the U.S. or even other broader markets that we haven\u2019t touched base on so far and how you prioritize to evaluate those different markets? Rob Goldstein : Well, in the U.S., you know of our efforts in New York, which we shutdown because New York did not resolve that issue. So that\u2019s not available at this time. Texas, we remain very committed to pursuing. I think it\u2019s a couple years away. But I think there\u2019s a real chance down the road back in Texas doing something down there. There\u2019s some recent news there in Florida. We put a new order in Florida. If we can get some opportunity, we\u2019re going to look past there in 2022, because we\u2019re successfully gathering signatures to get a vote in the fall of 2022 for a land-based opportunity. In the U.S., that\u2019s all at this point we\u2019re looking at. Obviously, we\u2019ve discussed Japan, although, previously. Our best opportunities are to reinvest in Macao and Singapore because those places have proven huge successes. And I think when you\u2019re as fortunate as we are to have made $5-plus billion when we build out there, who knows what, but there\u2019s a lot of running room in both Singapore and Macao. Frankly, they remain our biggest focus, because they\u2019re so extraordinary and hard to duplicate anywhere in the world. And I think that\u2019s our focus right now is getting MBS things to up, and hopefully, late in the fall, we can invest more in Macao. The Londoner will be completed later this year or 2022, Four Seasons. We would love to deploy more capital in Asia. I think the broad opportunity is interesting. We\u2019ll see when we have the ability to get there. But it\u2019s hard to find things as extraordinary as the two places we operate today. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Rob Goldstein : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe a question for either Grant or Wilfred, but I was wondering, I think, we have a pretty good sight line on the core premium mass market and how that\u2019s performing and how the spending behavior is going. But I was wondering if there\u2019s any color insights you guys have gleaned just from what you\u2019re seeing on more of the base mass or the lower end mass market. I am sure the sample set is small, just kind of curious on how the customer is behaving when they are in the market and what you\u2019ve seen in some of your properties if you could provide anything there? Rob Goldstein : Grant? Grant Chum : Yeah. Hi, Shaun. Good morning. I think the trends have been pretty consistent in the last six months. You see, I think, very strong consumption propensity, great strength in spending power for those who have returned to Macao for leisure trips and I think that applies across the different segments. But, obviously, clearly, the premium mass, the segment has returned in greater volume, greater number of patrons. But when you go farther down to mid level and the base mass, the spending power is definitely prominent. However, we can see from the visitations, they are still around, let\u2019s say, low 20% of where we were before the pandemic. So the base mass is clearly impacted by just the drastic reduction in the number of people visiting. But the people who are coming are actually staying longer and in most cases, more. And I think what was encouraging sequentially, although, June was somewhat of a temporary hiccup, what was encouraging was we saw the greatest amount of sequential growth in the base mass in the FRT segments versus Q1. Although premium mass continued to cover. The bigger bounce back was actually in the base mass. So we hope to see some of those makes encouraging trends continue into the summer holidays and beyond. Shaun Kelley : Great. And maybe change here for a quick follow-up on the online topic, if I could. For Patrick or Rob, just kind of want to get your quick sense on maybe the build versus buy equation, right? So, obviously, some of these technologies and things are out there, but they could be quite expensive. Just how do you kind of weigh maybe some of the options that are around acquisitions and sizing relative to possibly things that could be done maybe more organically? Rob Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : So it\u2019s a very interesting question. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been looking at for a while and we continue to look at. It\u2019s an interesting comment about valuations. I think there\u2019s been a lot of optimism in the market, call it, the last six months to 12 months, and valuations have definitely moved around a lot in the last few weeks. I think the key thing for us is we\u2019re really building for the long-term and so when we look at things we\u2019re really going to take a long-term view of value and if we do acquire something, it\u2019s going to be for the reason that it fits into a much larger broader strategy and something where we see long-term value creation by owning it. I also think we\u2019re not necessarily looking to take big bites right away. I think this is something we\u2019re going to look to develop it over time in the prudent manner and sort of build more and then maybe buy where it makes sense. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us go out and make a splash by using Las Vegas sale proceeds in any large transformational acquisition unless there\u2019s some really compelling reason why we have to do it. But that\u2019s not our focus. Our focus is to build the product, get the culture right, get the opportunity right and then make acquisitions as they fit in with the overall strategy. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Yeah. Patrick, just a follow-up to that question. Respect that you\u2019re not going to do a transformational deal, but how are you thinking about the size of the deal, like, are you thinking of being kind of an incubator for startups or are you thinking of like hundreds of millions, low billions, how are you thinking about the sizes? Patrick Dumont : It\u2019s a pretty broad range. I\u2019ll tell you that, our goal is really, I don\u2019t know that we provide a lot of value at the angel stage. We might be able to help some people, but I am not really sure that that\u2019s where we provide sort of the most value. I think from our standpoint, if we can get kind of earlier-stage and mid-stage, but again fitting into a larger strategy, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll look to be really effective. I think things that are much larger that would be transformational in the $1 billion range. We would have to have a really good reason to do it and I think we would want to be operating for a while to understand why that would make sense for us. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to buy our way into a business. I think we\u2019re going to develop our way into a business and look to see how acquisitions help enhance that approach. Thomas Allen : Helpful color. That makes sense. And then just on Macao and Singapore, respecting that the majority of your business and the majority of your future is really around the mass market. VIP came in really light. Only $600 million of rolling chip volumes in Singapore stood out. Just can you talk about what\u2019s going on there and your expectations? Rob Goldstein : Well, I think, you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re looking at Singapore as opposed to Macao you said right, Thomas? I think\u2026 Thomas Allen : I think Macao was down quarter-over-quarter too, Rob, so like, I mean, Singapore was what really stood out, but just talk about VIP in general and kind of your expectations there? Rob Goldstein : Well, VIP, as you know, right now it\u2019s a closed market, just locals only. So you do trading mostly exclusively on people who are living in Singapore and that maybe people residing during the pandemic. You might get an extra push from some of the folks who have moved to Singapore to wait out the pandemic as part of the reason. But I don\u2019t think you can look at our numbers at this point and really make a whole lot of inference as a future, because it\u2019s so -- without having -- look at the slot business there, it\u2019s so outsized and yet it\u2019s surprising us how well it\u2019s doing because that never was the case that kind of performance. You have people that can\u2019t leave, they are stuck in Singapore. The same way people can\u2019t leave, they are stuck in Singapore right now on the high end. So I think it\u2019s hard to make inferences looking into the future. It\u2019s probably a trend. It\u2019s just an anomaly. I think that\u2019s going to be the case until this thing resolves and there\u2019s air traffic in and out of Singapore. You\u2019ll see these trends both good and bad that are confusing. And I think in the case of it\u2019s very difficult to look at Singapore\u2019s numbers and come up with a clear direction where it goes and the slot performance confused all of us initially and now you realize a lot of people who travel outside Singapore are staying to gamble. The same probably holds true on the high end on the Chinese nationals to be residing in Singapore during the pandemic. So I am not sure you can make a whole lot of long-term trends based on what we\u2019re seeing today in Singapore. Patrick Dumont : There\u2019s one other comment that might be helpful, which is the way we\u2019re sort of thinking about it, is that the investment in the product really matter. And so if you look at what we\u2019ve done during the pandemic, we spent a lot of time and deployed a lot of capital in sort of enhancing the offering that we have. So when there is a recovery, we have better capacity and a more competitive product. It is a product driven industry. And so from our standpoint, the way we think about the long-term is the level of investment that we put in during the pandemic, so we can position ourselves in a more strong way when the recovery happens. So I wouldn\u2019t look at the rolling volumes now and you -- to indicate anything. I think you should look at the fact that we\u2019ve been able to deploy capital, create higher quality products, create higher quality experience for our customers and that way we\u2019re stronger positioned on the other side and that\u2019s how we\u2019re really approaching it. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So probably going back to Wilfred with this question, but I guess for Americans and investors that we talk to, it\u2019s tough for us to understand where China is with respect to their vaccination progress. And case counts continue to look pretty promising, but China is still having issues. But is it -- China still having issues with lack of availability with the vaccine or is it the vaccine that\u2019s being used hasn\u2019t been effective or is it just something else? I am just trying to get more color around that if all that makes sense? Rob Goldstein : Well, thank you for the question. Actually, China is not lacking in vaccines. Actually, they export quite a lot of vaccines. But the truth, if you look at the statistics, China today has already administered 1.5 billion doses of vaccine. Now that really means that over 50%, 60% of the population has been vaccinated and if you assume everyone has two doses, then that represents 53%. And they are still vaccinating at over 10 million doses a day. So what it means is, every 25 days, they can increase that vaccination rate by 10%. Now, that is also to some extent true for Hong Kong and Macao. Hong Kong already administered 5 million doses and its vaccination rate is already over 40%. Macao administered 460,000 doses. That\u2019s also over 40% of the population. So we\u2019re quite confident that if China continues in that rate and with the increase of vaccination rate by about 10% per 25 days, when you come to winter, almost the whole population like 90%, 80%, would be vaccinated. Now, I think once we reach that level, that travel bubble within China, including Hong Kong and Macao is really possible. Now what you have seen in the news is that because China adopts a non-tolerance policy towards COVID, so whenever there\u2019s some outbreak in certain areas in the country, it\u2019s widely reported and they immediately go back to lockdown. And that\u2019s why I think the best scenario in the short-term is a travel bubble between China, Hong Kong and Macao, because they are so concerned about the importation of COVID cases, especially with the variant cases. Steve Wieczynski : That\u2019s great color. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your last question is from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You covered a lot of\u2026 Rob Goldstein : Hi. David Katz : You covered a lot of ground. What I wanted to ask was just kind of a broader question. You\u2019re taking in everything about the U.S. and what you\u2019ve said in Asia. If we were to think about what LVS looks like in say three years to five years out or two years to five years out. What\u2019s that picture look like? What\u2019s the vision for that? What are the -- and obviously that can be as qualitative and high level as you\u2019re thinking about it? But I\u2019d love to just hear your perspectives on that. Rob Goldstein : Well, it\u2019s pretty simple from our perspective. I mean, first and foremost, we return to $5 billion or $6 billion EBITDA in our Macao and Singapore markets. We see a renewed investment in both Macao and Singapore to grow that from $5 billion to $6 billion and beyond. We still see a one or two land-based facility in the United States [Audio Gap] maybe Florida and Texas and last we have a strong regional presence. And reflecting our balance sheet, we have the ability to do all these things. I think we\u2019re convinced in Asia that the most important thing in this company is the timing is uncertain of a return to more normal environment in Asia, but the outcome is not uncertain, it\u2019s going to happen. And I think it reflects what happened here in Las Vegas, which is people flock to these casinos, will make more money than pre-COVID and our business will boom again and I think, you are asking, clearly, asking about timing, but not of the outcome. And also we\u2019re not going to invest heavily in both those places, because that\u2019s our best path to $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion EBITDA. We have been very clear of these in both Texas, Florida, and perhaps, other larger jurisdictions in the U.S. We will be -- we have the balance sheet and the optionality to pursue those, and as Pat just outlined, we are very involved in the digital strategy. It\u2019s pretty slow to get there. But I think three years to five years from now you\u2019ll see a real positive outcome. And that\u2019s where we think we end up. We feel pretty confident. We\u2019ve been derailed the last 18 months by this horrific virus, this pandemic. But I think it\u2019s clear we\u2019re heading, to me it\u2019s very obvious that we\u2019re going to be patient and stay the course and I think we\u2019re doing that. We have ample liquidity to do anything we want to do anywhere in a large scale. So that would be my thought three years to five years from now. Patrick, just go ahead with this [ph]? Patrick Dumont : I couldn\u2019t agree with you more and I think that the great thing about it is we have a lot of opportunity in front of us, right? I can\u2019t tell you which one of these options hopefully all of them become available but probably. And the great thing is that we\u2019ve just invested $2.2 billion in Macao. We feel very strongly about the market and the potential to invest more post-concession renewal. We feel very strongly about the expansion in Singapore and our long-term commitment. Singapore is a very unique tourist destination and a high quality of earnings potential that we\u2019ll get from Singapore. And then looking to the U.S., these are just great locations. And looking at the digital opportunity, we feel really strongly about the returns and the potential growth that\u2019s in this area. So from a company standpoint, five years from now, we could be looking like a very different company in terms of our scale. And to Rob\u2019s point earlier, I think, our balance sheet and the capability that the liquidity from the sale of Las Vegas presents allows us to pursue all these opportunities. So we\u2019re very bullish about it. David Katz : And if I may just follow-up quickly and I appreciate all of that, with respect to the digital strategy, is -- the notion that it would be integrated with the company as it is today and branded as such or is it more of a sort of a separate enterprise or potentially either still at this point? Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Rob, if you\u2019re okay, I\u2019ll grab that one. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Please. Please do. Patrick Dumont : So I think the key thing to note is, we have a very skilled team and a great platform. We have a very strong corporate culture. We have just the ability to execute on a variety of different things and I think we have the capital to have patience and invest for the long-term. And so I think this is going to be a business that will require separate people, separate infrastructure and be distinct. That being said, it will benefit from being part of our larger organization. So much like Singapore and Macao are part of a global team, they have things that are specific to them that they have to deal with and so will this business. But it will benefit from being part of the larger organization. David Katz : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, David, as always. Dan? Operator : This concludes\u2026 Rob Goldstein : That concludes -- go ahead. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Dan Briggs. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, Operator. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call are Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China, and Grant Chum, Chief Operating President of Sands China. Before I turn the call over to Rob. Please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we're making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The Company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures, a definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides in our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in Q&A session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon and good morning to our colleagues in Asia and thank you for joining our call today. I'll provide some brief comments then we'll go to the Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. Heightened restrictions directly impacted our results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets. We remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. Singapore gaming operations are closed for a portion of the quarter, enhanced restrictions were in place throughout the remainder of the quarter. The good news in Singapore, the travel quarters are being established with the number of source markets, which hopefully will contribute to the strong recovery of the time. Our considerable investments in Macao continues to take shape. As the market recovers, we believe that Four Seasons in London will present a growth opportunity in the future. The spend in Macao has proven both resilient, the premium mass level from both the gaming and retail perspective you can see on Page 29, 30 in your deck. We have great optimism about our ability to perform to a pre -pandemic level once visitation has returned. Our Company is divided in 3 areas. Most importantly, the Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore, remain confident we will return to a strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions or fees in traveling tours recover. The sale of our Las Vegas assets create liquidity and optionality as we pursue large-scale land-based destination resorts in both U.S. and Asia. We will continue to build out our digital presence and we're exploring multiple opportunities we'll achieve in the appropriate time in future. So thanks for your time again, say let's go to the questions. Dan? Daniel Briggs : Operator, we're ready to go. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, everybody, hope everyone's well. Rob, obviously, not going to spend a lot of time discussing the results as we all know that numerous impacting results right now. But what menu -- when you think about the progress as it pertains to Macao and what you're hearing around potential using of Visa stuff, whether it's on a province by province basis or whatever the latest is that you could share would be appreciated. Rob Goldstein : Sure. We woke up 2 guys and they were nice so I'll let them speak to it. But, Grant and Wilfred, why don't you take that since you're on the ground, living and breathing them -- these issues every day. Grant Chum : Yes, let me do that. Rob Goldstein : [Indiscernible] Grant Chum : Thanks, Rob. On the basis -- I think the main point is the Visa channels for the individual business game remains open. I think if you look at the quarter in the third quarter, what really impacted results during the quarter, month by month is really the conditions on the ground in terms of domestic COVID cases. So you will see that in July we had at 1 point for about 3 weeks in July, we had a pretty significant recovery in the visitation and also room occupancy. And we were starting to get a good momentum for the summer after the issues we had in the Guangdong outbreak in June. And then as we moved into late July and early August, we had more local cases starting with the Nanjing airport outbreak. And eventually in early August, we did have 4 local cases. So that obviously curtailed the traffic immediately. And as we move into September, again, we were recovering well, especially in the second and third week of September. And we were building up, ready for the October Golden Week again. And unfortunately, we did have some local cases towards the last week of September, which, again, reduced the traffic immediately as it led to additional restrictions around the border. So that really explains how the traffic flow evolve during the quarter. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Rob, you guys, did disclose, and I think this is different from how you've disclosed historically around capital expenditures in the period. The one line in there was $24 million of Corporate and Other. Does that -- what exactly does that pertain to and does that have anything to do with the comments that you made on the digital piece of the business? Rob Goldstein : Sure. Pat, you want to take that? Patrick Dumont : Sure. I think there's a bunch of stuff in there. Some of the stuff relate to digital, but some of it relates to Capex associated with moving. Carlo Santarelli : Got it. And could you just update your latest thoughts on the learnings of the last couple of months, quarters as it pertains to the digital initiative to any degree, Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Yeah, sure, happy to do it. I think for us, we take a very long-term approach. We mentioned it last quarter, I think this is something that's going to invest over quarters and years. We're really investing for the future. I think for us, we're looking to be mindful of the way we deploy capital. We've always had a history of investing in things that we think provide a very high level of returns in the future. And that's where we're thinking about it today. We think there's a great opportunity in digital and a variety of different areas. You see some of the valuations that the market is giving to certain areas today. We think it's very compelling, especially for the long-term. So right now we're just sort of moving along slowly and when we have more things to report, we will, as Rob said, his opening remarks, but we're very confidence. We have capital to deploy against that. We're excited about the future. And we have more things to talk about. We certainly well for right now, it's very early stages. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Thank you, guys. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Carlo. Operator : Thank you.Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thank you. Maybe changing gears to look at Singapore, It looks like that market was also obviously impacting the quarter VIP, particularly soft. If we look out further once restrictions ease, I guess, how do you think about the potential EBITDA potential of that asset if VIP in Macao remains pressured. In other words, what kind of overlap do you typically see in Singapore from the Chinese traveler, and could that be impacted if VIP is permanently restricted? Rob Goldstein : Sure. First, I think the fascinating part to me is we operate in 3 markets currently and Las Vegas is the blueprint and include recovery of Asia. We said -- about a year ago, I was coming to work and someone told me, here in Las Vegas we wouldn't see normal returns here, total revenue till '24, '25. We are already in the fall of '21 and the market's loan wide open. And what's the path? The path is pent-up demand vaccinations and doors get open. And I think Las Vegas will be the blueprint release, that's the path. So vaccinations in Asia are booming. If you can look at the what's happening in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, China, Korea, it's all above the percentage-wise what's happening in the U.S. So first, we have extremely strong vaccination rates in Asia, surpassing U.S. Number 2, I think you've got, obviously, the government that wants to open the doors in Singapore as evidenced by their actions they want just that. I think you'll see a big turn in '22. Your recovery will begin in '22. When do we get back to 1.7 and maybe beyond that EBITDA, I don't know. The exact date I can't tell you. I can tell you this, it's going to be a lot better in '22, if the government continues their path, which is shown a lot of leadership and thoughtfulness, the acceleration --vaccination rates, I think are actually approaching 80 plus percent. The market over there feels it's ready to come back in '22. As the government opens those travelings and we look at, again, the demand issues here in Las Vegas have been I think very instructive. It's great to walk through it and see the numbers that's kicking out through the city. Why wouldn't that happen in Asia? If Singapore has been a hugely important market to us. Your point about Macao versus the Chinese market, obviously, part of our business is dependent upon access to Chinese market, but it's not dependent. In fact, it still make a lot of money, maybe as much as a billion net dollars without a lot of Chinese inputs. So if Korea opens up and Singapore opens up, Malaysia opens up and Korea -- and Japan, those markets are very, very fat and happy for us. And I believe, the scenes are opening up throughout '22. That's the pick. If a vaccination rate is slowing, its open traveling, it's open your doors up and then watching what's happened in Vegas happen in Singapore. And I feel I don't want to identify a month or a quarter, but I think you're going to see a nice turn in '22. And then the same will happen in Macao when the government decides to open those doors up. I know there's people are -- people are saying '25, Macao opens up '27. But the truth is, Vegas has put about 30 minutes. Once they open their doors up, it just recovers. And base recovery is not a convention bank was based recovery out yet to come. I think the future in Vegas remains, as we voiced that very bright. And there's no reason why it can't be anyway it, in both Singapore and Macao as vaccination rates takeoff and government get more confident and travel lanes re open. So we're highly confident this will happen in Singapore in '22. To what degree? I don't I won't predict, but it's just a question for MVAS goes right back where it was pre - COVID it's just another -- so we're very confident. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And perhaps as a follow-up, going back to Macao, what -- we'll love it just if you could provide any additional color on the consultation process. And what are the key points of clarification that you are watching for as you think about how to strategically position the business? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. We've been -- I've been involved in, well, my colleagues in the country over two decades. We've seen, I mean, we've been through everything and starting 20 years ago, and people tell you, you can't do business in Macao and then Cotai wouldn't be successful. Now, we have the incredibly crippling crisis in the 8 and 9. We had smoking issues. It always worked out. And we're very proud of what we've done in Macao over the years. I think our activities, our investments speak for themselves. I have faith in the process. They've always treat us fairly, and we responded with the largest investment in any gaming market in the world. So we believe -- we remain believers. We wait for the government's advice in direction. We've submitted our responses. But looking at our history on success, I believe, will be instructive to the future of our business in Macao. And so no more beyond that. I think it's clear to say that we have a lot of lead in this market. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. Thanks so much. Rob Goldstein : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Hello, everybody. Rob and gang -- Rob Goldstein : Hi, Joe. Joe Greff : On Macao 's recovery and the potential for more meaningful, increased travel and mobility between Mainland China and Macao, do you get the impression, whether it's from conversations with the government and otherwise, that this is more likely after the Olympics in Beijing in February? Rob Goldstein : I will defer them to the fellows in the ground up. I don't think we heard these points of Golden Week and it's going to happen when the Olympics are -- I don't think we know. I think it'd be silly for us to predict, Joe. I don't think we can really give you confidence that we have great insights when the doors will reopen. But we just know they will at some point. I think '22 will be a turn year. But I don't want to get into the game of saying it's to happen this date. I think we said in previous calls, we don't know when, we just know when it does happens to be very powerful and it's going to limit Las Vegas. I mean, anybody hasn't seen that, hasn't spend time in Macao. It's going to be quite a storm of activity over there. But I don't want the Olympics or Golden Week or -- because we -- obviously we've been wronged by those who predicted has fallen on a sort is no reason to. Grant, Wilfred, do you have a different approach to this? Speak up. Grant Chum : Agree. Rob Goldstein : Sorry Grant. Go ahead. Grant Chum : Sorry Rob go ahead We see we see underlying demand continues to be very strong when the opportunity arises. Now, the opportunity has -- maybe has been relatively brief, one month here, a few weeks there. we can definitely see the underlying demand actually across all the different segments as very strong. And I think Rob referenced the pent-up demand that we've seen in Las Vegas coming through. And I think it's not going to be dissimilar in Macao. But I agree with Rob that we can't be really drawn into predicting timing. But we definitely see the evidence on the pent-up demand for sure. Joe Greff : Great. And then -- Rob Goldstein : Wilfred? Dr. Wilfred Wong : And I think that China will open up to the world when they feel confident that they can control any community outbreak situations. And that depends a lot on the vaccination rate, which at this stage stands at about 80% and the availability of medicinal cure. They are now testing with all kinds of cure methods including Chinese herbal methods, and there's a lot of research going into it. So we're quite hopeful that very soon with -- they are vaccinating at about 1.3 million, 1.4 million people a day. So if they continue like this in another 200 days, it will be another 10% of the population. So I think as China's vaccination rate goes up, the government's confidence increases. And we are hopeful that Macao, as part of China, adopting similar policies will benefit from the opening up. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. Patrick, on the investments on the digital side, can you talk about how you envision maybe the size of those investments over the next couple of years, are we talking about relatively small, more modest investments or could we see investments in hundreds of millions or a billion-dollar range, depending on what's available and what you like. Patrick Dumont : So it's something we talk about a lot internally. I think some of it's going to be related to the value of the opportunity that we see. I think it sort of our thoughts right now is that we're really thinking earlier stage or mid-stage. But again, it was fit into a larger strategy and that's kind of how we'll think about being effective for the long-term and how we think will create long-term value. I don't know that we'll necessarily look at something that's transformational right away. That's something that we may consider in the future depending on where things go and what market opportunity we see. But I think the good news is we've got plenty of firepower. We've got a strong management team and expertise in the industry and we think we can be really helpful to grow in technology. So from our standpoint, we're going to be opportunistic and we'll see how it goes. But in the beginning we're going to start small and sort of build from there. Joe Greff : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about one of the proposals in the new legislation. Is that it would require government approval for dividends. And if that were enacted, I realize it's just in the discussion stages now. But if that were enacted into law, would you think twice about investing if you -- if then there would be a chance that you wouldn't be approved to get a return on that investment? In other words, how much of a concern would that be for you? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Patrick, you want to take that? Patrick Dumont : I'm sorry. Rob Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Grant, yes. I think from our standpoint, I think we're obviously very much focused on building on our past. As Rob mentioned, I think we have a great track record of investing in Macao, in scale and non-gaming amenities. And I think from our standpoint, we have confidence that we'll ultimately will result from this process will be a good path forward. And so we're very confident, we're eagerly waiting instructions on how to proceed. But in our mind, Macao is the best market in the world, we continue to invest. We're very excited about the long term in Macao and wait and see how things go. But from our standpoint, we're very confident about the future. Grant Chum : Rob, one thing I think we tried to reference is, after 2 decades of being there, we've never found the government to be not thoughtful. They're very thoughtful, and they're going to take these issues and make it reasonable for all of us. We're not that concerned. I mean, I saw initially the response was putting like that, they're concerned. We don't have this concerns, and yes, we're eager to reinvest in Macao. We were assuming that the process will be fair and equal, and we're also assuming that they want us to invest as well. The government there wants the growth in Macao. So we're not that concerned about that issue at all. Robin Farley : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Just in terms of timing or potential extension of your existing concession, is there a point at which you feel the indication is that it's going to be extended for at least another 12 months? I mean, just given the timing already seems would be -- seems very challenging to do anything before June of '22, given the inability to travel into the country. Is that safe to assume that, at this point, it's not something that you would expect to come up for bid before June? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : I don't think -- we're not going to voice their opinion because we just, again, we remain confident the process will work out. Again, we have 2 decades of history with this government, and it's been a very good 2 decades. This Company built a great business base on it. We've had, like every business you have stops and starts, and good days and bad days. In the 2 decades since we started doing business in Macao, we've always found the government very reasonable, very thoughtful, and very fair. And we're not concerned when they make that decision next month or month after or make it in June. I don't know when they're going to make that decision. I'll let them make that decision and tell us. We'll respond accordingly, but we have no trepidation or bring fear that will be an issue to us. We knew this was coming. I mean, it is a lease, so we knew this day was coming and we're prepared for it. And we're also prepared to wait till the government tells us how they want to proceed and will respect for that process. Robin Farley : Okay. great. Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning and afternoon, everyone. Just to maybe follow-up on the whole licensing process. I mean, I think one thing we've all thought about is the requirement or the idea that they're probably incremental capital that would need to be invested either in Macao, theoretically in non-gaming amenities which you knew well, or in somewhere in greater Mainland China, I just wanted to ask about that last point. Any thoughts on your desire, your ability to invest directly in mainland China? Is that something you'd be prepared to do and sort of how would you kind of underwrite returns or thinking about underwriting those given some of your return focus. If that was the ask. Rob Goldstein : A lot of other factors, but I'm going to preempt up by saying we, again, you know we have the ability to invest as clear based on our balance sheet. We have the appetite to invest. We have a track record that was -- that obviously we invested 15 billion. We invested a few billion dollars right before the pandemic hit, which people thought, oh gee, you want the clarity of the license, we did it. So we remain willing and eager to invest in Macao and perhaps other parts Macao, and just waiting for that day to happen. Patrick, you want to jump in? Patrick Dumont : Sure. Thanks, Rob. We're very happy, very proud of Sheldon's long-term vision for Macao and for our Company's investments. We're proud of what Sheldon and the Company in the team has accomplished over many years there, the amount of investment, the high-quality of tours and assets that we've created, the tours and drivers, the non-gaming diversification. And really to be fair, a lot of the tourism innovation that we brought to Macao we've all been saying things that have been complementary and follow through with the original goal of the first concession. And so we're very proud about that and we're very confident about the future and our ability to invest in or support these long-term goals of the government and for the Company. And so I think as we look to potential things that we may have to do in terms of future investment, we welcome the opportunity. We would love to invest more. We're very eager to deploy capital into these markets. We think they're very high quality and we really believe in the future. So there's just been a lot of commentary around things that may happen to occur or may have to occur. I don't think anyone really knows. I think the only thing that we're very confident about is our ability to invest, to innovate from the tourism side, and to drive really the support of the initiatives that have been asked about. So from that standpoint, we're ready to do it. But until we have clear direction, there's not really much more we can say. Shaun Kelley : Great. And maybe just as the follow-up, sticking with the investment team, probably for you, Patrick, but just thinking about the same question for Singapore. Obviously, there you have a little bit more of a developed path on dollars that have been allocated and when you want to get going. But can you just give us the latest on when you think you'd actually be moving on some of the investments you, guys, have committed to make there and building out the additional hotel tower and expansion? Patrick Dumont : Sure. As we've said before, I think we're very excited to do it. It represents a tremendous opportunity to support Singapore 's goals, to deploy a significant amount of capital in the most privileged market in the world, which is really one of the great cities in the world. Singapore is growing. It was growing tremendously before the pandemic and they've really been leaders in their public health initiatives to support their population during the pandemic. So we're very proud to be there. I think we would love to get started soon as possible. But right now they're dealing with a lot of things that have a higher priority. So we're waiting patiently. We have a long-term partnership with the government and we're looking forward to working through new open remaining items so that we can begin. But our plan is to begin and we're very excited about it. So the question is when and I think that's going to be dictated by necessary public health responses around timing and opening. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question -- your next question is from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Benjamin Chaiken : Hey, everyone. There's been lots of -- there's been lots of conversation understandably about investing in digital and 2, to investments that maybe required in Singapore and Macao. But at the same time, you spoke about pent-up demand in Macao and Singapore, which seems to make a share buyback at these levels, potentially a more compelling ROI. I guess, how do you balance the optionality of those different options, I guess? Yeah. Patrick Dumont : So we think about this a lot. We spend a lot of time on it as a management team. We run a lot of sensitivities and scenarios around potential returns. And it's interesting. We have a lot of opportunity as the Company, we're really excited about it. And I think our highest and best use of capital and to create the best shareholder returns really is to develop new projects from the ground up. That's how we built the Company. That's how we've always created the return profile that has made our equity very compelling. And so from our standpoint, that's our focus. Rob and the rest of the team spent a lot of time looking into development opportunities in many different jurisdictions. And so we're focused on deploying capital into those jurisdictions to grow the business. At the same time, we recognize there's opportunity in the equity. And in the past, we've always returned excess capital through share repurchases. And so that's something that we'll look to do in the future. But at this point, I think we're evaluating a lot of opportunities for real growth. And so from that standpoint, we're very excited, but we'll always look at the return potential of buy equity. Do we believe the equity is at a compelling level? Absolutely. But at the same time, we also like to believe that we have some real significant available opportunities in the future that will create very significant returns as well. So to your point, it is balanced. But we look at it and we're trying to allocate capital in the best way that we can. Benjamin Chaiken : Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Politzer : Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So on Singapore, how do you think about margins for this property over the next couple of years? I think there is a higher tax rate that goes into effect and potentially impact from construction disruption, and possibly some of the costs you were able to optimize over the past 18 months. Going forward over the next couple of years, how do you think about that given the expectation for pent-up demand to come back in 2022? Rob Goldstein : Firstly, I look at what's happened. Again, it's instructive look in Las Vegas. The so-called four-year recovery took again about less than a year. I think Singapore is in arrival. Las Vegas becomes the pre -COVID recovery being stronger, which means stronger margins for us and bigger growth. I think -- there's this market in Singapore is proving very resilient in the past, especially when the government's come to open traveling, to open the doors up. I think margin will be just fine. We didn't -- by the way, we didn't furlough people or lay off. Lots of people -- we didn't squeeze people out the door. We stood by our employees and I think we didn't necessarily maximize -- we could have, we decided not to do that. And I think that's to our credit. But on the other hand, I think our business there will currently reoccur back to pre -COVID levels and probably beyond pre -COVID. And again, if Vegas is instructive and I believe it is, the demand is going to be extraordinary in Asia. The Lock down here in Las Vegas is much shorter. than the lock-down in Asia. Yet the gaming proclivity for lot of Asian countries is solid in Las Vegas. So anybody things Singapore is not going to come back with a vengeance, I think is mistake, the same Macao. And of course those revenues will drive our margins. So I have no fear that were returned to pre-COVID and margins and pre-COVID revenues exceed both. Really voice on Singapore will be the first and the best place open next year for the gamer, or for the tourist or for the leisure leisure travel is going to be exceptional plans to revisit. You see where the government is going. They've indicated they're anxious being open. Their vaccination rates are soaring. The traveling is being established. The neighbor is getting better in Malaysia, Korea, Japan. Indonesia is still lagging, but coming on. So I use this question time, '22 is return year till we see margins and revenues, and EBITDA has been much more back to normal than they've been the last 24 months. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks. And then just one more on Macao. I mean, when Macao does eventually recover, how do you think about your share of GGR evolving given the opening of the London area, which we didn't have back in 2019? And also, I know how to target different customer, but how do you anticipate any impact from Lisboa Palace on your properties? And if so, if there's an impact, which ones? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Mr. Chum, are you still here? Grant Chum : Yeah, Rob. I think history of Macao shows every time we have large-scale high-quality product coming in on Cotai, it helps the market. And I think when the demand comes back, it's going to be to the market's benefit and to the whole industry's benefit that we've got good new product that customers can patronize. And that applies to Lisboa Palace, that applies to with some buck, other competitors will be -- will have open by then. And, obviously, we think first and foremost is going to apply to what we've completed in Grand Suites at Four Seasons, and also to London and Macao. So we're very excited and confident that when the demand returns, all these new projects but I would say, especially all projects is going to be a growth driver for the industry. And by implication, we hope that we will achieve good market share. But I think it's much more about as the history and 2 decades of shan growing the overall pie. And I think in terms of segments, again, I wouldn't hesitate to say that it's going to be positive across a very broad base of segmentation of the mass -- the premium mass and so forth. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. Rob Goldstein : Hi, David. Patrick Dumont : David, you there? Rob Goldstein : David? We lost Mr. Katz. Operator : Okay. We'll go to the next question. It's from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just one question here for me -- good afternoon, Rob. Just one question for me. And Rob, I know you're probably tired of answering a bunch of hear-say questions about the renewal process. And this one is probably going to be a bit more direct. I guess the simple question is, do you guys see a scenario out there where you are not operating any casino assets in Macao at some point in the near future? And I'm sorry to be so blunt, but it's a question I think a lot of investors are pondering right now given the bigness that has come out of the Chinese government about what they're actually looking for. Rob Goldstein : I do not -- I see no chance of that whatsoever. I think we're -- but I -- I'll refer as I -- I apologize by singing a broken record, but the truth is we've been doing this for a couple of decades, we have unparalleled track record. The whole Cotai development would be -- one guy did that and it's Sheldon. One guy put $15 billion around the non-gaming and gaming assets. One Company made almost $4 billion EBITDA, and I think we have been stellar with our employees. So I remain beyond confident that we'll be operating in Macao. I don't think chance whatsoever that we wouldn't be. I'm not saying that rhetorically. I mean that sincerely. Our -- every indication we have gotten is to the opposite. So we, again, I'm very proud of our track record throughout profitable development, profitable investment, but I think the government is recognize we've been a lawfully good licensee and partner and friend China and Macao. And we're eagerly back there. So no, I don't believe that's a possibility. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Great. Thanks, Grant and Rob. Rob Goldstein : Sure. Anything else? Operator : Your final question is from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi, can you hear me now? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. We thought you fell asleep on us because you're in Macao. David Katz : There is no sleeping at Jefferies. What I was really hoping to have the team's perspective on is really VIP gaming. Because we do spend a fair amount of time talking with investors, with people on the ground, et cetera, around what the VIP -- what the future of the VIP business really looks like. There have been some public pressures on it. Talk about currency, changes, and things like that, that presumably would have some impact. What is the real growth solid recovery core look like in VIP? Rob Goldstein : I just want to let Grant take that question, you listened and read. You talking Macao, I assume in the whole track of this discover, right? David Katz : Yes. Rob Goldstein : Okay. So let's begin with a little bit of historical perspective. Again, for the 20 plus years we've been doing business in Macao, we incurred this, this isn't going to work, that's not going to work. The revenues will never go anywhere. I believe this is for off one. Segments are going to fall apart. The latest thing is to say the VIP is not always the junket side. I just remain a huge believer in that market of all segments. Obviously, we've made our strength in the mass -- premium mass has been our bread and butter and will continue to be. But I don't think you'll ever discount, those who have discount, this segment has done it at their own parallel. I think it can -- it could move to a different channel, the different way of being available. But gamers are going to keep happening in all segments in Macao. I just -- as a precursor to Grant's comments, I think you have to realize how awful this market has been, the growth has been unbelievable. Those of us who started back in 2002, 2003, and 2004, never dreamed the way every segment just developed in the 2010, 2011, 2012 era. It was the junk as we drove Macao to sent and morph into our premium mass market -- our premium mass market. And again, our Company has been more focused on the base mass and premium mass segments. But the VIP had served the market very well. So I think it will re-merge in different form with different channels of distribution. And that's my take. Grant, you're much closer to this, so please speak up. Grant Chum : I think you said it very well, Rob. I think it's important to remember, again, the proportion of profit coming from that segment, especially, I think, you have more referencing the junket segment versus our own VIP business. It's very, very small. It's really low single-digit pre-COVID. So I know people spend a lot of time talking about it, but our business is really geared to that large scale destination resort with premium mass, mass, the leisure, the FIT, and the future is going to be that structural growth in those segments, as well as the non-gaming, the retail, the MICE. And so that's where really our re-investments and asset base has really focused on. Rob Goldstein : I think the driver gets Grant's point -- the driver that market is always going to be or work focuses lifestyle. Extraordinary entertainment, restaurants, retail, rooms, that's where investors -- we see the London, that's where the focus was. The Four Seasons is more towards the very high-end premium mass. But no matter what form it takes, the gamble is that it'll just keep growing over there and the desire to come to will grow. So whether it be the new -- as we built another Company, it just enhances the market. And I don't think there'll ever be a lack of customers, a lack of visitors to Macao. The problem's going to be when the market comes flooring back in, whenever, it's '22 or whenever. I think the problem's going to be lack of capacity, going to be lack of rooms. That part is always going to be burdened by needs new capacity, needs new lodging because whether it be based mask, pre-mask, it is no longer a Hong-Kong dependent overnight market. It's a stay-overnight market, it's a leisure market, it's a business market, it's a spectacular market. And we're going to be there with everybody else, trying to get our fair share, and I think our new assets, if we ever get to see them,? next year, are going to surprise you. What we've done with the London or Four Seasons is the best thing we've ever done, in my opinion. So we look forward to getting back to Macao and getting back to business. Thanks, David.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Daniel Briggs. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Daniel Briggs : Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call are Grant Chum, our Chief Operating Officer of Sands China; and Dr. Wilfred Wong, who are about to get connected and I apologize for starting late. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides in our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon and good morning to our colleagues in Asia, a very good morning for our colleagues in Asia. Thank you for joining our call today. We will have some brief comments and then we will go right to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic\u2019s impact. Travel restrictions continue to affect visitation and our financial results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate some positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets. We remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. The good news in Singapore, the travel restrictions and travel carters were established with many important source markets during the quarter. Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Australia, Thailand were all part of the initial rollout of the DTO program. And obviously, emergence of Omicron variant impacted the DTO program in late December. The DTO should contribute to a more robust recovery over time. Our confidence in the long-term opportunity in Singapore remains deep, and I am pleased to announce we have embarked to a $1 billion U.S. renovation project at MBS that will introduce luxurious new suite product to the resort. The program will meaningfully expand our room suite offerings and significantly enhance our appeal to premium customers. In Macao, the Londoner is near completion. As the market recovers, both the Four Seasons and Londoner will provide growth opportunities -- material growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. We continue to have the largest footprint in the world\u2019s greatest market, Macao, and appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process ongoing. We look forward to participating in the tendering process as it proceeds to fruition. Customer demand and spending in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective, as outlined, I think, on pages 29 and 30 in your deck. We continue to have great optimism about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns. You may know our company is divided primarily into three material areas, the most important being Asia, the portfolio in Macao and Singapore. We remain confident we will return to strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. The sale of Las Vegas creates liquidity and optionality as we pursue additional large-scale, land-based destination resorts in the U.S. and Asia. And we continue to build our digital presence. We are exploring multiple opportunities at this time and we will provide some color at the appropriate time. So let\u2019s go to your questions and thank you for listening. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Good afternoon. Good morning, everyone. Rob Goldstein : Hi, Joe Joe Greff : Rob and Patrick, I\u2019d like to start off on the topic of capital return and how you are thinking about that, particularly in light of $5 million in gross cash proceeds coming in the next couple of months. Does that cause you to probably rethink that capital return is more of a near-term event? Or do you really need to see a recovery in both Macao and Singapore before you initiate some sort of capital return? I know you mentioned liquidity/optionality for new jurisdictions in the U.S. and Asia, so in that that\u2019s part of the calculus. But if you can refresh your thinking on capital return, I think, that would be helpful for us? Rob Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : I am happy to. Yeah. Hey, Joe. I appreciate the question. I think we have been pretty consistent in our thinking. It\u2019s been part of our long-term strategic plan, how to create additional capacity to really grow this business. Sheldon has really started from the beginning as you know, you followed us since day one that he\u2019s really been a developer of large-scale projects, and I think that ethos continues today within our company. And I think we are very excited about some of the opportunities that we have in front of us. Rob and the rest of the development team and our entire group has been working very hard. It\u2019s great opportunities to grow with large-scale development in the future. So I think the way we see the capital that\u2019s going to come into our system from the consummation of Vegas sale is really to grow the business. As we have always said before, the dividend and share repurchases really do represent part of our shareholder return strategy, the dividend being the cornerstone. We are looking forward to the opportunity of restarting the dividend program. But as we have said, and I think, we have been consistent about the idea that we really want to see a steady return to operational cash flow, understanding what those cash flow levels are from a trajectory, and call it, a sensitivity scenario perspective and then make an assessment about the profit return of capital at that time. We really view the dividend as something that needs to return on a stable and long-term basis. And so that\u2019s something that we will look to do when our cash flows return and we get out of pandemic operations, which unfortunately, during this quarter we were still in. Joe Greff : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe the gentleman from Macao can chime in on my follow-up question. Just a clarification on the draft bill on the amendments to the gaming law. Can you talk about how the government is thinking about you and others in the market maintaining specific levels of gross gaming revenues in order to maintain your table count? Can you talk about how they are broadly or specifically thinking how this will work and what the broad framework is here? And that\u2019s it for me? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Grant, you there? Grant Chum : Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I think the amendment to the gaming is still work in progress. It\u2019s working its way through the legislature. We need to wait further details in terms of the final form that the amendments would take and there will be additional regulatory measures that will be potentially issued thereafter. So, in general, to your question, we have always efficiently used our table allocation, and in general, we welcome the direction of linking table allocation with productivity, but specifics, I think, are yet to be outlined. Joe Greff : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Hi, Carlo. Carlo Santarelli : Rob, maybe if you could kind of shine some light, I know Singapore, obviously, it was kind of a tale of a couple of months. But as you have seen things starting to normalize over the course of the period, could you comment a little bit about how you felt during the better periods of the quarter as it pertains to restrictions and stuff like that when some of them were more loose? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. We were very excited to see when there\u2019s rays of light and you can get in and the VTL is established, it was extraordinary. And I think it indicates -- it\u2019s a real predictor, Carlo, what\u2019s going to happen. That place opens back up. Hopefully, we see it in the first half of the year. Clearly, demand is going to be there. The VTL -- the government\u2019s thinking is very positive for us. I think Singapore probably gets there quicker than I think Macao might be later. But citing Singapore, the demand is clearly evident when the VTLs were open. It\u2019s a shame. I think we had a real - a positive momentum going that got crushed by the Omicron concerns. But I think that\u2019s just inevitable. The market is around us. I mean the important source markets are opening up, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, all improving. So we have a lot of hope to see a big bounce in Singapore. I would like to reference we had some non-recurring income in that quarter you should be aware of. Patrick, can you illuminate, just we are clear on the numbers on the\u2026 Patrick Dumont : Yeah. Sure. Happy to do it. So\u2026 Rob Goldstein : \u2026Singapore, of course? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. Of course, happy to do it. And Carlo, thanks for the question. One thing we did want to highlight is that we were positively impacted by approximately $70 million of non-recurring items during this quarter, including bonus reversals, job support scheme and some other items. So I wouldn\u2019t look at this as a run rate quarter. I think I would point you back to some of the comments that Rob made on some of our prior calls about that run rate envelope during these conditions, call it, the $500 million run rate EBITDA context. The real problem is things have kind of been switched on and switched off so much. It\u2019s hard to get a real read on the quarter. I think what is really encouraging is the vaccine travel lanes, the public health posture of the government, which really has been a leader in both vaccinations and the way they approach public health. And we are very encouraged about their approach towards long-term tourism and we are very excited to see how that plays out in the upcoming quarters. But I think, overall, the vaccine travel lanes were a big step. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Patrick, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And just one point of clarity, that $70 million, was that all in the EBITDA result for the quarter? Patrick Dumont : It was. It was. That\u2019s why I referred back to the run rate that we talked about previously. Carlo Santarelli : Yeah. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : We\u2026 Carlo Santarelli : Thank you, Pat. Rob Goldstein : We have referenced $0.5 billion run rate until things get better over there. Until these travelings become real, we are still in the same range as our point not to get over exuberant about the $170 that it was. It is impacted by non-recurring? Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Thank you, guys. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about, you have said for a while you are evaluating online gaming and sports betting options and there\u2019s been a little bit of a change in valuation over the last year. Can you talk a little bit about how kind of what your current thoughts are and how that may be impacted by changing valuations? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. I think we have said in the past, we have always been interested in digital and all these interests that\u2019s happening in the market. But two things are happening at the same time. Our business, I think, is coming back to a stronger place. I think 2022 finally, especially in Singapore, and I think, as well in Macao, we will see that getting better. Our balance sheet speaks for itself and we have all followed what\u2019s happening in digital equities and the struggle there. So I believe there will be a day when sports betting and online gaming are very successful businesses and we will continue to look at the opportunity. We will wait patiently. It hasn\u2019t been a bad idea to wait for the last six months to eight months to see how this shakes out and there\u2019s done a lot of blood spill. But I think we will continue to evaluate is there an entry point that makes sense for LVS. We remain consistent, Robin, as you know and you have known for years, our bread and butter is still going to be Asia land-based as we will make -- we can\u2019t replicate a $5 billion business, which we think will come back in place in next year or so. So that\u2019s our first order of business and making sure our balance sheet is pristine, which now will be following the closing. But we will continue to monitor as the difficulties continue, the equity markets and the valuations change. The question is when does that situation get better? And I think it will and is an entry point for us and we will keep our eyes and ears open for that possibility. But waiting hasn\u2019t been the worst idea to see things shake out. Robin Farley : Yeah. Definitely not. Also a follow-up question is, can you remind us what your kind of latest thinking is on the size of the investment when you go to re-bid for the new license term? At times, you talked about things in the past, obviously, you are looking forward to investing more in Macao. Can you kind of remind us what your latest thoughts are on the size of that? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : I am not sure I understand. Patrick, I may have been missing it. I don\u2019t think we have a -- I mean we continue to be very bullish on Macao market despite the last 24 difficult months. We like what we are seeing, the retendering process. We are respectful of the process. We are continuing to help and be involved with the government. I don\u2019t think we have a dollar amount in mind or a specific approach at this time. Patrick or Grant, do you want to chime in? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I will just say one comment and then I will turn it over to Grant. But I think the important thing to note, it\u2019s still very early stages yet. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any details that we can really talk about in terms of our approach, because it\u2019s not known sort of where things are going to shake out. Grant, I don\u2019t know if you have any other comments that you want to add. Grant Chum : No. I think that\u2019s right. I think we just reiterate our general approach, which is continued reinvestment in our asset base and it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves we are coming to the end of our $2.3 billion CapEx program in Grand Suites at Four Seasons and The Londoner Macao. And we have really stayed the course during the pandemic. We have accelerated the works where we can, we have overcome all the challenges related to supply chain during this pandemic and we are coming well within budget. And we are delighted with the outcome. So I think that gives you a pretty good indicator both of our appetite, but also of our resolve to continue to reinvest, in particular, in the direction that the government is pointing towards across the various domains of diversification. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Robin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. I guess two follow-ups. And the first is really a follow-up on Robin\u2019s question and Joe\u2019s earlier question on the legislative proposal. You mentioned it is still a work in progress, obviously, but I am wondering if you could just walk us through where you feel like you do have incremental clarity and where specifically there may still be pockets of uncertainty based on the language and your conversations. Rob Goldstein : Grant, that\u2019s yours. Grant Chum : Thank you for the question. I think the main -- the key aspects of the legislation have been laid out in terms of the number of concessionaires and the duration of the future concession. But there are a lot of details in that to be worked out through the legislature. We just encapsulated one through the first meeting with the legislative, but firmly and we are now moving to the winning stage. So I think we can say at this point that it is still in draft form, but we really welcome the progress that\u2019s been made. So issue in so rapidly since the launch of the first public observation in September, it\u2019s only been a short 12 months since that time and we are already at this stage where we are going into the committee review of the draft. So I think the government has done an outstanding job in getting us to this stage of the process so quickly with a lot of framework being clarified. But it is important to remember that this is still draft legislation and we await the final outcome, hopefully, in the coming months. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. Maybe as an unrelated follow-up here, you continue to have impressive cost control despite a pretty difficult environment. How are you thinking about margins and labor inflation in Macao, as well as Singapore as we think about ultimate recovery versus maybe some of the cost reductions you have made? Patrick Dumont : So, hey, it\u2019s Patrick. It\u2019s something that we look at a lot with our team. And I think one of the focuses that we had during this pandemic over the last really two years has been to keep the core team together. So when we do recover, we have the ability to service our customers and get right back to business. And I think it\u2019s to credit to Grant, to the team in Singapore and really to everyone at the local teams that we are able to keep the group together, continue to focus, continue working and keep everyone healthy and safe. And I think where we are today, as we look about -- look at margins upon the recovery, we were in a pretty efficient business both at Sands China and in Singapore prior to the pandemic. If you look at our margins in the years leading up to the pandemic, Sands China team did an unbelievable job taking a lot of costs out of the business and becoming more efficient as we grew our business there. And so I think if you look over a series of years, we have always been cost focused. I don\u2019t want to say that there was really room in the prior operating level. What is true is that I\u2019d like to believe that the run rate margins for the business will be consistent with those margins prior to the pandemic. The one thing to note is that in Singapore, there is going to be a tax rate change, which will impact -- a gaming tax rate will impact margins at Marina Bay Sands when that happens. There will be some slight margin impact from that going forward. But as a practical matter, we would expect to have the same margins given the same level of volumes even taking into account mix. Because if you recall in Macao, our exposure to lower margin business such as junket and VIP is less, we are more premium mass focused. So we would like to believe our margin structure will be fairly consistent upon the recovery. Stephen Grambling : Helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey. Thanks. Can you just talk about potential future investments? I know that you have been looking at Florida and New York, any comments on those markets? And then when announced the project in UAE yesterday, have you considered that market? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : I will take the U.S. and I will leave Patrick to discuss the UAE. Tom, as you know, we have been for years talking about -- maybe four-year time it\u2019s been so long. New York, we are big believers in that market. The recent announcement by Governor Hochul about three licenses is encouraging. We are in the hunt. I wouldn\u2019t want to overplay our hand, so we have -- what opportunity it might be. But it\u2019s a massive market underserved by the current product and by any metric that should be a massive market for us. So we are deep into it. We were there last week. We have a team on the ground working through it and we are hoping to get a license. That\u2019s all I will say about that. You have followed in the newspapers our efforts in Florida. We are in a signature gathering mode. It\u2019s a struggle down there. It\u2019s not an easy process to go through. But we are trying very much to be in the hunt in Florida. We really appreciate how underserved that market is and the material opportunities exist for a top-tier land-based opportunity in Florida would be wonderful. Same goes for Texas, all Texas a few years away from it. We have been down there. We have spent time in the market. We have people trying to find our place in that market if it does happen, but I think that\u2019s probably the farthest away from the decision. Patrick, do you want to address the Wynn [ph] that you raised the UAE, what happened over there yesterday? Patrick Dumont : Sure. Happy to. So a couple of thoughts. First off, as someone who\u2019s in the tourism business, our company is very focused on looking at markets, evaluating them and what different markets present in terms of both competition and things that customers like. And I would tell you, if you go to UAE and you go to -- and you see the investments that are going on there, it\u2019s really remarkable. The scale of investment, the quality of the investment is really unique to the world. It\u2019s a very special place. And I understand why Wynn would have interest going there. It is a tremendous tourism market, has a lot of potential. And to be fair, it is an economic center for that region. So in terms of opportunity, we all understood why there would be interest there for them to go. So it\u2019s something that we will continue to watch and look at. But there are a lot of high quality markets that are available to our company, Rob just referenced a few. And we are going to keep all of our options open and continue looking for opportunities for Las Vegas Sands to deploy capital in high quality developments. So that\u2019s really sort of our view on that situation. Thomas Allen : Perfect. Thank you, Pat. And then just on the MBS $1 billion renovation. It\u2019s something you guys have been talking about for a long time, but you just added it to your slide deck this quarter. Is that just because now it\u2019s ready, any more details on the potential disruption or time line? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Well, it\u2019s a step that it\u2019s moving forward. I think the point we talked about a long time, Thomas, we have underinvested at times in these rooms and suites are deep into the renovation. I think we all know with the COVID environment. You always have the risk of either labor or supply chain risk. But we are moving nicely and the team, we have not been there, so I can\u2019t say we have seen it. But the images we see are very positive and I think it\u2019s moving at a really good pace assuming that there\u2019s no interruptions we can\u2019t control. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : So, I think, what\u2019s interesting about it and you have heard Rob reference it before, and I think our team is very focused on using this time to the pandemic to enhance our product offerings and our attractiveness to our customers. And we have always been working with the Singapore Tourism Board to help achieve their goals while we invest. And I think there\u2019s been a focus in Singapore over the last few years on increasing high quality tourism and we believe the MBS is a leader in that area. We wanted to reinvest in the property to really enhance our suite of products and some of the other amenities that we have for our customers while we have some downtime. And so this is something that we have been looking at for many years. We have a high quality design team that will really create some of the best suites we have ever had in our system. We have had some great success with some of our efforts in Macao and some renovations with some of the new products we brought online during the pandemic and so we feel like our design level is really at a high level now and we are really looking forward to investing this amount of capital into Marina Bay Sands to create a level of suite product we never had there before, both in terms of account and in terms of quality. So this will address some of the goals that have been laid out by the Singapore Tourism Board and the government there, as well as help us address and grow our business in high value tourism. So that\u2019s really the objective. It\u2019s something that will happen really over the next two years. We are underway now and we hope to be complete as soon as possible. But in reality due to the labor and materials it looks like it\u2019s going to take two years. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one, because it actually hasn\u2019t come up, I guess, it\u2019s a sign of the times really that, I was just wondering from either Grant or Wilfred if we could get a little color. Just on the COVID conditions and signaling on the ground in terms of possible reopening milestones you might be looking for? I believe there was actually a little bit of press from the government talking about the tourism industry and its importance. So maybe just a couple of your high level thoughts about things we can look forward to there? Grant Chum : Sure. Thanks for the question, Shaun. I think in the last few months, if you could describe it sequentially, we have come through some local cases on COVID that occurred in Macao at the end of September to early October. So obviously, the business environment was heavily impacted during the month of October. In fact, that was the lowest month in the entire year for the GGR for the city. As we move toward the end of the year, things improved in terms of the travel board policies around Zhuhai and Macao and then you saw the business volumes and visitations recouped accordingly. Most recently, we have had some local cases in Zhuhai, which has impacted the border again, and hopefully, we are going to be coming through the other side of that as they get that under control and as they have done. So I would describe it as not a lot has changed in terms of the overall environment. The government, both central government and local government continue to control the COVID cases exceptionally well in accordance with their policies. And as we move forward, we obviously have the Chinese New Year and also the Winter Olympics. And understandably, everyone is being more cautious in terms of traveling, and obviously, it\u2019s possible that beyond these events, as things improve in terms of the domestic cases in the various provinces and these big events are out of the way, we can look forward to a more positive picture in terms of travel. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you. And then, just one probably for Patrick. But Patrick, you mentioned the Singapore tax rate. I think we picked that up in some of the local press as well. Just I was curious if you could give us a little bit more color on how that plays through. Is this the change that was actually tied back to the license extension or is this something that\u2019s incremental or different from that, because I think there was a tie-in to that, if I recall correctly, but it\u2019s -- frankly, it\u2019s been a couple of years? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. It\u2019s just been a couple of years. This is the implementation of what was tied into the development agreements. So nothing has changed consistent with prior disclosure or prior discussions. But I just wanted to highlight it as something that may have an impact on margins going forward. That\u2019s all. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Dan Politzer : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So a quick follow-up on just the sports betting and i-gaming endeavors or analysis that you are doing. Have you given any thought or consideration to opportunities that would involve markets outside the U.S., such as Europe, are you really just focused on U.S. sports betting at this point? Rob Goldstein : We consider all markets, yeah. We have markets that are on the table. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I think one thing to highlight\u2026 Dan Politzer : Okay. And just... Patrick Dumont : Yeah. Sorry. One thing to highlight. So I think we are not just looking at sports betting. I think we are looking at a variety of opportunities in the digital space. And to Rob\u2019s point, in a variety of different markets, but we are not rushed. So we are building teams. We are making long-term investments. We are thinking about opportunities. We are focused on return on invested capital. And we are really looking at it through the lens of a long-term strategy that can blossom into something meaningful. And so, we are not just sort of chasing certain specific areas that may have valuations that are peaked at the day. I think we are looking for long-term high growth opportunities that present really positive returns. And so it\u2019s not just in sports wagering, it\u2019s a variety of different things, we are looking at different markets. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just a clarification on the capital allocation question from earlier and as you think about a repurchase versus the dividend, I mean, do you really need to see a more sustained recovery in Macao before returning capital or is there a scenario where you get the proceeds from the Venetian sale and Singapore starts to recover and you could be more active on that front beforehand? Patrick Dumont : I think from our standpoint, we sort of view return of capital for a very long-term shareholder enhancing process. And I think for us, we are going to want to see a return in our markets with a stable level of cash flow and post-pandemic conditions, where there\u2019s operational clarity before we begin return of capital. I think it\u2019s very important for the sustainability of any dividend and a return of capital program and it\u2019s something that we hope will come soon. There\u2019s been a lot of investment in public health initiatives and a lot of things that are incrementally making progress in both of our markets, and we are hopeful that this occurs in the near-term. And so, once that happens, we will start to evaluate potential return of capital. But, again, we sort of view the proceeds from the Las Vegas sale as permitting us to develop large scale destination resorts in new jurisdictions to help grow our business. Dan Politzer : Got it. Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David, your line is open. David Katz : Just I am doing myself\u2026 Operator : David, your line is open. David Katz : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, if I may, follow-up on two of the details from earlier where you talked about the $70 million and that sounds like it\u2019s in the EBITDA line. Is that solely in Macao, is that spread, does that include Singapore\u2026 Rob Goldstein : It\u2019s just Singapore. David Katz : \u2026and it just, Rob, with respect to the $500 million run rate, which is Macao, that is excluding what may or may not have occurred with respect to Omicron in January, correct? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. I think, Dave, we mentioned apples and oranges [ph]. I think, first of all, the $70 million Patrick referenced was solely at MBS. And my $0.5 billion reference was on previous calls, I said, I think, the current situation which runs up and down every day. We -- I think in Singapore today is $0.5 billion EBITDA annual run rate until we get further VTL and stabilization. My point is I want to -- as you are aware, we are running that same $0.5 billion. We have a lot of optimism that that will change in 2022, perhaps, first half. But that\u2019s all Singapore related, the one-time non-recurring and that $500 million was referred to Singapore as well. We are not making any -- it\u2019s impossible in Macao to rationally predict anything until the government makes decisions on the visitation. It would be silly for us to speculate something that\u2019s so speculative. We have no underpinning of fact. I think once, look, we believe that market will explode when it opens back up again. But I think it\u2019s more of the second half of the year, but then again, who\u2019s to know? So we are not making any speculative decisions on a run rate in Macao. David Katz : Understood. If I can just follow-up very quickly, with respect to the makeup of business in Macao, not looking for a guide or a range, but any insight around\u2026 Rob Goldstein : Yeah. David Katz : \u2026 how VIP business, which may go away, could be recaptured through premium mass? Any tools or thoughts and perspectives to help us think about what portion of that would be really helpful? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. I will just give you my quick look, and I want Grant to opine as well. I think we all believe that the junket -- having done this for many years in Macao, in the U.S., these customers in that segment are going to just disappear and when they read the other junket businesses not happening. Therefore, demand will go away. It\u2019s not going to go away. It will just resurrect in different segments and find new ways of materializing in the casino and it always is that way in any business. It goes back to any segment doesn\u2019t necessarily just go away, because the mechanism goes away. It just evolves to a different segmentation. So we are pretty bullish that a business that was yielding 8%, 10% could be much more positively profitable as a resurrection of the segments and so that\u2019s my take. I think any belief that the junket business segment is only just not thoughtful. Grant, do you want to add? Grant Chum : Sure. Yeah. I think, Rob, has just spot on on that, because you have to distinguish between the end demand and the distribution of it. So, I think, clearly, some portion of the end demand and we are not going to get drawn into exactly what the proportion will shift into the other segments and that\u2019s just natural because the end demand is there. Now, will some portion of it also dissipate and disappear. Sure, but that\u2019s probably the portion that was not in the first place, that\u2019s sustainable in any event. So I think the core underlying end demand that will find its way through other segments over time and we should distinguish between the end customer as opposed to the distribution system. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation today.

[Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, Paul. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining are Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. We have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in Asia. Some brief comments, and we'll go to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemics impact, the travel restrictions to press visitation, our financial results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in Singapore and for the company in total. The [business] in Singapore as the travel corridors established last quarter have been replaced with an introduction of the backdated traveler framework, which allows backdate travelers to enter Singapore in much the same way as prior to the pandemic. In short term, as we are open for business in Singapore.  Our conviction and long-term opportunity in the Singapore market remains steadfast. The $1 billion capital investment currently underway at MBS introduced luxurious new suite product and amenities that disorder. In Macao, our considerable investment Londoner are nearing completion. As the market recovers 4 Seasons, Londoner will provide growth opportunities in both premium and mass customer segments. We continue to have the largest footprint in the Macao marketplace, and we appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process, and we look forward to participating in the retendering process as well. While the current quarter results in Macao were impacted severely by the enhanced travel restrictions in China, customer demand and spending Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective in periods when the restrictions have been relaxed. We remain confident that we return to positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. We consider our portfolio of resorts in Asia to be outstanding the platform for growth for the years ahead.  In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop large-scale resorts in both the United States and Asia. The sale of Las Vegas was completed this quarter, which creates additional liquidity and optionality. Lastly, we can build out our digital presence and to explore multiple opportunities. We will provide additional color at the appropriate time. Let's go to your questions. Daniel Briggs : Paul, we're ready to go to questions. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Joe Greff from JP Morgan. Joe Greff : Rob, I love to get a little bit more detail on the recent experience in Singapore with the VTL framework? And can you tell us or share with us business volumes, visitation improvements in March and April to date? And when we kind of look at the first quarter and looking at the $121 million of hold normalized EBITDA. How much of that was sort of the last month of the quarter, given the benefits from more international inbound tourism? RobGoldstein: Yes. Joe, it\u2019s a fair question. The core to MBS was clearly driven, it moved upward as you went along. I started $17 million in January, went to $46 million in the hours of February. We had $58 million of EBITDA in March. And that trajectory is continuing the momentum is going upward in April. I think \u2013 look, Singapore is back, and it will experience the same post-COVID numbers as you see in the U.S., in my opinion. The question is how fast does it get there? The demand is there. It will continue. Assuming there\u2019s no more surprises from the COVID situation. We like to think that Singapore returned to $1 billion run rate in this year. So $58 million in March feels pretty good, and that momentum is continuing. Joe Greff : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And hopefully, I\u2019m not going to follow up Macao-related question but is much to ask. Can you talk about Thailand and sort of that as an integrated resort opportunity and what the latest is there? I know there have been press reports with your efforts and that as an opportunity. RobGoldstein: Yes, I think it\u2019s premature, Joe, and we\u2019re looking at a lot of different things in Asia, and that\u2019s certainly a list of things, but I think it\u2019s premature to get ahead of ourselves there. I\u2019ll pass on that. Operator : And the next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Maybe sticking with new development opportunities. There's obviously been a lot of back and forth in New York, specifically New York City, different boroughs, you've been seeing some headlines around Times Square. Just curious what you're seeing there, how we should think about that as an opportunity? RobGoldstein: Well, New York has been on our radar for a long time. We continue to be in the hunt there. I don't want to get into static borrowers locations. I think that's proprietary. But we remain interested. I think it's a huge market for us. We've been very clear about that in the past. The process is quite a long way to go. And we'll just keep you posted as we hear and learn things, but we're in the hunt and we'll see how it works out for us. Stephen Grambling : And then you did mention you'll discuss digital when the time is right and they obviously say patience is a virtue, which is clearly paid off looking at some of these stocks. So as you think about the opportunity set in front of you, has anything changed in terms of your thinking of what areas of the industry might be more or less interesting to dig into even before considering where the investment might end up? Patrick Dumont : So it's Patrick. So I think nothing has really changed in our view. We take a very long-term perspective on digital. I think our comments have been pretty consistent across the quarters. We're really in a growth and investment stage. So it's very early on, and we have something to talk about, we'll definitely start discussing it. But at this point, it's a very early stage. We're building a team and looking forward to the future. Stephen Grambling : Awesome. Maybe one last one if I can sneak it in then. So since the development opportunities feel like they're still pushed out and you've gotten some proceeds in from Vegas. I think you maybe have mentioned this in the remarks, but just remind us in terms of thinking about capital allocation priorities. I mean is buyback something that's on the table that you'd be thinking about with some of those proceeds? Or do you feel like there's enough other things to spend the money on the near term? Patrick Dumont : No problem. This is a question that I think we get pretty often. I'll refer to the answers that we gave in our last quarterly call. But I think the key thing to take away is we're very focused on new development. The sale of Las Vegas was really to reinvest capital in high growth opportunities that we think are unique to our company. We feel very strongly about our development capabilities and our ability to execute large-scale developments in new markets. And we think there's a lot of them out there, a lot of potential. And so we're waiting to see this 1 come forward. And as Rob said, where we can invest to get the highest returns. In terms of return of capital, I think we've always said that the dividend is really the cornerstone of our turn capital program. It's something that we want to look at in terms of really long-term operational cash flow growth, and then we'll size it accordingly and look to that to recur before we actually start the dividend again.  In terms of share repurchases, we've always said we've been opportunistic to return capital that way as well. If you look at our past, we've actually returned a fair amount of capital through share versus when we felt that we had the excess liquidity. So I think at this point, our priority is to make sure we get out of the pandemic, make sure we have ample liquidity and a protected balance sheet to ensure that we recover from our pandemic operations. We can support a local host market, support our team members as we go through that process. Then we're going to focus on new development and growth and investment in our existing markets, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic and then we'll look to restart the dividend as operating cash flows recover. And then lastly, I think we'll look at share repurchases where the opportunities arise. RobGoldstein: Let's not forget that we are investing $1 billion currently in Singapore. We're trying to invest more in Singapore. And we think Macao when things reopen might be opportunistic as well. People forget how much capital we could put to work in our existing marketplaces. Operator : And the next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Just maybe to actually touch on Macao for a minute. Rob, there have been some different starts as it relates to the reopening in Hong Kong, and I think some positive progress there as case counts have come down. Any signposts maybe out of that market and maybe reconnecting that with Macao that the local team could give us some color on? RobGoldstein: Sure. Grant, do you on the call? Grant Chum : Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. I mean at this stage, there is no new information or news in terms of quarantine-free travel from Hong Kong to Macao. I think Hong Kong cases have been improved. But we're not at the point where there's any change in the quarantine policy. Shaun Kelley : Grant, maybe just to clarify, is that specifically as it relates to its interaction with Macao? Or what about for visitors coming from overseas possibly opening up a corridor to Singapore? So maybe help us think a little bit more broadly, if you could? Grant Chum : I'm sorry, are you referring to overseas visitors from [indiscernible] Shaun Kelley : Yes. Either, I think arriving in Hong Kong and then, I guess, coming in from inbound places or leaving Hong Kong going to places like Singapore. Grant Chum : Sorry, you're asking a question about people going to Singapore or to Macao? Shaun Kelley : Well, specifically talking about -- just is there any sign that Hong Kong is loosening of its overall visitation policy because it's been pretty closed from the external perspective. I guess that's where I'm trying to go. Grant Chum : Sorry, I'd be asking about Hong Kong. Yes, they have relaxed. So non-residents can now travel to Hong Kong from the 1st of May and that was -- that hasn't been possible for some time. So you can go to Hong Kong from next month overseas into Hong Kong, but you would still have to be subject to the quarantine policy once you enter Hong Kong. RobGoldstein: Something more to say, Glen, I'm going to cut you off, more to say? Grant Chum : No, that's it. That Okay. Operator : Next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley : I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Singapore and any change in the composition of business there in terms of what's coming back? Is it more mass? Is it more VIP? Is it higher win per visitor than what you saw before or just more absolute number of visitors. Just kind of what are you seeing sort of come back first? RobGoldstein: The answer is yes. It's all coming back. I mean it's demand over there for -- in the month of March, we saw outsized demand from free independent travelers on the pure leisure side, we saw premium mass. We saw high-end plate coming out of over the relm. I just think Singapore is a unique position. It's -- obviously, in Macao is in a difficult place right now, so people are going to gravitate to other opportunities. They want to travel. They're no different than what we've seen here in the U.S. I think our MBS products as a very, very unique opportunistic window here. We're hoping Macao's up obviously sooner. But until it does, I think you'll see a lot more demand than typical. I think it's from all segments, the team there is being very good about what happened in the month of March. And again, it's leisure travel, it's casino, it's is VIP casino, it's premium mass as casino. It's universal. And it feels like renewal very positive beginning. And hopefully, without a COVID interruption or a change in policy, I believe MBS is going to be very productive '22. Robin Farley : Great. And then my follow-up question is about you had an announcement a week or 2 ago about it's probably a small investment, and I think it was sort of an integrity-related business for online sports betting. And I wonder if you could just talk about that because it seems like there are some B2B online sports companies that already sort of provide that kind of for free as part of their services between the leagues and the sports books. And so I just -- I wonder if you could talk about what interested you in that angle or what's different about that? And kind of what's offered almost for free really by the other OSB B2B providers? Patrick Dumont : Sure. It's Patrick. And I think what you'll see over time is us make investments in small companies where we think they have a competitive advantage in the B2B space that has a lot of growth potential and also where we think over time we may form it to a larger platform. So from our standpoint, we're looking at a variety different businesses that are in start off or early stage in order to make sure that we stay in front of technological innovation in our industry. And so this is part of a broader strategy. It is a relatively small investment relative to Las Vegas and -- we think over time, this investment in others will help contribute to our overall digital efforts. So I'm not going to get into the exact thesis behind every investment that we do. There's a long-term plan for what we're approaching. And I think over time, you'll start to see how that evolves. Operator : And the next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : I just have 2 kind of time line-related questions. And I don't know, Rob, maybe answer the first and then perhaps something on color on Macao and the time line there. But just in terms of MBS, obviously, construction and things along those lines in this type of environment is very hard to predict. And I have not gotten a chance to get through the slides yet to see if there any changes to kind of your expectations for the time line there. But what are some of the goalposts in terms of construction on that? And then secondarily, as it pertains to the tender process and whatnot in Macao. How do you guys see the time line for that shaping up as we move through the rest of 2022? RobGoldstein: Carl, in Singapore, as you know, we're underway in a rather extensive renovation, $1 billion-plus renovation in Singapore that's underway as we speak. And it's going to take a while. It won't complete until the '23 but it's going to be a very encompassing. We've had -- as everyone in the world has been impacted by COVID, both getting supplies and labor has been issued, but it's happy it's underway. We're still working through our issues with IR too. We were not ready to talk about that today because we're still working through issues there. Same issues supplies, labor costs, et cetera. We intend to complete IR 1, again, '23 IR2 is token for interpretation. As for Macao time lines and the retendering, I'm going to turn it over to Wilfred or Grant to take that question. Maybe Wilfred, the best suited. Wilfred Wong : Thank you. The time line for retendering of the concession is progressing according to the time line announced by the Macao SAR government. Now currently, a few things are at play, 2 bills relating to the gaming law is -- has been approved by the legislative assembly and will be approved in full after the panel discussion before the end of this legislative session in August. And we are hearing all kinds of suggestion that it will be earlier than August. At this stage, we are going to be granted an extension of the current concession until the end of 2022. And that is the time that we expect the retendering exercise will be completed. And so after the amendment of the law, then the retendering procedure will start a lot of information about the retender will come out. We are in the process of preparing for that retendering exercise and hopefully, everything will be done before the end of 2022. Carlo Santarelli : That's helpful. So just so I'm clear, in August, you'll more or less have everything you need from the gaming law perspective? And then that period from, say, August, if not maybe earlier through December will be the formal tendering process when everything is more or less buttoned up. Is that the right interpretation? Wilfred Wong : That's right. Operator : The next question is coming from George Choi from Citigroup. George? George Choi : A couple of questions from me. Firstly, Macao. The Macao Corp has recently ruled that a couple of your competitors are joining and separately liable for some illegal deposits for I guess, how do you see the likelihood that you guys will also be found liable for this potential liability after the recent close down of the major changes there? RobGoldstein: Grant, do you want to handle that? Grant Chum : Sure. Thanks, Josh, for the question. I think, as you know, the cessation of operations of all of these fixed-room junket promoters, obviously happened fairly recently in December of last year. And as a result of that, obviously, there are some new court cases being raised by various stakeholders and participants in that system. Currently, there is nothing material to report from Sands China perspective. There are a few cases ongoing, but none of them are material, and we will continue to monitor the situation and obviously report back if there any changes. George Choi : And my second question is on your balance sheet. Now clearly, the first quarter was quite difficult for your Macao operations is putting a lot of stress on your balance Sands China. When it gets to a point where Sands China needs to raise funds, could you guys consider equity as option or is because of that still cheap enough that you would continue to look to response from the decapital market? RobGoldstein: Patrick? Patrick Dumont : It's Patrick. So a couple of thoughts here. I think we're very optimistic about the long-term future of Macao. We understand there's articles out about concerns around liquidity. I think we have a very strong balance sheet. Yes, we've received some stress over the last few years under the pandemics tough operating conditions, I think we all have. But the good news is that our company as a group has a lot of liquidity a lot of different options. I think the good news is also that we were an investment-grade company during the pandemic, which does a lot about the market's view about our ability to raise additional capital. So from our standpoint, I think we have a lot of flexibility.  Our balance sheet was designed to withstand shocks and a lot of variability in our respective operating markets. I think we've proven that. And I think where we are today is we'll look to see how the operations continue coming out of the pandemic, which hopefully soon, look at our liquidity to review. I think we have cash of the parent, we have cash around the system. We have an investment-grade credit rating. We have access to credit markets. And I think the good news is we position ourselves well to benefit from the recovery on the other side. So I think we have a lot of flexibility, and we'll use it as net Operator : Next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad Beynon : I wanted to ask about inflation. I know it's obviously something that people are a little bit more focused on here in North America and it's different in different regions of the world. But wondering if you could kind of talk about the labor inflationary environment or employment situation in your key markets, Singapore and Macao? And how that could potentially impact margins when the business is fully recovered on the revenue side? RobGoldstein: I don't want to say one thing about our business. Obviously, margin is inflation. It's a question we're anticipating. But I would say that I believe the revenue side of the equation is going to more than take care of itself as far as margins. We're going to be really -- I'd be shocked if will see a big return in Singapore this year and then hopefully a big return in Macao in '23, hopefully, maybe '22, I don't know. We don't have any visibility more than you do about what's going to happen in China, to be clear. But I do think, just like here in the U.S., margins have gone very powerfully positive because the demand is there. I only think Asians are different. The equation is going to be driven by excessive revenue, I think, in Singapore, we'll see it this year, I believe, and hopefully see in Macao this year or next. As for the operating entities, Grant discussed as you see as far as Macao, for example, in wage inflation, I don't know how to address that question. Grant Chum : Sure, Rob. I think right now, Macao is a slightly different situation. If you look at the wage trend, it's very moderate, if not flattish in terms of wage inflation. But obviously, that's for reasons that are not hard to discern because there is pressure on unemployment since it's such a tourism-dependent economy. And then interestingly, in terms of construction works costs are, again, either in line with prior years or if not going down somewhat, again, because of the demand supply situation that's specific to Macao as a lot of large scale works have moderated, they being completed. So at this stage, we're not seeing any significant signs on the inflation front.  Of course, there are some supplies such as food and so on, where we do experience inflation, but obviously, thoughtful for the totality of our business, this is not going to be material. But I think the important point is what Rob said, I think you also have to consider for our type of business, the revenue side of the equation, which I think is going to be the more dominant driver. -- is obviously prices tick off Patrick Dumont : And just to sort of 1 other thought. I think -- the important thing to note is where you'll see the impact of inflation is really in construction costs and in materials that go into construction inputs for large-scale projects. You see that in the U.S., you'll see it in Singapore and you'll start to see in other markets in Asia. As people come out of the pandemic and really there's a pent-up demand pipeline of things that needed to get done as well as a shortage of labor and a shortage of labor movement related to pandemic restrictions. So that is something that is a likely thing to be seen, you're already experiencing a little bit of it in certain markets. I think the other thing is, the good news is that inflation also comes pricing. And so our business is not tied into any long-term contracts. We have the ability to operate within the market. Singapore has always been a very high quality place for labor. It's been an expensive labor market. It's always been very tight, and we've always managed it. So I have faith in the team take on our execution capability to maintain margins through the cycle. And I think that's really the nature of our business that we have pricing power. We have the ability to change rates as a hotel as a consumer products company and really work through the changing inflation and in effect, make that part of the business margin. Chad Beynon : And then separately, just on -- kind of back on the digital portfolio opportunities that you talked about just given the current valuation change that we've seen in a lot of the public companies, has anything changed just in terms of the total amount of money that you want to invest in this space given that there might be some really good opportunities in the near term just because of a valuation disconnect? Or are you still kind of disciplined in terms of the total amount that you would put forward towards this effort? RobGoldstein: I believe we have to be disciplined. And the reason I say that is our core business, and let's be honest, our balance sheet is what it is. It's in a pretty good place. If our business returns in Singapore, like we anticipate, -- and then behind that comes to Macao, we get back to $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion EBITDA. Our investment portfolio approach may change as it relates to digital. But at this time, we're going to stay doing what we're doing now, which is being very disciplined waiting for our core business return because there's no 1 like us. If the Macao comes back and I think it will be back hopefully sooner than later, Singapore is coming back, we'll be in a very different place in 6 months or a year and that may change our thinking. I think it's pretty simple. We want to get back to our core strength and then we visit other things at that time. Patrick Dumont : And I think 1 other thing that's important to note is we're very much focused on building rather than buying. We want to make sure that we create a lot of long-term value. Our company has a history of being a platform of development in entrepreneurship, and we are taking that approach through our digital efforts in several different areas. And we think over time, that will provide the most reward for shareholders. So we're very patient. We're thinking long term. And yes, there are cycles in valuations across the digital space. In our mind, we'll execute against our long-term strategy and take advantage where we can. Operator : The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : With respect to the U.S. land-based opportunities that's out there. If you sort of have your druthers or how your wishes come to pass, what does the LVS U.S. land-based presence look like over time? RobGoldstein: Any place there's very large-scale buildings that can create large EBITDA. We're not looking to be a small regional player obviously. So that limits the opportunities doesn't to Texas, New York. We failed in Florida recently, but we're not done with Florida. We're still looking at that. And there thereaf places we can go and invest the kind of money on investment, the kind of returns we want, we're not going to be buying small businesses. So I think at this point, as you talk to you today, it would have to be Texas, New York and perhaps Florida. Operator : And the next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : Just 1 question for me. Rob, you talked about getting to that $1 billion EBITDA run rate in Singapore by potentially by the end of the year. And I'm not sure you're going to answer this. But is it fair to say that March and maybe more so April on a monthly run rate basis is enough to get you to that $1 billion run rate level? And I'm just really trying to understand a little more how strong recent trends have been? RobGoldstein: Yes. Well, I guess, looking at March, you're at about $700 million run rate if you take you annualize March, and April looks better at this point. So I don't think it takes a lot to get there. I mean, to be honest, I don't know why we wouldn't get there. We won't get into specific numbers in April, but the trending Singapore, as I referenced earlier, Robin, someone asked the question about what's happening it's outsized demand in all segments. So why wouldn't it happen? I mean I think it's going to blow past the $1 billion, frankly, I think it should. It just depends on if we see any pushback COVID restrictions. I mean we have an outsized opportunity.  Singapore is the best product at all in the market today. Macao essentially is not available. I think we compete very well anyway in Singapore, but it's unique now. And I think it's -- it should at $1 billion and better. The only negative there, as you well know, is China is still relatively close to us. So that's the market we'll miss but we feel very confident about our prospects. In the last month, things have gone from hesitancy to full-bore excitement about what's happening in Singapore. And I think the government -- I think I hope they show our enthusiasm. Operator : And the final question is coming from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. Ben Chaiken : I guess just 2 or 3 follow-ups on Singapore. You mentioned $58 million in March. Can you remind me, is that -- I believe there was some tax changes coming into play, I guess, simplistically, VIP and mass each go up roughly 300 basis points. Is that -- was that in March already in the numbers you mentioned? RobGoldstein: Yes, it was as of March 1, that was - were impacted as of March 1 by the changes you referenced, yes. David Katz : Cool. And then two, I think in the last few days, there's been some changes in Singapore regarding travel restrictions -- can you remind us maybe -- can you just refresh us where we are today versus where we were in March? RobGoldstein: Where we are today is if you're a vaccine, you can get into Singapore pretty easily. There are still restrictions and you've got to be -- if you're in the casino, you've got to be smoking or drinking water or something to I think your mask off. But pretty much, it's -- if you're a vaccinate, you have full access to Singapore. It's a very different place than it was a month ago. So that's why we're still bullish in Singapore. It basically is quarantine free entry for all vaccinated traveler. And no quote on number of daily arrivals is no more strict. So we're back in the business in Singapore in a very positive way. Ben Chaiken : Got it. And then just last quick one, not to get ahead of ourselves, but -- you mentioned $1 billion a few times. But why not, I mean you're doing $1.7 billion, right, pre-COVID and the new hotel coming, like what's -- is the billing just a round number to -- RobGoldstein: There's no new hotel coming. We're not building any hotel yet. So there's no new hotel. There's a renovation of a current hotel. Look, we just see $1 billion of benchmark. We think that's attainable. We're not trying to oversell it or over -- get too excited ahead of ourselves. Let's see where it goes. We're looking at the results in the U.S. We're very excited what's happened in the U.S. The demand is there. We've seen a reason why Asia shouldn't just keep ramping more positively. And again, as we referenced, that's a very unique asset. $1.7 billion at the peak was the performance of MBS. We get back to some time Yes, I think we will and then beyond that, but it won't be this year. Operator : There were no other questions in queue. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. So we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thank you. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures that's included in the press release. We have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments than we move to Q&A. The recovery in Singapore at MBS accelerate during the quarter with property EBITDA reaching $390 million. The relaxation of pandemic related restrictions in Singapore and many of its source markets has enabled this encouraging improvement in the financial performance at MBS. We expect the more robust recovery over time as additional airlift in the Singapore comes online and further relaxation measures in the region are implemented. Our conviction the long-term opportunity at Singapore might remain steadfast. Our $1 billion capital investment is underway at Marina Bay Sands as introduced exceptional new suite product and premium segment focused amenities the resort, more offerings will be added throughout the remainder of 2022 and '23. And this one has the properties appeal to premium customers seeking the highest level travel experiences. In addition, we look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the Singapore market as we execute our expansion plans, and Marina Bay Sands in the years ahead. Singapore remains in an outstanding market for additional investment. Let's turn to Macao. The operating environment there remains very difficult in periods when the restrictions have been lifted. The customer demand and spend in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective. As the market eventually recovers our $2.2 billion investment program at Four Seasons in London, we'll provide outstanding growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. We appreciate the clarity of the revised gaming law in June. We look forward to participating in the concession re-tendering process as it proceeds. We continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. We retain great optimism and our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels and beyond the Macao, once visitation returns. We would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional dollars in Macao. We continue to believe Macao is now outstanding market for additional investment. We can see our portfolio of resorts in Asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead and additionally continue to pursue additional other opportunities in large land base destination resorts in the U.S. and Asia. Let's go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live. Joe Greff : Hello, everybody. Robert Goldstein : Hi, Joe. Joe Greff : Love to start with Singapore here. When you look back at trends within the 2Q, which were obviously encouraging. And you look at the premium mass in the VIP segments, was there anything notable in one segment versus the other throughout the quarter? How even with the recovery month-to-month in the segments throughout the quarter other than seasonality. You talked about source markets driving improvement? What geographies are driving that improvement? And then lastly, with my multi-part, question number one here can you talk about what you've seen so far in July in the first 20 days here? thank you. Robert Goldstein : A lot of questions there, Joe. We're not going to break out the quarter. I think we'll be -- it\u2019s suffice to say we're pleased that we back in the strong position in Singapore. And the fundamental growth there comes from obviously both base and premium mass, I don't think either one outshine the other is consistent movement in the right direction. I think the biggest thing we're seeing is the airlift is opening up. And that also remains to be the -- remains to be the most challenging part of the Singapore recovery. Airlift is still a challenge. You were getting a lot of good business out of the region, especially of Indonesia, Malaysia, but I think there's a lot more opportunity as the airlift returns. And I think you'll see that in our deck, the Changi monthly visitation numbers are still relatively less than 50% of what they were at pre-pandemic. So although we're delighted with Singapore, and the numbers reflect that. We think it's really optimistic in the months ahead. Joe Greff : And great to make follow-up\u2026 Robert Goldstein : [Indiscernible] question, Joe. If you want to just keep that's where I think I heard you say, is there more to it? Joe Greff : No, I mean, I, can you just talk about what you've seen so far in July? Has that trend continued? Robert Goldstein : I think, we're not going to do that. We're not going to talk about July, I think, but I think the numbers or deck gives you a real good sense of what happened in Q2. And I, again, I think the story in Marina Bay Sands is a regional story and Singapore Story as that, as that place gets more visitation. I think if you look on Page 16 of your slide presentation deck there, you'll see that we've not even reached 50% capacity, and in Changi it's like 46%, but it was May of '19. So we're doing these numbers with a still very, very distressed airlift. And I think, unlike the U.S. where there's unfettered ability to get to regional markets, airlift is back transportation, this is still a place you need to fly to. And so the airlift story can use to hamper the recovery. So I think the $300 million plus quarter is a pleasant upside to what we've thought we do. But there's I think a lot more room to run, as this market opens up in -- into places like Japan, Korea, and more travel. We're really more dependent right now on the closer in foreign markets. Joe Greff : Got it. Patrick Dumont : And Joe, one other thing it's Patrick, I think one thing to know when you look at Marina Bay Sands, is that we're not at capacity. And what I mean by that is, to Rob's point, if you look at the amount of airlift coming in to Singapore, it's not where it can be. But we're at levels that are very strong relative to 2019. If you look at, our not only volumes, which are really speaking to the premium mass segment from the catchment area, this is only going to grow. And the good news is we have our team together. One of the things that's been slowing some of the growth coming out of the pandemic, and really capturing some of the pent-up demand and return to normalcy is the fact that many operators on luxury segment didn't necessarily keep their team together throughout the pendency of the pandemic. We were fortunate enough to do that. And so now our team is ready to respond. So we have plenty of capacity to absorb the growth as it comes in. So our view is that this is a good start, but we have more room to run. Robert Goldstein : To Patrick's point, Joe, one more things to make you aware. We were there, I guess a month or so ago. One thing is disturbing is the hotel business. They even the luxury brands haven't been able to get open 100%. So I'm running at 40%, 50% capacity, because they don't have adequate personnel. And that obviously feeds into Marina Bay Sands. So as they get open fully this year, as that market returns, as employment grows, I think we'll grow with that. There's a lot of room to run here if we get that place fully open, and airlift returns to pre pandemic numbers. Joe Greff : Great, thank you for your thoughts there. Switching over to Macao. Can you just talk about what your average daily operating expense? Average cash burn rate has been during this most recent casino closure there. Robert Goldstein : Grant, are you awake? Grant? Grant Chum : Yes, we're here. Robert Goldstein : Got it? Grant Chum : Good morning. Sorry. Just momentarily lost you. Yes, Joe, I think obviously, second quarter, we were running at this $110 million EBITDA loss. So we'll basically just over a million a day. Now as we went into the second half of June, we have a local outbreak of COVID in Macao, and therefore, into the third quarter. Clearly the revenue environment is slower than it has been in the second quarter, especially with the last weeks [indiscernible] casinos as well. So I think you can look back to where we were in 2020. In a very, very low tourism environment in the middle of that year. And take it from that in terms of the actual daily cash burn rate, although I think our operating expenses have moderated a little bit since then. But that's the ballpark region. Joe Greff : Thanks, guys. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Rob, just sort of going back to Singapore for a moment. The Changi numbers are really interesting. Is that a pretty good guide for, I guess visitation levels of the property and sort of where I'm going is, thinking about spend per visitor, right. We've obviously seen the pent-up demand, and that those numbers rise across U.S. regional gaming Las Vegas strip. And I think we're all struggling a little bit to know exactly what Asia is going to do, but we can all I think do the math, if visitations down 50 and obviously, you're 75% or 80% of your productivity levels already that's just very good spend per visit levels, but obviously, don't want to extrapolate just from the airport, if you could give us a little bit more guidance. Robert Goldstein : Well, I think it'd be careful here in terms of extrapolating, without recognize we are running high occupancies already at Marina Bay Sands, where I think you struggle a bit is to factor in when the rest of the market recovers. That's why I referenced the other high end luxury hotels are lots of sleeping rooms, who we benefit from, they come to shop, eat with us, gamble with us, we're not getting that lift, I think that's the -- could be a very impactful down the road, we're very happy to spend levels we're seeing, and we're happy with the occupancy we're getting, but we're not getting that extra people don't sleep in our hotel unnecessarily coming over to gamble, shop, et cetera. So I think that's where we're trying to point out the visitation levels. I also think there'll be helpful in driving better levels of play and spend as these other markets. So you can't lose three million people in a month, like May and not have some impact in numbers. The question you raise is how high is up? And I don't want -- I'm not prepared to answer that, I don't know. But you can't ignore the fact that you're losing 10s of millions of people versus pre-pandemic. The point here is just to make it clear how different is over there versus in the U.S. where visitation levels are back and access these properties is back here in Las Vegas and regionals. It's not the case yet in Asia, and I think will benefit as that rise in spend will get better. There are retail numbers that you might look here on Page 31, as some indication is how powerful the recovery is happening even without full visitation, you can see the sales per square foot MBS and the power what's happening over there. So the good news is we're getting we're profitable, we're seeing growth, the better news is there might be a lot more ahead of us if we can access more people into Changi. So have more hotels around our hotel and see a full visitation inventory. It's not there yet. Shaun Kelley : Great and maybe just my follow-up thinking about margins in Singapore, right without the revenues being back online, it's been hard to analyze, but can you just talk a little bit about puts and takes there now as we get back to very recovered levels on the revenue side, about some of the, kind of on a stabilized basis as different segments come along? Because I think, there was a tax change there that impacted the market and some other things. So, could you just help us think about pros and cons or segments of business that could impact margins on a stabilized basis? Robert Goldstein : Pat, you want to take that? Patrick Dumont : Yes, sure. So a couple of things to think about. First off, just as you mentioned, after March 1, our gaming tax increased both by 3% in the Premium and the non-Premium side. So that 3% does impact margin. Now I think there are some other things going on in Singapore, there's some higher expenses that is used, there's utility costs that have gone up. There's other costs to operate in the market that have gone up inflation that you've seen in other markets are impacting some of the things that we buy. There's also some wage inflation because there's scarcity of labor in the marketplace in Singapore, so a high quality environment to work in. It's just a high demand as our economy continues to grow for high quality labor, so we've seen some labor increase. So there's some things that from a cost basis side are impacting our margins. But the flip side of this is we're not at full revenue yet. So as we grow revenue and as we make investments in these higher value suite products and as we grow some of the services that we offer to our patrons in the long run, we'd like to believe our margins return back towards where they were before, we just need to be operating under normal environment. So we still have some start-up, what's called fits and starts related to some expenses. And I think our goal is to get our margins back to where they were, but it's going to take some revenue growth for us to get there. Shaun Kelley : Great, thanks. That's very clear. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Well, Rob maybe you could help here. Just in terms of the -- at Marina Bay Sands, obviously, I think VIP recovered to close to 75% of Q2 '19 levels, as you think about that kind of moving forward are clearly some channels, as you mentioned, Korea, Japan, and I would assume to some extent Mainland in China is curtailed to say the least. But when you think about like the stability of that, in the current environment, does it feel as though that's a number that that's kind of a new baseline, thereabouts, at least as we move forward? Robert Goldstein : You mean, this current quarter's results being a baseline? Carlo Santarelli : I'm referring more to VIP ownership volume and kind of the stability of that segment of the market? Robert Goldstein : I think there's room to run, I think there's room in there. I mean, look at what's happened in Singapore, let's begin with we glossed -- I glossed over the beginning, but we're putting $1 billion in that product. It'll be very blunt about it. It's always been a very appealing building, but it's never had the FF&E component in the suite and room product, I think it deserved, it now has that and over the next 18 months, it'll finish. We were there and the product we're putting together is as good as any place we've ever operated. And I think that's going to be very helpful. To us be clear that Singapore is more desirable than ever as a destination is growing in appeal to a lot of people for a lot of reasons. We referenced the airlift, you referenced China, you're absolutely right, China's obviously not there. But I think you add these things together, the desirability of Singapore as a destination, the rethinking of the FF&E in that building, the return of a lot more airlift than there was hopefully in 2019. Yes, I think that segment can run, yes, I do. I think we can, we also have less competition in the region. Obviously, Macao is not operating at this point. But I think this Singapore business is going to continue to grow because the region, the City state of Singapore is very desirable, and more and more people come to us. So you add our better building with a more desirable Singapore with the airlift, with the opening of China, with the opening of Japan, Korea at all, I think the cumulative impact here is every segment can grow. I have a lot of belief that we can drive -- we have to drive it because there's cost size as it was referenced by Sean and Patrick in the previous call. So we will drive revenue in all segments and we'll be very attuned to it. But I think we were in a very, very privileged position in Singapore right now. And what's happened there, both our building and with the destination itself. Carlo Santarelli : Great, that's helpful and then just as it pertains to the expansion that the 1000 new rooms, I believe you guys had the construction start, kind of, I guess it was an extension on what you had to begin construction into Q2 of next year, if I'm not mistaken. Is there anything firmer that you guys have around cost and our plans there that you'd be able to share? Robert Goldstein : Yes, Patrick, do you want to? Patrick Dumont : Sure, absolutely. So, Rob referenced our visit to Singapore, it was a great visit on a lot of fronts, I think we spent time in the building. And we had the opportunity to continue our dialog around the IR2 expansion. We're very excited to begin, I think one of the things that the pandemic did unfortunately was slow down that process. There's just a lot of things that have to be considered to fit it in to this very complex and very busy environment to make it sort of fit all the requirements that are necessary to get the approvals to begin. And so I think we're working on that now. And it's something that we hope in the coming months that we'll be able to get more firm about a start date, but we're excited about it and working with the Government currently and hopefully we'll get a chance to begin soon. Carlo Santarelli : Great, thank you Patrick. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live. Chad Beynon : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask about M&A in this environment. And I know that's not a normal question for you guys. But given your strong cash flow, position, your balance sheet and just compressed multiples kind of across the gaming lodging leisure space. How are you thinking about maybe considering some opportunistic looks across the world? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : So, I think one of the things as a company that alternative pandemic, and part of the pandemic we've always focused on is how we allocate capital, and how we drive the highest returns for shareholders. And you may have heard in the past say that our highest and best use of capital do new development from the ground up. And that's really what we're focused on. If you look at the history of the company, and success in the way it's delivered outside shareholder returns is exploiting a strategy of building large scale integrated resorts in new jurisdictions. And that's what we're focused on. And so for us, I think we have opportunities unique to who we are, we have a long track record with Rob and his decades of experience, the rest of the team has decades of experience in developing these resorts. And so we're going to look to do that, before we look to buy anything, I don't think the idea is that we would never look at something, I think we're always interested, I think we're interested in seeing if there's a way to create greater returns for our shareholders. But as a practical matter, we're not an M&A driven business. And I think for us, our priorities are going to be look for new markets, develop, build and scale, and invest over the long-term to create sustainable and durable returns. And that's really what we're going to look to do. So I understand that there's variability, particularly in the digital side, there's a lot of things that have valuations now that may people see them as compelling for the long-term, there's perhaps some land based opportunities that may come up over time. But as a practical matter, like everyone else will look at it, see if it makes any sense for us. But we're really going to be focused on ground up development. That's who we are. Chad Beynon : Thank you. And then on MBS again, just on margins, you kind of touched about some of the different pieces of that, because the promotional environment between you and your competitor in the market changed versus pre-pandemic, or does it feel as rational as it was at that time? And do you expect anything to change from a promotional environment once Macao opens back up? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : We've always been lucky that environment is not driven. I don't think it will be in the future either. And I have to wait and see what happens in Macao. But my sense is Macao when opens will not be a challenge either. There'll be plenty of demand and usually promotional activities, got to controlling his lack of revenue, I don't think we lack revenue in Macao or Singapore. So I feel pretty good about it. Chad Beynon : Appreciate it. Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Chad. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt your line is live. Brandt Montour : Hey, everyone, thanks for taking my questions. First one was on Singapore I'll follow-up on that the last question. But more just for the Singapore market, specifically. And we've heard a bunch of chatter out there in terms of potential interest in your main competitor in that -- in the Singapore market? Is there any scenario in which, a different operator would come in and take that over? And that would change the way you look at that competitive landscape? Patrick Dumont : We'd already have been without it, that's up to the government make that decision. But it's a duopoly market. And I don't see it having impact either way. Grant Chum : Yes, I think one thing that's important to note is that we view Marina Bay Sands as the best building in the world. And in our mind, it's just an unbelievable opportunity to continue invest and operate the building and grow it over time. So I don't think we view it any differently. We think the market opportunity in Singapore is absolutely unique. And, we're very committed to long-term investment there. So for us, I'm not sure it matters, who operates it, that's up to the Singapore government and to the owners of that business. But for us, we're just focused on, continuing to develop our property and grow the market as best we can. Robert Goldstein : What I would say about Singapore, we said before, we'll just reiterate is that that place has evolved even better than was we started years ago. And it keeps getting better. And if you look at Changi running it such a still 40%, 50% capacity. Look at the desirability at market, the things we're doing, I'm sure again, thing is as well to improve the product, it just feels like that mark has a lot of room to run, and to grow from us and for our competitor. The offerings get better, our Phase 2 will be even stronger. So to me, that's the market just beginning to feel it's muscle. Brandt Montour : Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on that, as we sort of think about how to think about the constraints, for how fast that that MBS property can recover. The Singapore Tourism Board recently put out a number for 2022 international visitation that are some something along the lines of $4 million to $6 million for '22. That it doesn't seem like that would incorporate a ton of ramp from here, and I know that's not necessarily exactly what you guys would see. But does that is that make it seem like the Changi airlift is for the rest of yours baked into the cake now or is there can that be flexed up do you think? Robert Goldstein : I'm not going to speak for the government or what their numbers say. I think the capacity opportunity speaks for itself, I think it's more depended not on Singapore but on the airline themselves and the other countries wanting to reengage and to open them. I think the airport can obviously have the capacity. I'd be surprise if Singapore wouldn't welcome more, more access more flights. It's question of getting the requisite employees in these airlines to get the lift going and open up these countries in a major way. I think it's hard to forecast we're in a world of change every day is different. And I'd like to think there's a lot more opportunity than that, but remains to be seen. If the government's want to engage and if the airlines can get the employees make it happen. I think demand -- underlying demand is absolutely there just gained the ability to get there. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. Hi, just a quick one on I don't know if I'm missing your introductory comments, any comments on what you've talked about in the past related to online gaming and sports betting and kind of more looking at B2B investments. I didn't catch if you had an update there? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : We didn't have enough there. We didn't mention, we're focused right now on what's happened. We remain committed to our digital investments and looking at that market. But right now, the story for us is this land based recovery, which we're dealing in Singapore and we made some major strides in this company in terms of liquidity. The reopening of Singapore, and we think the upside potential of Singapore. The licensing process and Macao are focused on that. And of course, most importantly, the return to a normalized operating environment in Macao is paramount. We just been so busy without your focus wasn't on digital. Right now, we continue to look at that opportunity. We continue to invest, we made a few investments, as you know, in the past, so just simply a focus right now on land based. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. And then also, has there been a change in what you expect for timing and spending a potential New York project, since last quarter? Robert Goldstein : I'm sorry, I missed you -- about New York. Patrick Dumont : Timing of spend. Robert Goldstein : Oh, timing of spend? No, I think we remain a believer in that market. And the process is taking longer than I thought it would. But hopefully it'll come to -- hopefully this year or early next, we'll know what's happening there. Now it's still the density of population and the ethnicity. And the access in New York makes it very appealing and lack of capacity still remains a premier market in my mind, if we can get there is a lot of competition. We're one of many in the hunt there. So nothing new report, we have a plan in place we're executing to it want to wait for the RFP to unfold. So we're nothing new in New York. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Robin. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line of live. Steve Wieczynski : Yes, hey guys, good afternoon. So this will probably be for Grant, and it's probably going to be a difficult question to even answer. But, Grant, I guess for us, non-Chinese citizens, it's extremely tough for us to understand, where China is with respect to the reopening process. But I don't know if you can help us understand, maybe what you're hearing around the zero case policy, which I mean, I think the rest of the world probably fully knows at this point is never really going to work. And if some of these harsher stances toward the virus could start to get relaxed before. Maybe is there a timeframe you guys are watching? Or is there anything you've heard? Maybe it's at the October election? I guess, anything around that would be very, very helpful? Thanks. Grant Chum : Yes, thanks for the question. I think as you alluded to, there's not much that we can help with in terms of any speculation on timelines or changes. I think what we're focused on is, what was happening in Macao. So I think, the things that we can effect is to make sure that we do help the prevailing government policy so that we can actually get Macao reopen back with Zhuhai that's a neighboring city in Mainland as quickly as possible. And that means, I think aligning ourselves fully and safely with the overall COVID policy. And that's what's happening right now. And so hopefully, in over the coming weeks, we will be progressively reopening all of the facilities that we've had to close in the past week. That's what we're really focused on. And it's really not a place to speculate on future changes on the overall health policy. I don't know if Wilfred has more to add on that. Wilfred Wong Ying-Wai: No, I think Grant, you're right. At this stage, I think the whole country is also employed in this COVID situation. And obviously, policies will evolve. And we in Macao is trying our best to support that local government in order that Macao can return to normalcy. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks for that guys. And then Rob, obviously, there's been some it's been some movement with regards to the new Macao gaming laws, regulations, whatever way you want to think about it, which actually seem pretty favorable. But wondering how you guys are viewing those regulation changes, and maybe any of the pros or cons that you see emerging from those? Robert Goldstein : Well, we're grateful for the clarity from the government. I think the process is moving very well. And I think a lot of concerns, some people haven't been eliminated. So we're just going to go into process and hoping to complete this thing in due course, but obviously, we're all pleased. I think all the operators are pleased how this is playing out. And we're hoping for a positive conclusion. I think a lot of the fears have been erased. Grant or Wilfred is going to comment, that's as far as I can take it. Grant Chum : I think that's right, Rob. Wilfred Wong Ying-Wai: Yes, absolutely. Grant, go ahead. Grant Chum : Yes, I'll just going to add that, obviously, we're very appreciative during this difficult time on the COVID front, that the government and the legislature were able to move forward to complete the passing of the revised gaming law in towards the end of June, and that we were able to also execute the six month extension that takes us to the end of this year. So I think the whole process is moving forward expeditiously. And as Rob said, we look forward to participating in the tendering process. Patrick Dumont : Steve, one thing I would say our company, as you know, has been through it's been an awfully difficult couple of years more than most because we're Asia focused. But we've now completed the sale in Las Vegas gives us more than ample liquidity. Now what happens? Singapore is up and making money and there's more to come. It's a very, we're very grateful for what's happening in Singapore. We see a lot better days ahead. The Macao licensing process is the same way it feels like we've survived it was a lot of people are concerned.  But in the end, it's worked out for everybody in a positive manner thus far. Hope that continues. And we're just waiting for the thing you referenced initially, which is when does Macao, when does the government rethink the zero COVID or how that play out? We don't know. Don't pretend to know. But that's the last thing waiting for it to get our company back to a much better place, but three of the four have been achieved. So we'll continue to press on with a license and wait patiently for the government to advise us on the reopening of Macao. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Robert. Appreciate it. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live. David Katz : Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Number one, I wanted to ask about just the physical plant in Macao. And recalling that, those are have a significant number of private rooms that were historically used for VIP. How do we think about kind of that spatial layout and planning going forward and then I have a follow-up in another direction? Robert Goldstein : Grant, do you want to take that because I have my own views, but I think you should. Grant Chum : Yes, sure. I think we've been watching as the market has been evolving and also planning for the future. I think a lot of the salons and suddenly that applies to the new salons that we've developed as part of The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, and the London and Macao projects. I think they're really premium salons, premium gaming salons that could be applicable and used by the different segments whether that's the VIP rolling or the premium mass. So, clearly I think Macao overall, may be relooking at how each operator redeploys their assets. But as far as we're concerned especially the new products that we've developed over the past two years, we feel pretty positive about redeploying a lot of those gaming spaces for the premium mass segment. But also over time, as we look towards the future also the premium direct segment and attracting the overseas markets in the Rest of Asia, into those products. So we've been currently going through a planning exercise on the future deployment of those areas. But as the market evolves and as things normalize, we'll be able to get more definition around that. But even as of the past 12 months, we've been redeploying some of those rooms that were assigned to the Rolling segment, to the non-Rolling segments. Robert Goldstein : Hey David, no ever thought the additional gaming space in Macao is a bad thing as we focus more on base mass and premium mass, I think actually expands our ability to make more money, the junket business, we always know is a margin challenge business. I feel grateful, we have all this new space coming back to us that we can redeploy. And we're still going to the world's biggest gaming market, real land based and one of the biggest footprint. So as this as we as Grant and Wilfred and the team, rethink that space, I think it adds all kinds of premium opportunities for base mass, premium mass and direct premium as well. So to me, it's a very valuable transition to a higher focus margin business, that enables us to again, Singapore, I mean, Macao, the penetration is Chinese still, I think sub 3% for the China population, there's going to be a growth market, capacity will be an issue down the road, because there are new casinos opening. So I think that space may prove be very valuable as we get back to work in Macao, hopefully this year, or next. But I think we're lucky to have all that extra space, we can redeploy in a more profitable way down the road. So happy to have it back. David Katz : Understood. And as my follow-up, you've done obviously, the Singapore MBS did a lot better than what we had. But just looking at the ADR of, I think 330 and I'm not sure that you cover this directly so far when we look back to 2019, it was there's still some headroom there. It was about $90 ADR higher. How do you sort of see that evolving as we roll forward? Robert Goldstein : Pat, you want to take that? Patrick Dumont : Yes, sure. Happy to, I think some of it has to do with sort of startup across the quarter, I think one of the other things to note is that it's not fully recovered in with all the different segments, because there is sort of not as much FIT and MICE demand as we had across 2019. So you're going to see some ADR spread from that. But I think the most important thing to note is we're making as Rob referenced a $1 billion investment in our product there, over time, our ADR will be higher. So across the next six quarters, and let's sort of focus on at the end of '23 in time for Chinese New Year of '24, we are going to have 400 new suites that we've never had before. And they're the highest quality suites we've ever done as a company. And we're going to drive different ADR. So while we're out a couple of 100 suites now we've got rooms out of inventory, we've had a lot of things going on through the building, it started period, I wouldn't look at this ADR is representative. And so over the next couple of quarters, as we have rooms out of inventory, it's going to -- there's going to be some choppiness, but by the time we're done getting into '23 and getting across '23, when the project is completed, then you'll have a good look what ADR can really be under the value of the full investment, which is substantial. It's basically a complete redo of Towers 1 and Towers 2 and some of the common spaces and amenity spaces that we have. It's going to be a fundamentally different experience for our guests. And we hope and believe very strongly, they'll pay a lot more for it, because it will attract a higher value tourist and that's really our goal. Robert Goldstein : Our biggest problem in the days ahead in MBS is as that Changi recovery continues, and passengers come back as our game, our biggest problem won't be ADRs can be putting have enough rooms to accommodate all the demand, ADR will climb either to casino direct or through cash customers or to convention. There'll be no problem getting back. That's not the issue. The issue as always been it'd be where capacity constrained in MBS, we need more sleeping rooms. And we'll get the ADR that markets, the recovery you're seeing here is in its infancy it's just beginning. And be assured that we can get the ADR back to pre-COVID levels and above in fact, I hope we can do much better with casino demand and driving casino ADR as well. David Katz : Perfect, thank you so much. Robert Goldstein : Sure, thank you. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. And last question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Daniel Politzer : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, given the momentum you're seeing in Singapore and the recovery is still in its infancy, how do you think about the long-term path to getting back to pre-COVID, the $1.7 billion of EBITDA in the event China doesn't open, do you need China to reopen to kind of get back or get close to that level or given what you're seeing now, do you have a line of sight to getting near there in the absence of China reopening? Robert Goldstein : It's good question. And we're watching like you are, I think, let's not ever dismiss the importance of China in any of our businesses, China's still a powerhouse as a consumer market. And we should never dismiss it as powerful till we get to $400 million a quarter without China, I mostly would think not. But then again, I would have thought we wouldn't have done this well, with Changi still having underperforming in terms of visitation. So, depends on like the U.S., I think you have to question what were the over indexing come from will Indonesia, Malaysia and other source markets over indexed and that's the question, we don't know the answer that, will there be pent-up demand coming out of Thailand and Vietnam and Indonesia. And could they -- could Korea outperform, I just don't know what the wait and see if those markets open up again, we're in uncharted waters here. It's new. But I would never dismiss the importance of China as a market for anybody in our retail business, or hotel business, or casino business. China is very, very critical to everybody in Asia. And you can see that in any market, we participate in. But how high is up without China returning, I do want to wait and see together. There's a lot of good drivers here that make us feel good, the visitation makes us feel there is opportunity there. Our renovation, it feels like it's been very impactful as comes online. The over indexing of non-China markets feels like it's coming on strong. But I think we'll revisit that and we'll have a better answer for you next quarter, we print our numbers. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then just a follow-up. I know COVID cases in Singapore actually have been rising lately. Given your experience working with the government and your perception, and I guess other than their standard of living with COVID and the stage of reopening, do you see any risk with additional restrictions coming back or being put in place? Robert Goldstein : Patrick, do you want to grab that? Patrick Dumont : Yes, sure. Happy to, I think at this point, all we can do is be optimistic about the public health posture that Singapore shown, they have shown a lot of leadership, they have a significant history of investment in their hospital system and their public health infrastructure. And I think they're proceeding as they've said, I think they broadcast it all along, and they followed what they've laid out. So as we sit here right now, I think they're moving in the way they said they're going to do, which is continue to have visitation, continue to be involved in the growth of their economy and move forward with this is an endemic situation. But we don't know. And I think this is something where we've obviously shown flexibility to respond as needed to support the government their initiatives, but at this time, it seems like we're heading in the right direction. But could that change in the future? We don't know. Daniel Politzer : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sands' Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thanks, Paul. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Dumont, our President and COO; Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, EVP of Asia Operations and CEO of Sands China. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. We have also posted an earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to the presentation during the Q&A portion of the call. For the Q&A session, we ask that participants please pose one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments and we'll move to Q&A. The recovery of Marina Bay Sands continued during the quarter with property EBITDA reaching US$343 million. Relaxation of virus-related restrictions in Singapore and many of the source markets, coupled with the improvements in airlift, have enabled this performance and financial -- this improvement in financial performance. We expect a robust recovery over time as further relaxation measures in the region are implemented and additional airlift in Singapore comes online. Our $1 billion capital investment program currently underway at Marina Bay Sands has introduced exceptional new suite product in premium segment-focused amenities of the resort. The response to these initial offerings has been strong. Additional offerings, including spacious new suite products, will be introduced throughout the remainder of this year and 2023. We look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the Singapore market as we execute our expansion plans at MBS in the years ahead. Turning to Macao, the operating environment remains difficult. Importantly though, tourism with restrictions have been relaxed to customer demand and spending in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both gaming and retail perspective. We appreciate the opportunity to submit our tender proposal for one of the six gaming concessions in Macao in September. We are now in the consultation phase of the tender program. And as such, we won't be able to comment much further on the process at this time. We are big believers in Macao as a world center of tourism and leisure. We have been the biggest investor and operated non-gaming businesses over the past two decades in Macao. We absolutely welcome the opportunity to invest even more in the non-gaming products and offerings in Macao. We have great confidence in Macao's tourism recovery and its long-term growth prospects as we do most of our -- we'll do our utmost to support Macao's economic diversification and its evolution as Asia's leading destination for MICE and leisure visitors. We consider our existing portfolio of resorts in Asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop new large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the U.S. and Asia.  We thank you for listening today, and I'll turn to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : Yes, Rob, Marina Bay Sands, you're run rating close to $1.4 billion in annualized EBITDA. And as you referenced in the investor slide presentation, without any contribution from a geography, namely China, given what you're seeing with improved easing regional visitation volume in, say, other non-China geographies, do you think you can get to 2019 EBITDA levels at some point in the next year or so without direct contribution from China? Rob Goldstein : Joe, we think Singapore is in a very unique place. I think we easily achieved 2019 levels. And as you referenced, we have three great impediments right now. We have -- obviously, tourism to China is very limited. We also are running about 55% visitation into Singapore from the rest of Asia, which means -- and that may seem odd to reference that because you think, well, we're running at the high levels of occupancy. But keep in mind that, that residual tourist that comes in does not sleep at the MBS property, gambles there, shops there, eats there. So we're getting hurt, I think, on the table business by not having all the hotels in Singapore operating at full level. It's a big business for us because MBS is the first protocol from those visitors, whether they're sleeping there or not, they go there. That hurts our business. And despite that, we're achieving $700 win per units on the slots and huge retail numbers, but the upside is material. Third impediment is our sleeping rooms. We had about 400 or 500 units down right now. I think Singapore, it's just beginning. I always joke with the guys here, the party is just starting in Singapore. The truth is that Singapore is going to grow and for a couple of reasons. One is the destination is getting more powerful than ever. Our building is getting better than ever. And I think when you see a rebound from China and the rest of Asia, one, six looks very small in terms of our ability to grow with much larger than that. I think we can keep going to $2 billion the next couple of years if we get it right in the market for recovers. So as much as we like the numbers currently, we think there's much better days ahead for Singapore. That market and that destination has grown quite a bit in terms of the Asian tourism world. And I think our numbers will reflect that years ahead. Joseph Greff : Great. And then switching over to Macao, I'm not going to sort of waste, I guess, my bullet of the question on concessionaire terms and other things I'd love to ask about. But maybe can you just remind us what your expectation or what your conversations during the consultation process, what the timetable is for the license renewals to be finalized? When would you expect to hear from the government and then the government's end result to be publicly communicated? And that's all for me. Rob Goldstein : We woke our colleagues up in Asia in a deep sleep to participate. I'll let them answer that question. Gentleman, Grant and Wilfred, both online correct? Daniel Briggs : Correct. Rob Goldstein : Are you awake, guys? Wilfred Wong : Yes, we're up. Grant Chum : Yes. Rob Goldstein : Answer away. Do you need the question? Wilfred Wong : Well, we've been working with the government closely. And a couple of rounds of discussion has been held. We are waiting for the government notification, whether there will be another next round of discussion. And the timetable remains the same. Everything is in good progress, and we expect some notification towards the end of the month for us to know what's the next step. Rob Goldstein : Grant, do you have anything to add, any additional commentary, Grant? Grant Chum : No, I think that's right. And we obviously welcome the smooth progress in the process. And we still do expect the entire process to complete by the end of the year, as previously stated by the government. Operator : The next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. . Carlo Santarelli : Obviously, Rob or whoever wants to take this, you guys had a significant boost in kind of hotel revenue out of Singapore and namely in ADR. Any color you guys could provide? I mean, I know strategically, you're looking to put the best customers in that building right now from a gaming perspective. And obviously, that's showing up in the numbers, both on the VIP segment roll and mass segment roll. Anything you could provide as to kind of how the mix has changed at that property? I assume some of that ADR is just kind of casino comp room and that's kind of what's making that sound so significant? Rob Goldstein : I think, Carlo, one of the most significant things is what's not there. We're running like 96%. You see on Page 14, the reference page, ADR $515. I think, again, we're just beginning. We only have half the recovery in terms of -- China is not there, most of Asia is not there. Our point is, the mix gets better and better because demand gets higher and higher. Our problem there's going to be enough rooms to service all the demand FIT casino.  And I think we pointed two great variables : one being retail, which is that mall just keeps getting better and will keep getting better. And then our win per unit on the slot side looks strong. But I think the refocus on Singapore as a destination market, as a market in great ascent illustrates what the upside could be in the -- on the tables, the non-rolling tables. Rolling tables will probably get the whole new level, but demand for the non-rolling tables is what I'm waiting for recovery. And that's where you see China and the rest of Asia full lift comes back. So right now, we're just faced with -- the sad reality is we like to have a lot more rooms in Singapore because that $515 is a real number, it could be a lot higher as demand keeps lifting. We can sell hotel resolve there longer at top dollar rates from the FIT side. We have great demand, much better than pre-pandemic demand from the rolling side. So again, the 343 is a very nice number, a good print in lieu of what's happening in that market. But I think the best phase of Singapore next couple of years as we keep growing -- and you're going to see our refocus on our mix in the retail segment. Our room mix, we're going to continue to focus. I mean the right room mix, top-tier rooms, the right food and beverage product, we've got to work harder because Singapore as a destination is growing measurably. We want to be a part of that. So we're just in a very good place in Singapore. I think looking back, we always thought one, six was a very nice number. Hopefully, obviously a small number in the future. Carlo Santarelli : Great. That's helpful. And then if I could, as you guys have talked about in the past and the thoughts on development, clearly, the New York process is kind of underway. Could you perhaps maybe share a little bit of your thinking around your approach and perhaps how you're thinking about the broader process timeline in general for New York? Rob Goldstein : Waiting for a Governor Hochul\u2019s advice to how that's going to process will begin. As you know, we've always been focused on the market for many years. We have a bid we're putting it right now. We have property we're put together right now. Very bullish on New York as a market. Tough because one really, I think, one available license at the end of the day, I think it's been a very -- a dog fight. And hopefully, we have a bid that gets attention. But other than that, time table looks like January for the RFP. I think sometime in '23, maybe you see a decision. And we'll put our best foot forward, that's for sure. It would be a perfect market to be in with the density of population and ethnicity. Operator : The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley : Can you give us a sense of when -- what your expectation is for a more open border and whether there's still an expectation that November would see the package tour visas and electronic visas, is that something that you feel like is still moving forward and will still allow for increased visitation to start? Rob Goldstein : I'm going to ask your former colleague, Mr. Chum, to answer that question, Robin. Grant Chum : Sorry, Robin, I couldn't quite hear the question. Can you repeat that? Robin Farley : It was just about your expectations around timing for the border to be a little more open in Macao and specifically anything on the changes that were planned by early November for visa applications to be electronic and packaged tour visa to restart? Grant Chum : Yes, sure. I mean I think, Robin, there has been a positive announcement on the relaxation with regards to two groups as well as the electronic Visa application in four provinces and also in Shanghai expected to commence end of the month or early November. And so that's obviously going to be a very positive signal for a gradual recovery in the visitation especially from these key provinces and municipality. And obviously, we welcome the development. Clearly, in the past few weeks and also months, it\u2019s still being relatively impacted by the COVID cases in different provinces as far as the non-Guangdong visitation is concerned. So what we're seeing right now in Macao is predominantly coming from the Guangdong province. But hopefully, as we get out further into the fourth quarter with these recent measures, we're going to start to see a more well-rounded mix of visitation building up towards the end of the year. Robin Farley : Okay. And then also for my other question on Singapore. I know you\u2019ve said that the deadline to start construction was extended to April 2023, and that's -- you had said that before this quarter. Just wondering if you have anything more definitive about when that would happen? Patrick Dumont : I think -- it's Patrick. I think the great news is, as Rob said in his opening remarks and the questions, our performance in Singapore is very strong. It's a privilege market and now tourism there is really remarkable given some of the constraints. The spending power of the consumer there is tremendous. We're really focused on high-value tourism and you're seeing the results of that in our results. And I think the Tower 2 in our [IR 2], in our mind, has just tremendous potential. We're very excited about it. But unfortunately, we don't have any update right now about the timing. So we're working on it. We're in process. And as we make a little bit more progress on our work there, we'll be able to disclose further about where we're headed. But as of right now, we're very optimistic about it. We're excited about the project. We think it really will speak to a very powerful part of the market. Now we don't have an update on timing. Robin Farley : Can I just ask one clarifying question on that? It had sounded previously like the timing of the budget and all of that was because of the pandemic and the disruption from that. If your business level has sort of fairly recovered, is that still the kind of uncertainty in the commencing construction? Or are there other factors that are more of a gating issue at this point? Patrick Dumont : It's really just process. I think there's a certain number of steps that we have to go through to be able to build. And so those processes were delayed because of the pandemic and because of some of the government agencies that we have to deal with being focused on very pressing matters. So now that they're able to reengage, we'll start that process again and begin on the path. And as we follow sort of the steps necessary, we'll be able to provide an update. But it's really just timing related to things necessary to begin. There's a lot of things that have to happen to make a building of this scale and complexity in the location that it's in, get all the approvals, go with the steps necessary to begin. Rob Goldstein : And Robin, I would say, the process for us is a learning -- is an evolutionary process. We keep thinking how about this market differently as we learn more and see more. And so our thinking has changed, there's the size of on gaming capacity, who the customer is. Singapore is morphed from what it was five years ago to hold it in place now. And I think it's affected our thoughts on what we build and so forth and how good should it be and how powerful it should be. And I think it's slower we want to be, but it's been the end of a very, very important product. Operator : The next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : So just -- you guys are seeing a lot of strength in terms of the room product right now. You're doing the $1 billion project renovation on your room product and MBS. I mean how do we think about the return of that given this should be fully online next year? And do you think you can get to that typical kind of 20% return historically or maybe higher even in the absence of the Chinese consumer coming back? Rob Goldstein : I think we need the Chinese consumer. We -- a couple of these to happen, let's be clear, we need to see China return at some point to achieve our goals. We also need to see the balance of Asia open up and come back at. Again, as I referenced earlier, the 55-or-so percent number, which is compared to 2019 isn't good, we need Singapore full on because our building, if you walk through there, when there's tens of thousands, hundreds of thousand people there, they're all staying there. There's the other hotels from the business. So these other hotels are very important to us.  So we need two things happen. Our innovation will complete in late '23. The balance of Singapore -- of Asian tourism into Singapore should be hopefully by Q2 complete. And that leaves the one barrier we can't answer as to China return. But when all that happens, do we think we can get you a very fat return? Oh, yes. I'd like to believe we can -- our goal is to get to $2 billion in Singapore. And we believe that's not difficult if the market returns in full. So keep in mind that we went into Singapore with a very different mentality a decade plus ago. The evolution of Macao into a really the premier FIT gaming market probably right now in that region is MBS. And I think we're experiencing the beginning to return, but it's not nearly where it needs to get to for us to get to $500 million a quarter. But I think that -- we'll hopefully see that in the years ahead. So we feel very bullish. And I can't think of a better place to invest our capital than Singapore and Macao, and Singapore has proven to be terrific opportunity. We put a lot of money in Macao. That will open up the fence and be a good opportunity. But right now, Singapore is very, very exciting for us. And yes, we're very confident the returns will be there. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then just pivoting to Macao. Another one on the group tours and the e-visas being resumed. I mean can you maybe frame how big these components work for your business in 2019? And then secondarily, if we think about these parts of the business returning and coming back online, is there a path to Macao getting to positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter, assuming no major outbreaks? Rob Goldstein : I'll ask Grant to reference that. But I think we should be careful. We don't -- it's very hard, as you know, right now, predictions of Macao had been erroneous the last couple of years because we don't know who's going to come and we don't know when they'll close the market. It's been stopping the start for so long. It's kind of silly for us to pontificate on exact gains in EBITDA. Could be EBITDA positive? Sure, these positive tomorrow if things open up and visitation returns. And that's going to happen at some point. But I think it's not -- it's difficult for us to tell you fourth quarter could be EBITDA positive without knowing what effect the visitors team will have in November and then also not knowing how zero COVID in force will happen. So there's certainly unknowns in Macao is very difficult to guess. Grant, Wilfred, any commentary? Grant Chum : Yes, Rob, I think Rob is right. I mean, the prediction of the future is tough. I think what we can say about the past is the group package tours represented roughly 1/4 of the visitation before the pandemic. With respect to electronic visas, we don't have those numbers. Obviously, it varies significantly from province-to-province. But clearly, the provision or availability of that node of application absolutely is helpful to facilitate the visa application for those relevant provinces. Operator : And the next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Maybe just to stay on Singapore, my first question is just to ask a little bit about trying to triangulate a little bit more on sort of what you're seeing behaviorally. When we look at RevPAR, for instance, I think it's about 6% versus 2019. Is that a decent gauge of, let's call it, the consumer and the, let's call it, the spend per person or per head. Is it better than that? I'm just trying to kind of think about pent-up demand or what you're seeing on kind of a core visit-to-visit basis versus what we've seen in some of the Western markets because we don't have a great proxy in Asia yet about sort of how pent-up demand is going to play out and just trying to kind of see what you're seeing a little bit more. Rob Goldstein : I'm going to ask Patrick to take that, but I want to say one thing, it's critical to understanding is that Singapore is much different. I think this is the obvious response to that. Singapore is much different than Las Vegas or U.S. regional because of the obvious that you got to fly to get there, so you had to take other countries opening up and it's like buying wine in Burgundy, a lot of different regions in Burgundy. Well, there's a lot of different regions in Asia that don't open, haven't opened, airlift is a problem. So we're really hampered. As nice as what 340 is for the quarter, I think you're not getting the full power. It's hard to differentiate versus other places. The truth is that Singapore remains really held back by no China or little China and the regional market there, depending on airlift. The difference, Macao will be -- when Macao opens up, it's like Las Vegas or regionals. You can come right in without airlift. You're not airlift-dependent. So I do think Singapore right now is in kind of unclear, uncertain environment. It's nicely making 1.4 billion, whatever the number annualizes. But we won't know the full power of this market. We see it in retail. We see it in local slot play is still strong. We see it in rolling volumes are strong because everyone is coming to Singapore, especially the F1. But I think what you're not seeing yet is unleash the full power of this destination and what's happening. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : It's a very interesting question. I think the key thing to note is that it's a data point for the quality of tourism coming into Singapore. And the high amount of consumption that's there when tourists visit, there are constraints and there were constraints from during the quarter. So as Rob mentioned at the beginning, you see from the deck, we had approximately 500 rooms out of inventory during the renovation, the rooms that are coming online are probably the best products we've ever had. We're very proud about that. We think we'll be able to trade up in terms of the quality of the tourism that we get out of those rooms once the completion is there. One thing to note is that we'll be done at the end of '23. So we're going to have a few more quarters of disruption as we take rooms out of inventory to complete the renovation process and rebate Sands. The other thing to note is that the airlift is not there. And some of the other hotels around the Singapore market do not have the full capacity because of labor constraints. So once these things are removed from the market that act as limiters, then you can get an idea of what the true potential would be in a run rate environment. But I would still call this a little bit of a recovery quarter. So we think there's more potential to run as we fix some of these things that are sort of limiting the way that we can earn. And to be fair, the market can earn. Rob Goldstein : If you look at our sales in the retail mall on Page 31, it gives you some indication that we're running at $2,300, $2,400 a foot at Marina Bay Sands from the third quarter. I also think if you look at the rolling volumes as they start to kick in, I think those are great data points as you get quality coming. But again, it's early days. I think the recovery quarter is the right way of approaching it. Shaun Kelley : Super helpful. And sort of want to go down the same path, transitioning over to Macao. And I'm not sure it's the exact right way to look at it. But here, you do this slide on Slide 12 where you kind of break down the mass win per visit, which I find to be very, very valuable. Just as we think about that level, and we saw the sort of pullback from what was probably a very premium mass driven business back over the -- like last eight quarters or so, the last two quarters? Have looked a lot like where you were back in kind of 2018, 2019. Is this the right -- which one of those two, either the sort of pent-up demand we saw over the last eight quarters or kind of these more recent numbers is a better guide for what we think normal activity might look like in Macao? Robert Goldstein : Grant, do you want to take that? Grant Chum : Yes, I'll take that, Rob. Yes, thanks for the question. I think it's interesting looking at that trend as you highlight for the past several quarters. I would say the difference that you highlighted with the previous two quarters versus the prior eight, it's really just a function of the regional mix. So into 2022, we've had a much more Guangdong bias mix, if you look at the visitation data, and that's mainly a result of the various COVID outbreak impact on the non-Guangdong source of visitation. So if you're looking at the period post-pandemic, that's clearly the differentiator. And then if you compare with pre-pandemic, then it's, of course, still very much premium mass coming back faster. And I think that broadly stands notwithstanding or up Asia adjusted for the regional provincial mix. I think that's still a valid point, and it's borne out by the data series. So obviously, premium mass comes back first and then the mass comes back later. But this year, definitely, there's an impact from the regional mix as well. Shaun Kelley : Very helpful. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : I think we all agree to underlying demand in Macao's going to be there once COVID resolved. And no difference happened probably in the U.S. and again, with our footprint there, our size, our scale, we know the base mass, premium mass is going to drive this thing. The only variable we don't know is the missing junket segment, how impactful will be. But we believe -- again, when that door does open, I think the pent-up demand is going to be extraordinary. Operator : And the next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt Montour : On Singapore, can you guys give us the room rate differential between the finished room product and the legacy room product at run rate? Patrick Dumont : I think the problem is the -- it's Patrick. I think the problem is there's so much noise in the comparison because what we would be giving you is 2019, and this is not a fully open market yet. What we'd like to believe is after the quality of the renovation to be fair, we were taking keys out of inventory to create larger suite product. The level of design, we have a new service model. We've changed out a lot of the team there in order to improve our service delivery. There's a lot of things that are going to be different. So I don't want to quote you a number until we get to the run rate. But the key takeaway is that we're very focused on high-value tourism. We're investing in room product, we're investing in personnel and training and in service delivery and in food and beverage and other amenities in the property to ensure that we can sort of capture that high-value tourist. And that's really what you'll see over time. Rob Goldstein : I think one thing you just have to do, you want to understand this thing is you will have pictures listen to us, but jump on a plane some day and go see it. The product we're building there is unlike any haven't been done in Singapore, it is our spirit to what we've done the best in our competitors. And so I think when people -- our response has been across the board perfect in terms of be able to view this product. I think the impact is going to be much higher than we understand because you build something that good, people respond to it. I would encourage anybody who's in that part of the world to spend a day at Marina Bay Sands and we'll show you what we're doing is pretty impressive. Brandt Montour : Great. That's helpful. And then as you -- again, on Singapore, one of the narratives on the early days of the reopening in that market was that Singapore was gaining share of groups and convention business from Hong Kong. As you talk to your meeting planners and bookers and they're looking out six, 12 months, 18 months. Is there a sense that with Hong Kong starting to reopen that, that market is sort of trying to regain some of that share? Or is that market too uncertain? And the momentum is being maintained for Singapore in that business? Patrick Dumont : So Singapore is open for business. And so that means a return of leisure tourism, which we're benefiting from directly and the return of business tourism, which we're seeing in a strong way. I don't think we can draw a comparison with Hong Kong because access is different. So I think the way to look at it now is Singapore has always been a very strong MICE market. And I think it will continue to be so because of the investment, the high-quality tourism assets it's important as a financial center. We intend to invest behind this thesis. And so we think it's generally a very strong place to do business tourism. In terms of Hong Kong, I don't think we're at run rate yet to really understand sort of what that means. There's still COVID restrictions. There's still other restrictions in operation. So until those return to a more normal time, I think it's going to be hard to have any view at all. Operator : And the next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : You mentioned the trade-up and quality of the new rooms in Singapore. Can you just remind us of the cadence of rooms coming out and coming in over the next couple of quarters? And also talk to the net impact from these actions split across any uplift from renovated rooms versus the older rooms and maybe even tying in headwinds from those closed? Patrick Dumont : So we're going to have, let's call it, anywhere from 300 to 500 keys out of circulation across the next five quarters. And then the room renovation will wrap up and the tower will be fully -- the 2 towers will be fully ready by Chinese New Year '24. And actually by the end of '23. So that's sort of the cycle. So we're going to have we're going to have not our full potential of room delivery during the next five quarters. Stephen Grambling : Are you currently delineating between the new rooms in terms of pricing in the old rooms? Patrick Dumont : There is some variability there, yes, but it also depends on which room within the segment so that we have certain suites that are out, certain rooms that are in, depends on the time. Yes, there is some differentiation. So there is a blend there. Stephen Grambling : Got it. And then maybe turning to Macao. The market share there in mass has been quite volatile. How would you frame how your market share may evolve in a market recovery as different segments return, as you've described in a bit of a cadence premium mass and then mass? Rob Goldstein : Grant, do you want to have that? Grant Chum : Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I think it is volatile right now because the volumes are so thin. So I'm not sure looking at this quarter or even the prior quarters is particularly meaningful at this point. But I think going forward, I think as Rob referenced, we expect a strong comeback of both premium mass and mass. And I think in those segments, we're going to perform very well. Obviously, there's a past history there. But also, I think looking forward, we are coming off these fantastic product investments that we've made during the pandemic with the $2.2 billion investment program that we've implemented and now coming out on the other side pretty much completing with the London arena being the last component. So with the Londoner and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, we feel very strongly that we're going to perform very well in the market share front. Across all of these segments, not just because of the suites, speaking to the premium mass segment, but also for the mass segment, I think we'll end up with these three wonderful iconic destinations to follow on from The Venetian and The Parisian and now with the Londoner Macao, which is already starting to gain so much traction with the people who have been able to visit and also locally as well. Operator : And the last question is coming in from David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : If you could just talk a little bit about what you may have learned past quarter or so about the mix of revenue in recovery in Macao, what should we expect? And what role does sort of VIP play in all of this? And I know obviously, premium mass is the focus. But help us break down the different streams, if you can. Rob Goldstein : Mr. Chum, are you still awake? Grant Chum : Yes, still going. Yes. I think as I referenced earlier, I think there is a mix between the business segment -- the matrix between the business segment as well as the regional breakdown. So I think if you're just looking at the business segment, then clearly, VIP right now is -- has very low levels of volume, especially versus premium mass and even mass. But part of this impact in 2022 is also the regional composition of the business where we're obviously very Guangdong-dependent right now and have been for most part of this year. But I think going forward, it should be like how we've been seeing, which is the premium as we'll come back first and more strongly and then followed by the mass. And this is also true if you look at the retail numbers, what we've seen is 2021 very, very significant performance in the luxury retail segment. And of course, 2022, less so. But again, it's really impacted by that regional difference. And then going forward, yes, similar trends, we expect the luxury retail to come back first and the fastest and then you follow through with the mass retail. Operator : Looks like we lost David. We did have another question come in, from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. Benjamin Chaiken : Just kind of want to level set as we close the year. I think we mentioned tour groups and e-visas for a few provinces in Shanghai, either at the end of this month or early November. Is it possible that Macao could have breakeven or positive EBITDA as we go into the end of fourth quarter? Or do you think that's out of the realm of expectations? Patrick Dumont : Yes. I think the difficulty is, we don't know. We've been in these conditions for 2.5 years. We're very hopeful. We're going to continue to invest in Macao. We feel very strongly about Macao's future and the opportunities that exist there for leisure and business tourism but we just don't know. So as of right now, we're just waiting patiently, and we're going through the process, and we're looking forward to the opportunity for the upcoming concession. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed on listen-only mode, but we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, operator. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Dumont, our President and COO; Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, EVP of Asia Operations, Las Vegas Sands and COO of Sands China.  Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making those statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements.  In. addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We may refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. The presentation is being recorded.  I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments, then we move to Q&A. Macao's future is bright, remains the largest integrated resort market globally. Our commitment to investing in this incredible market is never wavered and with an unrivaled critical mass of world-class IRs as well as continued improvement in transportation infrastructure in the region. Macao will mature into a vibrant, diversified tourism market over the coming years. SCL's positioning and scale are perfect to capture the opportunity. Our diversified IR model with continuous investment in non-gaming segments, including MICE, hotel suites, live entertainment, retail, food and beverage, positions us well to capture the growth opportunity. Our diversity, scale and track record in non-gaming make us uniquely positioned to cater all segments of the market enable Macao to appeal to international tourists as well. The new concession is a win-win. We deeply appreciate the opportunity to operate one of those gaming concessions in the next 10 years. We are excited to deploy more capital to expand non-gaming offerings at SCL.  The $3.8 billion commitment is just a baseline. We hope to invest more as the market continues to grow. The commitment to develop non-gaming is the core of our investment and operating strategy for the past two decades, whether it be MICE, entertainment themed attractions or destination sales and marketing in overseas markets. We view the investment commitments by SCL and the rest of the industry is positive for Macao. Over the past few weeks, travel restrictions have been lifted. It is too hard to tell the true measure of the underlying pace of recovery, but indications are extremely positive. We have seen significant improvement on property visitation, gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy.  We remain positive on investments in, The Londoner and Four Seasons. Our investments position us well as the market recovers. The quality of our new products will also help drive high-value tourism from the region, especially the overseas markets.  Turning to Singapore, our normalized EBITDA and gaming volumes are back now to the 2019 levels. Normalized EBITDA reached $386 million for the quarter. Rolling volumes are approaching 2019 level and mass win per day is now exceeding the level of 2019. We have also delivered strong performance in non-gaming across all segments, including retail, mall, hotel, F&B and MICE. Retail is especially noteworthy with a 26% increase in tenant sales per square foot versus 2019. Our [ Indiscernible 0 :03:45] casino renovation program is progressing. Renovated product will come online throughout the year. Looking ahead, Marina Bay Sands is poised for further growth as all of our markets recover and become free of travel restrictions and airline lift continues to recover.  Let's move to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live. Joseph Greff : Hey, everybody, good afternoon. And good morning to those in Macao. My first question, obviously, is going to be on Macao, and Rob, Patrick, Dan, can you remind us what levels of mass GGR either on a dollar per day basis or as a percentage of 2019 levels, do you need to be at in order to be EBITDA breakeven? Obviously, the 4Q saw a narrowing relative to the 3Q. I'm presuming and would love for you to expand on it, I'm presuming what you're seeing thus far early in January is either at EBITDA breakeven or maybe more recently generating some level of positive EBITDA. Rob Goldstein : So pessimistic, Joe. We're more than breakeven. A lot more than breakeven, doing just fine. I'll ask Patrick to give us some color on those issues, but I think we're past the breakeven. We're now in the positive territory moving towards very positive territory. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. So a couple of things to note. Mix is important here. So as you know, we're a mass and premium mass and really a large-scale tourism investment company. And I think the key thing to note is the market is open. Liquidity is in the market. This is going to be a premium led recovery. We invested significantly during the pandemic. And the benefit of that investment is on full display. We have new suite products. We probably have the -- what we think is the best new property we've had in a long time, opened up in Macao. That investment is really showing power in the market right now today. There's significant non-gaming scale and investment that we've made that is bearing fruit. And so it's great to see the recovery. It's great to see the volumes coming back.  It's interesting, I think, Rob has talked a lot about pent-up demand over the years. He's witnessed it in other places earlier in his career. We saw it here in Las Vegas, and we experienced it fully in Singapore and now we're at a run rate that is really, really strong. And I think we're seeing that in Macao. I think the key thing is this is going to be a premium led recovery.  In terms of breakeven, I don't think that's really a consideration anymore. I think we're way past it. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Joe, I think we can be confident, be very honest and direct. We are in very positive territory and keep moving upside. I think the one thing I would say to you is that no one ever questions the power the base mass market. I would remind you I was looking at our numbers, base mass in Macao in our building costs about 1,500 Hong Kong per hand as an opening bet. So it's a couple of hundred bucks a hand USD. That's the base mass business. The problem we have right now is you can't get a seat in the games in our buildings. We're running 95%, 100% occupancy in those games. And the same applies to slot ETGs. The big question everyone's thinking about obviously is premium mass. And I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when you can see the numbers coming out of the premium mass. And you'll see the liquidity, you'll see resilience in that segment. And it's been a very pleasant surprise. Grant, can you add some color to that? Grant Chum : Yeah. Good morning and good afternoon. Yeah, I think the key thing we're seeing right now is that the quality of patronage is very high across all segments. So it's not just premium mass, it's also the base mass, it's in the retail segment. So we are seeing a very strong recovery in spend per customer. And again, that's not concentrated in any one segment. It's extremely broad based. And I think what you're seeing in the public numbers on presentation were recovered.  I think for CNY against 2019, we're about 40% of where we were in 2019, Chinese New Year for the first three days. And we're seeing revenues and volumes outperforming that visitation recovery, which is natural, which is what we've seen in other markets. So things are looking extremely positive right now. Joseph Greff : Great color, guys. Thank you. And then maybe switching over to Singapore for my follow-up question. Obviously, your comments on mass gaming, Rob, obviously, very strong. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your comments that you believe on like forcing late December and thus far in January, there's been an inflection at least from the Mainland Chinese segment? Can you give us some perspective on the relative -- I don't know if you want to look at it on a revenue or EBITDA contribution looking at 2019 levels. And then where that was sort of more recently as a percentage of the total mix? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. I'll let Patrick -- you want address that? Patrick Dumont : Yeah, sure. I think the important thing to note is that there was this pent-up demand story in Singapore and now it's blossomed into full on bonanza. And so what we're really seeing is every segment is working. And so we had a lot of noise in this quarter because of the hold. We rolled north of $7 billion, which is pretty unbelievable considering where we came from. And the mass play was very, very strong. And so while we were doing this, we had almost 20% of our room inventory out. And so when you look at that 477 win number in mass and you look at the rolling volumes and realize we're out 20% of our rooms, there's a lot of leg room here. There's a lot of room for us to go. And so I want to be careful when we talk about margins and contribution because we're going to adjust that as we change mix, as we get rooms online as we go through the innovation, as we change our suite product, as we price up, as we yield up, and as we have access to higher value tourism. So this is really a forward-looking thing more than it is what happened in this quarter because we're going to continue to sort of adjust while we get our mix right.  So what I would look to in this business is margin expansion over time, more rooms coming online, better product, better service and, of course, being able to capture a very strong component of both VIP play and mass play. Rob Goldstein : Joe, I think we're missing -- to Patrick's point, we're missing -- we're in a great place. We're back to 2000 -- we're back to 1.6 run rate if you take out the abnormal low hold on the rolling. But the two drivers that we just thought -- there's a lot of drivers, but the two jump off the page or renewed tours throughout Asia and China in particular. That's yet to come. We haven't -- we're doing all this -- we're in 2019 with no China participation and or limited China participation.  And as Patrick mentioned, a handicap physical plan, we are in a very, very fortunate position with MBS. I think it's going to become a property, a lot of growth. And I believe it's going to be a $2 billion business in the future. And I see nothing holding it back, except for our own renovations, which are extraordinary. I hope you get a chance to see it. And the reemergence of Asian tourism, including China back into the property.  The only regret we have is Singapore. We just like to have more capacity because -- you'll see -- I think you'll see in this year the power of -- the earning power of MBS. It's an extraordinary product, and we're lucky to have it. Joseph Greff : And Patrick, just back to your mix and yield comment. Do we interpret that, at least if we look back to 2019, that, that China MBS patron was a -- had a positive mix on spend per trip or spend per day or gaming revenue per day? Rob Goldstein : I think it's a combination of factors, Joe. I think, obviously, the China market is always powerful. But I also think there's cost issues in all these markets. There's this inflationary factors, undeniable, be it energy, wages -- I mean, there's a different world out there, and you've got to cope with it. But the thing about MBS that fascinates us is we believe we can drive revenues across the board. We're going to rethink our retail, rethink our table mix, our floor, our room pricing. We think we have a product that the demand will be close to insatiable for it, from the gamer and non-gamer perspective. And we're going to overcome margin cost -- margin by overcoming costs with higher revenues, a lot higher revenues across the board in every segment. That's the approach. We see MBS as a very unique product that's unrivaled in that part of the world. And we can just push pricing across the board, gaming pricing, ADR pricing, retail pricing, F&B pricing, it's just that good and that desirable. And let's face it, the market right now is using our favor. Singapore is very desirable from a lot of perspectives. Joseph Greff : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, everybody. Thanks, and good evening. Rob, or whoever wants to handle this, I was just wondering, in the brief time that China has more or less reopened, have you guys seen positive or negative, any change in behavior as it pertains to patronage at MBS? Rob Goldstein : MBS, that's a good question. I think it's too early to say we're going to see that. I see us as getting plenty of trying of participation, both in Macao and Singapore. But it's really too early to say. It just happened so quickly and the turnabout was so rapid that I think it's too hard to predict. I think the way this is going to segment though is that we're going to get more than our fair share of the rolling business in MBS. That moves in that direction, and we'll get the premium mass customer to visit more into Macao. I think our business really is going to split in that direction. I think it's very predictable what's going to happen here, and we're okay with that. So Singapore will get the top of the top. But each of those places will get tons of premium mass demand from China and throughout the region. I also think people underestimate how powerful Macao can become as a desirable visitation place throughout China. It's got everything. It's got the rooms, it's got the access, it's got the -- one thing, it has beyond Singapore, it's has lots of capacity and lots to offer. So I think Macao is going to be a very strong international destinations ahead. We plan to be very aggressive trying to push people into Macao to see the property, all of our products. Carlo Santarelli : That makes sense, Rob. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, and I understand kind of looking backwards at things that are Macao related is somewhat pointless in the environment that we're in right now. But it's just -- it does stand out a little bit when looking at your base and premium mass table revenues from the slide deck, your premium mass is representing, I think, 20% of 4Q '19 base mass kind of more like mid-teens, 16, something like that. However, the premium mass is down considerably year-over-year, whereas the base mass is reasonably steady year-over-year. Is that a whole dynamic on just lower than normal historical volumes? Or is there something else that's kind of made those 2 diverge more recently here, and then the fourth quarter specifically? Rob Goldstein : No, I think it's just a visitation issue. It's not a whole issue. It's visitations sure. I think you're going to find that washes out. I wouldn't take those numbers too much to heart. I think when you look at Q1, I wish when you see January, when those numbers are out there for the market, I think it will all wash away quite nicely. It won't be -- it won't enter into your thinking, Carlo. It's a nonevent. I think you'll see a surprising strength in both those segments.  I would say in Macao, we're going to be very strong, very represented in the base mass because we have the capacity. We're a scale player. And so we have the capacity in the gaming, non-gaming, retail, restaurant space to do extraordinary things in the base mass. And again, as I'll reiterate, base mass in Macao is a different animal than the U.S. It's a $200 base bet, $175 base bet. So pretty special customer. We are going to represent because of our scale. But on the other hand, with all of our suite product, et cetera, I think we'll also be the leaders in the premium mass business. So we have a very strong future ahead of us in Macao. I always chuckle, people, if you're looking for a negative commentary in the Macao market, you're in the rolling earnings call. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. And then, Rob, just quickly, if you could remind us, to the extent you guys are willing to share it, 2019, your direct VIP volume, your in-house VIP volume as a percentage of total, would you guys be able to share something like that? Rob Goldstein : We would, but we won't. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. You could, but you won't. Rob Goldstein : We could share it, we just won't. No, we're not going to do that. But Carlo, thank you. It's good to hear from you. Carlo Santarelli : Thanks, guys. You as well. Take care. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Grambling : Hi, everyone. Thanks. Can you hear me okay? Rob Goldstein : Pretty clear, Stephen. Go ahead. Stephen Grambling : So the visitation data for Chinese near looks like Hong Kong has been the bigger driver in the recent uptick in visitation. Is there any way to parse out recovery between Hong Kong and Mainland China? And any reason why spending behavior and recovery may be different between these source markets? Rob Goldstein : Yeah. And I've got a perfect answer to that. Mr. Chum? Grant Chum : Yes, you can see from the visitation numbers been published by the Tourism Bureau. The Mainland Chinese visitation is at about 30% recovery rate versus 2019 CNY. So obviously, with a 40% recovery for overall visitations, Hong Kong visitation recovery has been higher. Mainly, I think, as a result of just the ease with which they've been able to go. And obviously, Hong Kong has had a longer stabilized situation with, as it relates to the pandemic. So I think from a pure visitation point of view, it's just not unexpected. And bear in mind, the transportation support for the Hong Kong visitor only really opened up on the eighth of January. So this has been a very rapid increase in Hong Kong visitations. That said, I think we referenced back to the comments that Rob made earlier and I alluded to as well, I wouldn't get too stuck on the visitation recovery. I think in these types of reopening, we're going to see the premium customers come back first. The core customer coming back as a much bigger percentage than the overall visitation.  So I think what we're seeing is the quality of revenues and the patronage from all regions that visit in Chinese New Year has been very, very high. So we are way outperforming the visitation recovery in terms of volumes and revenue. And indeed, I think if you look at our property visitations our recovery rate in visitations to our own property, is far outperforming the recovery in the overall visitation numbers in the market versus 2019. Rob Goldstein : Steve, to Grant's comment just, again, we don't want to confuse visitation with GGR. There's not necessarily an easy way to make them work. I was recently in Singapore, I walked in one of our retail stores with our retail person and she told me the sales in the store were like $70 million. And I said there's nobody here, no one in the store. And she said, Rob, we only need the right people, not a lot of people. I think that's what's happening in Macao, we gained the right people showing up in mass, and it's reflecting in the numbers. You'll see that when the market numbers come out.  I think the early adapters to the market are the right people for the market. And I think that's why there's a confusion in the visitation versus the actual revenues. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. And maybe as a related follow-up there, there's been a similar dynamic, stronger spend per visitor in the U.S. that ultimately drove much better margins. How are you thinking about the puts and takes to margins in Macao versus what we've seen in other markets? Rob Goldstein : Grant, margins? Grant Chum : Yeah. I think first of all, our cost structure is in good shape. It's been -- unfortunately, we've had to spend extra effort in optimizing the cost structure over the past two or three years. So we've got a very lean cost base right now. In terms of gross margins on the revenue, I think a couple of things. One is our mix, obviously, is more favorable going forward just from a gross margin mix perspective simply because a vast majority of our revenues will be coming from the non-rolling and slot segments. And then secondly, the non-gaming, we expect to be growing, and that's obviously a much higher margin. We expect to be growing retail, hotel, F&B, actually all the non-gaming segments. So that's the structural framework for the margin. But obviously, the actual flow-through in the percentage margin we ultimately deliver from this very positive structure is really dependent on the rate of volume recovery. So we still need the top line to recover to a certain level before you get the flow through. And then to go beyond that, obviously, we hope and we all are working towards that, is for this market to continue to grow and, hopefully, at least in the mass segments and non-gaming segments glad to go beyond where we were in 2019. So if that happens, obviously, our margin structure should be very positive. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we think about the structure of margins going forward. Stephen Grambling : Absolutely. Thanks so much. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask, you've obviously always been very focused on the mass business there. But some of your competitors that have been more VIP focused, are you seeing them do things differently now that there's not the VIP market to go after in the same way there had been? Is that -- is it too soon to be seeing what changes that might mean? Rob Goldstein : I would assume it is, but I'll defer to Grant since he's on the ground. I can't imagine we have any visibility into that at this point. But clearly, we have a new market here, which favors our asset base. And our approach for the last 20 years has been scale. As you well know, Robin, it's a mass story with premium mass and retail commencing, et cetera. So we don't have things like -- it's tailor made for what we do, this environment. Our competitors will adapt and have to change. But I don't know. Grant, any color on that? Grant Chum : Yeah. I think, Robin, the competition for premium mass has always been very intense. And I think we'll continue to be, given the dynamics you just referenced. At the same time, I think as Rob says, we've got a footprint and scale advantage on our [ Indiscernible 0 :24:40] non-gaming asset facilities, I think really position us very well for all segments of mass. And then as Patrick referenced at the outset, the product that we've been developing for the last three years, especially, The London and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, are really prime position to help us be more competitive the premium lifestyle segments up in market as well as, I think, hopefully, to drive overall high-value tourism to Macao over the coming years. And I do as to point about international tourism as well. I think our footprint to combine with our new products and our traditional strength in MICE, in international marketing network really position us very well to bring those high-value guests to Macao as well. Rob Goldstein : Great. Thank you for that color. And then just for my follow-up question on Macao. Can you give us sort of a rough sense of that dollar commitment that you've made to invest over the next 10 years in Macao? Kind of roughly what percent of that might be new projects and what percent might be -- might kind of fall into the OpEx line, kind of like overseas marketing and things? Just kind of CapEx versus OpEx split, just ballpark? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. Sure. I think one thing that would be helpful. If you turn to Page 22 in the presentation, you'll see some details on that. So it might be best to refer to those pages because we do break it out, and there are several pages behind it that explain what our concession renewal commitments actually are. So it's there in the presentation. Robin Farley : It's always tough to get through all of your slides before the earnings call. Patrick Dumont : I apologize. I think the key thing here is that we're very committed to investing in the Macao market. We think this investment will drive additional long-term tourism value and diversification of Macao's economy. We're very excited to make these investments, and we think these are things that will really help achieve our goals in the goals of the government. So we're looking forward to it actually. Robin Farley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Shaun Kelley : Good afternoon. Good morning, Grant. So just high level, as you kind of look through kind of what you're seeing probably real time, could you give us just your latest thoughts on maybe the pace of recovery here? Do you expect things to be pretty linear or any chance of whether it's COVID or restriction-related setbacks or anything else that could change what you're seeing on the ground? And obviously, Chinese New Year is fantastic. But it would seem like the opening here is just going to continue.  Any reason that, that would be kind of different from the reality? Or how are you seeing your bookings shape up and the patterns you're expecting to see over the next couple of months? Rob Goldstein : I'd begin by saying, first of all, we're just thrilled to be open and making money and seeing demand like we're seeing. I don't think any of us have the aptitude or the insight to tell you what's going to happen -- they have post-change news.  But I do think longer term, you have to have real strong confidence. And you see -- when you get to see these numbers that we are seeing that this is a market that's going to rebound. This market has a strong base mass, premium mass. And some of the fears be in the market about, it was liquidity like, what's resiliency, I think those fears will be pushed to the side.  What's the trajectory and how fast it happens? I don't think any of us have the gumption to make venture a guess. I think it would be silly. We just feel fortunate we're open. We're operating. We think it keeps getting better, not worse. I don't believe COVID is going to be -- obviously, China has gone through a different trajectory than we did here in the U.S.  But hopefully, that won't be a problem. Again, I don't want to speak anything that I can't speak for. But if things keep going like they're going, we'll all be in a very happy place in 2023, especially, I think, somewhere in the second half of the year. As normal travel patterns resume, Hong Kong gets back on speed, Mainland China. I think there's a lot of growth potential and a lot of good thoughts coming our way vis-a-vis the future. We are -- again, as I said earlier, we're not going to tell you that we don't believe in this -- we believe in this strongly very strongly. We believe in our assets very strongly. We believe in international tourism in Macao very strongly.  So we're not going to predict when it happens, how it happens, how fast it happens. But we feel very positive about what's going to happen in Macao in the long term, very positive. And we're looking to investing money in there and getting back to where we were in the past in Macao. We couldn't be more positive on the can long term. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thanks for that, Rob. And then maybe a little bit more specific one for Grant, if I may. But just wanting to dig in a little bit more on the labor and staffing side of what you're seeing in Macao right now. You talked about the margin structure high level. But are you fully expecting to return to levels of staff that you had pre-COVID?  Are you already there? Will it be even above those levels? Kind of what's needed and what have you optimized? I know those people have -- many of them have found employment elsewhere, the market has grown since where we started. So kind of how do you think about maybe either FTEs or overall operating expense run rates relative to 2019? Grant Chum : I think, Shaun, we've also become more productive and efficient through the past couple of years. So I think we'll have to rethink -- it wouldn't necessarily be referencing exactly back to 2019. And also a mix of product has also changed quite a bit through the Londoner. We do have more high-quality non-gaming asset base to operate as well.  So to give you a bit more color, today, we are short of manpower relative to full operating capacity and relative to the demand that we're seeing. So we're not operating one of the Sheraton Towers as we speak. So we are minus 2,200 rooms from our operating capacity. And our newest hotel Londoner Court, which we soft opened in the past year, we're not at the full operating capacity for that high end all-suite hotel. We're still only about two thirds of the way through in terms of ability of manpower to operate the whole hotel. So both at the top end and at the mass end, we are still short of manpower to operate at full capacity. And we'll be progressively hiring to fill the gaps as we go through the recovery. And hopefully, within the next few months, we're going to be in a better place relative to our full operating potential because we clearly see the demand pattern, I think is going to urge the whole industry to staff up and to be able to operate, especially for these peak periods. And that's another part. We have no crystal ball as Rob says served on the post CNY. But clearly, the early indications of metrics like the demand for the hotels is telling you that, yes, the demand is staging a strong recovery.  And obviously, we're going to have to [ Indiscernible 0 :32:50]. Thanks. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live. Chad Beynon : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In the slide deck, you highlighted principal areas of development being Macao, which we just talked about, Singapore, which we talked about, and New York, which I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on. But second part of that question is, I know in the past, you talked about other potential opportunities in Asia like a Korea or a Thailand, years ago we talked about Japan. Wondering if those are going quiet at this time. So I guess, firstly, on New York, and then secondly, potential Asian opportunities? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Chad, let's revert your mind, I'll reverse it just. I think we all know that Thailand has been discussions there, and we're certainly looking at Thailand. And that's no secret has been in the press that Thailand is a possibility. So we're certainly looking hard at Thailand. I would love to be -- have a presence there in the future. Japan, as you referenced, is not there. And Korea is nothing viable to speak of today. So we'll jump to New York, which is an extraordinary and unique opportunity. And I think for the winning bidder or bidders, it's going to be an amazing opportunity because of a very simple dynamic of a huge market with limited capacity. There's only a few casinos there. It's probably the only place in the U.S. where you can have millions and millions of people, and yet there'll be probably just a handful of casinos total. The win per units there will be exceptional.  The lucky winner is going to do very, very well. I think the evidence of the market is clear just by looking at the three operating properties under the table games. And we really don't have much of a -- it's not a great product right now in New York as far as room capacity. It's still doing approaching USD 2 billion with just slot machines.  So our approach is very much in LVS, it's anchored by an LDH historical approach, which is scale and quality. We're not looking to build a casino, looking to build not a regional casino but rather a truly large hotel with spa convention space, dozens of restaurants, a new theater, a huge entertainment feature, a transformational product, which will positively impact the community and grow tourism a powerful statement. We're not looking to be in this thing in a limited way. We'll be all the way in. And we think if we do it, it will be transformational for the county we're working in, very good for the people in the county and something they can be very proud of. And it will drive tourism -- outsized tourism into Nassau. Our bid is very much traditional on the thinking of LVS large-scale with numerous non-gaming assets, lots of meeting space, probably 400,000 square per foot new space.  So I view New York very much very unique to the rest of the United States. It's not -- it's a population in the many millions to just a couple of casinos, very different here in Las Vegas. We've got a huge local market but dozens and dozens and dozens of casinos. There you'll be basically alone. And so it's going to be very -- it's an exceptional opportunity. It won't come along again. I think this is one and done. So we're trying very hard. And we've been trying to do New York for a number of years, but it looks like this is finally someone's opportunity. Hopefully, it's ours. Chad Beynon : Thank you very much, Rob. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask another one on Macao, now that you've had some more data in the market, Grant. It seems like there's an even bigger shift towards Peninsula -- or I'm sorry, versus to Cotai versus Peninsula than we've seen in the past. I was wondering if you could confirm that or if that's really just kind of a mix of a reflection of what we're seeing from the different modes of transportation. Wondering if that's a trend that could continue in '23.  And then related to that, how are you thinking about your asset and the Peninsula there's CapEx opportunities? I know that's not part of the big CapEx plan. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Grant? Grant Chum : Sure. Rob, should I take that? Yes. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Grant Chum : I think I haven't seen any data on the split between Cotai and Peninsula. However, it stands to reason, I think, structurally, we see -- and we have always said that Cotai will become the primary hub. And I think even pre-COVID, we were already more than half of the mass revenues from Cotai. And I think that trend will continue.  I think there's a lot of different reasons. But I think at its heart, the main reason is just the cluster of world class integrated resorts that you have on Cotai. And what this, I think, next generation of these lifestyle consumers are looking for from Macao as a destination, and all of the investments in non-gaming that are going into basically making these results even more desirable over the next 10 years, all of those structural factors are surely will continue to push the balance of revenues towards the Cotai side, and that's a structural issue that will continue to evolve over the long time. As regards to -- we obviously have one asset on the Peninsula, we do intend to reinvest in that asset. But it clearly the majority -- the vast majority of our capital will still be going towards our Cotai properties. Chad Beynon : Thank you very much. Appreciated. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live. Brandt Montour : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Starting on Singapore. I was curious if you could compare the spend per visitor that you're seeing there to what we saw in Las Vegas in 2020 and 2021. If that's sort of holding up in the same way, if it's -- if the curve looks different quarter-over-quarter. And then if you want to throw Macao early days into that comparison, that would also be helpful. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I think it's really hard to compare between markets. The key thing to note is that it's really all about pent-up demand, consumer tourism experience and the products that we offer. And sort of the nature of those assets for high-quality tourism. So it's not really fair to compare between markets. The price points are different, the consumer behaviors are different. It really doesn't look the same. What is thematically similar is the pent-up demand story.  And Rob -- as I said before, Rob's seen it in his career in other locations. We experienced here in Las Vegas in a very strong way. We saw it in Singapore in a very strong way, and it's still in effect and we're starting to see them in Macao now and it's coming on strong. So I think it's really the nature of consumer behavior as opposed to the specific price points in each market. Brandt Montour : Okay, that's great. Rob Goldstein : It's part of the -- to Patrick's point, think about what Singapore is market GGR versus Macao, Macao could be a $25 billion, $30 billion GGR market has been higher historically. And Singapore just doesn't have the capacity. And then Las Vegas is much more of a -- it's got a gaming component, it's got a very strong non-gaming. So it's almost impossible to apples-to-apples. The driving force is the scale of people in Macao in Singapore -- in Mainland China, the accessibility to adjustable market is so huge in Macao. And so the product offering. To Grant's point, the Peninsula, versus the Cotai, it's got such enormous capacity and great product. It's hard to -- that market is so outsized when it just back at full capacity, it's hard to compare than anything. It's so powerful. Brandt Montour : Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then on Slide 22, the long-term commitments in Macao slide, on the capital, the left side of the slide, I was curious, looking at your plans for the next 10 years if you think you're going to be able to achieve return levels commensurate to recent projects that you've done in that market and you've enjoyed in that market? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, we sure do. We forget, we -- you're talking to a bunch of people have been doing business in the count for 20 years, and we've seen the returns. We've seen what non-gaming can do. Our theaters, our retail, our entertainment has driven billions and billions and billions of dollars of EBITDA, and they will in the future as well. We have no concerns whatsoever about investing and getting a solid return on non-gaming commitments. All they do is drive more visitation to the market. They are additives to the market, certainly going to drive more business right now.  We look at this as a 10-year starting commitment and going beyond that. Our commitment to Macao is as long as we can be there. And so we have no hesitation to invest or show the market a very, very considerable return. Just look we've done in the past. I mean, on our current assets, mostly non-gaming. The lion's share of our investment in Macao is non-gaming, the great majority. It's worked out pretty well for us. So we think next 10 years, we'll continue that trend, and we're very happy and very committed to Macao. Brandt Montour : Excellent. Thanks so much, everyone. Rob Goldstein : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. Ben, your line is live. Ben Chaiken : Hey, everyone. Just a quick one for me. Historically, capital return has been really important to you guys. Obviously, Macao is just beginning to ramp, and there's a lot of areas to invest. But how are you thinking about the dividend these days? Is that still important? And if so, how should we think about timing of that? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. If Sheldon were here, he would say, yay [ ph 0 :42:49], dividends. I think someone put us on hold in Macao. Daniel Briggs : Sorry about that. Rob Goldstein : Brief commercial from Macao. Patrick Dumont : So as I was saying, if Sheldon were here, and we miss him dearly, he would be saying, yay, dividends. I think Las Vegas Sands is a growth company. We're back to growth. We're a development company. We do large-scale developments in key markets. But most importantly, we're also a returning capital company.  And I think as our business returns and as we see normalization of cash flows, we're going to look to start the dividend again and be very shareholder friendly. But at the end of the day, we're very focused on the strength of our balance sheet of new development. And you heard Rob talk about New York, it's very exciting. There are other things that hopefully we'll get a chance to do in the near term. And opportunistically, I think we'll continue to deploy capital where the highest returns are. And as part of that, the dividend will be fundamental to our shareholder return strategy. But I think we're going to wait and see where operating cash flow ends up and we'll make some assessments at that point. Ben Chaiken : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line is live. Steve Wieczynski : Yeah, guys. Good afternoon. So Rob or whoever wants to take this, I mean, if we look at visitation in Macao over the last, let's call it, week or so around the start of Chinese New Year, it does seem like it has been pretty strong. And I guess, is there any commentary or color you could give us about the spending patterns of these folks that are coming to the market? Meaning, are these folks gambling as much as they did before? Or is that some of that spending being pushed more into the non-gaming side of the floor? And maybe it's just too early to tell. But I think with how high Chinese savings levels are right now. I'm just wondering if you can provide any color around that. Rob Goldstein : Yes. Yes. Yes. They're spending in retail, they're spending in gambling, they're spending, as we may have referenced so Steve, it's just the right customers showing up. And I think this is historically how it's worked out in the recoveries where those who are the most aggressive gamers and retail spenders show up first. And we're seeing that strongly in Macao. It's a very good audience, a very strong audience. You'll see the market numbers then come out.  It's really gratifying for those of us who wait along terrible three years to see these days return, and they returned. And I think the real question is these customers that are now the question is, how many more are coming behind them? Because to your point, visitation has been mediocre out of Mainland China, relative to what had been previously. We're not even there. We're getting some pretty big numbers coming out of Macao in the market.  So we're very enthused about it. I don't think -- it's not necessarily choosing gaming or retail, I think they're doing both, and then they're eating and shopping and funding everything. So -- it's very typical of these recovery situations where the people who wanted most to shop there and they're buying their spending enjoying life again. I think the Chinese are no different to the Americans who came to the U.S. markets and enjoy themselves. And hopefully, a party continues is just getting started, and we've got a very encouraging start to this reopening after the last three years.  Grant, do you want add some color to that, any issues you can raise that I haven't? Grant Chum : No, I think it's just as you said. The nature of these reopenings, it will attract the high-quality customers first, and that's what we're seeing. And I think we saw that in Singapore in April as well. We had much stronger recovery in the Southeast Asian overseas spend in Singapore versus the recovery in the tourist arrivals. And I think Macao has also following something similar, except for the fact Macao has a much bigger advantage in being able to support visitation, not just by international airlift, regional airlift, but also by land and sea as well and domestic airlift then connecting through the Southern China as well.  So I think it's -- let's see how -- what the pace of visitation recoveries like versus the revenue recovery. But so far, I think the pattern that we've seen in CNY does support that pattern. Yes, you're getting a much stronger revenue. I think you are in visitation. Rob Goldstein : I think that last comment of Grant's, that's a great one, in that this is on the air dependent market like Singapore. You'll need the airlines. You can come other ways, access to Macao is mostly vehicular or both. So I think it's a huge advantage for Macao that as the population conquers, the virus situation gets more confident, there's nothing to -- no impediments to massive growth in visitation coming to Macao from China. That's a very positive point.  But Steve, look, we just -- we are pleased we're seeing and they're spending in every direction. So we very -- we feel very fortunate. Hopefully, it just continues to ramp up from here. Steve Wieczynski : That's great color. That's it for me, guys. Really appreciated. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, as always. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. Cassandra Lee : Hi. This is Cassandra on behalf of David. Happy Chinese New Year to everyone. Yeah, I think a lot of my questions have been answered already, so I hope it's not getting repetitive. You've mentioned cost issues in all markets, especially in energy wages. So could you discuss to what extent are those permanent? And where we might be run rating in terms of EBITDA versus 2019 level today? Rob Goldstein : We're not going to discuss EBITDA at this point, except for what you've seen in Singapore. I do think energy is a vast thing. It does vastly. It doesn't go one way, as you well know, whereas wages, I think, worldwide are going to be an issue for everybody. And I think we'll deal with that. They're not -- I don't see them coming down a whole lot. Again, our resorts and our capacity constrained ability to price up -- the rating at our business is you can price up and retain your margins. That, I think, will be our strategy in Singapore and also in Macao. I don't think wages are going to decline greatly. I think Grant alluded to efficiencies, and then that's important. We have a large workforce, in the tens of thousands, in Macao. So more efficient and better doing what we do, that should be helpful. But I think we're all going to live with at this point in the U.S. and Asia, higher wages appear to be in the structure for now. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : I think the key thing is that by the nature of our business, we have resiliency in the face of inflation. As Rob mentioned, we have a lot of flexible pricing, hotel rooms, gaming pricing, the way we operate food and beverage, that we operate all of our non-gaming amenities. These are not long-term contracts. We have the ability to go with the market.  So while there are some structural increases around wages, around inputs that we use, at the same time, we have the ability to price because of the unique nature of our products the experiences we offer to be fair to the positioning of the products that we have. We've invested a lot over many years in both markets, the reason why they're so strong. So in our mind, inflation is a real thing. We have to take into account but we have the ability to work through it and actually grow the margins of our business over time. Cassandra Lee : Great. Thank you. And shifting to New York, how do you share or disclose publicly what kind of investments you expect to make if you win the gaming license versus if you don't? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, the current thought in our heads is about $4 billion to $5 billion. Again, this is not a regional casino. This is a full-blown resort. With MICE, entertainment, retail, restaurants, it's the real thing. It's not meant to be a small time investment. We're going all the way in and building something transformational that drives tourism. And we think will be the biggest, in terms of the casino business will be the biggest revenue generator. Cassandra Lee : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, appreciated. Operator : Thank you. And the last question today will be coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Dan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for [ Indiscernible 0 :51:23] I guess, first on Macao. I know VIP was historically about a quarter of your total business. I mean, to what extent, if any, have you seen this customer return and in what form has it been more of a credit, a direct VIP type customer? Or is this customer showing up in premium mass? Patrick Dumont : So one thing to note is the VIP contribution was much lower than that. So let's call it, high single digits, low double digits historically. We've always been mass and premium mass driven. So it's -- on a contribution basis because the margins in premium and VIP and, to be fair, junket business, were always structurally much different than they were for our mass business. So we've always been led on a contribution basis by our mass play and our premium mass play. And you can tell that by our asset base and how we speak to our customers and the type of tourism we attract. That being said, I do want to turn it over to Grant for some additional comments. Grant Chum : Thanks, Patrick. Not a lot to add. I mean, all of our rolling business currently is in the premium direct program. And I think the second point is premium mass is doing recovering much, much faster than premium direct. I think that's what we're seeing right now. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the New York investment, the $4 billion to $5 billion you mentioned, I mean, is there -- should we expect a commensurate return on that type of project that you've seen in your Asia-based investments or given the high density population, the spend curve per unit, is there reasonable to think that there could actually be upside to that kind of 20% historical return? Patrick Dumont : I think for us, we're very focused on return on invested capital. So Rob and the rest of the team really looks everywhere that we can to try to best deploy capital in the highest return outcomes. And so we would be interested in New York, if we didn't think the returns were there. We think it's a very strong potential opportunity. And for us, it's going to be about the jobs we create, about the tourism we drive about the investment in the local community, the relationships that we have. In every market that we're in, we're typically the largest trade partner with small and medium enterprise. We're looking to develop deep community routes, so we can support the community and really show this industry is something that can benefit everyone. So we're very excited about it. We think the returns are there. Otherwise, we wouldn't be interested. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, but we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thanks, Paul. Thank you all for joining the call today. With me today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, EVP of Asia Operations and COO of Sands China. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making those statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We may refer to that presentation during the call. And finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining the call. The results speak for themselves. There is a powerful recovery underway in Macao in both gaming and the non-gaming segments. The future looks very good for both markets. Our commitment to investing in both Macao and Singapore has never wavered. In Macao, following the relaxation of travel restrictions, increased visitation has driven gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy during the quarter. In other words, business is back. Sands China is in unique position to capture the opportunities. Our diversified IR model with continuous investment in non-gaming segments MICE, hotel suites, live entertainment, retail, food and beverage, positions us well to deliver strong growth in the years ahead. Our focus is on all segments in the Macao market, including international tourists. We're excited to have the opportunity to develop -- to deploy more capital to expand our non-gaming offerings in Macao. The $3.8 billion commitment we made as part of the concession tender is just the baseline. We will invest more in this extraordinary market. I look forward to everyone having the opportunity to see, to witness The Londoner and the Four Seasons. The quality of our new products is exceptional. Marina Bay Sands delivered EBITDA of $394 million for the quarter. Mass win was an all-time property record of $549 million. Rolling volumes have nearly equalled the 2019 level. Our $1 billion suite and casino renovation program is progressing. More suite inventory will continue to come online throughout the remainder of the year. We will have 400 suites available by the end of 2023, up from just 150 prior to our renovation. Okay, let's take some questions, and please ask away. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Joe Greff from J.P. Morgan. Joe, your line is live. Joe Greff : Hey, everybody. Congratulations on these results. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Joe. Joe Greff : Rob, Patrick or Dan, whoever wants to take this first one. In Macao, presumably, March was better than February, and February, obviously, was better than January from an EBITDA and an EBITDA margin perspective. I was hoping you can maybe help us understand maybe the margin exit rate coming out of the quarter as we head here into the second quarter. If you've reported 31% margins for the quarter, March was something much higher than that. I was hoping you can help us maybe understand the cadence of EBITDA generation by month and maybe the same thing for margins by month, just so we're, I guess, thinking about it the right way in terms of our projections going forward. Rob Goldstein : Joe, I'll ask Patrick to take it. But before I do, I'll just say, I think you have to realize, I think you do realize that Macao is in its infancy as far as a return to a more normal operating environment. It's not even -- I think we're -- it's still early days there. This first quarter is still not representation of what can happen in Macao or will happen. So, I wouldn't call it normal operating mode. And as you referenced, the acceleration in revenues is clearly there and that will accelerate margins. Patrick, you want to add some more color. Patrick Dumont : Thanks. Rob. Joe, it's an interesting question. I think we've been very focused on margins for many years at SCL. Unfortunately, operating environment during the pandemic made it very hard to see the benefit of some of the work that the team has done over the years to make the business itself more efficient. I think in the long-run, we're going to look to see some significant operating leverage and the performance out of Macao, particularly as we reach a higher level of performance in a more normalized environment. I will say that there was a material difference in performance across the quarter. January was obviously impacted because, on January 8, the opening occurred. And then, subsequent to that, February is typically a very slow month post the Lunar New Year. But March was a very exciting time. A lot of things were going full steam ahead. It's very excited to see the recovery, the increase in tourism. And so, margins did recover to a more normal level. There's a lot of noise in the quarter because of the start-up. But I think overall, our long-term outlook for margins is quite strong. I think we've done a good job managing costs historically. I think the business itself was set up to be efficient. And I think in the long-run, given the mix of business, we should see a favorable margin operating environment. Grant, I don't know if you have any comments you'd like to add to that. Grant Chum : Sure. Yeah, thanks, Patrick. Yeah, maybe I can just give some color on the March trends. I think, Joe, you're right, the market experienced strong recovery through the quarter. So, pretty much across all operating metrics, March was better than January and February average. I mean, just as a starting point, in Macao, overall visitations city-wide were up 22% in March versus the first two months of the year. For our portfolio, the gaming volume, non-rolling drop and slot handle were both up 10% in March versus the first two months. Rolling volumes accelerated a lot more than that during that month, not least because we're starting to get some traction on the foreign VIPs coming to Macao, to our properties. Hotel occupancy improved. Occupied room nights increased by 8% in the month versus the first two months, as we were able to operate more hotel rooms with the additional manpower that's coming on board in the second half of the first quarter, and that will significantly increase further into the second quarter. So, overall, yes, I mean, March was a very pleasing month in terms of evolving trends. And as Patrick said, operating margin did recover and did recover more in March, but hopefully this is just the beginning. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you for your comments there. You mentioned that 31% of your rooms in Macao were out of service related to labor constraints. Where does that stand now? And can you talk about labor constraints now? And how are you remedying that? Grant Chum : Sure. Rob, shall I take that? Rob Goldstein : Yes, please, Grant. Yeah, you're closest to that. Sure. Grant Chum : I mean, hotel room inventory, Joe, availability, the actual availability for the first quarter, yeah, was around 7,700 rooms for SCL portfolio-wide. So effectively, we were accommodating as many rooms as we could, given the manpower constraints during the quarter. As I just referenced, it did improve somewhat in March as the additional hiring of the labor came on board, and the Macao government and the labor bureau have been very supportive in helping us to bring on the labor that we need to operate, especially the hospitality side of the business, the hotel and restaurants. As we go into second quarter, we would expect that, on average, second quarter, we can reach 10,700 rooms in terms of operating capacity. So that's roughly 3,000 additional hotel rooms that we will be able to operate in the second quarter, and that, obviously, takes us up to the much close to our physical available inventory. And we will reach the 12,000 probably sometime in the third quarter, in time for the summer peak season, as additional hiring and training completes through the second quarter. Rob Goldstein : So, Grant, is it safe to say the labor issues are not event for the entire market by summertime? Grant Chum : Yeah, Rob, I think for most of the market, for the second quarter, it's effectively a non-issue from a hotel operating capacity. Obviously, the size of our inventories is the biggest. We'll take a little bit time to get up to full capacity, but obviously, there is a big difference already that we can see between operating 10,700 rooms versus 7,700. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Grant. Good job. Joe Greff : Thank you, guys. Rob Goldstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, everybody, thank you. Rob, just as it pertains to MBS, obviously, now Macao has gotten up and running and you're starting to see things normalize with obviously the comments there on March. Have you guys seen anything change behaviorally? I mean, we see the results. It doesn't look like anything's changed. But I was just wondering if there was anything that you've seen change in terms of demand around either the high end or the premium mass segments in MBS post kind of resumption of activity in Macao, as it continues to ramp? Rob Goldstein : Carlo, one thing I thought I understood and I think I was wrong in that respect was the super high-end premium customer in Asia. I thought we would dominate completely in Singapore. We're seeing Singapore is doing very well. We've equalled our 2019 rolling volumes. But what surprised me to the upside is the international demand for Macao, and rolling volume in Macao has been very pleasant, much more than I thought, that we could be rolling in that market far in excess of $20 billion, $25 billion annually, this keeps going. So, there has been a pleasant surprise -- has not hurt us in Singapore if you look at the numbers, but of course, there's only so much money out there, so it might have some impact. Singapore, as you see, had record numbers on the -- the slot numbers are astounding, to be at 900-plus per unit. I've never seen that in any market I've worked in, on especially the scale of machines, the market plus our non-rolling win. To exceed 6 million a day, it's pretty extraordinary. And that's what the impediments and the big headwinds of our rooms being down, our casino being torn up and there is yet to be a recovery of the Chinese consumer into Singapore at the level I think it will get to. So, the pleasant surprise is, Macao is attracting a very strong international Asian high-end customer and yet we're doing fine in Singapore. We may be sharing a very large rolling business between Singapore and Macao for long time to come. I had that wrong pleasantly. I do think the slot business in Singapore and the non-rolling is just the beginning of a trend, a very strong trend. Once we get these rooms back and the casino and -- who knows where it goes. If we make $2.5 billion, $3 billion of those segments in the years to come, maybe. But clearly, we're very happy with the results. For Singapore to do this well this early [in the day] (ph) without a full blown China recovery, it's pretty impressive. I think, we can believe we can make $500 million a quarter in the near future when things get back to a stronger place. So, we're very pleased in both markets for different reasons. Carlo Santarelli : Great. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up. I guess, my question is more along the lines of, are you surprised by -- when you are looking at deck, obviously, your premium mass business looks like it's recovering or I should say, your base mass business is recovering relative to the first quarter of '19, very similarly to the premium mass business. And given where visitation is today relative to '19, is that dynamic surprising to you guys at all? Rob Goldstein : It is to me. I think if we go Page 14 of our deck to see the visitation [being like] (ph) 40% and yet see a recovery where it's at, it's very encouraging for future. The trajectory of Macao feels very good to us. And as Joe alluded to, the growth between January, February, March, it looks very [indiscernible] not be encouraged when you see. We made $400 million roughly without visitation really coming back very much, without hotel rooms being fully occupied, without a lot of impediments, a lot of headwinds and yet here we are. So, yeah, it's very encouraging for us and to the market. And of course, we're the biggest beneficiary of the recovery of base mass since we -- that's our dominant position. But I want also allude to the fact that we believe with our new Londoner and Four Seasons suite and physical product, we're going to compete very favorably, not just the base mass, not just retail, we're going for the very top-end of the market as well to dominate that, and we believe we can do it in both the rolling and non-rolling segments. We have both scale in terms of suite product, but also great aesthetic. When you see what we've done, we were there, and you see the new Londoner, you see the new Four Seasons, I promise you, you will be overwhelmed with the product of quality. What that team has done is exceptional work. So, for us, we see no segment in Macao to our competitors. We want to be first in every category. I believe it's possible with our new products. Carlo Santarelli : Great, thanks very much. Grant Chum : Rob, maybe I can just add something on the... Rob Goldstein : Yes, please, jump in, Grant. Grant Chum : Sorry. Okay. Just to add something to Rob's comment on the premium mass versus mass off the question, yes, it looks like from the deck that we recovered at a similar rate on the premium mass and mass win versus first quarter of 2019. But overall, in terms of volumes and headcount, it was definitely a premium mass led recovery and the quality of customer has been increasing and the spend per head. The win comparison with 2019 is more hold related issue on the premium mass segment for both 2019 and 2023. But overall, premium mass gaming volume, gaming drop and headcount recovery is faster than base mass. But I think to Rob's points, we've been essentially out competing in the premium segments in both VIP and premium mass as you can see from the market share in the first quarter. Our non-rolling drop recovered to two-thirds of the first quarter of 2019 level. That's in line with the overall market recovery in mass, despite a much bigger dependence on base mass. So, as the base mass, which has been lagging in the recovery, starts to ramp up, especially as more hotel rooms come online for city -- for the whole city and for our portfolio, and also that visitations pickup and transportation and logistics improve, we should obviously be the biggest beneficiary of that base mass recovery. And some of that you can already see in the way we've outperformed in a slot electronic gaming market. Slot handle recovering to over 73% of 2019. And that has a lot more exposure. I mean, Hong Kong base mass is a much bigger part of slot and tables, and obviously, Hong Kong base mass has recovered faster as you can see from the visitations where Hong Kong visitations are already 75% of where they were in 2019, and you can see that outperformance in electronic gaming has been strong, both in absolute terms and relative to the market. Carlo Santarelli : Certainly. Thank you very much for the additional context. I appreciate it. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Carlo. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Robin Farley : Great, thank you. Grant, following on your comments about the strength of the recovery being that by the premium mass side, I'm curious if you're seeing any impact at all from visa policy that is sometimes turning down kind of frequent visitors or multiple visits in a period. Sounds like it's not impacting the recovery in your view. But I'm just curious if you're seeing any impacts from that. Rob Goldstein : Grant? Grant Chum : Rob, shall I take that? Rob Goldstein : Please, yes. Grant Chum : Yeah, Robin, I think for -- if you look at the visitation, overall, we are seeing a much faster recovery from Guangdong than from the non-Guangdong provinces. I think that's for obvious reasons, the proximity, the ease with which the visitors from the neighboring province can get to Macao. From my point of view, I think the biggest impediment to a higher rate of recovery in non-Guangdong visitation is actually the amount of hotel room inventory that was unavailable in the first quarter. I mean, we're the biggest repository of hotel rooms and we're with offline by 36%. And for the city as a whole, obviously, the percentage of out of rooms availability was also very significant. So, I think people have kind of high propensity to think about coming to Macao. I think the hotel room inventory issue has been a big impediment. But that's obviously easing dramatically as we get into the second quarter. And then, transportation is still only a fraction of what it was, especially in routes like from Hong Kong to Macao. Our ferries are only 20% of where they were in 2019 during the first quarter. And yeah, obviously, the visitation from Hong Kong has been so strong. So, I think overall, the visitation recovery is progressing very well, but you've got to bear in mind a couple of those pain points that are both, I think, I would say, easing quite significantly, and that's the hotel room inventory and the transportation. Robin Farley : Great, and that's helpful. Thanks. And then, just as my follow-up, if I could. Understanding, it's going to take a couple of quarters for all your hotel rooms to be up and running, at that point, when you think about the run rate where you are for operating expense, how would you compare that to 2019? Is there any kind of permanent reduction in some way in operating expense? Or in fact is -- does the labor issue, mean that costs are going to be higher when you're kind of fully ramped up? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Take it, Grant. Grant Chum : Yeah. I think clearly we -- as we add headcount to man, to operate all of our inventory on the hospitality side, our payroll cost will start to go up. But obviously, we expect the revenue to be rebounding a lot more. So, I think this is just the ordinary course of ramping up the capacity. We achieved multiple rounds of cost savings over the years. After the 2014 downturn, we achieved some sustainable savings from that round. We made some additional structural cost savings on our expenses during the pandemic, and we hope to hold on to some of those savings. But, in terms of the labor portion, absolutely we have to invest in the manpower to get our assets back up to full operating capacity and, obviously, the cost will grow in line with that. But clearly, we want to be operating 12,000 rooms, not 7,700. So, this is something we're trying to do as quickly as we can. Robin Farley : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun. your line is live. Shaun Kelley : Hi, great. Thanks. Just, maybe to start, if we could go back to a couple of your comments, Rob, on that base mass versus some of the premium mass mix and the surprise there. I mean, is -- a healthy way to think about the mix that we're seeing in the market today, just kind of low double digit increase in spend per visit, is that -- if I look at the 62% base mass versus, let's call it, 48% overall visitation growth, is that reflective of market conditions, or is there some subtext or some difference that we should be thinking about, or did that change throughout the quarter at all? Just trying to kind of get a sense of what's pent-up demand and how much of this is just getting the bodies back into the property. Rob Goldstein : I think, one thing we would be careful of, we're -- again, we're in early innings here. In fact, we haven't -- I would say, if you're playing golf, we're still in the driving range. I mean, we haven't gotten the first tee yet. This market, 100 days ago, Grant reminded me, we're kidding about the market, hoping to see a profitable quarter in '22. We now just gave you a $400 million number. I think my point is, it's evolving so quickly and the movement -- if you look at -- I don't think it's easy to spot trends. I think clearly the base mass to Grant's comment, has been somewhat confusing and his thoughts recovered much better than base mass tables. But again, I think it's very difficult to assign the certainty to where the trends are going. I just think, when you look at the page -- Slide 16 or 14, you'll see the non-Guangdong visitation, which is pretty weak, and there is so much more room to run here. I think when this is all said and done, we'll make a lot more money with a very healthy margin and all this will be left behind the desk. I just don't think we can take -- what really effectively half of January, two months subsequent and assign real value to it. Yeah, it's just too early to figure it out. Grant, please jump in. Grant Chum : No, not a lot more to that, Rob. Yeah, I think you covered it well. Rob Goldstein : Shaun, what else you got? Rob Goldstein : Great. I mean, the other question would be the follow-up and maybe a little bit indulgent, but I'll try. Just trying to get a sense of kind of... Rob Goldstein : Indulge us. Shaun Kelley : Just trying to get a sense of market share as we, let's call, exited the quarter, be it March or some [amount] (ph) of run rate, as we look at it, some of the checks suggested that it was accelerating and you did very well. It probably depended a little bit of the timing on some of that base mass recovery, but for the quarter, we calculated you at around 27% share. And just kind of curious if that was level across the quarter? Did you kind of -- was it your exit rate meaningfully higher than that? I'm just kind of trying to, again, probably extract a little too much from where we are in the recovery, but we want try anyways. Rob Goldstein : All right. Patrick is going to take a look at that. Patrick Dumont : Yeah, it's an interesting question. I think when we look at Macao, it's a story of investment. So, if you think about the growth in Macao and the asset base that we have and why we're able to get the visitation and the productivity out of the assets, it's because of our scale of investment in non-gaming. It's the rooms, it's the retail, it's the entertainment, it's the food and beverage, it's all the things that drive tourism value. And so, we invested $2.2 billion across the pandemic. So, from our standpoint, it's a new day. And we have probably one of the most important assets we have created in The Londoner, which was Sands Cotai Central. There's a lot of productivity that's available there. We have 650 new suite that we didn't have pre-pandemic. There's a lot of volume that we're going to be getting that we never had access to, now that the pandemic recovery is underway. And I think the other thing that's important to note is we've done this two other times. So, we were in the Las Vegas market during the recovery. And we saw the schedule and let's call it the slope of recovery related to pent-up demand in the marketplace and recovery of tourism. We went through that. We saw it in Singapore and the different stages of tourism access that occurred in a very controlled market in that recovery. And now we're seeing unfettered access to what is probably the best cluster tourism assets in all of Macao globally. And they've been continued to be invested in. There's a lot of depth to the market. And it is the beginning innings. It's early. So to call a market share now is a little tough, because it's not really comparable to pre-pandemic, because of the amount of investment and some of the dynamics changes that have happened to the market in the last three years. So, from our standpoint, I think we put up a good quarter. I think we're positioned well. As Grant mentioned, we're very excited about the additional inventory coming online as we get manpower into the buildings. And I think we're in a good place to continue to grow. So, we're not really looking at market share right now as much as we're looking at investment, visitation, access, customer service and then margin and outcome. And you saw the results of that in the quarter that we just had. So, March was really good. We're really excited about it. We're in a great trend. And we're going to keep pushing. Shaun Kelley : Congratulations. Thanks very much. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live. David Katz : Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just go back to the direct VIP business in both markets. And I know you made some commentary about sort of where Singapore is coming from and where some of the extra business is coming from. But can you help us understand the direct VIP opportunity in Macao? And are there any insights that we can learn from about where that could evolve to over time relative to what we saw in the past, understanding it's a completely different business today? Rob Goldstein : Yeah, I think we're all in the same boat here as far as not really knowing how -- I think the first quarter is indicative that there is a VIP market. Our rolling volumes indicate that. We wonder if it can increase, keep going. One surprise to me has been the acceptance of foreign visitation from non-China countries into Macao. It makes sense to me. The quality of product there, the diversity of product, the experience, there is very -- it's an exciting place to visit, easy to access, getting easier, especially for foreigners. So, I think that's going to continue to build. Also the people there -- it's obvious because the structural junk is disappearing. It's a much different approach. And these are people you have to know who they are, credit wise, et cetera, to be in business with them. But I don't think it slows down. My sense is, Macao has such a compelling product and such diversity of compelling products and has such great food and retail, it's just an exceptional place for visitor internationally. And I think you'll see more and more of that trend. I don't think it will cost as business in Singapore in terms of -- I think people will still obviously get to Singapore for the same reasons. But Macao, I think has a better future on the direct rolling business that I anticipated. And I think it's driven by, again, access, quality of product and people want to go there, and it's evident here in the first quarter. Obviously, the -- it's impacted by our retail sales as well. You can see the quality of our retail business in Macao, it's a direct relationship with the super high-end that come to visit. That's again, early innings, non-junket, liquidity issues, a lot of unknowns at this point. I don't think we should pretend to know what the future looks like, but I think there is a very positive trend in the right direction. Grant, do you want to comment? Grant Chum : Sure. Yeah. I think Rob is absolutely right. The attraction of Macao to foreign VIP gamer is immense and I think the pleasant surprise, although we are obviously redoubling our assets post the concession tender in bringing international visitation to Macao and the VIP gaming was the first natural place to start, given that the general airlift, commercial air flights are still a fraction of where they were in 2019. So, I think this direct VIP performance that you referenced, it was very healthy during the quarter and kept growing and we don't know where it grows to, but there's no reason to believe that it wouldn't continue to grow, given the quality of the product. And you can see, not just the strong product appeal for the premium customer that we provide, but we provide such a diversity of -- such a clustering effect of so many world-class resorts and we already have four of them in our portfolio. But together with all of the other colleagues in the industry, it's an amazing clustering of world-class premium gaming destination that should appeal to the Asian regional players over time. And then, I think the other point that is, I think specifically for us, we've been doing this for a long, long time in terms of our international direct VIP around the Asia region. Las Vegas, Macao, Singapore, this is not a new structure to us. We've just got enormous ability to promote Macao now to the foreign countries, because we have the capacity, and to Patrick's point, we have the new product that we've never had before, the availability of the top-quality suites, the top-quality salons. So, we're going to be -- we have been and we're going to continue to use our international sales network that we have the biggest infrastructure across Asia in the industry and that's where we're going to combine the benefit of this premium product, Macao as a destination for these Asian gamers. With our sales infrastructure that will continue to expand. So, I think the future is very bright for foreign visitation and foreign VIP market into Macao. David Katz : If I can just -- thank you for that. And if I can just follow-up quickly. In terms of which -- any color on sort of which countries and where this is sort of coming from and any sensibility about kind of the sustainability? Obviously, you feel like you can continue to grow them, but the non-Chinese, other countries, and the degree to which extending credit may cost a little bit more along the way. Any color there would be helpful too. Rob Goldstein : We won't be, David, country-specific, we won't do that. But I would just say to you, the demand is in a number of countries. And I think Grant's last point was very interesting. I was juffling, because he's actually right. We've been doing this for decades. In Asia, we have a very strong sales force. A lot of same people have been with us for 20 years and represents in Las Vegas and of course Singapore, Macao. So, we are the beneficiaries of that sales system. But I think the high-end is probably built now in Singapore and Macao is going to drive that customer. Is this sustainable? Does it grow? I don't want to predict the future. I just don't know. But if it does, I think we will be the biggest beneficiary of it, because again, we have the biggest network and we have all these different places that we can take people within Macao, and of course to Singapore. So, it's hard to predict because again, it's early innings here. But I think if there's a strong rolling business in Macao, I think we'll get a big chunk of that. And time will tell how big it is, liquidity issues. But the MICE and the junket business clearly has a new day there. But if we can roll $20 billion, $30 billion, it would feel like a good place to be, if that's possible. David Katz : Thank you very much. Londoner looks great. Rob Goldstein : Oh, thank you. You saw it? We love people seeing it, because it's only halfway there, but what we've built so far is, we're just very proud of it. Thank you. David Katz : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live. Brandt Montour : Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Rob Goldstein : Hey, Brandt. Brandt Montour : So, given -- thanks. So, given Grant laid out a pretty good case based on the transportation impediments and the hotel room inventory impediments, that premium mass visitation could very well outgrow base mass visitation from here. I hope I'm not putting words in anybody's mouth. But could you give us some insight into what you're seeing in terms of premium mass win per visitor and compare that to other markets that you saw reopening post-COVID and sort of an index to 2019? Just trying to get a sense for how the pent-up demand on a per person basis is really trending. Rob Goldstein : I'll just make a few comments and I'll pass on to Grant. I think the key thing here is having seen this, as we said before, in several other markets. This is an impressive recovery. It's very strong. The people who can get there are consuming meaningfully in all segments, retail, food and beverage, on the gaming side, on the hospitality side. So, it's great to see. It's very exciting. I don't know that in any of our markets, we had a quarter with this amount of EBITDA recovery this quickly after opening. So that's a good indicator. And so, I think we're very excited about that. I think, it's hard to call these things are -- it's -- I wish we had a crystal ball, but I think at this point, we look at the recovery and it's very encouraging. I will turn it over to Grant to see if he has an additional remark. Grant Chum : Yeah. I would say, the points that we're making on the hotel room inventory and transportation, it's more a reflection of what happened in the first quarter. I think, if anything, those factors obviously improve and has been improving dramatically into March and into second quarter. So, we obviously hope that the base mass would catch up assuming as we are the biggest beneficiary of that segment. And then, I think spend per head for the entire market is clearly up and the quality of customer is very high. And I think it really applies to all segments. You only have to walk through the different properties. You can see the level of spending power, not least in our retail, more -- we're up 18% in overall retail sales versus 2019, but clearly the luxury segment, it's up a lot more. And that's with obviously only [40%-something] (ph) of visitations that we had in 2019. So, not just in gaming, but also in the non-gaming and retail, you can see those trends were consistent in the first quarter. But hopefully, we can start to see the base mass visitation growing and the hotel room occupancy growing for the entire market. Brandt Montour : Great, thanks for that. And switching gears maybe to New York. Just curious if you're willing to give any updated thoughts on the RFP process there? If you think the timeline has shifted since we've talked about it three months ago? Any other comments on the factors for winning that third license? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. New York, work in progress, waiting response from the government. Obviously, it has pushed back. We're here and we don't know for a fact, let's begin there. But we've been told, it could be early first quarter of 2024. But again we have no definitive date at this time. We do believe we have a very compelling bid. The project is in sync with our historical approach to development. It's large scale resort with enormous non-gaming amenities, hotel, convention space, entertainment, spa, et cetera, very beautiful design, very much LVS spirit, the way hotel should be designed as a real resort, a real destination. We have close to 80 acres. So, I think we have a very special bid, a very compelling bid, and I hope the market sees it that way. Timing will reign with New York State's government, and again we hope it's the first part of '24. No more to say about that at this time. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Grant. Brandt Montour : Great, thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line is live. Steven Wieczynski : Hey, guys, good afternoon. So, Rob or whoever wants to take this. I mean, if we look at visitation into Macao over the last, let's call a month or so, it seems like there might have been or there might has been a change in the makeup of the typical visitor coming into the market. And based on some reports that have been out there in the market, it seems like there are potentially more tour groups and stuff like that coming into the market versus pre-pandemic. So just -- I'm just trying to -- just wondering how you're thinking about the spending characteristics or wallet size of the typical customer today versus what that typical customer looked like previously. I'm not sure I asked that question really the right way. So, if I didn't, let me know. Rob Goldstein : I think you asked it perfectly. It's a good question. Grant, do you want tackle that first? Grant Chum : Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think we're trying to get recovery in all segments of the market, as the tourism market is multifaceted in terms of the different segments. And the tour groups with the last segment to really be recovering. So that's only been taking place in the second half of the first quarter. So yes, the first visitors to come back been more at the premium end and over time, you're going to get all the other segments recovering in good time. And I don't think there's any difference fundamentally in terms of how these different segments behave or perform versus 2019. I think in general, of the people who have been coming back, I think you've seen a higher propensity to spend. But over time, as the other segments come back, I don't think we should necessarily expect a fundamentally different mix or fundamentally different profile within each of those segments. Yeah, so the only different point to make at this juncture is that, yes, across all segments, the spend -- spending power is higher than what it was and propensity spend is higher, and we'll see where that evolves over time. Rob Goldstein : Steve, I think we all agree that what Grant just said, we have total confidence that this market will look a lot like it did before. The only difference structurally is the junket situation. But maybe the more affluent have gotten better access earlier, but I'm a staunch believer that that market will come roaring back in the base mass. You walk around the Peninsula, you see already the base mass is booming down there, although it's just lower-quality spend than premium base mass. But I think the base mass market will come back, the question is how quickly it does come back. But this market will look fundamentally the same in 2023 and '24 as it did in '18 '19, I'm pretty confident of that. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, thanks for that, guys. I appreciate that. And then, Rob, I think the slide - what number is it, number 23, it's pretty interesting in terms of how you laid out your Macao capital commitments for the next 10 years or so. I don't know if you answered this, but if you think about that potential all-in, the $4.5 billion that you might have to spend over the next 10 years, is there any way you could help us think about what you guys are kind of targeting for a potential return on that commitment? Rob Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Yeah, I think we've always said publicly that we look towards a 20% return on invested capital there. But I have to tell you, Macao is a bit of fantastic market to invest in over the last 20 years. We're very excited to follow through this commitment and we look forward to the opportunity to actually invest more. If you look at the growth of our company, it's because of the investments we've made in Macao in non-gaming. It's an extraordinary tourism market. The consumer responds very well, and we're very excited about the opportunity this new concession to invest more than what we have on this page. So, it's something that we're very focused on and we look forward to the opportunity to do it. Rob Goldstein : I think we're going to be raging bulls on Macao, investing in the future. And they're fairly look-back to our past and further, you can see our future, which is going to be, we believe non-gaming assets are wildly profitable, but they also drive gaming assets. It's all in sync. So we build more hotels or we build more retail or anything, it drives the gaming win. We've got plenty of positions to fill and to grow those numbers. When you look at the slot number coming to Singapore and the win per unit and tables, you realize just how far Macao can get to. So, we never saw the investment in the concession being an ending point. We saw it the beginning point. We much believe that Macao in next 10 years will make a lot of money for us. We're very bullish on the market and we're thrilled to be there. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Rob Goldstein : Sure. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And the last question today is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Dan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on the quarter. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan. Dan Politzer : First, I wanted to touch on Macao. Can you talk a little bit about the recovery level across the properties there, and which have been most impacted by room and labor constraints versus mass versus premium mass mix? And then, similarly with Londoner and the suite investments that you've made, what's kind of been the kind of the early read out of the gate and your expectation on recouping that typical 20% return on those investments in terms of timing? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Grant, are you still awake? Grant, please take that. Grant Chum : Yeah, sure. I think between the properties, Londoner clearly is the most impacted by the hotel room availability. So, you can see that the reported, like physical inventory, occupancy is only 46%, 47% for the property as a whole. And that's the biggest repository of hotel rooms in our portfolio. So, clearly the impact for that property was the greatest. But at the same time, it kind of flips into your -- second part of your question. The portion that we were operating, especially the newer product on the north side of the building and the new suites, we've really had an exceptional customer response to the product. I think not just the excellence of the design and hardware, but also combined with the actual programing of the hospitality, and just the levels of service that bespoke hospitality that we're offering, but doing so at scale. So in terms of those return questions that you asked, we see the early signs are very, very positive from the new product, including the new suites at Londoner hotel, and also the brand new Londoner Court, which is offering very different kinds of bespoke luxury hotel experiences for the customer. But overall for the property, it's a big property. We are hampered by the lack of hotel room availability during the quarter for sure, but, of the new product that we're actually operating, the initial results are, I think, very-very pleasing. Dan Politzer : Got it, thanks. And then just turning to Singapore. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes the reopening of China? And I know inbound travel from China has been a little bit slower to recover, but, I guess how do you think about that recovering over the course of the year? And then, similarly, China customer base that had been in Singapore, are you still seeing that customer, or have those -- has that base gone back to China? Rob Goldstein : Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Thanks. It's a very interesting question. I think with the opening of China on January 8, there hasn't been a huge influx of Chinese visitation in the early part of the quarter. But there is an ongoing ramp of outbound tourism from China, that we will be the beneficiaries from. And that's something that we've been anticipating a long time. There is not the normal level of flights. There is not the, let's call, the normal airlift capacity that you would expect during a normal run rate period, which they're going to slowly ramp into. So across the year, our expectation is that, that visitation will recover. It's such a strong market for Singapore, has been historically, and yet we're able to execute these levels without that market really contributing. So we're very bullish on the opportunity of outbound tourism from China to support Marina Bay Sands and its ultimate growth to where Rob has mentioned earlier in the call and beyond. There is one other comment that I do want to make. We had a very interesting question from Steve just prior to yours about the level of investment that we're willing to make in Macao. And I think we're very optimistic about our investments there. It's a high return environment. We're very focused on continued investment there, not only through the fulfillment of our concession renewal, but also in general, to grow our non-gaming asset base. But the same thing was true in Singapore. I think we're very focused on growing Singapore as a market. The opportunity there is very unique. It's a really high-value tourism market that has a different catchment area than Macao. We're very excited about the Marina Bay Sands expansion. Although, just to sort of comment on it, kind of going down that vein, we have very high expectations for return on invested capital in both these markets. But when we first went into the Marina Bay Sands expansion in 2019 and we entered into a development agreement in April of 2019, a lot of things have changed. So it's probably going to be a lot more expensive. The pandemic brought additional costs. There has been material -- labor and material cost increases. There has been significant inflation globally, as everyone knows. It's just overall market conditions. But I think from what you see in this quarter, is that the strength in the market is on full display. We really believe that it's going to get stronger over-time. And particularly with investment in high-quality tourism assets, which is what the Marina Bay Sands expansion is. But I think it's really important to note that there's been significant inflation since we began discussions a year ago. So the cost at Marina Bay Sands expansion is going be a lot higher. The good news is, the market is so good. We think the opportunity is going to be a lot stronger or will do a lot better. So, I think to set expectations, the investments that we make, both in Macao, are going to be very strong return. We're very excited about them over the next concession periods. We're really looking forward to investing in Marina Bay Sands expansion. We think it's going to be a great asset. But both of these are going to be expensive. The good news is that we believe the returns are there or we wouldn't be doing them. So, I don't think our investment thesis has changed in either market with the cost inflation. We believe in our long-term success in these markets. We sort of have a very long-term thesis in both of them and going to deploy capital into both in scale. And we're going to look for high returns, and we feel very strongly about the opportunity in both of these markets. But I did want to say that it's going to be expensive and it's going to be worth it. Rob Goldstein : We are fortunate to be in two markets : one, our expense, the two, reward the money spend. I think we're very fortunate to be in a market that can grow and grow, and we will continue to invest heavily because we believe we'll get back to much bigger numbers in both markets. So stay tuned. We appreciate your time today. Thank you very much. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. We will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thank you and thanks for joining us today. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Dumont, our President and COO; Dr. Wilfred Wong, the President of Sands China, and Grant Chum, EVP of Asia Operations and COO of Sands China. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making those statements under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We may refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please post one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. The powerful recovery taking place in Macao and Singapore is evident in our results. We believe it's early days and there's still room to run in both those markets. We continue to invest in both markets for our future growth. We do have a structural advantage in Macao based on our scale. As the market accelerates, we will be a major beneficiary in the future. Singapore continues to do well despite two impediments. We're in the midst of $1 billion renovation, which does impact adversely the results in Singapore. In addition, we haven't seen a full return of the Chinese premium mass segment yet. This iconic building has a very bright future. Cash flow recovery is in full bloom. So it's very, very enjoyable to say, yay, dividends. Let's go to some Q&A. First question, please. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live. Joe Greff : Hey, everyone. Rob Goldstein : Hi, Joe. Joe Greff : Rob, Patrick, Dan, and the team in Macao, I'd love to get your view on margins in Macao, both within the quarter. And then just broadly how you're thinking about it going forward. When you look at the months within the 2Q, was there a differential between margins exiting the quarter in June versus the first couple of months? And then related to that, I'm assuming you're under the belief and impression that monthly GGRs can continue to grow sequentially. I would imagine in the summer months that would follow typical sequential seasonal trends, and margins from here probably have more upsides than downsides from 2Q levels. So my question is specifically this going forward, how do you think about the flow-through on incremental revenue growth from here? And then I have a follow-up. Rob Goldstein : Yeah. Joe, I'll start and then turn over to Grant for the margin discussion. Obviously, we do believe that the market is starting to get stronger, and you saw that in our numbers. Our June results were the strongest, almost $200 million of EBITDA in June alone, so we had acceleration in the quarter. Our numbers, I think, speak for themselves, they speak loudly. Six months ago we were virtually closed, and in the month of June, again, we do $200 million EBITDA. And visitation increases in the town. I think the visitation issue is going to drive obviously the GGR escalation. I just do believe we will be the beneficiary because of our scale and $15 billion of investment will pay off quite well. We have adequate room to run because we have capacity in every segment of the gaming and nongaming. We have, I think, a very strong advantage in that regard. So, again, we think as the GGRs escalate from more visitation, we will be a major beneficiary. As to margin, Grant, I hope you're awake in Macao. Please answer that. Grant Chum : Thanks, Rob. Yeah, Joe, margin obviously has continued to improve as we grow the revenues on optimal cost structure. Normalized margins up about 240 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And I think that will continue to rise as revenues continue to recover. We do have a more profitable business mix than 2019, as does the whole industry because we have a greater proportion of mass relative to VIP. But recall, relative to the industry, we always had a much greater proportion of our GGR in mass. So 87% of our GGR this quarter is in mass versus 71% in Q2 of 2019. And also the shift between gaming and nongaming, and recall, we're the dominant revenue generator in nongaming in the industry, and nongaming is rising as a percentage of our revenues going from 17% in 2019 to 22% this quarter, so both of these mix shifts are positive for margin. We are, obviously, reinvesting our revenues back into the business to increase our capability to handle more visitors, chiefly increasing our headcount to service more hotel rooms. That's for sure one of the things that we've achieved this quarter where our room operating capacity was back to 10,700 rooms on average for the quarter. And as we go into the summer, as we discussed last time, we're heading back to 12,000 rooms in terms of our operable hotel room capacity, so that entire labor shortage issue has dissipated as an impediment. And then in terms of intra-quarter, margins are related to the revenue recovery rate, and June was the standout month for sure for us. We recovered for the second quarter as a whole, as you can see, 85% of 2019 levels in terms of mass revenues for the second quarter. But in June, our mass revenue were about 97%, almost at full recovery to June 2019. So the acceleration in June was really very broad-based. We saw underlying visitation recovery obviously, Macao visitation recovering to almost 70% of 2019. And all of our key volume metrics were up significantly against April and May, so our non-rolling drop increased 15% against April-May. In June, slot handle was up 9% and rolling volume was up 10%, so across the board we saw a very sharp acceleration in June. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. Rob Goldstein : But also reference page 14 of the deck, I think the structure to look at what's happening in the provinces beyond Guangdong and non-Guangdong visitation and lack of penetration. It's just early days, this recovery. And I think if you look at '14, it gives you a really good snapshot of what we believe is the beginning of a strong recovery. Hopefully, this summer will evidence more and more return to pre-pandemic numbers in the non-Guangdong visitation. And that's going to fuel this business. As you know, we have the capacity, gaming, non-gaming to participate across the board. And that's what we believe will happen, that will impact margins, but also in our mind, that's an inevitable factor in Macao, six months into this recovery, and we're still way behind in terms of visitation. Joe Greff : Great. My follow-up question is, we've seen within Mainland China more mixed macroeconomic performance year-to-date. And yet at the same time in Macao, gross gaming revenues, visitation, retail sales, pretty much most metrics have steadily improved. How do you reconcile the disconnect between China macro and the fundamentals on the ground in Macao? And how do you see that relationship playing out going forward? Rob Goldstein : So obviously, we prefer a strong macro economy in China. We're hoping for that in the future, but we can perform and will perform even if the recovery is slower than our business. We'd like to see it come back quickly. But as you see in other businesses, so that will be matures numbers, you see other retail members. The retail market, our business doesn't require -- everyone's been making a strong economic recovery because certain segments can make it happen. But again, we're hoping for a strong rebound and a stronger macro that would impact us positively. I still believe this market will continue to grow in spite of a slower recovery than we like in that region. Joe Greff : Thank you. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Arpine Kocharian : Hi. Thank you. This is actually Arpine for Robin. I was wondering if you could talk about average spend for mass customer and where you expect that to sort of normalize, thinking about the fact that a portion of higher spender in VIP obviously ends up in mass, but also that as you open up more hotel room capacity, that ramps up probably higher percentage of grind mass returns to Macao. How do you think about that more normalized spend per mass customer, looking forward into the back half? Rob Goldstein : Grant? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think you can see from the results that premium mass recovered still faster than the base mass. But sequentially, base mass still grew strongly on the back of improving visitation. And as you alluded to, I think as room inventory increases, we're able to cater to more visitors. I would say the spend per head directionally continues to be very strong across both premium mass and base mass. So whilst, obviously, as the base mass picks up, you'll see more of a mix shift, I think, over time. But within each of the segments, spend per head is actually rising. So we are getting high-quality, high-value tourists into Macao at this point. And also, we're broadening this to high-value foreign tourism as well. So we can see strong results this quarter again in terms of the high-end foreigners. So I would say at this stage, the higher-valued segments are growing, recovering still at a faster rate. Base mass is picking up as visitation grows and hotel capacity increases. But within each of the segments, i.e., both premium mass and base mass, the spending is actually continues to be very high, and indeed, spend per visitor is heading in a positive direction. Arpine Kocharian : Great. Thank you, Grant. And just one quick follow-up. With your dividend restated here, I was wondering if you could update us on your overall kind of capital return strategy and how you think about buybacks. Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Hi. How are you? So I think when we view the business in terms of capital allocation, we feel like we have a lot of good opportunities really for big growth, both Macao and Singapore. And that investment will continue to drive our expansion of non-gaming amenities and drive our cash flow. But we also think that we're going to be able to return a lot of capital in the future. We were a very shareholder-friendly company in the past. We're very focused on return on capital. But I think when you look at our prior program and what we're looking to do going forward, I think we'll probably look to have more of a balance between share repurchase and dividends. I think when we talk about the dividend size, it was something that -- there's plenty of room for investments in the future. It allows us to grow over time, which is our focus to really grow our asset base and grow our cash flow capacity. But it also allows for future share repurchases, which is something we're motivated to do. I think the dividend size today gives us flexibility with our capital allocation. And really, over time, we intend to shrink the share count. I think having a balanced capital return program is very important for us. We talked about it with the Board. I think management is very focused on it. We'll probably look to be more programmatic about share repurchase than we have been in the past. And I think really this gives us the flexibility to repurchase more shares over time and to really address our capital expenditure needs. So I think what we're going to try to do is allocate capital to growth, which we think we have a lot of opportunities that are unique for our company. Focus on the dividend as it corresponds to our program as we always have, but allow ourselves to have more balance, more flexibility in the future to do more programmatic share repurchases and really shrink that share count. Arpine Kocharian : Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, everybody. Thanks. Robert or maybe one of the guys in Macao, I was wondering, as kind of the market has shifted and you've seen a couple of quarters that at least look more normalized, as operators who may have been more VIP-focused in the past or certainly more mix towards VIP relative to you guys, have you seen any change in behavior as it pertains to kind of mass reinvestment levels across the market wide? Rob Goldstein : Yes. Grant, why don't you take that? Grant Chum : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the whole, we see a very stable competitive environment. I think all of the operators, the entire industry is continue to invest in non-gaming and diversification and bringing about, I think, a really stellar event programming into the market, which is helpful, I think, not just for growing the tourism economy, but also increasing the business volumes for all of the operators. So I think you're seeing the positive results from that investment in non-gaming and events programming, even in this past three months, not least in terms of our non-gaming programming that we put in place has been really driving business levels and visitation. In terms of reinvestments, yes, I think it's relatively similar to what we've seen in the recent quarters. Clearly, it's become -- continues to be actually, always been a very competitive market in premium mass and will continue to be. But I think there's very rational behavior amongst the operators in the industry in general, led by the larger players. But as I said, the focus of the industry has been to reinvest in the non-gaming programming, and that's been a tremendous driver to the recovery so far. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you for that. And then if I could, as a follow-up, just in terms of the expansion at Marina Bay Sands, I know you guys were going through some stuff and reviewing some budget needs and design plans and everything else. Is there anything you guys could share at this point in time with how we should be thinking about that time line, spend, et cetera? Patrick Dumont : Sure. First off, we're -- we have very strong feelings about the future success of Singapore. If you look at the results from the quarter, look at the visitation that we have, the type of customer we have coming through the building and the fact that China has not fully recovered, and if you look at sort of the nature of where Singapore sits today in the confluence of events in terms of the growing economies in Southeast Asia, we have a very strong view that the future of Singapore is positive. And so we're very motivated to make an investment there and expand our capacity at Marina Bay Sands. Right now, we're in discussions with the government about what the final form of our project will look like. There's obviously been a lot of change to the market in terms of market potential, the government's goals around high-value tourism, and to be fair, the way we want to grow into that market. And so there's some adjustments that we're making. And hopefully, we'll have a better sense of what that will look like in the upcoming quarters. But right now, we're in discussions and hope we have a chance to continue with the final version of our project in the short-term. We're looking forward to getting started. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, Patrick. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks. As a follow-up on Macao, the $200 million number you mentioned in June, is that a clean number that you would think of to build off of, given normal seasonality? Or should we see that build as base mass continues to recover? Rob Goldstein : What was the second portion, the last part, last thing you said. Recover? Stephen Grambling : I guess it's a question of as base mass continues to recover, how should it impact that $200 million number? Rob Goldstein : It should go up. I think that -- the reason we called that out is because obviously, a strong month, especially in light of the seasonality of June not being a great one. But look, our position is simple. We think Macao will just continue to get stronger. And the recoveries will be predicated on visitation in all segments. And again, our advantage is very structural and very different offers. We have capacity to grow, base mass, premium mass, ropes, retail, everything you think of these customers want, we have the product to service that, that does the business of our competitor. So I think June is the beginning, and hopefully the summer will be evidence of that. We'll see how July, August, September holds up. But our story is pretty simple, more visitation, especially more base mass, more penetration into China will yield bigger GGR and we'll be a huge recipient of that. And I think that's just what we believe in partly. I guess I take comfort in fact, again, six months ago, we weren't sure we'd open. We had basically a closed business in December '22. Here we are in summer of '23, looking at a $2.4 billion run rate. Just based on June, we believe that could accelerate. So we were firm believers in Macao. Always have been. We never vastly in our belief that that market is just special. And the recovery in China is slower, in general, for all segments and probably, but it's coming on now and the summer will be a great indicator how fast to get back to $26 billion, $30 billion, $32 billion. I don't know what the peak is, but just the acceleration will be evidenced this summer. And again, we are in just very, very good position on having target assets to put to work in Macao. Plenty of rooms, the rooms are all open. The retail is open and functioning, slots and tables. So as the market grows, we should be a pretty big beneficiary from that new demand is coming. Stephen Grambling : And so just to be clear, you don't -- do you think that there was any kind of one-time benefits in June, whether it's Jackie Chung or other things that could have been driving that? And so that may have been an outsized number? Or is that -- you're saying that is a clean number to build off of? Patrick Dumont : So I think the key thing to note is that we've had these non-gaming what we call lifestyle programs, which includes entertainment and other activations for years. And they're very successful pre-pandemic because we were able to connect with their customers and bring in very high value tourists in those high frequent. And so we've started those programs again. And so the concept you just referred to is very popular. And I could let Grant comment on that or Wilfred comment on it. But I think the key thing for this is our non-gaming programs are working. That the investment in non-gaming, that the activations, that the driving customer visitation through social media is working. And so the visitation of high-value customers flows through with our results in that month. I think the interesting thing is, air traffic to Macao and to Hong Kong is like around 50% of where it was pre-pandemic. So our story is one of visitation. It was led by higher value customers on premium mass. But now as people can begin the trial of the Macao more easily and more frequently, they're starting to return. They're starting to consume all of our different amenities, not only the hotels, but the concerts, the food and beverage, the retail, all of it's working. And so we'd like to believe we can grow from that number materially as our base mass non rate of play returns as more premium mass customers show up. And as Grant said earlier in the call, more of our hotel rooms come online. So we think we've invested to the pandemic and very high-quality products. The customer response has been very strong. And we're little priced through it. So we'd like to believe that there is margin room there. We'd like to believe that as we activate our non-gaming activities that will draw more customers to concerts and other events, and then that will continue to grow overall the desirability and visitation of Macao. Grant, do you have anything to add? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, I mean, as you rightly say, we've had a very long track record going back 16 years in terms of posting world-class entertainment events at The Venetian Cotai Arena. And this was always part of our lifestyle programming. Jackie has been terrifically successful in the past with us as well. He played in both 2017 and 2018 in the summers of those years. I think what makes this June special is, firstly, he played a record-breaking 12 shows across four weekends. I don't think that's ever been done before in Macao. But not only that, Macao was the first touring stop of the entire global tour that Jackie Chung has just launched. So that he chose to launch this new global tour at The Venetian Macao, I think, is testament to both Macao's rising destination appeal, the importance of it as an entertainment hub regionally, as well as our own track record in partnering with Jackie and his team over many years. So the month was strong, not just the days when the concert was on, which is nine months of the month. So it's a combination of factors. I think the underlying visitation to Macao, like Patrick referenced, was improving throughout the quarter and into June, even though it was into a traditionally weaker part of the travel calendar. Hotel availability improved, transportation improved, concert series undoubtedly played a part, but that's just one component of the ongoing lifestyle program. And I think that programming is not just done by us, but the whole industry. And I think that will make Macao continue to recover rapidly. And it speaks volumes to, I think, the new direction that the government is pursuing and I think is a great start to the new concession. Stephen Grambling : It makes senses. Thanks so much. I'll leave the floor. Grant Chum : Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is life. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. So maybe I just want to go back to the cost side a little bit. It's probably for Grant. But if I caught it correctly, I think in an earlier question, you said room complement was up to 10,700 on average in the quarter, heading to 12,000. Can you just give us a little bit more color on that? Are we at the 12,000, we exit the quarter there? And just what does that imply for kind of necessary either headcount or kind of cost ramp-up from here? Is there a little bit more remaining? Or actually, is this number that we saw in the quarter pretty reflective of kind of what you think the baseline operating cost should look like from here moving forward? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks, Shaun. Yes, I think you heard it right, averaged around 10,700 rooms a day in terms of our operable capacity from a labor standpoint during the quarter. We actually increased further towards the end of the quarter. So as we go into third quarter, we're roughly at that 12,000 rooms mark, which I said, plus or minus, typically, there's always a handful of rooms out of order for maintenance, regular maintenance. We're effectively back in full inventory now and ready for the peak summer season, which is getting underway later this month. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thanks for that. Maybe a similar question, but kind of transferring over to Marina Bay Sands. There, we've seen kind of two quarters in a row with margins kind of in the 46 to 47 camp. That's still a couple of hundred basis points below pre-COVID. And I know there's a lot going on there. I do believe in the slide deck, you guys called out that the -- some of the renovation activity was either over or close to. So maybe just an update on some of that renovation disruption and how we sort of exited the quarter there. And just your thoughts on costs, which I think were up about 10% Q-on-Q. Is there anything -- any -- is there -- as the full complement of rooms comes back, can we also see some margin leverage or improvement sequentially or going forward? And how should we think about that in the second half? Patrick Dumont : So I think what's important to note about Marina Bay Sands, as Robert said in his remarks earlier, the building is under a lot of change. It's changed for the better. We're investing a lot and we're creating what is arguably the best product we ever had. And the customer response is very strong, but we're mid-flight in that. And so I think -- a couple of things to consider. Our biggest suites, so our 200 multi-day suites are the last to come online. So that's what's going to come in this quarter and the next quarter. So the full earnings potential of the renovated Tower 1 and Tower 2 will not really be reached until those suites are online. So we've been operating without them. So we'll be able to price better. We'll have higher margin and we'll have like a larger quantum of cash flow from this high-value segment coming into the building because they didn't have any place to stay. And now we're adding 200 suites of the highest quality we've ever had. So that's going to be meaningful, and that will address, let's call it, some of the operating leverage we want to get out of our cost base. We had a significant number of rooms out of inventory. And so I think between some of the cost increases that we've seen in the market for inputs -- and to be fair, the gaming tax increase, there are some things we need to overcome through higher-value customers, through pricing and through volumes. And I think the one thing that's important to note, aside from the fact that we haven't had our most important room inventory available to us, our casino floor has also been in renovation, that's coming to a close. But most importantly, airlift from China is really back yet. And so when you look at play across the quarter from rated play from China, it's increased each month across the quarter. And so as China visitation comes back into the fold and our new multi-day suites come online, we will have an opportunity to price through some of the cost increases and improve margin. Shaun Kelley : Thank you, Patrick. Thanks everyone. Rob Goldstein : I just want to say, I think we're going to the labor side more escalate because in every business, be it hospitality or retail, when you've got an exemplary product people want, you've got pricing power. And I think we're finished over there. It's taking a long time. It's a slog, but we get through this thing, the room product offer, the F&B, the retail, rethinking of retail. You see this all over the map in terms of why is Hermes and now Louis Vuitton get these ridiculously high-priced side margins. We want the product. They offer a superior product. Same thing happens in the watch world, same thing happens in the hospitality world. I think we're building something that people don't understand how good it is until you see it, understand it. It's going to be really special, and we'll be able to get pricing in every level, be it rooms, casino gaming, retail. When this building is done -- I'm amazed we're doing these kind of numbers with ripped-up buildings -- when this building is done, our pricing power is going to go to another level. I think that's where MBS takes some different here. The margin have always taken care of itself as long as you have the product people want and will pay for it. And I do believe when you guys have a chance to get over there and see MBS and experience what we're doing, you'll appreciate these comments. It's going to be a pricing power issue. We're not going to cut costs, we're adding cost to add more labor. We're going to have a really good product we want people want to be at. But that enables you to charge prices that are high. And I think that's our strategy, is not to, we're going to earn our way to success by offering a great product and people will pay up for it. It's just that simple. And margin reflects that in the daytime. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live. David Katz : Afternoon, everyone. Thanks. I know you've touched on this from a number of different perspectives, but I'd love just a little more help or insight in terms of how margins should evolve, specifically for the Macao enterprise in total. And just looking back at where normal was in 2019 and what a new normal could look like now. How high the ceiling is, any qualitative perspectives around there and how we get there in the next several quarters would be helpful? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : I want to get Grant take that question. But I do want to say, David, again, I think I'll use the words structural advantage. I think we're just a very different position than some people in that we were built for this market in terms of scale and size in every area of our business. Base mass, premium mass, we're still handicapped by the base mass hasn't fully recovered. But I think our reinvestment in the last 20 years is to make this product grow and grow relative to margin and demand. I think we're just built for this environment. So I'm highly confident margins will rise with our increased revenue. Grant, can you add some color? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks for the question. And again, we don't have a specific forecast on how high the margins will rise to. I think you can look at the structure of the business. I mean, as Rob says, I mean, we have an excellent structure in terms of our business mix. We have an efficient cost structure. And I think the way you will be looking at this is how high will revenues go. But it is true that the segments that are going to drive more revenue recovery and then eventually growing structurally will be the higher-margin segments within gaming, mass versus VIP, and then also non-gaming versus gaming. I think non-gaming is recovering even more strongly than gaming. We're at 93% of our 2019 non-gaming revenues. Our hotel revenues for the quarter are 8% higher than 2019 on fewer rooms being available. Our retail business is looking very strong. Tenant sales were up 28% this quarter and that will continue especially with full seats. That's ongoing. David Katz : Thank you. And as my follow-up, with respect to share repurchases, Patrick, which you touched on earlier, obviously not asking for specifics around when and where and how much. But any color on sort of boundaries or accomplishments or how we might think qualitatively as to when we get there and when we can start to think about that in a more tangible way? Patrick Dumont : So I think we just restarted our return of capital program this quarter. I think it shows the Board and management's confidence in the long-term performance of the business. And we'll look to grow that dividend over time in a way that also allows us to have repurchase program. I can't give you a specific side about the volume of repurchases for the time of it today because we still have a lot of things to plan for. But in our capital allocation thought process, we're going to think about it in the way that was described previously. I think what's also important to note is that we're going to have variability in our CapEx. We have a lot of large projects that we're considering. Some of them are more certain than others. We're very excited about Marina Bay Sands expansion. We think it's going to be an unbelievable asset. We're very excited about it. The timing may be a little delayed from where we are today. And now we're going to invest as much as we possibly can because we think the growth there will be extraordinary. But we have other options, other things we're looking at. And the timing of that potential outflow is unknown or if it's going to happen. The good news is, we'll have the ability to modulate our CapEx based on how we grow the business and use excess capital and return it to shareholders through share repurchases and hopefully in a programmatic way. So I can't give you an exact amount today, I will tell you [Indiscernible] is to look at our -- what's called, CapEx for growth, CapEx for the future. Our way to grow the business. Look at the dividend program and ensure that it grows in an appropriate manner. And then look at our return of capital program through share repurchases that are shareholder friendly. And I think that's how we'll look at it. But as where we are right now, I can't give you a side yet, but we'll continue to look at it in the upcoming quarters, and we'll talk about it. David Katz : Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks very much. Good-luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live. Brandt Montour : Hey, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So on the VIP business, which grew nicely for you guys in the quarter, but wasn't as strong as the overall market. Could you just update us how important is this segment to you when you plan the next couple of years? And then can you just touch on the current dynamics of the VIP market overall away from you and how your strategy compares to the broader market? Rob Goldstein : I'm sure this is the first point, you said we didn't do as well as the market in the VIP? Brandt Montour : VIP quarter-over-quarter grew below market-wide VIP. Rob Goldstein : I think we're very comfortable, we're going to the VIP and the base mass. I think our portfolio is so well rounded. The Venetian is still the king of Macao. It's going to be the first place that the $1 billion plus dollars earned EBITDA-wise. And it shows no signs -- buck the recovery to its previous position. We built a portfolio that is very well grounded. The Four Seasons enables us to meet very well to anybody to run product there, and the game products are pretty much unparalleled. Again, the Londoner, early stages, we're halfway done with the renovation. The full renovation is still a while down the road. But except for The Sands, which I think we give up on the potential, a lot of growth being down here in the peninsula, it's still a very difficult, challenging place to make a lot more money. The shift has been to Cotai, which, of course, all our assets other than The Sands are there. We remain convinced there's more room to grow in the region. But I think our position on the VIP and the base mass is as good as it gets. We've got more suites than anybody else, more share than anybody else. And I think more potential growth because of the pure mass size of our buildings. And again, we referenced lifestyle. We built a business there with Jackie this month or somebody else next month, whether it's the best retail, the best restaurants. We built the lifestyle approach, I think, puts us at the top of the heap in that area, both as a product offerings, but also quality of product. Very comfortable going and have no reason why we can't grow and keep growing both in base and premium. I think the idea we're not a premium mass player is unfair and unjustified by numbers, Grant? Grant Chum : Yes. I think on the VIP, our strategy hasn't changed. And in fact, obviously, the way the market has evolved in Macao for VIP, it fits our strategy more than ever because we're focused on the -- we've always focused on the premium direct segment out of the VIP. And we've historically had a very strong sales network around the rest of Asia. So we're working very hard, bringing foreign top-tier players into Macao, and we're having I would say, initially great success in doing so. Our foreign rolling volumes are already back to 2019 levels in the second quarter. Obviously far ahead of the general tourism recovery from overseas markets for Macao. So I think -- I think it's anchored around premium direct, our very strong sales network around Asia and our continued effort -- intensifying the effort to bring more foreign top-tier patrons to Macao. As Rob said, it's a great destination for all of those markets, and we intend to make full use of our great product and destination to attract those foreigners. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on CapEx. I'm trying to reconcile slide 23, this really helpful year-by-year build you guys do for us with last quarter. It looks like MBS expansion, I guess, was temporarily taken off. You guys commented on that already. You added Londoner Phase 2. Wanted make sure that that's new and hear any maybe thoughts about targets -- return targets for that project. And then lastly, I think there were some reports from you guys or came from you guys through the media mid-quarter about a new hotel tower at The Venetian. And if that's a true or a plan, I'm just curious if that's going to be included in the $3.5 billion CapEx commitment that you've agreed with the government on. Patrick Dumont : So just a few points. We did take Singapore expansion off because until we finalize the program and have final approval from the government, we don't know exactly what it will cost. So we're going to hold off on that until we have a project decided upon. In terms of The Londoner under Phase II -- I think the great thing about The Londonder is when we first started, we actually did it pre-concession during the pandemic, and we built through the pandemic and into the concession renewal and came out of the other side. And the thesis was validated. It's incredibly well received by the market. It looks spectacular. Customer response has been very strong. And we're excited about the result, and that market validation was very important. And now we're going to roll into the second part of the building and really hopefully tap into the absolute earning power of that, let's call it, really well laid out, really thought through hotel offering and amenity offering. And so in our long-term view, that's something that we'll open one day, come close to the Mid-East in terms of its productivity. The potential is there. Very excited about that opportunity. In terms of return targets, I think it's not something that we talk about directly, but in our mind, there's a lot of potential growth in our deepest and most profitable segments, which is mass and premium mass. And so with the revised or renovated hotel suite -- hotel rooms and suites that we'll have there, we think we'll be able to address the market incredibly well, just like we did with the first phase of The Londonder. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And in terms of a new hotel tower, I don't think we can comment on rumors. I don't think that's something we're familiar with. I think for us, we're really focused on really delivering against our concession renewal requirements, investing in the non-gaming amenities that really help define our portfolio in Macao and really drive visitation. So Grant, do you have any other comments you'd like to add? Grant Chum : Patrick, you covered it very well. I think The Londoner's success, we've had the wholesale reinvention of the property's positioning and the branding and the functionality. And actually, it's easy to forget that most of the hotel room accommodation today still remains the original Sands Cotai Central rooms, as is half of our main gaming floors. So Phase 2 is really about making Londoner more Londoner. We need to reposition and upgrade Sheraton and the Conrad hotels as well as a comprehensive upgrade of the Pacifica Casino on the Sheraton side. And we'll be adding more non-gaming amenities and attractions to The Londoner, many of which are also included in our concession commitments. More signature restaurants that have international appeal, state-of-the-art wellness center, other sort of lifestyle attractions. And then beyond that, over a longer time frame, we\u2019ve always committed since the concession, retender to developing this new landmark garden-themed attraction, the conservatory located -- to be located in the gardens south of The Londoner resort. That will take a longer time frame to develop. But first off, we're able to get right down to work on Londoner Phase 2, on the hotels and the casino refresh because we've been working on this during the pandemic on the designs. So we're now -- as Patrick said, I mean we've seen it, the product that we have come out with being hugely validated and with the market recovery with return of visitation and the hotel guests. We're keen to get moving on to this Phase II, and that's why we're able to start the actual construction in the second half of this year. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks all. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line is live. Steven Wieczynski : Hey. So Rob or whoever wants to take this -- and Patrick, you touched on this a little bit, so this might be you. But Slide 14, I think, is pretty interesting. Around visitation trends during the quarter, with Hong Kong back to actually above pre-COVID levels, Guangdong pretty much back. The rest of China, though, remains well below pre-COVID levels. So wondering how you guys are thinking about the recovery in that segment moving forward? And what you're watching. And I know, Patrick, you talked about air capacity. Is it really just air capacity? Or are there other factors out there that -- but might be holding that segment back? Patrick Dumont : I think one thing I do want to say is we're really excited about it. Seeing the visitation come back has been thrilling. Customer responses, seeing -- seeing patrons from before, see new patrons. It's really a fantastic place. We were in Macao recently, and it just -- there's great energy, great electricity in the city. So I think some of it is air capacity. To be fair, some of it's the, let's call it, the more mass player, the unrated play that The Venetian and other of our assets were so strongly set up for that really drove a lot of high volume and high margin business. All those segments still haven't come back and forth. So between the airlift -- and if you turn to the next page, actually, page 15, where it shows the visitation for 2019, and then compared to this last quarter, you can kind of see that we have a lot of room to go. We have a lot of patrons who will want to come back and see us. And they're just starting now to make their trips happen. So I think from where we sit, we have a great ability to accommodate these customers than we've done in the past. We have the capacity. We have very interesting non-gaming amenities, we have entertainment. And we think this is the most important tourism market in Asia and the region and people are going to show up. We also have international visitors showing up, which is kind of a new thing. So I think the power of Macao is going to continue to grow and grow. But when I look at slide 15, I just see a lot of potential, and our team is working hard to try to capture that potential. Grant, I want to turn it over to you and see if you have additional remarks. Grant Chum : Yes. I was going to point to that page as well. Patrick. Yes, Dan's famous Page 15 on the penetration. Actually, you can see from the Eastern China, Yanxi River Delta region, especially Shanghai and Zhejiang Province. In fact, the recovery rate is higher than Guangdong's because I think you have better airlift, better propensity to travel cross-border from those source markets. And we've already seen a very big upward shift in the recovery rate of non-Guangdong, relative to first quarter. So I think in the first quarter, when we're looking at that recovery rate, it was less than 30%, and now we're approaching 50%. So non-Guangdong visitation second quarter grew almost, I think, in the high 40s sequentially. So it is coming back, as we said, as airlift improves, transportation in general improves, and also our hotel room availability has been increasing. And actually, we'll be further increasing for Macao as a whole in the third quarter. We have some new hotel rooms coming online. So all of that, I think, is positive for the outlook for continued recovery in the visitation outside of Guangdong Province. Rob Goldstein : Maybe I'd just add, the trajectory may be uncertain, but the end result is very certain. I mean this market always comes back, and I think it walks the summer, you'll see some very positive indications. I don't think anybody knows when or exactly why it's not fully recovering in certain areas, but we just know it's going to recover. It's a question of when that happens. The result, I think, is on the question. And again, I hope this summer, we showed some strong evidence. And July, hopefully, will show a big number, the best number of the year thus far and that starts to add in this recovery. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Great. I'll leave it there, guys. I appreciate the color. Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And a final question today is coming from Daniel Politzer from Wells Fargo. Daniel, your line is live. Daniel Politzer : Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up, Rob, on that comment about July. I mean, is there any reason other than just the airlift capacity that we wouldn't expect that normal seasonality and the build off the momentum that you saw in June, whether it's macro concerns, behavioral or entertainment calendar? Is it really just simply airlift? Or there are other reasons in particular? Rob Goldstein : No, there's multiple variables at work here. And I wouldn't want pigeonhole, the economy, Visa, I don't think we really know the answer to that. It's an aggregate answer, it can't be unpacked really. I do think though, seasonality, summer has always been the time. This is the first time, post-COVID. I, for one, believe summer has improved very strong. Some business people boasting about what the joint numbers look like. I hope they're right. I believe some will be very indicative of new growth in this market. And look, again, I think you have to look back on how quickly we see this recovery. Six months ago, we were in dire straits. And now we're unpacking $200 million a month in June. So we're very bullish when we think long-term. And again, the trajectory may be uncertain but the end result's very clear. We're going to get there. We're going to make a lot of money in Macao, definitely. And we hope we have more good news in the near future to offer to you. So I'm hoping for a big summer for the market. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And just 1 more quick one. We haven't touched on the digital strategy. And there's been some headlines lately that there's been some progress there. Do you have anything that you could possibly share? And as you just -- in high level, as you think about the strategy, how do you reconcile that with regulatory concerns, given your presence in Macao and your relationship with the government there? Patrick Dumont : So I think we said a while ago that we were going to invest in ground up digital activities. So we're -- we're not buyers, we're builders. And I think for a while, we've been working on a couple of digital initiatives. And I think the key thing for us is, it's still early days yet. We don't really have much to talk about. We're very confident about it. We think long-term, there's real potential there. But our focus is going to be on highly regulated markets. So that would mean Europe and North America. Our goal is to make sure that we maintain our regulatory standards in the best possible way, only working with partners where that makes sense and being very selective. But in our mind, we're very focused on regulatory certainty and being in strong [Technical difficulty] I'm going to put this on hold. Sorry about that. So I think our view is that the digital issues have potential. We're going to continue to invest in them for the long-term. We are committed for the long-term. And I think our goal is going to be to focus on highly regulated markets. Daniel Politzer : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, everybody. Patrick Dumont : Thank you.",

Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macao diluted $630 million of EBITDA for the quarter and we are only eight months into our post-COVID reopen. These are early days. We began in Q1 with $400 million of EBITDA; Q2, we did $540 million of EBITDA; and Q3 is now at $630 million of EBITDA. Look forward to growth in both the gaming and non-gaming revenue to lift the entire market. SCL (ph) the largest share of non-rolling table win, rolling table win and slot ETG win. We've always believed that completed Londoner will meet perhaps exceed the earning power of the nation. Our future growth in Macao is tethered these powerful assets which have all the variables necessary to drive growth in years ahead. Whether it's rooms, gaming capacity, retail, entertainment, food and beverage, we have stellar assets. There is speculation about future growth of Macao. A relevant question is, can the market grow to $30 billion, $35 billion, $40 billion of GGR and beyond? We are firm believers that it will and may occur much -- a much shorter timetable that anyone realizes. This underscores our confidence and the returns will be generated by our capital investment programs in our portfolio. We are staunch believers in the growth of Macao market near and long-term. LVS has invested $15 billion in Macao, which is the most important land-based market in the world. A few reference points to consider, third quarter EBITDA represents strong growth compared to previous quarters, as I mentioned. Our retail business in Macao has far exceeded pre-COVID numbers. I expect the gain portion of our business to follow the same trajectory as Singapore and accelerated 2024. [Technical Difficulty] MBS and Singapore. Six quarters into a reopening, MBS delivered a $490 million quarter. The power of this building is evident based on the results despite the disruptive impact of our ongoing $1.75 billion renovation program. Disruption notwithstanding MBS is hitting on all cylinders from a gaming, lodging and retail perspective. Slots and ATG (ph) MBS are approaching $1 billion annually, non-rolling tables are exceeding $20 million of drop per day. The ADRs are escalating and our retail component is going far beyond pre-COVID numbers. MBS is a testament that quality assets prevail and validates the thesis that reinvesting in our assets will generate sustained returns. MBS has it all (ph), an iconic building with superb decor and service levels, which attract the most desirable customers in every segment. At the completion of both phases of our refurbishment program, MBS will feature 770 suites. We used to have 200 suites before the refurbishment. There is no denies future. How far can MBS go? Our expectations starts with $2 billion or more in the future of annualized EBITDA. Finally, we're bidding for a license in New York. We have secured the Nassau Coliseum (ph) and the process of gaining necessary selling requirements to move forward. We're also receiving strong local support from the local community. The resort will cost in excess of $5 billion, but enables us to develop a five-star resort with unlimited appeal. This is simply an extraordinary opportunity. We are very excited about the prospect. Our bid is compelling, that we award the license who will be in the ground as quickly as possible. Thanks for joining us again. I'm going to turn the call over to Patrick before we move on to some Q&A. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. I would like to cover two important topics before we get on to your questions. The first is the long-term margin structure we expect in our Macao business. As the Macao market revenues continue to recover, our margins will naturally benefit from an improved business mix. This quarter, our Macao EBITDA reached $631 million at a 35.3% margin, which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to the second quarter of '23. As revenues continue to grow, we expect our margin to exceed the 36% of Macao business in 2019. This quarter, the Malaysian Macao grew EBITDA to $290 million, with margins reaching 40.1%. This is an example of a property achieving strong revenue recovery with financial performance and margin that reflect the improved business mix. The Londoner Macao grew EBITDA to $167 million during the quarter, with EBITDA margin expanding 660 basis points sequentially to reach 32.2%. The strong flow-through of revenue to EBITDA reflects the operating leverage of our business, once the fixed costs have been covered. The transformation to Londoner has created a world-class product that is a must see for visitors for Macao. We will naturally have some construction disruption in 2024, but we expect future EBITDA growth and margin expansion over time, so that's Macao. The second item I wanted to cover is an update on our plans for the return of capital to shareholders. Our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share repurchase through 2025, and we're looking forward to restarting our share repurchase program. In the nine-year period from 2012 to 2020, we returned over $22 billion of capital to [Technical Difficulty] shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases, which was split roughly 80% dividends and 20% to share repurchases. As we consider our future capital return, we expect share repurchase will be more heavily weighted than dividends. We believe repurchases will be more accretive in dividends over time as they reduce the denominator. We fundamentally believe in the compounding long-term benefit of share repurchases. So that's the capital return update. [Technical Difficulty] again today, and let's move to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Patrick, thank you for the additional color. Rob or anyone over in Macao maybe this one\u2019s best for. But as you guys think about the base and the premium mass. It looks like in the quarter, you guys kind of converted some premium mass tables to base mass tables. And obviously, with the increases in visitation that makes sense. Is that something you expect to do going forward? Do you have what you need basically in terms of the premium mass footprint in terms of table count at this point? Robert Goldstein : Yeah. The beauty of our business model is we've got plenty of capacity to do everyone. We will move to the market. As you saw in the quarter, we moved tables around to accommodate where we saw demand. But again, with the number of rooms and our table capacity, we can grow into any market in any segment that shows strength and that's what happened here. The truth is, I expect that to both move forward in the future and show growth both in base and premium. But our assets are built to be just this, which is versatile, able to accommodate the market. Grant may have some color on that's true of any market. The only difference in this market for me is, we did such a huge amount of table supply that we're very nimble. Grant? Grant Chum : Yeah. Thank you, Rob. Yeah. I think the repositioning this quarter for more towards base mass tables, that's just a natural part of our optimization between the segments and of course, as you rightly referenced, the summer saw a big increase in visitation and the base mass business. So that was just a natural repositioning to optimize the table count. As you can see, sequentially, a win per unit increased substantially in premium mass up 19% and base mass, even though we reorientated the table count towards base mass, we also increased the win per unit by 7% sequentially. So I think that you can see very clearly that we actually did optimize pretty well for the quarter between the two segments in terms of table capacity and these numbers will change again as the market evolves depending on which segment is growing faster. Carlo Santarelli : Great. And then -- thank you for that. Patrick, if I could just kind of follow up on the Venetian and acknowledging that there was some high hold in the period on the VIP side. But it's a relatively small number in terms of revenue. As you think about kind of the margin profile, the 40.1% margins in the period at the property kind of rivaled '19 despite annualized third quarter net revenue being down, I think, close to 18% versus what you did in 2019. If we think about that gap, that odd $600 million flow-through, getting back to kind of '19 net revenue levels at that property or any other property. How would you think about kind of the incremental flow-through on that incremental net revenue and perhaps we could obviously take it from there to get a sense for where margins could kind of prove out over time? Patrick Dumont : So it's a great question. I think for us, the first thing is, this is what happens if you cover your fixed cost base. So when we were 70% recovered, we had to cover our fixed cost base in Macao. And as the market recovered and as tourism and visitation continue to grow, we will reach our run rate margin levels, which we always felt was in this context. So what do you see the Venetian is a result of a great product that has, is really an example of a property reaching a more run rate level of operation post-pandemic and the performance in margins that result. And we feel very strongly that the Venetian Macao is going to run as mass visitation continues to return to the market. Remember, Macao visitation is still about 20% less than it was pre-pandemic, we're down about 1 million visitors in the same period. So we feel very strongly about the margin potential. We're very proud about what's going on to The Londoner. We think the market is starting to understand that product operate it is, and we\u2019re starting to see the results in terms of productivity in terms of margin. But again, in that product as well, we think there\u2019s more room to run. So I think it\u2019s a great testament to the team there, the work they\u2019ve done to grow these businesses. But to be fair, we think there\u2019s strength in margins to continue as revenue continues to come into the market through visitation. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, guys. Before COVID, you guys used to disclose department margin ranges for base mass table games and premium mass table game ranges. I think base was 35% to 45% and premium mass is 25%, 40%. Are those margin ranges or the midpoint and higher still viable or does The Londoner and that ramp and clearly is in ramp mode right now, does that cause those ranges to be more middle or the lower end of that range is in the aggregate in Macao? Patrick Dumont : So I think for us, because of the mix of business and where we're investing, we sort of run the business in aggregate. So what we're looking at is the 40% margin that Venetian just put up in the quarter and the 660 basis point expansion in margin that The Londoner saw as the market discovered how great it was, and we started getting more visitation and more growth. So I think for us, that's really how we're looking at it. Departmentally, I think we manage the business overall. And as Rob said earlier, we're going to shift assets to the segment that is most productive and provides the best returns. So I think for us, we're not really looking at that as a guide. We're really looking at overall productivity of our asset base in total. I think one thing that's interesting to consider is, so in Macao, room occupancy was 96% versus 95% in the same period in '19. But the thing that's interesting is we're actually driving more daily casino nights at higher yields per room. And so in the premium mass segment, we're seeing a recovery, but our base mass segment is starting to recover strongly. And this is really what you see is, the businesses that used to support Macao mass tourism continue to come back online after what was basically a three-year hiatus. So this increased visitation will drive base mass revenue growth, and we'll start to see margin return to a more normal mix. So I wouldn't look at the departmental. I would look at the recovery in the aggregate margin of the operating asset. That's kind of how we're managing the business, and we're trying to manage segments throughout. Robert Goldstein : And then we look at EBITDA. Patrick Dumont : And then we look at EBITDA, which is the most important effect. Thank you, Rob. Joe Greff : Thanks. And then with respect to the buyback, that was great to see, Patrick. Do you look at that as more episodic or opportunistic? Or do you look at it as there's a minimum consistent minimum level or a consistent level per quarter per year that you would look at? Patrick Dumont : I think we're going to be measured across time. I think we want to return capital through share repurchases in a meaningful way. We think there is a real benefit to reducing the denominator. We think it's accretive. We think there's a compounding effect in share repurchases. And so we're looking forward to do it on a regular basis. The amounts to be determined. But for us, you see the size of the authorization, you see our balance sheet strength. You see the amount of cash flow we're generating down in the business. And we're going to go out and be aggressive. I think for us, we fundamentally believe in the dividend. But if you look at that split that we had, let's call it, pre-pandemic of a return of capital story (ph), I think we're looking to be majority share repurchases and get that benefit. And so if you look at how we've returned capital historically in a regular and repeatable way, I think we're going to look to do that again. Robert Goldstein : And Joe, it can't help, but be somewhat opportunistic as we look at the market. Our stock is trading roughly COVID levels, and we think our buildings are going to make $5 billion (ph) and more $40 billion, $50 billion in the next decade. It's hard not to look at the stock in [indiscernible], that's opportunistic. On the other hand, we also like to be long term and be consistent. So it's kind of a mixture of both. But it's hard for us to sit here today and look at pricing as if we\u2019re close to Macao or half open to Macao and Singapore, not think there\u2019s opportunity, but we also have a long-term perspective. Joe Greff : Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on kind of what is holding back that lower spending customer. It sounds like transportation bottlenecks are no longer really the issue in Macao, if it's the RMB depreciation? Is that something we have to kind of wait for that to anniversary next year or I guess what do you think will change that the kind of visitor levels for that lower spending segment? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I think it's interesting. If you go to Page 16 in our deck and by the way, we debate this all the time. I think the team on the ground there is very focused on it. I think what you'll see is that visitation is from China, excluding Guangdong is 72%. [Technical Difficulty] Guangdong is back to 92%, but if you look at the air lift, Macao Airport was only at 64% of 2019 capacity in the quarter, and Hong Kong was only at 63%. So it's a pretty meaningful difference and so frictional transportation difficulties are still real, and they're getting better. Customers can get to Macao more easily in this border than they could before. But we're still not back to normal. And so what we're starting to see is, I mentioned earlier, some of the infrastructure for mass store groups are returning, which is very positive, starting to see some of the increased volumes due to their visitation. Some of the higher-value customers, premium mass customers and the IP customers, airlift isn't great. And some of this airlift coming into Macao was domestic and some of it's -- some of it's international. So I think for us, as we see this airlift capacity recover, we're going to start to see more entertainment (ph), of course, benefit not only us, but also the entire market is where people are able to get here more easily. But I think the recovery story is not fully there in terms of air travel and in terms of accessibility. I think it's on the way, but it's not fully back. Robin Farley : I guess I'm thinking that the air travel wouldn't necessarily be -- where the lower spending customer will be coming from there, and high-speed rail, I think is back to pre-COVID levels. So I just -- is there anything else that you think is impacting if that needs to change, whether it's policy in Mainland China or it\u2019s kind of anything else outside of that transportation issue. Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Grant, do you want to jump in here? Grant Chum : Sure. Yeah. I think, Robin, the -- Patrick referenced 72% out of non-Guangdong, Actually, if you look at the regional differences between provinces, I mean there are some of the higher spending provinces are actually way above 2019 in terms of visitation and some are lower than 2019. So I think there are just some regional differences depending on the whole host of factors ranging from the transportation to the availability of hotel rooms and so on and so forth, and their propensity to go cross border in their trips. I mean this is the first set of summer holidays since COVID. And then, I think what you see is actually a very strong acceleration in that non- Guangdong visitation this quarter. So we're really up 22% over visitations, but within that Mainland China is up a lot more sequentially. And that is also reflected in the property visitations that we saw this quarter, the 17% increase in the base mass revenue that we saw. So it is picking up, but it just accelerated at a different pace from the premium mass, which as you know, came back right from the start in a stronger fashion than the base mass. So I think as more to inventory is actually opening up and the propensity improves. People know the Macao market is back with all the non-gaming investments and events that are driving the interest in the destination I think that base mass segment will naturally improve over time as it did already significantly this quarter. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you, all. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. This may be a bit myopic, but I would love to hear a little bit more color on how Golden Week maybe trending and how the pace of recovery has continued across different customer categories more recently, especially around these big events that seem to have driven kind of a step function move in the recovery historically. Robert Goldstein : Steve, we traditionally don't talk about the current quarter. We'll keep that intact here as well. I think if you look at the numbers in the market as the print to see the strength of Golden Week\u2019s [indiscernible] the numbers driven by the government and other sources. But we never comment inside the quarter. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. And maybe changing to something more specific [Technical Difficulty] would love to just hear anything around potential near-term disruption. I think that that's going to be starting in November and then when that might be felt most and when we can anticipate the re-ramp? Robert Goldstein : Yeah. I'll turn to Grant, there will be some disruption, but we still feel as though the initial results, under are -- obviously, we're looking at it as a future hope that one of these prospects. Grant take it through '24, both [indiscernible] and Casino seeing that better and how we see it. Grant Chum : Yeah. Sure, Rob. I think clearly, we will work to minimize the impact on the guest experience and the business operations, but this is something that we have managed many, many times over the years. And indeed, we did that during 2019 when we started the holiday in conversion into The Londoner hotel. I think you'll see some disruption on the gaming side in the middle of next year. And I think we'll be managing the Sheraton Tower renovation methodically and judiciously over the entire period over the next 15, 18 months. So as to really continue to enhance the yielding on the customer front, but at the same time, try to get these works done as quickly as possible. I think the intent here is to move forward and complete the renovation and the repositioning of the entire south side of the resort, the Sheraton Towers and Pacifica Gaming as quickly as possible. The sooner we make the entire resort Londoner, the better it will be for everyone, our guests, our staff, our business and the brand positioning. So the only other point I would make is, we should take note that this part of the property portfolio is the lowest yielding part of the entire Cotai portfolio that we have both on the hotel and the gaming side. So we do hope to be able to successfully manage to minimize the disruption to the business. But when we get to completion on the other side, in the first half of '25. I think the earnings power through the holistic and expanded experience of the Londoner and Macao will be significantly enhanced. That's the goal. Patrick Dumont : Just sort of one thing to think about -- yeah, one thing to think about, so we're very focused on return on invested capital and growth in Macao. And so our anticipation is that the returns on these investments will be commensurate with those that we have previously and will drive meaningful growth. And by the way, the initial market reaction to this product really to what's been brought online so far really helps us with his view. Given the customer response and the performance of the asset in the long run, we believe that the completed Londoner, when it's done will be on par with the Venetian. That's what our target is. Robert Goldstein : I'd also add the Grant's comments, Stephen. Just again, the size, the scale of our portfolio gives us flexibility. We have 10,000 other rooms, money gets seems to new customers, too. So I think we minimize the disruption and maximize the opportunity to deploy the rest of our assets to keep our business strong despite that. And to Patrick's comment, one of those things can be juggernaut, they'll be neck and neck maybe exceed those two assets that are going to be hugely important in the future. But getting to \u201824, while not easy, I think it\u2019s very manageable to see deploy other assets in the portfolio intelligently. Stephen Grambling : Thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Robert Goldstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live. Robert Goldstein : Chad? Operator : Chad, please check your mute button. Your line is live, if you wish to ask a question. Okay. We can come back to Chad later. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. I just wanted to go back to the margins in Macao, and maybe that flowed through discussion a little bit more. If we look at it, it does look like flow-through just sequentially was a bit better in the third quarter here than in the second. I was just wondering, if we could get a little color on sort of maybe some of the mix impacts that drove that. Was that normalized staffing? Was it some of the non-gaming amenities, which are now kind of fully back on, which flow through at really good rates, like retail and hotel, was it sort of the base mass mix coming back? Just kind of how do you see it in terms of what maybe some of the factors were that drove that because it does look quite impressive. Patrick Dumont : Thanks for that, and appreciate the question. I will tell you that there's a little bit of magic to it. It's called revenue increase 28.9%. So for us, it really is just more people showing up, spending money at the product, recognizing how great it is and increased demand. I mean it's a phenomenal product there last week. It really looks for the team, it\u2019s really providing unbelievable customer service and it's a highlight for Macao. It's a great asset and will continue to grow. And for us, it was just covering the fixed cost base. We just had to get -- and it was not a known product in the market. People are starting to figure it out, and it's going to keep growing. And so for us, this was really just growth in revenue across all segments, that was really the secret to it. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thanks, Patrick. And then, as my follow-up, I just want to dig a little deeper into the buyback authorization, obviously, a big kind of strategic change. Could you give us a couple of parameters. I mean pre-COVID, the company was actually pretty high on its sort of overall payout ratio. You obviously have a pretty ambitious capital program across potentially New York, certainly, what you want to do on this -- on the big project in Singapore, some renovation activity and some of the CapEx in Macao. So should we think and parameters of a payout ratio and maybe how could we put some numbers around that, if possible? And then also just help us think about medium-term leverage, just given you're probably the most under levered gaming company I've ever covered. So a big complement to where you sit at the moment, but obviously, it presents a lot of potential firepower there. Patrick Dumont : So really appreciate the commentary of the question. I will tell you, so right now, we're sitting at about $5.6 billion worth of cash system-wide. Macao is starting to become very cash generative. Singapore is very cash generative. So the way we think about this is due to the timing of our development obligations and those cash flows, we will be able to do all. We'll be able to invest in our core markets and growth through organic growth and through redevelopment of key assets. We'll be able to do IR [Technical Difficulty] core. We'll be able to do our concession commitment to Macao and then we'll have excess capital and we'll pursue New York, and we're going to pursue other growth opportunities in new jurisdictions, and we'll be able to do it all because of the timing of the cash flow, the cash we have on hand and the cash tentative nature of our assets. So in terms of the payout ratio, as we addressed earlier in the call, we're not going to be as heavily weighted towards dividends as we were before. So if you look on Page 30, we sort of included a look on what were our prior return of capital programs looking like for both share repurchase and dividends. And on Page 30, what you'll see is historically, we were very dividend weighted. And to your point about payout ratio, we don't typically guide to payout ratio, but the point is well taken, we're looking really to flip it. So for us, the majority is actually going to end up being share repurchases, because we're very focused on growth. So we can grow the company's EPS through share shrink, we're going to do it. We can grow through capital allocations or high growth projects, we're going to do it. It's really an ROIC, and we're going to pursue it aggressively. And the good thing is we've got cash on the balance sheet. We've got cash center of assets and we have a historical program to provide you a good guide that we can launch off of and really hopefully drive real shareholder return in the future. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Patrick Dumont : Sorry, one thing. Thank you, Dan. You mentioned leverage, and this is a very important thing. So prior to the pandemic, we spent about five years transforming the company to be an investment grade name. We thought this was really important. It gives us access to the largest, most liquid debt market in the world. It gives us a very efficient cost of capital, which in the long run provides flexibility but also drives returns on our new projects. And so having this investment-grade balance sheet also helps us in new jurisdictions because we have the financial capability to execute on projects we propose. So for us, we like being leveraged 2 times to 3 times on a gross basis. We've said it before. You've heard it from us on prior calls, nothing's changed. We still believe that. We think we\u2019ll delever over time through EBITDA expansion. But more importantly, I think for us, that\u2019s a key metric so that we maintain our investment grade rating for all the benefits we just described. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Shaun Kelley : Thanks for that. Daniel Briggs : Thanks, Shaun. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live. Brandt Montour : Great. Good evening, everybody. Thanks. So for Marina Bay Sands first, in your slide, you show flight capacity hovering around 80% recovered. Based on the momentum that you guys are seeing in that asset, do you still feel like you need that last 20% of China inbound to fully recover to hit that $2 billion run rate target. And can that happen actually while Tower 3 is under Reno? Robert Goldstein : What's happening, isn't it? I mean, this quarter, we just did 490. I hate to say, if that's happening. Good question. We always need China, let's be clear about that. We always want more business in all countries. But I think what you're seeing in Singapore is a very diverse bunch of assets are coming together. I think the biggest story is the suite product, which we haven't -- you haven't seen it's pretty extraordinary. When it goes from 200 to 700 -- 770, it's just a very potent combination of great food and beverage grade service. It enables us to get a place we've never thought of before. The real question is, I think $2 billion is our goal in the future and beyond. The real question is, when you get more China, when do you get more flights where you open up totally -- the thing that we talk about [Technical Difficulty] it's been open about six quarters of now. If you follow the trajectory of Singapore, we're hoping to see anything after Macao. We're very early stages in Macao. Singapore opened up, it wasn't that powerful in the first couple of quarters. And it been along, all of a sudden, it caught fire and now it's certainly performed, we're surprised how strong it is and because the place is kind of turn up. If you've been there, it's got some real challenges from a physical perspective. So to answer your question, we think we can get to without more a lot more. We'll take all the customers we can get. We think this is user for an asset. It's one of the places you just want to go to. You'll pay up for whether a room product or the gaming opportunity in retail it just is going to keep getting stronger. Do we think it's achievable? Yes, but we prefer to have all airlift coming in and all the potential customers in trying to have business [indiscernible]. We just have a huge faith in this product. We don't think two at the end, at the beginning, we're in to. So I do think it's important that we look at it the cabin benefit of understanding. We've gone from a dead stop in January back to the very difficult times of no one coming to mere in nine months later about 80% of Q3 '19. But how much for they're going to go? I think a lot more. If you look at Singapore, this trajectory, I think it's very telling what's going to happen in Macao. So I think, again, another illustration of what's happening in was on Page 25. I think the retail side is just you have to look at it. I mean all you guys have spent time in about $3,000 a foot is a pretty good local mall. The four season Macao is 8,400 foot in the luxury segment and 3,700 of the non-luxury in Venetian (ph) Macau, which is not a necessary luxury malls to $70 a foot. So the power of the spending right now in the retail opportunity always seem to happen first. The gaming seems to follow us happen in Singapore to happen in Macao. But to your question, we have huge confidence in the future of MBS. And I think our investments will prove in the end we make works in many places is supremely strong buildings with great service and great architecture, and that's what you have Rosadi (ph) and MBS. Brandt Montour : Great. That's super helpful. And then over on Macao, on Slide 14, it shows the win per visitor coming down quarter-over-quarter, it's the second quarter that's declined. Is that sort of wholly explainable by the reallocation of tables to base mass, which we talked about earlier in the call or is there any other constraints that you'd want to highlight why that sort of win per visitor is hovering around some of the quarters that we saw in 2019. Patrick Dumont : Just a quick thought on Page 14. This is really driven by visitation by the number of visitors that we're showing up to the market as it averages down. But I would like Grant to comment if he had any thoughts, just for some additional color. Grant Chum : Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. No, I think what you're seeing is the evolution of premium mass coming back first. So for the first couple of quarters after the Board has reopened, you saw the revenue per Macao visit arrival, which is what this page shows, upon skyrocketed versus the historical levels. And you're now obviously getting more of the base mass, especially during the summer, so you are normalizing. But it's important to note that you are still getting a much higher quality mix of customers even with that when you compare to the same quarter in 2019. So I think from this slide, you can see is 610 per visits arrival in this quarter versus 557 in the same quarter in 2019. So the narrative continues that you are getting that higher quality across every segment, a higher spend per capita. But between the premium and base mass, you're now seeing the base mass starting to accelerate, especially during those July and August summer months. Brandt Montour : Got it. So just sorry to clarify, so it's mix to the base mass, but also more well-heeled customers that might be gambling slightly less, like families and such? Is that kind of a way to look at it? Grant Chum : No, this is actually showing you that the mass revenue per visit arrival is actually higher than the same quarter in 2019. So actually, you suggest that the higher spend per capita is actually prevalent in all segments of the market right now. And that also shows through in the gaming. I'm sorry, in the retail mall that Rob referenced as well. Brandt Montour : Perfect. Thanks for all the color. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Brandt. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from George Choi from Citi. George, your line is live. George Choi : Thank you very much. While we do believe concerts can help to get incremental revenues in Macao. How should we think about the associated incremental expenses? And I guess more specifically, do you expect the [indiscernible] concerts at the Venetian this month to be both EBITDA accretive and margin enhancing at the same time? Patrick Dumont : So one thing just to begin, and thank you for the question. Entertainment is a very important part of our business. We're very focused on using entertainment to drive premium as visitation and create the programs that our customers feel like they'll get experiences with us, they can't get in other places. It's a very successful thing in Asia. And in fact, we just recently opened a brand-new venue in The Londoner that allows us to do that in more scale. But so I think for us, these programs are very accretive. Directionally, we think more entertainment as high quality is good, not only for the market, but also for diversification in Macao and in Singapore. I think it brings a prominence and an entertainment glow to the regions. But I would like to turn it over to Grant to see if you guys any additional comments about an entertainment and cost associated with it. Grant Chum : Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Yeah. I think we've always been pursuing the entertainment strategy to create a better, more attractive destination and that hasn't stopped since the Board has reopened. In fact, we have been redoubling our efforts, as Patrick said, with the opening of The Londoner arena in May and June. So if you look at the third quarter, we actually did around 15 different show events with about 19 performances across the two arenas and obviously, in some only 13 weekends in the quarter, so there were some weekends where we are doing both a show at The Londoner and also in the Venetian. And we believe this is critical to driving not just the diversification in Macao and the non-gaming, but also to enhance the attractiveness and the propensity to come to the destination, especially our properties, and we can see the impact on our business. The economics of this hasn't changed and we've done this for 15 years. So we know how to calibrate the investment in entertainment versus the return we get on the overall resource spending. And also, there are different types of partnerships that we do in entertainment events, and that can range from just pure any rental to us being the actual promoter. So it varies and it's a calibration. It's analysis between the revenue benefit that we get and the visitation benefit that we get versus the cost and also depends also potentially on the entertainment partner as well, whether they invest or they want us to co-invest or us to invest. So that really hasn't changed, and we've been doing it for more than a decade. But what has changed is that we are actually significantly increasing the content because we now have a new spectacular venue in The Londoner for live music, which is already getting great feedback in terms of quality as any both for the audience but also for the office. Robert Goldstein : George, I\u2019d say, in my experience, entertainment is an essential component of any top-tier resort. You can never underestimate how powerful it is as a statement of the customer, longevity, commitment and honestly, for us, it's been stable. I wish regard how we can't do more because it's so powerful, just like retail, just like it's part of the package that makes people to come and visit. The reason why we have been so successful at the Venetian and it was true in Las Vegas. It was true in Lilac City (ph). It was true that anybody has ever worked. It's always been an essential component to be very tolerable in Singapore as well. So to me, it's not even a question, of course, how we do more of this stuff because it pays and pays and pays, very powerful. George Choi : That\u2019s very good color. Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, George. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Daniel Politzer : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. First, on Singapore, the CapEx, the $750 million for Phase 2. How do you think about this maybe relative to your longer-term expansion plans at the property? I know that's been pushed out and the budget is probably higher than it initially was. But I mean, is this more kind of a bridge to that or how should we think about that long term and maybe when we get an update there? Robert Goldstein : Its commitment to Phase 1 because the product as good as it was externally architecturally, it lacked. Frankly, it was necessary that what happens in Phase 2. It's the best money we could spend to make that product successful and stronger. It's going to have enormous dividends in the future, the room product was lacking both from a size perspective, but also a finish perspective. Some of the casino space were just not very good. I always felt that MBS as good as was architecturally is lack of [indiscernible] inside the building. And in our business, great buildings, always prevail, and prevail for a decade and just grow and grow. So that money is money very well spent. It's not connected at all. It's meant to make MBS 1 a very powerful 2-plus billion product. We built in Singapore years ago, the speculation was that you'd never be more than $500 million, $600 million EBITDA. We're going to push through $2 billion and beyond. And I think it's a testament to reinvestment and spend money wisely. It doesn't have any association with Phase 2. Patrick, Phase 2. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. Just to follow on with what Rob said, so fundamentally, we believe it's a product-driven business, right? And so that investment in quality, investment in innovation with great service and guest experience are going to drive the outside returns over time, right? So I think you're seeing that with The Londoner. And in Marina Bay Sands, the rules we just completed Tower 1 and Tower 2. The design is luxurious. It's residential, it is unmatched levels of service. These are the best things we've ever done, and they're basically saying a new standard for hospitality and customer experience at our properties. And to Rob's point, when Tower 3 is done, A Marina Bay Sands is going to be a hotel property in the world. We're really focused on it. From a food and beverage standpoint and from a retail standpoint, as Rob said before, from a guest experience standpoint, that's what we're focused on. IR 2 is going to be something different. It's going to be a new stand-alone development. It's going to have unique spaces, unique design, unique service, but it's something that's probably six months to a year away depending on how things go with approvals in order to get started. It will be additive to Marina Bay Sands. It will grow the market for us, be a different product and allow us to also have a live entertainment venue in Singapore, which is something that we really haven't had in scale before. And so if you look at the power of the Venetian and what we're doing in The Londoner with the venue that Grant mentioned, we will now have that capability in Singapore to drive high-value tourism to drive further growth and to really work that tourism that's related to live entertainment that we never really could do before. So for us, the expansion of Marina Bay Sands is a step function of growth potential. We're looking forward to doing it. We think it will be an unbelievable product. We've been spending a lot of time on it. And hopefully, we'll get a chance to start soon, but a completely different thing. Daniel Politzer : Got it. Thanks. And then just moving to Macao. I think for the last two to three quarters, your non-rolling ship win has been kind of in that 22% to 23% range. Is this a function of just really premium mass being a bigger piece of the mix or -- and so we should think about this kind of edging up over time back to that 23% to 24% plus range or is there something different in this market? And I'm sorry to harp on 1%, but when we're talking $24 billion. Robert Goldstein : You're right to harp on in, something we think about quite a bit. No, that your question is an excellent one, and we look at all the time, I was on the phone last night with our team Macao discussing its fast things we don't have an honest sans to tell you exactly why the entire industry seems to be down [indiscernible]. It's very impactful money we're talking about would be worth probably a couple of hundred million dollars used to us and go back 2% right, because it\u2019s EBITDA. So it's going back. We just don\u2019t have an answer. Is it mix? Maybe is it the removal of junket and that type of thing, maybe. But until we have a really coherent and certain answer, we don't want to give you a response. I'd like to believe that the oil industry trades up a point or 2. I'd vote for that. I'm sure our competitors would. But we didn't make it happen. We need perhaps -- it's very simple. The math on the baccarat games don't change. The customer best can change, ties and payers can change flatback change. So the point is, we don't know the answer ourselves. A lot of people scratched our heads until we have a certain answer we consider confidence. I want to hope along with you that we turn up to 24 again because it'd be a wonderful thing for us with our volumes, it will be incredibly impactful. We'd be at $700 million probably this quarter of EBITDA. So an excellent question. I don't have an excellent answer. We're working to prove it. Grant, any idea you add to that \u2013 that answer. Grant Chum : No, you're exactly right. We don't have a clear answer on that. There's -- in theory, actually, but just a point to make is, in theory, the premium mass being higher, higher mix in the drop actually should be positive for the whole facility. And it could also obviously add more volatility to the metric. But I think Rob is absolutely right that we don't have a clear answer and in truth, I mean this is only like eight, nine months into a recovery where the segments and the customers, I mean, all that is still evolving. So I think it's also premature to make specific pronouncements on what should be the non-rolling total percentage range. So right now, the numbers are what they are. But as you rightly referenced, as Rob also said 0.5 point of different, not even just 1 point, makes a tremendous difference to the numbers, the EBITDA, the margin, et cetera. So we're closely watching this, but there's no clear answer we can give on that in terms of why the whole percentage is where it is versus before. Robert Goldstein : Really in the new world in Macao, and I think people really don't understand. I think it's fast people understand how quickly this thing is reopened. I mean I know you know it, but the problem is Vegas open, regionals open, simple and quite a while ago, Macao was near the game. It's going to open for eight months, 8.5 months. So things are evolving and turning, it's happening quickly. Again, I think it's an instructive look at the trajectory of what happened in Singapore go back to eight months after it open, and you watch us happen double that time it's incredibly, I think, interesting to see the comparisons. I think this whole percentage thing is evolving. And we don't know we'll be wonderful to find out, we're back in '24 in Q2 would be wonderful. But without certainty, we will only give you an answer which we don't have clarity on ourselves, and we do we\u2019re happy to share with the market. Daniel Politzer : Got it. I appreciate all the detail and the perspective. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the last question today is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live. David Katz : Hi. Good day, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back on one detail. I'm not sure if you discussed this, but I'm just looking at the historical margin levels in Singapore, which were north of 50. Could you just talk about the puts and takes of getting back to that level again or if there's some specific headwinds? And then I have one quick follow-up. Patrick Dumont : No problem. I think one thing to highlight is that there was an increase in our tax rate by 3 percentage points and then there was a 1% GST. So what you see there is the impact of that along with inflation of the market. We've been able to manage expenses, manage business mix, manage pricing and push the business to be better. But our long term there is going to be with strong margins, with revenue growth just based on our investment and what we're seeing in the market. So we sort of manage the productivity yield and return on invested capital. Obviously, we look at margins and do our best. But we like where this business is going, and we think the future is very strong. David Katz : Understood. And as my follow-up, with the very, very good quarter that you had, and it's not just for your stuff, but many in our coverage, the market seems to expect some macro pressure in the future. And it's almost an obligatory question for all of our management teams. Are you seeing anything or providing anything that would validate any macro pressure at this point. Patrick Dumont : So I'll tell you what's interesting. You heard up Rob earlier reference our retail productivity. We are in very fortunate markets. So Singapore is an unbelievable place to do business. It's just a great place to visit as a tourist. There's a lot of exciting things to do there. It's a great business environment to trade and I think Singapore has benefited from its years of investment in the structure and people are going there and people are going there and consuming. And so we don't have a huge physical plant there. We've got 2,500 hotel rooms are going down as we add more suites. And I think in, Macao, we're less than 1% penetration in the market. And so when you look at business and leisure tourism opportunities, I don't know that we're impacted like a broad-based consumer staple. I think we're for a narrower segment, we don't appeal to everyone, but I think we're a great tourism assets in both of our markets. And we've continued to see growth through different cycles, because of who we appeal to and the volumes that we need to be successful. David Katz : Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We will refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macao delivered $654 million of EBITDA for the quarter. The number would have been $40 million higher if we had held as expected in the rolling segment. It's only been one year since the end of COVID in Macao. We began in Q1 with $400 million of EBITDA. In Q2, we did $540 million. Q3, we did $630 million. The growth just keeps coming. We look forward to continued growth in both gaming and non-gaming revenue, which will lift in our market. SCL continues to own the largest share of non-rolling table win, rolling table win and slot ETG win. Most importantly, we have the largest share of EBITDA in Macao market by a wide margin. We believe the completed London will need and perhaps even exceed the earning power of the nation. Our future growth in Macao is tethered to these powerful assets, which will drive growth in the years ahead, whether it's rooms, gaming capacity, retail, entertainment, food and beverage, we have stellar assets. Those assets will even get better as we complete the ongoing $1.2 billion Londoner reinvestment program. There is an ongoing speculation of the future growth of Macao. Can Macao market grow to $30 billion, $35 billion, even $40 billion and beyond? We believe that it will. This underscores our confidence in the returns that we generated by capital investment programs in our portfolio. We are staunch believers in the growth of the Macao market in near and long-term. LBS has invested $15 billion in Macao to date. Macao is the most important land-based market in the world. A few reference points to consider, fourth quarter EBITDA, assuming expected hold on rolling play represents considerable growth when compared to the previous quarters. Our retail business in Macao has already far exceeded pre-COVID numbers. I continue to expect the gaming force on our business to follow the same path as Singapore and accelerate in 2024. Let's pivot to the MBS and Singapore. Seven quarters into our reopening, MBS delivered a $544 million a quarter. This is the largest EBITDA for one quarter in the history of the building. The power of this building is evident based on the results despite the disruptive impact of our ongoing $1.75 billion renovation. Disruption notwithstanding MBS is hitting on all cylinders with gaming, lodging and retail perspective. Slots in ETG's MBS are approaching a $1 billion annual run rate. Non-rolling tables are exceeding $20 million of the drop per day. ADRs are escalating and the retail component is delivering far beyond pre-COVID numbers. MBS validates the quality assets prevail and reinvesting in our assets will generate sustained returns. MBS has it all, our iconic building with superb decor and service levels, which attract the most desirable customers in every segment. At the completion of both phases of the renovation program, MBS will feature 770 suites, we previously had less than 200 suites. There is no denying its future. How far can MBS go. Our future expectations starts at $2 billion and beyond in EBITDA per year. As you know, we're bidding for a license in New York. We're receiving strong local support. The cost of the building will be in the $6 billion range, which enables us to develop a true five-star resort with [indiscernible]. This is a massive opportunity. We are very enthused about the prospect. Our bid is compelling. If we receive the license, we'd be in the ground as quickly as possible. Thank you for joining us today. I'll turn the call over to Patrick before we move on to Q&A. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. We wanted to highlight some changes in the materials that we typically provide for the quarter. After discussions and review with the SEC, we will no longer be presenting hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA in our press releases, SEC filings and supplemental earnings materials. These changes are being made to our materials for this quarter and for our reporting going forward. We believe that the analysis of our financial and operating results in any quarter will continue to benefit from an understanding of the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our reported results. We will continue to provide the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our earnings materials. Please see Pages 6 and 7 in our earnings presentation for an overview of the new presentation format. For this quarter, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we generated $654 million of adjusted property EBITDA in Macao, a very strong operating result. It is important to note that we held 2.16% in our rolling segment in Macao. EBITDA would have been higher by $40 million in Macao had we held as expected in our rolling segment. At Marina Bay Sands for the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated $544 million in adjusted property EBITDA, another strong result. We held 4.57% in our rolling segment in Singapore. EBITDA would have been lower by $71 million in MBS had we held as expected in our Rolling segment. It is also important to address our margin structure as we held as expected in our rolling line segments in Macao and Singapore. In Macao, our margins for the fourth quarter of 2023 would have been 35.9%, an improvement of 100 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2023, if our hold was as expected in our rolling volume segment. At MBS, had we held as expected in our rolling volume segment, o ur fourth quarter 2023 margin would have been 48.8%, an increase of 170 basis points sequentially. It's important to note that both in Macao and in Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, we are generating revenue growth, EBITDA growth and when considering expected hold for rolling volume segments, margin expansion. We are very focused on the quality of our offerings on further investment to drive high-value visitation to our properties on the resulting revenue growth and our margin expansion over time. Looking ahead, we are excited about our progress in our markets, and we are focused on growth for the long term. Let's move to the Q&A portion of our call. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live. Please go ahead. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Rob Goldstein : Hi, Joe. Joe Greff : Obviously, the premium mass had significant sequential growth and exceeded the base mass. I was just hoping -- can you talk about the progression of base mass recovery throughout the fourth quarter? And then clearly, what we're seeing out of information for the Macao market as a whole, in January month-to-date is nice overall mass growth pickup. And as you said before, Rob, the growth keeps coming. I was hoping if you can talk about sort of the relative performance of base mass in January and if we're seeing this hopefully anticipated pickup in that mass segment? Rob Goldstein : Thanks, Joe. As you know, we don't comment on the current quarter. The numbers speak for themselves so the market appreciation in Macao in January thus far has been published, a very encouraging doesn\u2019t it, a continuation of December. As for our performance in Q4, I'll turn to Grant to talk about the acceleration of base and premium mass. Grant? Grant Chum : Yes, Rob. Thank you. Yes, Joe, the segment differential growth in the fourth quarter, we had 13% growth in premium mass and 8% growth sequentially on base mass. So I think base mass was progressing nicely through the quarter. It's just that premium mass had a great performance that exceeded that. If you look at the visitation trends during the fourth quarter, Macao actually recovered to almost 90% of 2019 levels on visitations. So I think the base mass is continuously progressing and building up. Transportation infrastructure has been improving. I think the demand to come, I think the desire to take advantage of the non-gaming events that have been coming on stream across our properties, but across the whole industry, have been very effective. So I think you should expect that growth pattern to continue. Rob Goldstein : Grant can say also \u2013 Grant, why I ask is it fair to say transportation and Visa, the whole lubricant that supplies the market into Macao is getting better year after COVID. It seems to me as if the ability to get the desire is there, but also the ability that this improving daily. Is that fair to say? Grant Chum : Yes. The ability to get there has been improving, but the desirability of the destination is even clearer. You can see that the domestic flight to mainland key Greater Bay Area airports has all but fully recovered. And if you look at our ferry statistics, passengers that we carried in the fourth quarter recovered to 93% of pre-COVID, but only 52% of our sailing capacity. So clearly, people are enthusiastic about coming even though the transportation capacity is still recovering. And that's also clear, very gratifyingly the overseas, the foreign visitation recovered dramatically in fourth quarter, especially from Southeast Asia, and that's great to see from Macao. And that's despite the direct flights from foreign countries into Macao, haven't recovered even by, I think, 60% in the fourth quarter versus pre-COVID. But the visitation now is getting back up to 80%, 90% of what it was before despite the flight connectivity still catching up. Joe Greff : Great. And then my follow-up\u2026 Patrick Dumont : Hey, Joe, it\u2019s a -- Joe, before the follow-up, one thing important to note also, it's been a while since we talked about this. But we actually have capacity to absorb base mass business as it continues to come into the market. So when you think about the property portfolio that we have, the investment that we've made in terms of amenities, the tourism attraction for the base mass customer, the ability to service that customer in terms of food and beverage, shopping, entertainment, but also the fact that we have the capacity as that market continues to grow, we'll be the beneficiary of that. And it's important to note, because the market is not at capacity yet. So as more visitors come in this base mass segment, we'll have the ability to absorb it. Sorry, what's your next question? Joe Greff : My next question is for you, Patrick. Obviously, it's nice to see $1 billion of buyback activity this past quarter. Do you view that as a sustainable level unless there's some huge volatility in the share price level? Patrick Dumont : I think there was -- I think there was some activity during the quarter, and to be fair, I think we looked at the share price levels as an opportunity. When we think about our future capital return, as we said before, we kind of expect our share repurchase will be more heavily weighted into that. And so I think we fundamentally believe in the long-term value of share repurchases, the benefit of the compounding, the benefit of the share shrink, trigging that denominator. In terms of amount, I think we'll be measured across time. If you sort of look at our balance sheet, you look at the free cash flow we generate, we're going to look to be aggressive when we can. And I think we're going to run a program where we look to acquire shares consistently over time. But I think -- I don't know that we'll necessarily buy the same amount that we bought in this quarter going forward every quarter. Joe Greff : Okay. And then one final thing, congratulations, Grant, on your promotion. That's all for me. Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. Please go ahead. Stephen, your line is live. Please you may go ahead with your question now. Stephen Grambling : Hey, there. Sorry, can you hear me? Rob Goldstein : Yes. Patrick Dumont : Yes. Stephen Grambling : Sorry about that. So you may have touched on this a little bit, but as we think about the renovations coming up for the remainder of Sands Cotai Central/Londoner. Can you just maybe help contextualize how that will compare to the first renovation, both in terms of disruption and then contribution? Rob Goldstein : Yes. I think we'll turn over to Grant for that comment. Grant, Londoner? Grant Chum : Sure. Thanks, Rob. Thanks for the question, Steve. I mean, I think we can say in terms of the time line, we have already commenced the renovation of the Sheraton Hotel, and that will continue through the whole of 2024, and we'll hopefully complete sometime in the first quarter of 2025. And yes, there could be some impact from construction disruption, especially as we go into the second half of the year. And that a little bit depends on when the works are approved to commence on the Sheraton side of the casino floor, and also as well as the number of keys that will be our at any given time at the Sheraton. That said, I think we'll be managing this whole process just as we did in the first phase when we converted the holiday in into the London starting in 2019. So, we'll be well used to yielding the rest of the portfolio. As you know, the yields we're getting at the Sheraton side of the building is lower than the rest of the portfolio. So, we will be trying to not miss any opportunity to yield the rest of the portfolio whilst the works are going on. And this is something that we've been doing throughout these existing building renovations. Right now, the schedule is still a little bit fluid, just pending some statutory approvals. But at this point, our expectation is the first half will be relative normal and then expect to see some disruption into the second half. But then by 2025, we're going to be in a dramatically elevated and different position in terms of the entire Londoner. You asked about the Phase I and Phase II contribution. Well, we have done the bulk of the work in the public areas and external facade in the Phase I and the retail mall and one the two casino floors, but we only touched 1,000 keys out of the 6,000 that we have. So, the main difference is that Phase II is going to address the majority of the hotel inventory in terms of renovation and of course, the other main gaming floor that we have on the Sheraton side. Rob Goldstein : Stephen, just to follow on Grant's comments. I understand the market is concerned about London disruption. It's a valid point. However, two thoughts for you. One is that I think if the market continues to accelerate like we're seeing January market numbers, perhaps we can overcome that by using other assets in the portfolio. But secondly, to Grant's comment, I think when you see the eventual transformation of Londoner, it will be a juggernaut on par with the -- or beyond. So it gives us two assets we think can probably make $3 billion by themselves. And while there's disruption 2024, 2025 in Beyond gives us something that's unique in that market. The number one and two assets are number one in on assets in that market for years to come. So, there may be some disruption but maybe market force can overcome that, but I think the end result is well worth the pain. Stephen Grambling : That's all super helpful. Maybe an unrelated follow-up on Singapore. Looking at least at the visitation data, it seems like it was mixed at best, but yet you're still seeing that market grow sequentially from an EBITDA standpoint, revenue I guess, what are you seeing from China customers coming back to the market? Any initial reason how we should be thinking about that building into next year? Patrick Dumont : I think I'm happy to give -- go ahead, Rob. Go ahead. Rob Goldstein : Go ahead, Patrick. I'll follow yours. Go ahead. Patrick Dumont : Yes. So, I think the key thing about Singapore is it's really about quality of tourism. So, we've been very focused on investment. If you heard us over the last couple of calls and what our investment thesis is, that the higher-quality assets we have, the higher-quality tourism will attract, and that's really on full display here. So, it's not about quantity. It's not about the full recovery. It's the fact that we're getting very high-value tourists if you look at Singapore as a market, it's incredibly attractive, right? It has a growing high net worth population. There's a lot of family offices moving there. There's a lot of business activity there. There's political stability, there's strong tourism infrastructure, it's got a strategic location, all of those things are benefiting the Singapore market overall and helping drive the business that we're in. And so for us, there's been a ramp from China. That's true. But there's still a lot more to go. It's still, let's call it, 50% on visitor arrivals. You may have heard that at some point, they're going to go visa-free this year. We're hopeful that, that actually occurs, which there's no way to know exactly how that official that it will be, but it can't hurt. But I think the key thing is just a very attractive market, but it really -- the results you see in this quarter in a building that was really under construction, didn't have its full suite complement and didn't really have a lot of the amenities that we'll have in halfway through 2024 and 2025. I think really speaks to the capability of the market and where this building can go. You heard Rob in his remarks about our view of the trajectory of this business, we're very bullish on it. But I think it's really just about high-value tourism. I wouldn't look at the absolute number of visitor arrivals and use it as a determining factor for where the business can go. Rob Goldstein : I think Patrick's comments are spot on, Steve. We have limited -- we have capacity constrained building in MBS. Unfortunately, we only have so many rooms suites, which we got 10 times as much, but we don't. So the mass market tourism is as important to us as the right tourists in the market. We look at this asset as a $2 billion asset today annualized EBITDA, but we believe it can grow 10% to 20% over the next three to four years. And then hopefully, we can finalize our plans with the government once the government blesses another building, we believe that, that could open later this year and make us a $3 billion projected EBITDA by end of decade in Singapore. So we see ourselves now at $2 billion, going to $2.2, billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and eventually stepping up to $3 billion. We see huge growth in this asset. It's just beginning. We got obviously hampered by COVID, but to watch it growing is growing. Our only disappointment in Singapore is we just don't have more space, because it's a very desirable market and that building probably the most valuable in hotel building ever built in the world and will just accelerate in the next three, to four, five years until hopefully, we can tell you a finality, we have a deal in Phase II. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. It\u2019s all helpful. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Please go ahead. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you. Hey, guys. Rob, you touched on it a little bit just there, but I was wondering, obviously, there's a ton of moving parts with COVID and everything else, but $1 billion in Phase I at Marina Bay Sands. Returns on that product look to be very favorable, $750 million over 2024 and into 2025. I was wondering how you think about returns there? And then to your point there at the end of your last comments, when do you expect to have an update around the timing and perhaps the spend on the larger scale projects there? Rob Goldstein : I'll just reiterate how much we believe in Singapore as a market. My comment is about $3 billion. We actually believe retainable when we opened this new building late in the decade. As for the update, Patrick's been right in the middle of that. So Patrick please take it away in terms of Phase II Singapore. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I think it's an interesting comment. I think the key thing for us is that we are an investment-driven story, right? So the more we invest in high-quality assets, the better service levels we have, the more we're going to have pricing, the more we're going to differentiate our product, the more we're going to have high-value tourists and the more our EBITDA and margins will grow. And so you're seeing that happen real time in Singapore. And so for us, I think we'll finish the third tower by Chinese New Year next year, that $750 million will go in. We'll saw some amenities that have to be done across parts of 2025 -- but by the mid part of 2025, we're basically going to have what is, in effect, a brand-new building. It's going to be fully renovated, and you'll get to see the full power of the suite product on the rolling side. You get to see the power of the premium mass and all the amenities that we have, the shopping, the entertainment, all the things that we're adding in terms of our premium mass lifestyle program that you can't get any place else. These are all very positive things and the quality of these amenities base customers want to be repeat visitors. And so for us, these investments will drive very high returns. That's the reason why we were willing to do and that reason why the board was supportive. You can see the trajectory of EBITDA now, we're not even done. So we think Tower 3 will be very accretive in terms of investment. You heard the numbers Rob just mentioned. We're very confident in those numbers. We feel very strongly, but that's where we should be going. And then in terms of the next building, IR 2, we've been in very close discussions with the government over many months. There's a lot of moving parts here, a lot of things we have to satisfy. This is a project of national significance. We want to make sure that everyone is comfortable with it and that we get all the proper approvals, and we're hoping in the next quarter or two that we'll get everything done. We've been making good progress. We've been visiting Singapore, and we feel very confident where we are. And hopefully, we'll be able to get all the green lights we need and we'll be able to et going soon. Carlo Santarelli : That's all I need. Thank you guys. Helpful. Rob Goldstein : Thank you, Carlo. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Please go ahead. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to offer my congrats to Grant on the promotion as well. And maybe speaking of promotions, Grant or whoever, if you could comment a little bit just on the promotional environment. I mean, I think this is a big question or theme that came out of the quarter last quarter and just sort of what you're seeing, particularly at the upper end of the premium mass segment right now? And in general, our premium mass market margins consistent with your pre-COVID expected ranges, or are they still a little bit below that? And what would it take for them to recover? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : Grant? Shaun, that was good by the way. Thank you. Grant Chum : Thank you, Shaun for the question. I think if you look at the competitive landscape, of course, it is very intense at the premium mass segment. But if you look at also at our margin structure, I think the way we've driven our business is no different from before, which is to really drive and elevate the product and to drive the content and the events that we put on across a whole range of sectors to attract visitors and patrons. And I do think that back to Patrick's opening comment, if you look at that margin progression, underlying margin grew another 100 basis points. We actually saw a good improvement in our mass margin sequentially. So we are dealing with the competitive market as any competitor does. It is intense, but we believe strongly that in the end, product wins and Londoner and Grand Suisse at Four Seasons are true living evolving testaments of that argument, that good product wins. And there are going to be fluctuations in the competitive intensity in particular segments at different points in time. But to have a sustainable competitive advantage and sustainable profitable growth, product and service and the content we put into the resort calendar are still going to trump everything else. And you can see that through what we've done at Londoner is already at a run rate of close to $800 million as it was exiting the year. And you can see that the way this is going, we will end up with a margin structure as we already are in Q4 back to the same level as we were in 2019. And then as the revenues continue to grow, you should logically expect that margin to continue to improve and therefore, exceed where we were in 2019. Rob Goldstein : Shaun, can I just follow up on Grant's comments. My experience has always been the same. Regardless of the market, great buildings and great experiences always prevail. We have those in Macao. If you look at our EBITDA in Q3, I believe our EBITDA exceeded our next two contenders combined, which is quite a statement to the power of our buildings. There will be promotional issues occasionally here and there, so in the end, we have a structural advantage, which can't be undermined. We have more capacity for lodging, food and beverage, retail entertainment and gaming capacity [indiscernible] by a bunch, and that will enable us to avail both a margin and EBITDA basis. And so yes, there will be occasionally a promotional issue here and there, but it really shouldn't concern as far as our business. Our margins remain intact, and our dominance remain intact in all segments in Macao. Shaun Kelley : Thank you, Rob for that. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, last quarter, it was mentioned, Grant, I think in one of your comments or one of your responses, a little bit about a bit of an uneven recovery we were seeing coming out of some of the source markets from broader Mainland China, as some of the air travel reopening. Wondering if we're continuing to see that uneven recovery or just any other broader signs of the kind of where the macro situation sits in China? Because so far, and again, seems to be continuing through January. Seems like Macao is relatively unaffected there, but I wanted sort of an update on that trajectory, if you could give one. Grant Chum : Sure, Shaun. I think if you look at fourth quarter, it did even have quite a bit. I think if you look at bans visitation from non-Guangdong versus Guangdong slides\u2026 Daniel J. Briggs: Page 20. Grant Chum : Are catching. Yes. Thanks, Dan. We're catching up significantly on the recovery rate in non-Guangdong. That said, it is still uneven in the sense that if you look at the breakdown by province, some of the wealthier provinces, have recovered way beyond pre-COVID levels of visitations, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta versus even Guangdong, the recovery rate is actually much higher. But overall, I think you can see an evening out in terms of the recovery rate in Guangdong versus non-Guangdong. And then also, I think the fourth quarter, the overseas, the foreign country visitation also started to accelerate and even out as well against the nearby region source markets. So I think you are seeing I think, a progressive improvement across all the source markets. I don't know, maybe Wilford, I don't know if you have anything to add on the China side in terms of the \u2013 the economy. Wilford Wong : Yes, Shaun, China is still recovering from the tough COVID period. And \u2013but what is evident is the company's quarterly performance has actually been trending well. We have seen as Grant alluded to, healthy growth in the number of visitors, especially from the non-confidential region. Now one observation is that when long-haul travels of Chinese travelers has not fully recovered, Macao is emerging as a top tourist destination for short-haul drivers from the Chinese mainland. Shaun Kelley : Thank you everyone. Rob Goldstein : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie Chad, your line is live. Please go ahead. Chad Beynon : Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one, just about the retail portfolio. We've been hearing and seeing a little bit of pressure just kind of in the luxury retail space, particularly in Asia based on the numbers that you put out and I guess, the turnover rent that you collected, you're not seeing that. But how are you thinking about the recovery in retail? Are you getting the right customers in there now? And do you think this could continue to improve as visitation and overall spend improves in 2025 or 2024? Thank you. Rob Goldstein : If you look at your deck on, I think it's Page 28 and 29, it gives you a pretty good look at our retail portfolio in Asia and be blunt about it, how it could be in half of these numbers, almost $3,000 a foot and a 600,000-foot more at MBS. Finished $2,000 a foot with 800,000 feet, of course, $9,200 a foot at the Four Seasons luxury and a mere $4,200 a foot on the non-luxury, so the answer is we are seeing our retail portfolio that's approaching $700 million of contribution and growing. Of course, there's discussions out, they'll be mentioned a slowdown globally. But it looks to me that I spoke to David, because they are retail experts. It feels like we continue to see opportunity to remerchandize and get better and better at the retail segment. We still believe that retail is a long way to go. Our buildings are a little different than other retail and that we attract a higher value customer both in Macao and Singapore, as you reference the lack of supply in Singapore. So I think that mall just keeps appreciating and we keep re-merchandizing it to be more effective every day, more luxurious, more upscale. In Macao, we've got work cut out for us in some of our buildings, not there yet in the Parisian. There's some work to be done, but I don\u2019t know how you could argue with these kind of results, $677 million of contribution, and it just keeps accelerating. It compares very favorably with 2019. So we feel very bullish about our retail prospects. And again, it takes work. David Sylvester constantly remerchandize read things and reassesses the portfolio. He's got a lot of work to do. But the numbers, I think, are stellar and I think we'll continue to be stellar for years to come. Chad Beynon : Thanks. Rob. Makes sense. And then just in terms of the hold, understanding that it's kind of random here in terms of luck or unlucky. Has there been any difference in terms of game play or you talk about kind of the recovery from the Chinese consumer. And I'm speaking of Singapore, but hold has been high now for three quarters. So is there anything that could kind of lead to maybe an elevated hold in that market in the near term, or should we expect kind of the reversion to the mean that we've seen in prior quarters and years? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : I think it's safe to say this business always runs on mathematics. The mathematics prevail, and I wouldn't take three quarters as an ongoing trend forever. There'll be a dark day in Singapore will miss by $70 million, because we take the highest volume players in the world, people who bet lots of money. And some days, it goes with you and someday it doesn't. This quarter, obviously, in Singapore went with us. But I would caution you, I don't think that the betters are changing. In fact, if any of the there's more of them, more affluence coming out of Asia, and we're fortunate enough to have the capacity to handle all of it. But I don't think you can point to a change in betting patterns in either jurisdiction that would elevate or hurt the whole percentage. It will be revert the mean always. And Macao will come back next quarter probably and do $70 million higher and Singapore may have a bad quarter. Grant, do you have any comment on that? That's how I see it. Grant Chum : That's exactly right, Rob. And people have relatively short memories. But in the fourth quarter of 2022, there is like $100 million plus adjustment on the downward impact from low hold at Marina Bay Sands. So I think one or two, three, four even five quarters is actually a relatively short period of time and sample size for you not to get potentially very random results that deviate from the expected normal hold. But I think it's fair to say, yeah, the mathematics always prevail. And given the scale of our business, over time over one year, two years, we should stay very much in the expected range. As you saw in Macao as well, we had the first three quarters holding significantly above the expected mean hold and then fourth quarter reversed. And for the whole year, we end up at about 3.3%, which is exactly where we expect it to be. Rob Goldstein : And Chad, going back yeah, just to find going back, I don't know, maybe eight, 10 years ago, we had a horrific number of quarters in a row due to a few players, I think, was Indonesia or Malaysia and we lost obscene amounts of money quarter after quarter to them. And some people on our Board were concerned as they want to be sure. And we talk -- we looked at everything, and we're very comfortable. And there is a belief therefore a while that these people were magical and could be beaten and they lost back their entire winnings and then some. It always goes that way. I don't think you can ever get too emotional about this quarter, it's very interesting to see the Macao miss and the Singapore overachieving. But in the end, the games stay consistent, pairs and ties versus straight bets do matter. But the Asian gambler is special. And he or she shows up consistently and they're great customers. I wouldn't let the success of a few quarters change your views on the mathematics of backlog. We don't. So thank you. Chad Beynon : Great. Thank you. Grant Chum : Thanks, Chad. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Please go ahead. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. Two questions, if I could crease it in. One is just any comments on Chinese New Year upcoming anything with trends approaching that? And then Cole-related just your latest expectations for timing of a decision in New York? Thanks. Rob Goldstein : I'll take New York first, Robin. The governor, Governor Hochul, I think it was this week commented on seeing something happen this year. I hope that's true. We're -- as you know, are -- we've been working in New York for quite a long time. And we think we have a very compelling bid. But we don't have any great insight if that will happen. We sure hope the Governor is correct. And either way, win or lose we\u2019ll get decision in calendar year 2024. That's our hope. But I think it'd be [indiscernible] any insight beyond the governor's comments. I think we just -- we worked very hard on this project. We believe we have a really good chance of getting one, but I don't give you -- I couldn't give you any guidance beyond that. Grant, Chinese New Year. Do you think he'll be any there for that? Will the year of the dragon bring anybody to the building? Grant Chum : Well, Robin, I mean, we can't really comment on the current quarter and obviously, booking windows are short here. But I think you can see from the December holidays in these peak holiday periods, even though the end of December is not a big China holiday. It is in Hong Kong and some other parts of the region. But the ramp-up in demand during those peak periods was tremendous. So hopefully, that will be replicated through into this Chinese New Year as well. So there is a lot of optimism and expectations that this will be a strong one, yes. Rob Goldstein : Robin, I do think, Robin, I think December was really great tell what might happen in Chinese -- December numbers that closed were just terrific. And again, you see the market numbers for January. So we're very hopeful that the year of Dragon is a huge year for us into the market. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. And Grant, congratulations on the new role. Thanks. Grant Chum : Thank you, Robin. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt Montour : Good evening everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So in Singapore on the Phase II, I was wondering if you could maybe remind us the total room count exiting the year and then specifically with regards to disruption cadence what is the quarter-to-quarter and overall year look like in terms of how that will flow through the P&L? Rob Goldstein : Patrick, do you want to grab that? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. So, yes, sure. So I think when we finished the year, we were around 2,200 keys available next year because of the construction in T3, Tower 3, we're going to get down to the mid 1,600 in Q3, it's probably going to be our peak of disruption. But those rooms are smallest right now and really have our lowest yield. So hopefully, the impact will be minimal, and we'll be able to yield because of the compression to higher-value customers. The performance today on Sands has been quite good, and you think we'll be able to yield up in the renovated portion of the building. Sorry, what was the rest of your question? Brandt Montour : And sorry, so then the ending key count when all is said and done with suites and normal rooms? Patrick Dumont : It's mid-1800s. Brandt Montour : Mid 1800, perfect. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just a broader question. We haven't really talked about non-gaming spending. I was just curious if you could give us update on your efforts on that front and maybe how your outlook has evolved for the return profile as we sort of go into 2024 on non-gaming spend? Rob Goldstein : When you say non-gaming, can you be more specifically talking about retail, food and beverage, hotels? Brandt Montour :  Of course, sorry about that. Yeah, with regards to the concession agreements. Rob Goldstein : Oh, I see. Okay. I'm going to let Grant handle that, but I would say we are a little bit different than the rest of our competitors in terms of we've been spending money aggressing Macao forever for 20 years on entertainment and other things. We believe it's a huge value add. I'll let Grant take the question specifically. But I think, again, it's important to note, we are a different animal than other people in terms of this concession. We welcome it. We've been doing it before the concession mandate. I think it's been very beneficial to our company. Grant? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think in 2023, we went very intensely on investing across all of the non-gaming categories that we committed to in the concession. As Rob said, many of these categories are categories that we have been investing in involved in for a very long time. So I think whether you look across entertainment, we had almost 80 shows that we put on during 2023 with some amazing record runs attendance. Obviously, firstly, with the Jacky Cheung concert in Cotai Arena, and then towards the end of the year, [indiscernible] a singer in Hong Kong and had a great 14 show run at the Londoner. So it's probably set a new standard and precedent for many residencies in Macao. And then across other categories in MICE, in art and culture, in themed attractions and gastronomy. Across the board, we've been investing heavily. I should also give a chance to Wilford to speak to some of those events and projects that we've been heavily investing in as well. But suffice to say versus our original forecast for what we would invest in the first year of the 10 years, we greatly exceeded that during 2023. And we're looking to do so again in 2024. Wilford, I don't know if -- so you want to add to the non-gaming concession and investments we're making. Wilford Wong : Yes. We have, in the past years, been investing heavily in the areas that Grant just described. And by a long way off, we are the leader in the MICE market. So we are still seeing a very strong presence of MICE activities in our properties. For non-gaming, apart from the shows, we've been helping to promote Macao as a destination, not just for gaming. Therefore, we have a lot of art exhibitions, cultural shows that really put us apart from the other competitors. Brandt Montour : Great. Very helpful. Thanks, all. Grant Chum : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live. Please go ahead. David Katz : Hi. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll ask to the both on one shot. If I could follow up on the share repurchases, Patrick, not asking about how much or when -- but just thinking about how the family stake takes a long-term view on where you'd like to be or how we might think about that evolving over time? And then second, since we last spoke on an earnings call, there's been an awful lot of activity and focus in Texas. And if you could share some of your views and thesis around what -- what the family's activities and how they might relate to the company and shareholders, that would be helpful as well. Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Sure. So I think first off, I think we see value in both equities. So we're very long-term bullish. From a company standpoint, we're going to continue to be aggressive, as you said before, focusing on investment for growth. Do you see the success of our capital allocation programs, both in Macao as Grant just described in Singapore in driving growth in high-value tourism in diversifying our amenities and by creating margin and revenue expansion. So we're very focused on investment for growth. That being said, we generate a lot of free cash flow, and we anticipate to generate free cash flow in the future that we'll be able to use to return capital to shareholders. So I think the company will look to be aggressive and measured over time as we return capital share through share repurchases to shareholders. I think we've always had a dividend is not from the pandemic. I think we like having a dividend. We think it's helpful for shareholder returns. We think it's an important component of our overall shareholder value strategy. But that being said, we're going to be overweight to share repurchases. In terms of Texas, I think the most important thing is that Las Vegas Sands is actively trying to facilitate the development of integrated resorts in the State of Texas and through the liberalization of gaming. And so we're very excited about it. We think it's an unbelievable market. Over time, we hope that it happens. I can't tell you when it's going to be, but we're very focused on it as a company, and we like the opportunity to develop some very unique tourism assets, specifically in Dallas. We think that's a great market. We've been very focused on it. And we think the opportunity there would be a great one. In terms of the family's activities in Texas, I think we like the state. We're very obviously happy with our investment there. We're very excited about it. And we'll look to be part of the business community there. But in terms of LVS, we're very focused on bringing integrated resource to decimate resource, the State of Texas and the development opportunity that would exist there. David Katz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Please go ahead. Dan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on Sands China and as it relates to capital allocation. Your net leverage there, I think, is around three times at this point. It should be much lower than that as you kind of make your way through 2024. How do you think about the subsidiary there resuming dividend payments up to the parent? And then obviously, your stake went up a little bit through the quarter through those debt repurchase. So maybe does that incentivize some of those dividends coming up sooner than later? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : If it's okay. I'll take that one. I think the key thing here, as I just mentioned in the prior question, and as Grant mentioned, as Wilford mentioned, we're very committed to investing in the long term in Macao. And so our primary focus is going to be deploying capital there for growth. That being said, we are generating meaningful free cash flow there as we did in this last quarter. I think what you'll look to see over time is that some of the leverage that we put on the balance sheet during the pandemic will decease. So we have a maturity coming up in 2025. We'll look to decease some of that in front of the refinancing. And our goal is really to bring leverage down in terms of quantum, but then also our leverage is going to come in naturally as our EBITDA stands over time, which is our expectation. So I think once that occurs, we're going to start looking to begin the dividend again at the Sands China level. That's something that's going to be determined by the Board there. But I think overall, it's something that we'd like to see. And I think the goal is to begin that dividend in the years ahead. It was a very strong dividend payer in prior years pre-pandemic. And we'd like to become an investment-grade name there, keep that investment-grade rating, invest in the future in terms of scale and scope to grow our business there and then return excess capital through dividends to shareholders there. So that's the plan. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just for my follow-up, as you think about Macao, we've talked a bit about the margins and the improvement, more or less, it's been about 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you think about kind of the trajectory from here, and I know you're on pace to get back to those 2019 levels how should we think about maybe the pacing of improvement? And do you think that operating expense structure is really in place at this point, you should benefit from scale here on out? Patrick Dumont : I have one quick comment and I'd like to turn it to Grant. We've mentioned this a few times in the past couple of quarters. I think the story of our margin expansion in Macao is going to be based on revenue growth. As the market continues to recover, as tourism continues to recover as more high-value tourists come online, they see the types of high-quality offerings lab, they experience the amenities and the entertainment that Grant referenced earlier, we're going to continue to grow and expand our customer base. And that will lead to pricing, that will be to expansion, that will lead to revenue growth. So, from that standpoint, I think our long-term margin view is expansion because of the investment and because of what we just described. But I'll turn it over to Grant to see if he has some additional comments. Grant Chum : Yes, Patrick, I think you covered it well. I think it's dependent on revenue growth as the market continues to grow, and we will be more than a full participant in that market growth. The margins will have a positive trajectory. I think we obviously have a more efficient and more productive cost structure today than we did in 2018 and 2019. So, we will -- we are benefiting from that as revenues grow and you get the operating leverage on the fixed costs. We will continue to do so. And I think it is very much about how revenues grow from here. And as revenues grow, our margins will have further upside. Dan Politzer : Got it. And congratulations on the promotion Grant. Grant Chum : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Choi from Citi. George, your line is live, please go ahead. George Choi : Thanks for taking my questions. My questions were answered earlier, but do have a housekeeping question. Would you please remind us how the overran mechanism works at the Macao properties? Should we expect a normal uptick in the quarter? That is when you guys received for rent? Thank you very much, I will come back to the queue. Rob Goldstein : I'm sorry, George, I think we missed that. Could you repeat yourself? It was unclear there was some difficult -- static, yes. Can you try again, George, about Macao? George Choi : Apologies. So, I just wonder how the turnover rent mechanism works in the Macao properties. Is it a fourth quarter event? Is that when you receive your term rate? Rob Goldstein : Grant, do you want to handle the fourth quarter turnover to retail. Grant Chum : George, there are leases that are on monthly turnover rents and there are leases that are on annual turnover rents. So, historically, what happens is for those annual turnover rent leases as we get into the third quarter, the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will obviously be recognizing more of those turnover rents, as we hit the annual sales targets. So, historically, you should expect seasonally the second half of the retail rental revenues will be higher than the first half. George Choi : Okay. Understood. That's all I have. Thank you very much. Rob Goldstein : Before we finalize the call, I want to reach out and recognize the great contributions of Wilfred Wong, who is now Executive Vice Chair. Wilfred has been with us about eight years and made a great contribution. And Wilfred, congratulations on the elevation of Executive Vice Chair. Grant Chum, well deserved. We hired Grant many years ago, the big concern was, was he old enough to win the casino at that time? And over the years, he's aged insufficiently, so he did not win the casino. Congratulations to you Grant. Both of you guys have built a terrific team over there. We're very proud and grateful for your efforts and look forward to many more years working together. Thank you for your time today and interest in our company. We bid you adieu. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

We will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, Paul. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Dumont, our President and COO; Dr. Wilfred Wong, Executive Vice Chairman of Sands China; and Grant Chum, CEO and President of Sands China and EVP of Asia Operations. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making these statements under the safe harbor provision of Federal Securities laws. The Company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We will refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those of interested to please pose one question and one follow-up so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. The Macao market continues to grow as it has each in the past five quarters. Since the reopening in early 2023, the annual run rate of the market has grown every quarter from $17 billion in Q1 of last year to $22 billion, then $24 billion and $26 billion, now reaching $28 billion in annualized gaming revenue. We remain confident -- so fully confident in the future growth of the Macao market. I've said in the past, Macao market will grow to $30 billion and then $35 billion and then $40 billion beyond in the years ahead, I remain steadfast in our belief. We remain equally confident in our business strategy to invest in both the quality and scale of our market-leading assets in Macao. Our capital investment programs ensure that we will continue to be the market leader in the years ahead. Our investments position us to grow faster than the market over the long term to grow our share of EBITDA in the market and to generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our current financial results for Macao. We delivered a solid result for the quarter despite the disruption of our ongoing capital investment programs. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and most importantly, in the market share of EBITDA. Because of our market-leading investments, we will capture high-value, high-margin tourism over the long run. We have a unique competitive position in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the London and our co-tying redevelopment program, our product advantage will be more substantial than ever. Turning to Singapore, we delivered a record quarter. We believe it's a record for the industry. So the team there has done an extraordinary job, and this is what happens when a superior product is located in the proper market. Our financial results in Singapore reflect the impact of our capital investment programs and our service capabilities. The appeal of Singapore as its tourist and destination and the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar also contributed to the growth at MBS. As we complete the balance of our investment programs, there will be a lot more runway for growth in the future. Thanks for joining us today. I'll turn it over to Patrick for more details. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $610 million. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $31 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected holds in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin would have been 34.4%, or up 380 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023. This highlights our focus on cost discipline and profitability. The ongoing capital investment programs at The Londoner and at the Cotai Arena had an impact on our results this quarter. The Cotai Arena was closed for renovation in January this year. After the significant reinvestment and renovation, the arena is expected to reopen in November. In terms of the second phase of the Londoner, we have now commenced the room renovation on the first Sheraton. We plan the completion of the first tower by year-end and of the second tower by Golden Week in May of 2025. The renovation of the casino on the Sheraton side of London will commence in May of this year with the reopening scheduled for December of 2024. While there will be ongoing disruption from these capital projects, as these products come online between the end of '24 and the first half of '25, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. The scale, quality and diversity of product will be better than we have ever offered before. They will be unmatched in the market. Turning to Singapore, MBS and EBITDA came in at $597 million, an all-time record for the property and for the industry. Our strong results reflect the impact of high-quality investment and market-leading products. Had we held as expected in our Rolling Play segment, EBITDA would have been $77 million lower. Had we held as expected in the Rolling Play segment, MBS EBITDA margin would have been 49.1%, or 181 -- 180 basis points higher than in Q1 of 2023. We have now completed both Tower 1 and Tower 2 of the Marina Bay Sands hotel refurbishment. While we have substantially completed the original $1 billion CapEx program, we are still in initial stages of realizing the benefits of these new products. We have now commenced the next phase of our capital investment program at Marina Bay Sands. The $750 million renovation that includes Tower 3. Tower 3 is scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of next year. This will support further growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our program to return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $450 million of LVS stock during the quarter. We also paid our recurring quarterly dividend. In addition, LVS has completed the previously announced purchase of $250 million of SCL stock, which increases the parent company's ownership interest in SCL to approximately 71%. We continue to see value in both repurchasing LVS stock and increasing our ownership interest in SCL. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's capital return program to increase return to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now, let's take some questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks so much. You talked to the March higher for the market in Macau, but this quarter looks like the margin flow through and EBITDA actually went in the other direction. How should we be thinking about flow through in Macau and operating expenses going forward in that market? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I just want to say one thing before we turn it over to Grant. I think some of this has to do in Macau with some of the disruption that we experienced during the quarter. So when we take the arena in January, we lose the benefit of our entertainment programs during a peak period. That did have an impact. So when you look at our operation, you compare it to Q1 of last year, Q1 of last year, we were coming out of the pandemic and it really took a while for visitation to get started again. This year, unfortunately, we did this to ourselves. We started renovating our arena. It's a very powerful asset. It has lots of entertainment and went through the Chinese New Year period and unfortunately, with some hotel rooms out and the arena out, we felt on the revenue side. So as we've said before, as the market continues to grow, we will do well. We have the best product. We've invested the most in non-gaming assets. We have the most amenities to offer to our patrons and they're very high quality, diversity of retail, diversity of food and beverage, diversity of entertainment, which is very important. Unfortunately, we didn't have that tool this quarter in full swing. We only had the London arena, which is good, but it can't compete with the Cotai Arena. So I think for us, as the revenues continue to grow, as you've seen in prior quarters, our margins will fall in line. And you see that in the Venetian, as the revenues are where they need to be, the margins fall in line as well. So that's sort of the headline from the margin performance this quarter. I do want to turn it over to Grant to see if he has any additional color. Grant Chum : Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. I think the most important point is still the GGR is growing in the market, and I think if you look at our profitability, at this level of GGR, I think we should be looking at low to mid-30s in operating margin -- EBITDA margin, and we're right at the high end of the range there. Obviously, each quarter there's seasonality relating to different parts of the business, the revenue mix. So first quarter, I think 34.4% in terms of underlying margin is a really good number. I think 2024 is going to be one that is impacted by our capital works and the renovations that Patrick referenced also in his opening remarks. We have obviously, started the hotel renovation in the first half of Sheraton, and down -- we're probably down about 500, 600 rooms in the first quarter on average in that hotel. But the number of keys that will be out of inventory will increase further in the second and third quarters. And of course, Cotai Arena, as Patrick referenced, that's always been a core part of our content programming, our content offering, and we were able to offer plenty of shows at the London Arena. But if you just compare -- just the sheer number of shows that we had in the first quarter, we had 12 shows compared with the fourth quarter last year, we had 31 shows. It's a big difference. And obviously, in terms of capacity, there's a big difference. So the attendance per show obviously was much higher in the fourth quarter as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color in terms of the disruption that had on our business with the arena being closed for renovation. And as I said, the hotel renovation is ongoing and you're going to see more keys out of inventory in the next couple of quarters. Stephen Grambling : Got it. And maybe one clarification. I guess in the quarter, industry-wide, I'm not sure, maybe I missed this in the presentation or I haven't seen the slides, but is VIP -- the VIP actually grew faster than mass overall in the first quarter for the industry. And how are you thinking about base mass versus premium mass from here? I know you kind of touched on this a little bit, but would be curious about the industry-wide thought process. Patrick Dumont : Rob, should I take that? Robert Goldstein : Yes. Yes, please. Yes. Patrick Dumont : Yes, you're right. I think if you look at our slides, the mass revenues sequentially would be around 4%, and the overall GGR for the quarter grew at 6% sequentially. So yes, the VIP revenues in the market as a whole grew faster than the mass revenues Q-o-Q. I think in terms of the premium mass versus base mass, again, I think you can see it from our slides. Premium mass grew slightly faster for us in this quarter, but the difference is not material when you account for things like whole percentage and patron counts and so forth. So I wouldn't say, there's a material divergence in the growth rates between premium mass and base mass, and it's part of business for the quarter. Robert Goldstein : I think it's important to note that -- it's important that the visitation still isn't like it to be. Obviously, there's still millions of people have not come versus the 2019 visitation numbers. We believe long-term visitation GGRs did grow, whether it be base or premium, we'll get more than our fair share. And I think we've seen obviously, I'll say the obvious, the promotional situation the market has changed and more people incent doing things. And once everyone starts playing that game, I believe that will resolve itself. We believe that assets will prevail. We believe London will be extraordinary asset much like it's happening in Singapore. I think our results in Singapore reflect a fully developed program and the execution in Singapore shows what can be done. We have the right kind of assets. What we have even done in Singapore the number is extraordinary. The same will happen in our business in Macao in time. As DGOs accelerate and they will, visitation accelerates and it will. We'll continue to be margin-focused, even without focus, and get more than a fair share and assets will prevail over promotions from our perspective. Stephen Grambling : Got it, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Appreciate it. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Thank you. Just following up on the first quarter margins. If I look at the fourth quarter, for example, and kind of extract the big element of turnover rent that comes in and obviously, very high flow through, it looks like margins are probably fairly similar. So it doesn't seem like a lot changed on that front. Is that accurate? Or am I missing something else seasonally there? Robert Goldstein : Primarily you're correct. That's a fair statement to make. The term red does, as you know, as you know to occur in the fourth quarter, and it's material. Grant, do you want to add to that? Grant Chum : Yes, it's accurate. You're right. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you. And if I could, just one follow-up on capital allocation. Obviously, over $400 million of buyback in this quarter. As you guys think about the capital needs here going forward, the stuff that you've announced, the stuff that obviously, is being contemplated and looking for budgets around and whatnot. Do you feel like that this pace is adequate and where you want to be as you look throughout the balance of this year? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. So I think first off, I just want to say we see value in both equities. And I think, we have a very long-term bullish view given the market opportunity for growth, our market-leading investments and our assets, and just how we feel about the opportunities in both markets that we have. So as we said before, we're going to be overweight share repurchases. As we think about future capital return, we are going to be more heavily weighted towards share repurchase and dividends. We think the repurchases are going to be more accretive than dividends over time and we want to shrink that denominator. And so I think we're going to look to make purchases that are consistent with our share authorization by the Board and with prior practice. And I think we'll look to be a little bit opportunistic. We may vary levels, but I think we're going to continue to be aggressive in the market. I mean, I think you see with the $450 million of LVS shares, the SCL share repurchases, we think this represents an interesting opportunity just a moment in time. And so we're going to try to take advantage of it. We happen to have a very strong balance sheet. We have a lot of liquidity and we tend to put it to use. So I think we're pretty happy with where the program has taken us so far -- both so far and we'll continue to use it and we'll see how it goes across the year. But we're going to look to repurchase more shares. Carlo Santarelli : Thanks for that, Patrick. Just one aside. Guys, I'm not sure the slides are actually posted yet. It certainly could be a user error, but it looks like that they haven't posted yet for the first quarter. Patrick Dumont : Yeah, we're working on it. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Greff from J.P. Morgan. Joe, your line is live. Joe Greff : Hey, everybody. I was hoping one of you could maybe help quantify the revenue and EBITDA impact from the renovations going on at Londoner and Cotai Arena. And then do you see that renovation disruption impact accelerating, and when do you start to see that decelerate? I know you kind of talked about the two towers and when they open up, but to kind of help understand that renovation impact in terms of how you're seeing it, and I think would be helpful for everybody. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I don't know that we can necessarily quantify accurately what the impact was because we can't know what we displaced. You heard Grant describe the number of missing shows and the number of people typically will go to those shows in the Cotai Arena, and you get a sense of the type of high-quality patron that we bring in when we have live entertainment. And it is impactful. I think Q1 typically is a very powerful quarter for us as is Q4, and you kind of see the difference that the impact had for entertainment. We made a decision that if we take the arena offline and do it and make it the high -- one of the highest-quality arenas in Asia, then in the long run, we will benefit from the entertainment. And so we decided to do it as quickly as possible. And so that meant taking it offline in January this year and trying to get it done by October-November. And so once we do that, we're going to have an incredibly high-quality arena with amenities that we've never had before. So it will make us more competitive in the market and actually drive additional high-quality tourism from both traditional markets and other markets and will also help drive high-quality tourism from our core customer base and allow for more repeat visits from our high-value customers. We're very excited about the opportunities this new entertainment asset will present to us. Unfortunately, we're going to take some pain while it's offline, and that really started in January of this year. I can't quantify the exact amount, but you hear the count from Grant and you realize that it is not immaterial. And then the other side is, we're taking the shared it out. And when we're done, it's going to be one of our best properties in Macao. The design will be high-level. The fundamentals of the Sheraton Tower are quite good and both towers are quite good. They're actually a little bit better than the existing Londoner side, believe it or not. The layout of the casino will be very good. The additional food and beverage amenities that we can add. And I think the connectivity will be a very good driver of future results for that property. That's the reason why we're pretty confident that the result, when it's done, will be that or exceed that of the Venetian. So I think for us, we're doing it now. It is going to be disruptive. The worst is going to be across the summer when we have the lowest key count that we've had since we really opened what was then in Sands Cotai Central because we're taking out -- that we're going to take the Sheraton out. And so it's going to be more of this disruption across the summer. But then hopefully, as keys come back online across the phasing, and as we get the arena back, let's call it October-November, we'll have a much more powerful set of assets to drive tourism and create cash flow. So there will be disruption. I can't quantify it for you, but it's not going to be immaterial. Grant, I don't know if you have other things you'd like to add to that. Grant Chum : I think you covered it perfectly. I think the only thing I supplement is Londoner phase one really gave us that elevation in the shared quality of product, as well as a very successful rebranding and repositioning of the entire property. But what phase two gives us is that scale of high-quality product and the diversity of it. And that's when I think the earnings power of this resort will be fundamentally transformed. Joe Greff : Perfect. And\u2026 Robert Goldstein : I believe what we think once Londoner -- we think once Londoner is done, Joe, we'll have the one and two -- number one and two assets in the GALP, by far. Not sure whether they'll be fully in front, but that company really gives us a unique positioning for '25 and the years ahead to dominate the market in terms of the largest resorts and those proper resorts, both one and two. Joe Greff : Great. Thanks, Rob. You may have answered my follow-up question indirectly on your prior margin commentary, and maybe this is something Grant could talk about. But can you talk about the level of the markets, premium mass reinvestment levels? Has that been pretty consistent in the first quarter? And what you're seeing year to date versus how the end of the year finished? Or is there any kind of trend change on that front? That's all for me. Thanks. Grant Chum : Thanks, Joe. For us, yes, our profitability, the structure of a margin in every segment actually, quarter-on-quarter very consistent. No significant changes there. And that obviously, fed through to the result that the earlier question described, which is that we had a very consistent margin quarter-on-quarter despite obviously, some inflation in the payroll costs due to holiday pay and salary increases. Joe Greff : Yeah. My question -- maybe I didn't explain it that clearly. The level of premium mass reinvestment from your competitors, how would you characterize that year to date versus the end of last year? Grant Chum : Oh. Sorry. You're talking about the overall market now. Joe Greff : Yes. Robert Goldstein : Direct investment invested to customers. Patrick Dumont : I think the promotion activities levels are relatively intense right now. Is it higher than Q4, I don't think so, but it comes and goes and goes up and has ups and downs. But I think over time, there really isn't any necessity in this market to be too aggressive on promotions. The demand and supply, supply-constrained market, the quality of supply is exceptional, and we are a big contributor to that. And as GGR rises, that becomes even less of an issue over time. And for us, it doesn't matter. We stick to our strategy, which is as Rob referenced product based is driven off our asset base. The upgrades we're making, the quality of the assets and the services that go with that in addition to the programming -- the content programming, and like we talked about, we're very big believers in that entertainment being co-offering. That's why we're investing this $200 million in the upgrade of Cotai Arena. So -- yeah, when it's all said and done, we believe that GGR continues to rise, our asset base is going to be better than before and better than ever. And that's the way we're going to compete and that's the only way we think we can compete on a sustainable and profitable basis is really based on the quality execution of a product and the service that go with that. Joe Greff : Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Joe, we're obviously, keenly aware of the commercial environment down. We're certainly aware of what's happening with Macao promotions, but we remain steadfast. I believe that our product, once completed, will be superior. The scale is greater. The market will grow, and that's how we'll capture our fair share and remain focused on margins and keeping our EBITDA once again. So we're not going to play the game of chasing $10 more for promotions. We don't think it's our business and who we are. We're an asset-driven company with quality assets and scale. And again, we've proven that time and time again, and once Londoner is done, the arena will be just want to be in terms of market leading and margin of the assets and the cap. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sorry if I'm beating the dead horse here, but I did want to just kind of stick with the margin commentary, but I'll give it a little bit of a longer-term view. My question is really just trying to get a sense of what would it take to get back to let's call it the mid to high thirties on margins here. Is what we're seeing today and now increasingly expecting for the balance of '24 more about customer mix? Or is it about sort of one time callouts around renovations and maybe some lost very high-margin non-gaming revenue? Patrick Dumont : So it's a very interesting question, and it's the right question to ask. So as these properties reach run rates so as they reach their full potential, the margin should be upper 30s [Technical Difficulty] Sorry. I think someone in Sands China put us on hold. Please excuse us. So we think about margins in the upper thirties. If you look at the performance of the Venetian, that's a good benchmark, right? It was impacted a little bit this quarter, again, also by the entertainment not being there in the Cotai Arena, but -- and mix-wise, to be fair, pre-pandemic, it had more mass play and that's a higher margin. And so as tourism returns, so as visitation increases, which has more mass play, and we have plenty of capacity for it. So if you look at our asset base, the scale of the assets, the food and beverage we have, the amenities we have, we can accommodate a lot of mass play, and we have the positions to do it. And so for us, as visitation shows up and continues to on an upward trend, our assets are ready to take that visitation, revenue will grow, margins will grow, and they will normalize back towards a more traditional mix. That being said, the Londoner has the opportunity to also bring a lot of high-value tourism. So we're carrying the expense base without the revenue, right? So we have the team members, we have the -- we have all the things going on that you have, that we're fully operating, but it's not fully operating at. So the margins naturally are not going to look right. So as the revenue comes in and as the visitation comes in, as the patrons come in, as the hotel is completed, and as the rest of the amenities are done, that will look more normal. The only problem is it's in '25. So we have a little bit of time that we have to get through with this investment. Are there some high-value things that are very high margin that we're missing because of entertainment or keys out, yes, that's true. But when you look at the asset base that we have, the experience that we have, the team that we have there, their ability to execute and how they've executed so far, and the asset base that we're creating with these investments, we're going to be in a great position. And the margins, we believe, will get there. So we need visitation to continue. That will be helpful for the Venetian. It'll be helpful for the mass to recover. We need to have all of our assets in line. So that's the Cotai Arena to be finished and the Sheraton to become fully Londonerized, that's a word, and get to our full key count. And then you'll see the true power of these assets and the margins will get there. We have a lifestyle program that we run with high-quality amenities. If you haven't been to Macau and you haven't seen what we've done, I would encourage you to do it. It's not simply one thing. It's not simply hospitality. It's not simply gaming. It's not simply retail. It's an ecosystem that allows our customers to travel around all of our assets and have an experience they can't get anyplace else. And that's really what we have on offer and it's unique, and it's been invested in and it will continue to get better. So for us, as Rob said, we're not chasing promotional activity. We're chasing asset development, and that will drive our success. Shaun Kelley : Thanks, Patrick, and appreciate the insight. As a quick follow-up for whoever as appropriate. Just looking at Singapore, I mean, obviously, a breakout quarter with a run rate above $500 million. There were some one time things in that market, Taylor Swift, I believe, being one and then, of course, which I think you called out event activity broadly speaking. But also there's a change in, I think, Chinese visa policies that was probably potentially fruitful for the market. So just the big question here is, what's the right run rate? And do you think again, maybe event activity agnostic we could sustain above the $500 million mark? And are we kind of off to the race here? And notwithstanding the fact that even that number sounds like it included a little bit of tower three disruption. Robert Goldstein : I think the first thing you should note is that the building is still under renovation. I think we believe $500 million a quarter annualized is very durable and more. And the most important thing you should note is two things. The growth in Singapore as a desirable destination is soaring. It's not just Taylor Swift. It's Bruno Mars. It's the Hamilton show. It's endless events, F1. It's a juggernaut. And really, it's become accelerated. This market has become very special in a very short order. And I think that's attributed to government there and the programs happening, entertainment, et cetera. So Singapore is highly desirable, and yes, that's very sustainable. And as good as Taylor Swift was, there's a lot more in the pipeline that will make that continue. Secondly, our building has less than 200 top tier suites. Upon completion, we'll have an excess of 700. The suite-spot on the market is the premium mass and super premium mass, rolling, non-rolling. We can't -- I think we're almost approaching a billion dollars a slot when we may be out of bullets there as we get more capacity. But this is a very special market. Our building is a special building. I don't think there's any reason to doubt that 520, 540, 600. Look, this may keep growing. This is a great place to be. We're lucky to be there. We're lucky that the government is very supportive and excellent team in place. But most importantly, the assets, it didn't happen by luck. We are doing -- spending a lot of money to make sure those assets are superb and the customers come back time and time again. The real question is what happens when the building has four wheels instead of three? That's going to happen later this year, in early 2025, when those suites are rolled out and they are great suites. They are phenomenal suites. Can that building go to two-two, two-four, two-five, it can and it will. And I think, again, what we're trying to tell you about Macau is we're frustrated by Macau. The operating environment is more difficult. We're under construction a self-inflicted wound. But once we emulate in Macau and we've done in Singapore, the same thing will prevail. Londoner I wish neck and neck to drive that market. And again, I think the government recently talked about a lot of things they're trying to do. Increase tourism and visas, et cetera. We see a real nice support system coming out of now, and we're grateful to the government for recognizing a session this week about increased tourism, increased entertainment. We're lucky to be in two very, very special places, and, yes, Singapore can do 500, they can do 550. It's not about Taylor Swift. It's about a great market, a great asset, and a team running it. Shaun Kelley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to circle back. You were commenting earlier and the slides were not up yet so I haven't been able to go through them. But it sounded like you were saying that your sequential growth in mass and premium were both at a similar rate sequentially. And just wondering if there's anything to add any color around that since, you know, the market has generally speaking been seeing better premium mass recovery. Just any color you'd add there. Patrick Dumont : Grant, I think you should take that. Grant? Grant Chum : Yeah, Robin. I don't know if the deck is up. Patrick Dumont : It's up now. Robert Goldstein : It's up now, I mean. Patrick Dumont : It's up, guys. Yes. Grant Chum : Yeah. So if you look at a premium mass win, we're up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and base maths were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. But I think my point earlier is the difference that's here and there could be related to any number of I think non-substantive factors. So I wouldn't describe this as a divergence in trend, but this quarter we just did slightly better in premium mass versus base mass. Visitations continue just like see the wider market growing. Our property visitations actually grew sequentially as well. So nothing significant to remark on in terms of the segment divergence. Robin Farley : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And just any thoughts around New York timing and your expectations there? Sort of anything new to add there? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. But we're very disappointed by New York. I mean, we've been working there for a long time and we thought it was going to happen in '24. That was the state. Now they're saying '25 or '26, but I don't think we have any real clarity. And to be honest with you, it's confusing and disappointing because we've done a lot of work in New York and a lot of time into it. So I have no guidance because I don't really know what to tell you with candor and insight. Just don't know about New York. And it's just wish -- we wish they figured it out and let us know. We just don't know. So we'll remain hopeful that things turn around there. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Robin. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Vitaly Umansky from Seaport. Vitaly, your line is live. Vitaly Umansky : Hi. Good morning, guys. I think maybe switching over to Singapore if we think about kind of the quantifying the effect of what the renovations at that property have already done, and Rob, you talked about potentially this property getting up to about $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion. In theory, once the renovations are done in the first phase of the property, where do we see kind of constraints being built in? Because if you look at kind of occupancy rates in the hotel rooms today and we look at ADRs, they continue to expand. At some point, we're going to reach a limit as to how many rooms can be filled, and then we're talking about trying to fill rooms with higher-value customers. So when we think about before we get to the expansion, where is that constraint, and how quickly do you think we can get there? Robert Goldstein : It's a good question. I think unfortunately, it's probably an answer that we've seen that we never dreamed slots with a billion dollars on property that they're approaching that. We never dreamed that in this environment. So quickly after COVID, we reached the kind of epic levels we're seeing. The growth in the premium mass is powerful and I was enjoying Grant on the call last week telling us it's still a drop in the bucket. There's so much more to go. And so I think the growth will come out of this super premium mass, both rolling, non-rolling. I don't think ADR is all that impactful because hopefully someday we won't sell many rooms. This will be a product that is mostly gaming customers in the rooms. I hope the suites we're building are just exemplary. And I think that this product is only going to have more good days ahead. I used to do five as a goal for our Company as the decade progresses and it's very attainable. It reached $600 million almost this quarter in actual is very stimulating. It's very exciting. But the cash in capacity, it's already a problem for us in terms of slot machines. It will be a room problem. We wish you had more exposure to Singapore that's why we're building more products. This is a very, very special place that people gravitate to. And as Singapore does its job as a lifestyle, entertainment, exciting place to visit, demands have grown. So the only concern we have in Singapore is how quickly we get there. Once these fleets are unleashed in the market, they see it. I think we'll have some very bright days ahead. But obviously, it's a capacity constraint. You only have so many rooms, only have so many slot machines, and I don't worry about getting there. I just think we get there, we'll be disappointed can't have more exposure, and that's why we're building phase two. Patrick Dumont : Hey, Vitaly, one thing, and welcome back to the call. I think the key thing for us is we have a very strong view of the future success of Singapore. So strong that we're investing a couple of billion dollars in this property and we're looking to do IR2 as quickly as we can. We think that this market is benefiting from a lot of the factors that make Singapore, great infrastructure, strong, stable government, great investment, great policy. And to be fair, you're seeing the result of it. And it's only our business, as many businesses in Singapore. And so I think that that's a very helpful indicator. But more importantly, the more other investment that goes into Singapore will help drive further visitation. So the infrastructure is already there. The real question is how many more hotel rooms will go in. We feel very strongly that the more hotel rooms are added will help add to the critical mass of tourism that Singapore already has today. If you look at the wealth creation going around in Southeast Asia, it's pretty substantial. The last four years, even during the pandemic and they're pretty meaningful. And there are a lot of customers that are new to Singapore, new to Marina Bay Sands, and they're affluent and very successful, and they want to consume and they want to take advantage of the Singapore -- things Singapore has on offer. And so we feel very strongly about the future visitation in Singapore. It's an interesting question, where is the peak of demand? We don't really see it right now. What we see is a supply constraint, right? When you look at who is trying to come to Singapore and the activities that are going on, we feel very strongly about future investment. We think it's there. Vitaly Umansky : Thanks, Patrick and Rob. Maybe just a follow-up, switching gears to Macau. And Grant, you talked a little bit about kind of the base mass and the growth you've seen in the quarter is very similar to premium. But I think overall, if we kind of think about sands in Macau, obviously, you're very strong in the direct VIP business, you're very strong in the premium business, but where you have a massive competitive advantage? In my view, it's just your scale, which then talks about base mass and the higher margin available from base mass. If you look at the recovery in overall base mass, it has not been as strong as the more premium end of the market. Can you maybe give an explanation as to why you think that is, if you agree with that statement, and then how does the market maybe change, or need to change over the next couple of quarters in order to get some of that base mass back, which I think would benefit Sands relative to others in a much stronger way? Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Grant, go ahead. Grant Chum : Yeah. Yeah, sure, Patrick. Yeah, I'll take it. And I think first point is your -- I agree we have a huge advantage with our scale, but I think the scale advantage speaks to all the segments. I think if you looked at historically, how the company has developed absolutely the base mask with our scale, that has been a core advantage. But in the sense of how we described all of these capital investments that we're making, especially in Londoner, the scale we have on the quality of the premium product is really unprecedented. So I think scale advantage will apply to all segments, in my view. Specifically on base mass, if you look at our actual numbers, the way we break it out between premium mass and base mass through the recovery since the reopening after the COVID restrictions, actually they're not too dissimilar now in terms of rate of recovery from a volume and revenue perspective. But it is true that in terms of customer count patron hours, we're still missing more from the base mass. So really it's two things it tells you. One is the quality of patronage has risen significantly because the revenue per patron is higher than before COVID. And secondly, there is still room for that base mass revenue and visitation to further recover. And I think there are many reasons and it's hard to specifically attribute to one or two factors, but I think over time, especially as the economy improves and also so I think people -- the distribution of content in terms of the lifestyle, the destination attractions, all of the events, all of the non-gaming products and assets and events that are actually distributed out there, I think you see a progressive improvement in that base mass segment. And obviously, we will be -- obviously, best placed to capture that growth when that comes. Vitaly Umansky : Thanks, Grant. That's helpful. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live. Chad Beynon : Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for posting the slides. On Slide 44, the flags of interest remain the same as what we've seen in the past couple of decks, Macau, Singapore, New York, and you've talked through all these. There's been some recent discussions around Thailand and some even think that an integrated resort could open in Thailand, maybe even ahead of Japan. So wondering if you could opine on your views. I know early, but could this market be big enough? Could a resort generate the cash flow meaningful enough for you guys to look at the market? Any views there? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Yeah. We absolutely have interest in Thailand. To your point, it could happen quicker than Japan. I think it's conceivable. It's early days, though we still have work to do with the numbers and understanding it. It's a very, very exciting market in a lot of levels, and just the sheer size of population, the accessibility and the willingness of people travel to Thailand, it's obviously, I think, number one resort destination city in Asia. So, yeah, we're very interested. But again, it's early days. I agree with your comments. It could be faster than Japan, which is possible. Certainly, there's usually a lot of pent-up desire from both business and government to work towards us. So we're interested, we're listening. We're doing the work to find out what makes sense for us there and we'll keep you posted. Chad Beynon : Thank you. And then on the P&L statement, investors are increasingly looking at EPS just given what you're generating and where the stock is trading. I believe there was a tax benefit in Q1. Could you talk to that potential benefit? And then any additional color in terms of will the tax rate start to look similar to what we saw in prior years, given your mix of Singapore and Macau? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : I'll answer this in reverse. Yes, it will look more normal. It was a one-time item. It was related to reversal in Macau, $57 million. But the tax rate will look more normal going forward. Chad Beynon : Thanks, Patrick. Appreciate it, guys. Patrick Dumont : No problem. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live. David Katz : Hi. Evening. Thanks for taking my questions. When we look at the Macao strategy in view of the renovations that are going on this year, I would think about, you know, reinvestment credit referral programs that people are talking about. What's your philosophy on those this year? And do you dial them back until next year? Or how should we think about that? Robert Goldstein : I'm just trying to understand your question. Will we dial back our investment programs because we're under renovation? Is that your question? David Katz : That's right. Level of conservatism versus aggressiveness and sort of how you\u2026 Robert Goldstein : No, no. We're not going to -- we will not dial back. We just may not be as aggressive as some of, you know, the competitive pressures on the commercial front right now, it's been talked about quite a bit. We're not believers in that approach. We believe we make our buildings the best in class. We have the scale. We have a lifestyle product. We just believe long-term GGRs will grow. We'll participate in that. We'll be very, very here into good margins, and that's an important part of business. But no, we won't dial back our current reinvestment strategy. We won't necessarily dial it up either to compete in the market right now. So this will be a year of reinvestment, as Patrick and Grant alluded to, both the arena and the Londoner. But we're not going to pull back. If anything, we'll stay consistent. David Katz : Perfect. And I wanted to just ask about, you know, one of the slides we show your maturities, you know forthcoming '25-'26, any sort of updated thoughts about, you know, how or when you're approaching those. And that's it for me. Thanks. Patrick Dumont : Yeah. So, you know, we're going to look to deal with. So if you go to Page 32, which is the page I think you're referring to, and you look at the LVS maturities, we should deal with those in short order. That's kind of our intent. And then in August of '25, we have the $8 billion that you see at the SEL level, and we'll address those in due time. We mentioned that we wanted to bring down our total debt level in at SEL given that we borrowed during the pandemic so you'll see us reduce the quantum of debt there. And then as part of the MDS credit facility, we'll address that in course along with the IR2 start. So that's kind of how we'll deal with our capital structure. You'll see us turn that out as we've done previously. David Katz : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Daniel Politzer from Wells Fargo. Daniel, you're line is live. Daniel Politzer : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First one on Macau. This is, I think, the second quarter in a row your mass shares declined a little bit. Obviously, there was a lot of different factors this quarter, but if you could kind of maybe give us a little bit more color. Is this really just disruption, heightened promotional levels? Or is there a difference in the customer that you're seeing coming into the market, or maybe something else altogether that's kind of driving the market share shifts we're seeing on the mass side? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. I do want to point out before Grant answers this question, that when we have less revenue because of disruption, we'll have less market share. So I do want to point out that with the arena being out with less revenue and a slightly lower margin because of the impact, having some hotel rooms out, that our market share will be impacted because it's the same thing. So with that, I'll just turn it over to Grant. Grant Chum : Yeah. I think it's hard to say which factors. I mean, you have a promotion environment out there that people have been talking about and that Rob reference you have, obviously, the disruptions that we've encountered because of our own projects. But on the other hand, it's also just looking at a very short time period here and there. So, yes, our mass revenues were flat for the quarter and the market grew 3%, 4%. But there's also a lot of factors that could have swung our way during the quarter and we would have been much closer to the market growth rate. So I wouldn't draw too big a conclusion from that. If you look at historically how we've sustained our share of EBITDA in a pre-pandemic, the market shares fluctuate, but we always end up back in that low to mid-30s range in terms of EBITDA share. And to be fair, let's look at a longer time frame, let's look at the scorecard for 2023, we achieved 35% EBITDA share against a GGR share of 26%. We were leaders in GGR, yes, but we were, by a much bigger margin, the leader in EBITDA share as well as non-gaming revenues, where we had 41% of the share of the market. So in aggregate, for the year, if you look at revenue gaming, non-gaming EBITDA, I think our performance has been solid. But quarter to quarter, obviously there will be fluctuations depending on those factors that we just discussed. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then just for the follow-up, I think you guys have gone up to 71% share of 1928 HK. I mean, can you talk about maybe where that goes over time? Is there an upper limit there and maybe some of the puts and takes to increasing that ownership stake? Patrick Dumont : So I think there's an upper limit of 75% by exchange rules, although they do give waivers based on the size of the equity, depending on the name. For us, I think, as I said before, SEL is investing a lot for the future. It has a bright future ahead of it, and we'd like to own more of it. So you'll see us be aggressive, and I think where we stand, we see value in the stocks today meaningfully. So that is a repeat of what we said before, but I think you understand our conviction. Daniel Politzer : Understood. Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Colin Mansfield from CBRE Institutional Research. Colin, your line is live. Colin Mansfield : Hey, everybody, thanks for taking my call, and congratulations on getting the last rating up to investment grade during the quarter. Maybe following on to David's question about the refinancing, maybe just an updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the subordinated term loan down at Sands China. And I know there's a lot of liquidity up at the parent, but how are you guys thinking about timing of potentially taking that out of the capital structure down there? And then I have one follow-up on ratings. Patrick Dumont : Sure. I think you'll see us deal with LBS maturities and the SEL 25s before you see any activity around the LVS [Indiscernible] term loan down to SEL. The one thing I'd like to point out is that it benefits SEL. It's a very favorable loan and allows them to have high-quality financing deeply subordinated at a favorable rate. So from that standpoint, the maturity is '28, and we'll see how it goes with SEL and what their needs are and kind of go from there. But I think we have ample liquidity up at parent co we believe to do what we need. Colin Mansfield : Great. Thanks, Patrick. And then just one follow-up on ratings. I mean, obviously, the company fully back at investment grade now. And I think with the development pipeline that you guys do have ahead of you, I'd just be curious how you're thinking about any sort of change to financial policy as it relates to target ratings. I think this is one of the companies that could eventually get to mid-BBB if you guys so desired. So I guess how do you guys balance any sort of desire to have those levels of ratings as it relates to cost of capital relative to obviously, the development pipeline you have ahead of yourself? Patrick Dumont : Thanks. So I think as we look back pre-pandemic, we spent five years working towards investment grade. We think it's very important for us to actually be investment grade. It gives us access to the largest most liquid debt market in the world, gives us a very efficient cost of capital, which in the long run provides us flexibility, but really drives returns on new projects. We have this investment rate balance sheet. It helps us in new jurisdictions. You heard Rob talk about several of them. We have the financial capability to execute on these projects. Our financial policy always been that we like gross leverage to be between 2 times and 3 times. You know, we've said this for many years. Nothing has really changed. It's our consistent view. I think over time, we're going to delever just because of EBITDA expansion. If you look what happened at MBS, it occurred, and our belief is that it will continue to occur at Sands China as well. So I think for us, the investment grade is very important. That gross leverage parameter of 2 times or 3 times is consistent with prior statement, prior practice. And I actually think, you know, we're very favorably levered on a net basis and on a gross basis, and we're looking forward to doing some new development. And I think that will fit within our leverage profile based on sort of the prior discussions that we've had about progression of funding and EBITDA development. So we're very focused on it. We think we can handle our new development, our investment, our existing assets, and have a very healthy return of capital program while balancing all these things and having investment grade balance sheet. That's our goal and that's our view. Colin Mansfield : Great. Thanks again, guys, for -- thanks again for taking the question, and congrats again on getting fully back to IHE. Patrick Dumont : Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thank you, Matthew. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, Patrick Dumont, Dr. Wolford Wong and Grant Chum. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We'll be making these statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results may materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are included in our press release. We've also posted an earnings presentation on our website. We will refer to that presentation during the call. Timing for the Q&A, we ask those of interest to please pose one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone within the opportunity to participate. The presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macau market continues to grow. Total gain revenues for the market grew 24% in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023. In addition, mass play revenue grew 29% compared to 1 year ago. We remain confident in the future growth in Macao market. I believe Macao market gross gain revenue will exceed $30 billion next year and continue to grow year after year. Our business strategy is predicated or investing in high-quality assets and also have scale. Macau is and always has a deeper competitive market. Our strategic approach has enabled us to compete very effectively. We have designed our capital investment programs to ensure that we will continue to be the market leader years ahead. Our approach allows us to grow fast from the long term and large share EBITDA and generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our results in Macau, we delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter despite material disruption at [indiscernible]. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and a market share of EBITDA. We will continue -- we will capture high-value, high-margin tourism over the long term. We have a unique competitive position in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product of offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the [indiscernible] and our Cotai Arena, our product advantage will be more pronounced than ever. Another strong quarter in Singapore despite ongoing disruption from construction. The financial results of [indiscernible] stands reflect the positive impact of our capital investment program and the growth of high-value tours. Enrolling FPL Singapore as a destination is enhanced by the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendars. As we complete the balance of our investment programs, there will be considerable runway for growth. Thanks for joining our call. I'll turn it over to Patrick down, and then we'll go to Q&A. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $561 million. We had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $4 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin for the Macau portfolio of properties would have been 32.1% or down 80 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2023. Context here is important. Our margins at London were directly impacted by the disruption of the London grand renovation. We closed the casino at 1,500 keys out during the quarter. Margin at The Venetian was 38.2%, and we expect margin improvement as The Venetian Cotai Arena comes back online later this year and as visitation to the market and growth in unrated play in the market both increased in the future. Margin at The Plaza and Four Seasons was 40%. We are now deep into our land grand renovation program. We plan the completion of the first tower by year-end 2024 and of the second tower by May of 2025. The [ Londoner Grand ] Casino has been closed since May and is scheduled to reopen in December. As these products come online, between the end of 2024 and the first half of 2025, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. We expect meaningful EBITDA growth and margin expansion in the future. Now turning to Singapore. MBS' EBITDA came in at $512 million. Our strong results reflect the impact of high-quality investments in market-leading products and growth in high value tourism. Had we held as expected at our roll-in Play segment, EBITDA would have been $64 million lower. Had we held as expected in our rolling play segment, MBS margin would have been 48% or 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. While we have substantially completed the original $1 billion refurbishment program at MBS, we are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of these new products. Tower gaming at Marina Bay Sands will be offered for the first time at the property in the third quarter of 2024. The next phase of our capital investment program at Radio-based Sands is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of '25. This will further support growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our program to return capital to state to shareholders. We repurchased $400 million of LVS stock during the quarter. We also paid our recurring quarterly dividend. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's capital return program to increase returns to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now let's take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe Greff : I'd like to start off on Singapore, if we could. I was hoping, can you give us a sense of maybe how players and visitors geographically, how they are performing? I guess more specifically, are you seeing any kind of slowdown from Mainland Chinese visitation or mainland Chinese spend into MBS? And was there any more material trend change towards the end of the 2Q versus maybe what you've seen over the last couple of quarters as that's been sort of a growing segment? Robert Goldstein : Joe, as you know, in the past calls, we have a diverse customer base in Singapore. We got them all on the region and certainly China is part of that, but we're all over the place, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, ,Malaysia. So I don't think we saw much different than the past year, except where obviously, your seasonality is in play in Q2. But our business, looking forward, the only thing I would say late is impacted is we keep self-inflicting loans by facing our building. And it's near the end, finally as it feels like a long time. But despite seasonality despite the difficulties of construction, Tower 3, Tower gaming, we continue to move forward towards $500-plus million quarters and diversity of business tours is very clear to be really the -- where they're coming from. They're coming [indiscernible]. We've not seen a slowdown in China. We just simply see the same as we see in the last couple of quarters, which is solid. There's also [indiscernible] more of the region. So Singapore moving forward, I think you'll see a real important transition probably in the early part of Q2 when the building is really full bore, complete and tower gaming is intact, all the suites are intact. We're really playing the game with one hand behind our back out now, still delivering $2-plus billion run rate. So we feel very good about our prospects to single. Probably the most -- not probably, is the most the largest or the EBITDA building [indiscernible] gaming. So -- and it continues to get stronger. We think it's -- we said before, we think that our goal is $2.5 billion out of Singapore. I think you'll see it happen in the oncoming years. Joe Greff : Great. And then people have not really asked me a question about Macau -- is Macao self-sufficient or speaks for itself. But Rob, Patrick, maybe you can give us an update on any development opportunities, specifically Thailand, and I'm not sure there's much to add to what's going on in New York. Patrick Dumont : So first off, I think the great news is we're very ready to develop new ground of developments in new jurisdictions. We're very excited about it. Rob, the team, I spend a lot of time looking at opportunities for our company to expand and grow new jurisdictions. As you know, we're spending a lot of time in New York. We've been spending a lot of time in Texas. We've been looking at Thailand. I think Thailand is a very interesting opportunity. The market there is very strong for different types of tourism. And I think depending on the way it's set up and the opportunity that's there in terms of structure, it could be very interesting for us. We love the market as a place to source customers. We think the tourism, our quality here is quite high. If you go and visit, you'll have a great experience there, and we'd love to be part of it. So if Thailand becomes available, we'd be very interested. But I think it's early days yet. I think we've been spending time there along with the rest of our industry, looking to see if we could be hopeful to that process. And we're waiting and seeing what happens. Operator : Your next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : I appreciate the comments on the Londoner Grand renovation impacting margins in Macau. But can you get back to 2019 levels in the current environment as that comes through and ramps up? Or do we need to see some change either in growth in the market or the competitive and promotional environment to get back there? Patrick Dumont : So a couple of things. And I think this is really important to note, the Macau market has always been super competitive from day one, it's been a very competitive market. And we've been very effective in the way that we compete because we have an investment-driven model. So if you go back pre-pandemic, if you go back in 2010, it was a very competitive market. And in fact, I remember when the premium mass segment didn't exist. And when it started, people -- Rob can reference this as well some other people in the room can as well. When there was no pre-VMF segment. It was really rolling volume and mass play. And the market has always evolved over time. But the one thing that's been consistent is that our company has driven success through investment and through leading and nongaming amenities. And to be fair, innovating on the gaming side as well. And so when you look at our performance, if you go to Page 14 of the slide deck, you can kind of see what happened in the quarter. So The Venetian Macau did $262 million of EBITDA in the quarter at a 38.2% margin. And it's missing about half its volume of unrated play. So just with the arena out, which is also a very valuable amenity to drive premium mass performance, look at the strength of the performance of The Venetian. Same thing is true in The Plaza. Look at what the Four Seasons did. 40% margin, $100 million of EBITDA. So when we look at the Londoner, we basically took out an equivalent property like [ Melco ] or an equivalent property to win Palace. We took that capacity out of the market for ourselves to renovate it. So for us to put up $550 million in the quarter, in my mind, this is a great result because we know that we have a limiter in place. We're missing one of a significant portion of what is ultimately going to be one of the best properties in Macau, if not the best property. And if you look at the success of the Londoner right now, if you look at the win fee per day on the table side, the Londoner is the second best in our system. So in Macau -- so when you think about that, the model has been proven and the investment has been validated. Now we're going to open up the better half, hopefully, by the end of the year in major [ part ], suddenly, the limiters are going to come off. So in my mind, this is a very positive investment for us. And we'll get to the margins. We're already doing it in other properties. It's just a function of renovation because we're carrying all the costs now associated with the shuttered casino and 1,500 rooms. So the Londoner or impact is really, one half of it is working. You see the performance, you see the slot win, you see the slot performance win per unit. You see the table win performance, you look at the hotel performance and the nongaming and the performance. And then you look at the side that's shut and you realize that's the better side, but we're carrying all the cost. The potential of the future is really there. We feel very strong about the potential for the margins to reach where we need to go. And just remember, pre-pandemic we were at 35% to 36% EBITDA margin on a whole normalized basis business in aggregate. So we're -- we'd like to believe we're in a good spot. We're competing effectively. We have great assets. We're investing for the future. And when we're done, we're going to have the newest and best products in the market. So we feel very strongly about the path that we're on. It's just going to take a little bit of time to get that. Robert Goldstein : The only structural change do we need is [indiscernible] Okay. The market is going $30-plus billion next year. We're going to have the two most important assets in the market speaking with each other. I mean that strategic, we're going to have Londoner and The Nation over 7,400 between them. The full power of Cotai Arena, all the amenities between those two. But I think those buildings will be very, very intertwined and give us, by far, $2 billion-plus assets speak each other. At Parisian and Four Seasons and Sands keep doing what they're doing, we will be a $3-plus billion and think will get $2-plus billion. I believe that sometime near future we will have the highest EBITDA creation in this company's history without Las Vegas. So I'm pretty confident that Londoner will perform and outperformed their expectations, but also enhances the [indiscernible] because the back and forth of those two buildings, they're very similar, huge retail, huge suite capacity, entertainment, retail, [indiscernible] they just -- they're much bigger and better than anything else in that market for making money. And when those come online next year, these results today another $150 million out of Londoner of a sudden, you're looking at $3-plus billion of annualized EBITDA. That's how we view the market. The margins being what they are, making EBITDA still the most important thing, and we will get there. We will get there. Stephen Grambling : So maybe as a quick follow-up. On capital allocation, you noted being consistent with capital return. And it sounds like you're confident in a ramp from here in Macau and really growing in MBS, yet the stock is near the lows during the pandemic. So what's the tolerance to be maybe not as consistent and actually being more aggressive with capital allocation or even rethinking about the leverage profile at least in the near term? Patrick Dumont : So I think, first off, we have said this before, we see meaningful value in both equities, where the stock is trading, does it make sense to us. Both on a historical basis and how we view the value of our company and how we look to invest and grow. So we're going to continue to repurchase stock. As you saw we did in the last couple of quarters. We feel very strongly about the value of our business, and we're going to continue to do it. Look, I think for us, we're very focused on being shareholder friendly. We were a very shareholder-friendly company in the past. We're a shareholder-friendly company today. We're going to continue to do that. That's our goal. And I think that the nice thing is that as we complete the Londoner, two things are going to happen. We're going to have less CapEx and more free cash flow. And to be fair, a more productive asset base. And so hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to use that cash flow to return it to shareholders. So we're going to look to do that and continue what we've been doing. But we agree with you think where the stock is today is not reflective of our long-term value. Robert Goldstein : And also, if we do invest in new opportunities, that's not in the near future, so [indiscernible] that New York, Texas, Thailand is years ahead. You can find lots of room to invest money to complete the [indiscernible]. Operator : Your next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley : Two questions. One is, can you share some thoughts on -- there's a lot of concern about tariff impact on the Chinese economy next year. Just any way to help us think about that broadly how you're thinking about? You have a lot of CapEx going being up and running in the market next year, which should certainly position you well. But just sort of thinking about broader impact there? Robert Goldstein : You take tariff impacts on the -- so the U.S., the new president ever he or she may be, I see. I don't think we want to talk about the two reasons. What we don't know what's really going to happen nor do we know the impact. Obviously, China [indiscernible] speaks for itself. It's been a struggle this year. And I think it hopefully just gets better, we see more improvement. But the big thing in our business is the 2 million-plus visitors were lacking quarter-on-quarter. They heard us, and that was just today. I don't think we should comment on politics or what has to happen, we actually don't know. But obviously, the biggest miss for our company, which is both for scale and quality, we lose 8 million annualized business tools that pus us with everybody else. So we'll leave that they are going in the political's going to do what to do with and why. Robin Farley : Okay. Fair enough. And then I had a question, and you already commented on your interest in continuing share repurchase. Looking at the rate that you did this quarter, you've been mostly through your remaining authorization at the end of this quarter. Is that -- when we think about like your appetite for continuing beyond that, is that -- if you could just sort of comment on that. Patrick Dumont : Yes. I think if you look at our prior practice, you can see that we've always been focused on return on capital, both through share repurchases and dividends. And that our board has been very supportive of trying to create shareholder value through return of capital. So as our current authorization gets used up, we'll go back to the board, and we'll have a discussion about how we want to allocate capital. But the Board has been very supportive of in trying to enhance shareholder returns over time. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Rob, if you could. I mean, I know this is probably a difficult question, but if you think about... Robert Goldstein : Then don't ask. Carlo Santarelli : I hear you. The question was -- maybe it's not as difficult as I framed it to be. But when you guys think about the rooms that are out of service at Londoner and those customers and recapture in your existing portfolio, whether you're able to recapture them in Venetian [indiscernible] or elsewhere. What do you think is actually the delta in what you're missing from those rooms being offline, i.e., how much of that shortfall that's being generated there relative to historical periods elsewhere in the portfolio versus how much do you think is just exiting the system and maybe showing up to competitors? Robert Goldstein : Right. Before I get this question, Mr. Chum, we woke up [indiscernible] this call in the middle of night in Macao, I want to also reference the fact that the disruption aside the carrying labor, we've been these buildings for when buildings are construction impacts both Londoner [indiscernible] and to want to be clear that the disruption isn't just limited to our current Londoner [indiscernible], which is a beautiful building, also feels the [indiscernible]. Grant, will you answer the question about the rooms and the delta and how you see that? Kwan Chum : Yes. Thanks, Rob. I think, first of all, yes, the performance definitely was impacted by the Phase I renovation on the Sheraton side. But actually, despite that, we referenced the fact that we -- we obviously worked hard to shift the patronage to other properties in the portfolio. And the team was actually incredibly successful at that. We actually reached the record high in any quarter on non-rolling drop as well as a record high in any quarter on slot handle. So in terms of gaming volumes, I think we've managed to sustain the volumes overall. However, within the mix, I think what you do lose is some of that base mass, which is where Pacifica Casino was primarily positioned. And also, what you also can see in the numbers is the impact of the loss of the rooms impacting the cash hotel revenues because, obviously, when you have fewer rooms, we are yielding accordingly. And when you lose that cash revenues from the hotel side because you have reduced inventory and we need to shift the customers to other properties on the casino side that clearly impacts not just EBITDA, but it's a high flow-through segment. Business segments. So it obviously impacts the percentage margin as well. Carlo Santarelli : Great. That's helpful. And if I could, just one quick follow-up. Sorry, go ahead, Rob. Robert Goldstein : There's -- do you have a dollar amount on the cash wound sales loss in the quarter. Kwan Chum : I'm sorry Rob. Robert Goldstein : I was asking if you can give us a number, but the dollar number we lost in cash room sales for the closure of London. Kwan Chum : It -- if you look at the actual reduction in cash revenue for -- versus Q1, then you're probably looking at the range of around $15 million, $20 million impact. Although you can't simply add that back because you've also got to consider that's a net impact of shifting more rooms into some customer segments and then having fewer rooms to sell. So it's a net impact that's probably not as high as that. But if you're looking at pure cash revenues, then that's the range of impact. Robert Goldstein : Sorry, your second question was on? Carlo Santarelli : Yes. The second question was just more of a technical question. And I get it, lot could go both ways, but this is the fourth quarter in a row where hold in Singapore has -- on the VIP side has been very strong. And I think when you look at the last 4 quarters, to $30 billion of volume at an almost 4.4% win percentage. It feels a little bit more structural. And I know in your add-back map, you guys are obviously dinging yourselves for a much lower hold structurally. Is there any thought of perhaps changing what that metric is as the normalized hold for that property going forward? Robert Goldstein : It's a great question and one we still have time on. And I think what you should realize -- I think you do realize this, the world is changing in [indiscernible] paper gives a better way of quantifying what the whole percentage should be but also we put games for, I'll call it, prop bets or side bets that changed the whole percentage in baccarat. And your comment is spot on. We're debating how high we can take it. The team there feels is understated. And you're right, we keep digging ourselves quarter-to-quarter. And perhaps in the near future, we'll address that because clearly, something is happening here. But again, the smart table opportunity, which we're deep into now, coupled with the game changes, the [indiscernible] is a pretty predictable game for many years. Player bankers and tie payer is changing dramatically. We were there a few months ago and shocked to see how much money embed on the prop bets. No different than the Super Bowl. We know just about the winning team, you've got every 3,000 side bets, which drives the per way up. We believe that's in flight in Singapore. We're not ready today, but we're coming close to a decision this year for us to address that [indiscernible] issue because you're right. The team would argue something in play. It's not simply better fortune, it's just better mathematics and the best be made and the ability to assess those mathematics smart table, et cetera. Pat do you want to add to it? Patrick Dumont : Yes, sure. It's the right question to ask. We've been following this for a while. Some of it depends on what Rob said or it depends on what Rob said, which is the additional wagers that are available on the game mix that we have on the floor at the time. But it's also -- you have to understand propensity. And so you have to observe empirically what people are going to do before you could make that decision. So you'd argue that our theoretical is higher than this. But we're going to continue to look at it, and we'll make adjustments as necessary when we think the statistics warrant it. But you're right, it is a very significant adjustment and one that we're going to continue to look at. But our game mix has changed. The availability for, as Rob calls, and prop bets, but really high-vol bets are on the floor now in a very different way than they have been previously, both pre-pandemic and even a year ago. And there -- the patron uptake is very high. And so that is adjusting the way that mix the floor is being exhibited through gaming win. And so we're going to continue to take a look at it, and we'll make adjustments when we feel that it's appropriate. But it's a very good question to ask. There's more there. Operator : Your next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : For Grant or the team, I just wanted to ask, can we get a little bit more color on just what you think is happening in sort of underlying visitation to the market? I think you captured it well in your Slide 19. But we saw our noted a bigger sequential deceleration than we typically see in the second quarter. And my question for you is twofold. Just, one, what's driving that? Is it macro? Is it something you're seeing or hearing out there? And I guess, just as importantly, is it continuing at all into Q3? Or what's your expectation for this pattern to possibly continue? Robert Goldstein : Grant you want to take that one? Grant Chum : Yes. I think you're right. The visitation recovery rate has actually reduced. So that's actually taking account of seasonality when you when you compare the visitation recovery versus second quarter of 2019, we're about 79%, but we were as high as 90%. 85% to 90% in the past 6 months in the past 2 quarters. So clearly, there has been, I think, more than just a seasonal slowdown. And that's particularly prominent in the visitation outside of Guangzhou. So that does impact, I think Rob referenced it earlier. It does impact, I think, the base mass business, especially that I'm ready to play. We don't know exactly why, but I think that is a clear feature of this quarter, and it does feed into, as we said, the base mass segment. Shaun Kelley : And then just as a follow-up, I think you also talked about -- I mean, obviously, I think you mentioned a number of times that the market is always competitive, always promotional. Could you just talk about your own promotional allowance or cadence this quarter? Was it a little higher? Did you need to reinvest a little bit more? I think on our math, that was possibly the case? Or is it all just mix? Just kind of how did you see it play out? And kind of what do you -- how much you're reacting to versus how much are you kind of letting -- kind of letting go on market share just because it's not your game? Patrick Dumont : One thing, I just want to say one thing, and then I'll turn it over to Grant. So just note that the visitation is very important. And you referenced Slide 19 and the fact that there's 2 million visitors missing, that were pre-pandemic. We are geared for scale. And that scale is very hard margin for us because of the volumes. And so our mix looks different and our margins look different and our reinvestment looks different because of the shift of business between nonrated and rated play. That's a very important thing when you look at our results and you consider what we're doing today, the mix of business has changed for us pre-pandemic, post-paneic. So that's one thing. The other thing is I would also like to highlight that if you look at the margins of our overall operations, they're consistent with prior performance. And when that unrated play returns and the volumes return of premium mass play, that our margins should improve. So yes, we look at reinvestment rates, but we also look at the total business. We like to understand how much money we're actually making on net. So when you look at the business overall, our margin performance and our competitive positioning is actually quite good given where things are. But I'll turn it over to Grant for some additional detail. Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, I think it's a mixture. Firstly, the business mix point that Patrick referenced. And secondly, because we were closing Pacifica Casino and getting ready for that, yes, there is, for a period of time, a high level of reinvestment as we prepare for that shift, which, as I talked about earlier, we did so very successfully, especially into the Parisian, but also the other properties. So those are the main factors affecting the reinvestment and the overall margin mix. But I think even though there are fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter, day-to-day, even in terms of tactical, I think we're very clear on our strategy which is that we will compete on the quality and the scale of our asset base. And of course, at this point in time, we're hampered because we have a number of our key assets out. But when those assets come back online, really from Q4 this year into 2025, we absolutely intend to be competing on that basis. because at that point, we not only have, I think, scale we always had, but the sheer quality of product that we'll have at that point at scale, I think that will be the fundamental difference from what we had before, and we intend to make full use of that in terms of competing for the market. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad Beynon : On Singapore, which has been consistently strong for several quarters, it appears that there's still some quarterly volatility. I think last quarter, we talked about some big events in the first quarter that drove nongaming and obviously, VIP play. As we think about the back half of the year, can you help us kind of square what seasonality should look like? And if there are any big events that are booked on the calendar in Singapore that could drive additional nongaming or VIP business? Patrick Dumont : So a couple of things. So typically, 2Q is our trough quarter in the year. And so you saw that in Singapore this quarter. As a practical matter, we were also out keys because of the renovation in Tower 3. So across the back half of the year and into Q1 of next year, all of that stuff is going to come back. So the limiters are going to come off. And so if you look at the tower gaming that we're adding, you look at the additional salons that are coming back online, some of the renovated gaming areas that are coming back, we're finally going to hit full stride of that building. So even though we put up this quarter, and last quarter, which are, I think, the two highest of all time, we have more room to go. We're not operating with full capacity. And so right now, when we look at Singapore, we see strength in the market we've geared ourselves to focus on high-value tourism, which is coming into Singapore at a very high level. We are the premier place to visit from an amenity standpoint, entertainment, food and beverage, and we're benefiting from it. And our hospitality is now second to none, which we spent a lot of years working on, and we're finally there. So we're going to start to see this asset continue to grow and outpace. In terms of the calendar up and coming, I can't point to anything other than Formula One that would be sitting in the category you just laid out. Formula what happens every year. It's a great event. It's something that's good for Singapore. Our patrons really enjoy it, and we look forward to its success. But in terms of calendar, unless Grant has something in mind, I can't think of anything other than that right now that's worth mentioning. Kwan Chum : Yes, that's the main one, yes. Robert Goldstein : This market is so powerful and getting better by the day. And in the past Q2 is one of the weakest quarter in seasonality. But still, what's happening in Singapore is almost unheard of in our industry. [indiscernible] that they -- and we're doing these numbers again with capacity constrained. When that goes away, and the market will continue to thrive, whether it's F1 or Taylor Swift or whosever coming next. They just those events are very additive, but that place as a market just becomes more and more designed by the day you see by the visitation and the quality of visitation. So [indiscernible] will come, but I think our ability will speak for itself. Chad Beynon : Okay. Appreciate it. And then I'm going to ask you to put on your economist hat again, not looking out to future years, but this year, obviously, the ARR cut could bring some more money back into consumer pockets in China. Just wondering in prior cycles, how long that usually takes for it to trickle down. Obviously, we've seen a nice little improvement in some of the July-foot traffic. I don't think it would happen that fast. But is this something if it's kind of working in terms of some stimulus, you could start to see it in the third or fourth quarter here? Just in terms of spend per play trends. Just wondering if you could kind of opine on what we've seen in prior cycles. Patrick Dumont : So this is a fascinating question. One thing I'll tell you, this was the highest volumes we ever had in premium mass and slots in a quarter. So clearly, like something positive is happening. I think if you said that the economy was [indiscernible] and doing incredibly well that we'll be doing better. I think that might be a fair statement. You can say that. But in terms of timing or specific economic actions, there are so many different things that can happen that may influence it. We have no idea. I mean, this isn't anything that we can comment on or have a view on other than that we're hopeful that there will be further economic growth and further beneficial economic activity around the [indiscernible] area. And hopefully, we be beneficiaries of that. But in terms of specific comments around timing or things of that nature, it's not something we can really do. Operator : Your next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt Montour : I just wanted to follow up maybe with Grant or anyone on Shaun's question about visitation. And maybe just thinking about what's going on there? I know that you don't have a crystal ball for the future. But in the 2Q, do you think Macro was the biggest factor? Is there still infrastructure friction there with flights to non-Guangdong, particularly? Or is there something else that you think is at play as well? Patrick Dumont : Yes. Thanks, Brandt, for the question. Yes, I don't have specific reasons why we have a slowdown in the recovery rate for non-Guangdong. I think what you can say is there is a segment bifurcation here where the premium segments are still doing incredibly well. And you can see, I think it's on Slide 18 on [indiscernible] pack. Actually, this is the highest spend per visitor arrival since the COVID recovery began of any quarter. So clearly, at the premium end, the strength of spending is very high. But at the same time, the I think, the lower price points in terms of, say, the slot performance is also incredibly strong. So those two factors drove record high volumes in our non-rolling drop and soft handle. But in the middle, especially the base [ mass ] tables, especially unrated, that is highly correlated to the strength of visitation and it just wasn't as strong this quarter, even if you adjust for seasonality. So I think we can explain how the segments have performed. But we don't know exactly why the visitation base isn't recovering as fast in the middle in terms of that base mass hesitation. Brandt Montour : Great. And then on the disruption, the renovation projects, if we were to try and gauge the level of disruption from these projects in the third quarter versus the second quarter, I know you lose the casino floor for a whole quarter versus half a quarter. Can you maybe give us some finer points on what else is going to be offline in the third quarter versus the second quarter room count, et cetera? Patrick Dumont : Yes. You go ahead Grant. Kwan Chum : Yes, the disruption will actually increase from a room perspective. So we're operating around 2,500 keys at [ Sheraton ] in the second quarter on average over the quarter, and we expect to be down to about 1,300 on average across the third quarter. Obviously, higher number of teams in the first half of the quarter and finishing up with fits. And as you said, we will have a full quarter of Pacifica casino closure versus 60% of the quarter in the second quarter. So yes, the disruption impact will actually increase during the third quarter. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : I wanted to go back to the repurchases and just take a little bigger picture look, right? Just thinking about the factors, obviously, the stock and where it is, is one of them. But when we look at your capabilities, there are some maturities out there. In the future, there's obviously the issue of the float at the current run rate that shrinks the float and that's a consideration that some companies think about. If you could just sort of walk us through how you're thinking about those other issues in view of all of them, that would be helpful please. Patrick Dumont : So all very good questions, all things we talk about all the time, consider with the board and we think about frequently. I think the key thing for us is we always look to invest for growth. So when you think about capital allocation, our primary conversation is how do we grow this business. We had a question earlier about new jurisdictions. We're looking at them. If you look at our Las Vegas sale, the fundamental driver of that was our ability to reallocate capital to faster-growing markets and new growth opportunities. And I think our investments in Macau and Singapore will prove out and that will ultimately allow us to grow those businesses, create additional cash flow, which ultimately will be used for either new growth or shareholder return. And so when you look at our balance sheet, we think being investment grade is incredibly important. We think it provides us with a strategic advantage. It reduces our cost of debt capital, which impacts our overall cost of capital and makes the financing of new projects more efficient and create better returns for equity. And also to be fair, we think when we go to new jurisdictions, it puts us in a more competitive position because we have the financial capability to execute the projects we're proposing. And so all of these things are very helpful for us as we look for our business. When it comes to capital return, I think the idea of shrinking the share count of something we've talked about previously, where we think there's a benefit to doing so. We think there is a positive gearing towards share repurchases. We've been very aggressive over the last couple of quarters. We like to continue to shrink the share count over time. And to be fair, we're also a dividend payer. We think that's helpful to shareholder returns. As a S&P 500 member, we think it's good to have the dividend as well. So I think we have the free cash flow to continue to return of capital. We're very happy about that given our investment opportunities. We have the balance sheet strength, be able to develop a new jurisdictions. And so I think you're going to see a balance between growth and our ability to return capital over time. I think the nice thing is when we're done with the Londoner and we're done with some of the other -- with these major innovation projects in Singapore, given the growth that we're seeing, we'll have the ability, hopefully, to return more capital. And we'll have the ability to increase our program and benefit shareholders. So you'll see us do that over time as our business continues to operate and grow. And so I think the idea of shrinking the share count, I think we're in a good position to do it. I think we have a lot of liquidity out there in the market. We have a very strong ability to execute. So I think we're in good shape in terms of our program and the way that we approach it. Operator : Your next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan Politzer : The first one on Singapore, the ADR was very impressive. Trends there seen overall, pretty good despite subdued visitation. Can you talk about -- are you starting to see the benefits of the existing CapEx that you put into the ground so far? And should we think about any disruption as it relates to Tower 3 that leading up to the completion next year? Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Yes, obviously, the money we put into the building thus far has done very well. You see results are -- when you look into a $2 billion-plus run rate, we're still under construction is more to do. Tower 3 is disrupted because we don't have the product from the room tower gaming isn't there. I mean, we're doing very well there. But again, I reference we have one hand tied behind our back and trying to get through it. So the road ahead still looks very positive to us. We think $500 million, $550 million, $600 million a quarter is in reach in the near future. And as we referenced earlier, once the entire building is complete in '25, I do see better numbers than ever on Singapore. It's a very rosy picture in Singapore. And yes, the CapEx we employed there is paying off very well. And we think it's going to continue to be even stronger in time. And as for EDR, while it's relevant, our cash sales are not the [indiscernible] is the drivers our casino business, especially our ongoing casino drop on the table side [indiscernible]. But it's a very positive picture. The disruption is real for the balance of the year into Q1 and Q2. But once that burns off and we had Tower game open the full complement of suites, I think you'll see Singapore just continue to be stronger and stronger. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then as far as it relates to the Macau property portfolio, obviously, there's a lot of CapEx going into Londoner. As it relates to the other properties there, is there anything that we should be thinking about as you start to wrap up Londoner later this year? Or should we expect 2025 to be pretty much disruption free there? Robert Goldstein : Yes. Good point. Londoner will wrap up again in '25. We should note that we are going to undergo -- there was a misunderstanding perhaps the one call about what happens in [indiscernible]. We are going to rehab some of the [indiscernible] because we always do. But it's typical, you won't see it in the numbers of the building will be hidden from the public view by doing the 4x4 traditional way you approach these things in our industry. So we will undergo a renovation of the room product at Venetian next year at the closure of Londoner renovation. Four Seasons pretty much is done. And then we'll sit and see what we want to do it in those things in Parisian and perhaps some Sand, but nothing beyond the should think about for the time being. Operator : Your next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : So Grant, you've been asked -- Grant, you've been asked a question on visitation twice now. I'm actually going to try to ask it a third time. So if we look at Slide 20, it shows that the group visitation was I think we've done about 1.3 million visitors in May and June so far. So I want to ask more about kind of what's going on with the group side? And just trying to figure out maybe has it -- do you think Macau has essentially gotten maybe too expensive? And is pricing certain groups out of the market. And I hope that kind of makes sense. Kwan Chum : Yes, thanks for the question. I think the two groups is a broader supply chain issue and the change in consumer habits, not just applicable to the Macau market, but to all the key markets that were significant to group markets prior to COVID. I think the other aspect that I should have mentioned perhaps I could get Wilfred to give his perspective as well as actually, during this period, we also have a series of significant announcements on policies that would boost visitation over time, even though in this current quarter, the impact may not be prominent, ranging from individual business scheme expansion to other types of visa relaxation. So I think we need to bear that in mind that things are actually moving extremely positively on the policy side to support future growth in visitation. Wilfred, maybe you want to add to that? Ying Wai Wong : Sure. I think the government, both at the Macau level and at the national level is monitoring the situation. And that's why you see the recent announcement that there's an additional 10 cities that people that qualify for IVS. And if you look at Macau traditionally, about 55%, 60% of the visitors use the IVS scheme. And this time, they added 10 cities, which has close to 60 million population. So you're increasing that catchment area. And I think the other measures such as a faster and nationwide application for business Visa will also benefit Macau. So it will take time for these policies to be promulgated, fully promulgated and known in these cities. So we are expecting some positive impact in the months to come. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

The presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Dan. Thanks for joining us today. The Macao market continues to grow. Total gaming revenue for the market grew 13% in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Mass gaming revenue grew 14% in the quarter compared to one year ago. We believe the Chinese economy will grow and flourish in the future. It remains steadfast that the Macao market will grow along with it. I believe that the Macao market gross gaming revenues will exceed $30 billion in 2025 and grow from there. The scale and quality of the assets we have built are second to none. We believe that our assets position us to grow faster than the market as growth expands beyond the premium customer segment. Our business strategy is predicated on investing in high-quality assets that also have scale. We've designed our capital investment programs to ensure that we will continue to be the market leader in the years ahead. We believe our approach will enable us to grow faster in the long-term, grow our share of EBITDA in the Macao market and generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our results in Macao. We delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter despite material disruption at the Londoner, which peaked during the third quarter. We opened the Londoner Grand Casino in the last week of September. We also opened 300, the first 300 Londoner Grand suites. We will introduce more Londoner Grand suites throughout the next three quarters. The total 1,300 Londoner Grand suites and rooms in service by Lunar New Year 2025 with a full complement of 1,500 suites and 905 rooms in service by Golden Week 2025. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and in-market share of EBITDA. Our objective is to capture a high-value, high-margin tourism over the long-term. We have a unique competitive advantage in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the Londoner in 2025, our product and management more pronounced than ever. We delivered another strong quarter in Singapore despite poor hold percentage. The results in rate base stands reflect the positive impact of our capital investment program and the growth of high value tourism. The growing appeal of Singapore as a destination is enhanced by the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar. As we complete the balance of our investment programs in the first half of 2025, there will be considerable runway for growth. Thank you for joining us. Let me turn it over to Patrick before we go to Q&A. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $585 million. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $2 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin from Macao portfolio of properties, excluding the Londoner, would have been 35.1% or down 110 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our margins at the Londoner were directly impacted by disruption of the Londoner Grand renovation. We closed the casino and had around 2,500 keys out of inventory during the quarter. Margin at the Venetian was 38.6% and we expect margin improvement as the Venetian Cotai Arena comes back online in November and as visitation to the market and grows in unrated play both increase in the future. Margin at the Plaza and Four Seasons was 39.7% for the quarter. As Rob mentioned, we continue to progress our Londoner Grand renovation program. As these products come online, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. We expect meaningful EBITDA growth and margin expansion in the future. Turning to Singapore. MBS' EBITDA came in at $406 million. Assuming expected hold on our rolling play, our EBITDA would have been approximately $78 million higher. The strong financial results reflect the impact of high-quality tourism investment and market-leading product and growth in high-value tourism overall. Had we held as expected in our Rolling Play segment, MBS EBITDA margin would have been 47.5%, 40 basis points higher than that of the third quarter of 2023. While we have made substantial progress on our $1.75 billion refurbishment program in MBS, we are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of these products, including from our tower gaming offering, which opened in September. The next phase of our capital investment program at Marina Bay Sands is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2025. This will support further growth in 2025 and beyond. Also, please note on Page 44 of our earnings presentation, we have provided estimated costs for our Marina Bay Sands IR2 project. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about investing in the long-term growth of high-value leisure and business tourism in Singapore. The original concept was in effect an expansion of Marina Bay Sands, including Arena. Our new program creates a full-scale integrated resort development with a full suite of amenities, including gaming capacity. We look forward to discussing that long-term growth driver in the Q&A session. Turning our program to return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $450 million of LVS stock during the quarter and our Board increased our repurchase authorization to $2 billion for future repurchases. We paid our recurring quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share in the quarter. In addition, our Board increased our annual dividend to $1 per share or $0.25 per quarter for the 2025 calendar year. We really look forward to continue to utilize the company's capital return program to increase returns to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now let's take some questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the results. One question two-part related to Macao. In the 3Q, if we look at contra gaming revenues as a percentage of gross gaming revenues, that percentage went down almost 200 basis points, how much of that is you're managing the business differently offering promotions differently than before? How much of that is just the market level of promotional activity is down? How much of that relates to mix between base, mass and premium mass? And then I have a follow-up. Patrick Dumont : So, Joe, it's a great question. And I think it's something we've been focused on for a long time. If you realize what happened in the quarter and the quarter before and actually in the first quarter, we've been impacted by disruption. And so we haven't really been able to manage our business with all of our capabilities. And so what we've been doing now is as things have been coming online and we've been focusing on managing the business for the future, we've been looking to become more efficient. So we'll look to improve our margins from managing the business more closely. And what you're seeing is a direct result of that. I think 1 thing that did impact our margins this quarter and they would have looked better was the fact that we took so many rooms out of inventory. So the majority of our, let's call it, our margin change and decline was related to the fact that that's a very high-margin business, and we still didn't have it because the rooms weren't there. So I think what you're seeing is the beginning of the cost discipline and the pricing power because of the assets we've invested in slowly coming into place. So I think it's a good signal for the future in the way that we're going to manage the business with discipline. I would like to turn it over to Grant for any additional comments. Grant Chum : Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think, Joe, it's more that last quarter, I think, we mentioned that as we were preparing for the full closure of the old Pacifico Casino. We did deploy some tactical measures to manage the transition of customers to the other properties. And we did that very carefully during second quarter. But for the third quarter, we're really back to our core strategy, which is we compete on the basis of our products and the content that we bring despite the fact that, obviously, third quarter, our disruption actually increased, like Patrick referenced, with many more rooms out of inventory. But we stick to our core strategy and we had a very strong quarter in how we managed customer reinvestments and still maintain market share relative to the second quarter despite rising disruption during the quarter. And despite the fact that the base mass did not recover as strongly as the summer months normally would indicate. So overall, it was a very strong margin performance. And obviously, we're very pleased that we managed to actually grow EBITDA sequentially despite the fact that the market GGR is down marginally against second quarter. Joe Greff : Thank you. And my follow-up question related to Macao, obviously, Golden Week was pretty strong October, for the most part, has been better than expected. Can you talk about what you think the drivers of that better-than-expected performance? I'm assuming it's probably better-than-expected for you guys as well. But how much of that is driven by the increases in equity prices locally? How much of that is seasonally strong events like Golden Week or New Year's typically see a step change is a little bit stronger than maybe typical seasonality? Any kind of comments about how the typical Macao consumer is behaving since the quarter ended, given all these generally more encouraging than not trends thus far in October? Thank you. Patrick Dumont : Yes, Joe, I think we're not going to talk too much about the current quarter just because we have a policy of not doing that. But I think directionally, we're very pleased about the quality of people we have coming into our buildings, both in Macao and in Singapore. And I think that there's some real opportunities going forward as our new product comes online, and people continue to spend their buildings. And I think even with the disruption that you're seeing, you're finding that the consumer, high-frequent, high-value tourists is coming to our properties and recognizing that there's a great experience to be had there. Entertainment definitely plays a big part of that. Entertainment has been super important for us in both markets. And we continue to look to schedule entertainment and take advantage of entertainment as it occurs in the market, even if it's not scheduled by us. Joe Greff : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thank you. Maybe turning to Marina Bay Sands. It's been hovering from an EBITDA standpoint around $450 million to $500 million for the past couple of quarters. Can you just remind us of the cadence of disruption, some of the work going on to add suites and how that might subside and then build into next year? Patrick Dumont : Sure. So just to give you a sense, during the quarter, we had about 1,600 rooms available versus about 2,800 rooms available last year. So there's pretty substantial disruption going on just from a room count standpoint. We also have some casino floor work going on, which is disruptive. We did just open up some additional salon capacity there. So I think by the end of September, we should have about 27 newly renovated salons. So there's just -- there's a lot of stuff happening. I think we did Tower 1, Tower 2. We did what we call our paiza area. We just introduced Sky Gaming, which is something that we've ever had before, which was actually granted us as part of the development agreement for IR2. We've redone some dining and updated some retail. I think the biggest disruption is really Tower 3 that's ongoing. And hopefully, by the end of the quarter, we'll add another 150 rooms. We'll see how that goes. But our biggest disruption right now is we have a, one of our casino floor areas is kind of mid-flight. And so that's disrupting a little bit the casino operation. But I would say that by middle of next year, hopefully, we're going to stop talking about disruption. I think my dream not talking about disruption at this point. Robert Goldstein : Yeah, I think by the country's point, by May of '25, both Londoner and Singapore pretty much are clear sailing. We're going to stop telling you that all the rooms are innovating, all disruption, all difficulties. It all comes to a head, and no more excuses. We'll start seeing I think some stellar results that will reflect the end of disruption in the beginning of making more money both in Singapore and Macao. I think Singapore is it's gone through a lot. It's amazing how it's done in spite of this, but Londoner having returned from that place. I can't wait to see a finished employee open, but the casino floor is very, very exciting work done. Patrick Dumont : I would like to just point out, if you look at our earnings deck, you can see some of the results for renovation on Page 40, Page 41. You can kind of see the quality of work there. I'd like to give a big shout out to our design team. We don't really produce anything like this in our company's history. Our customers are taking notice. You can see that by the high-quality customers we have coming in, the ADR that we have, the demand we have, the reviews we have for these rooms, the customer feedback very proud of what we've done in Marina Bay Sands. And if this is what we're able to do with this level of disruption, we're very excited about the future and the trajectory of the business. It's really amazing how strong the market is, how quality of tourists is coming into Singapore and the fact that they are really interested in coming to Marina Bay Sands. And so I think the investment has been very positive, and we're very happy about it. But unfortunately we're still talking about disruption. Stephen Grambling : And maybe as a follow-up, just on Marina Bay Sands, realizing that you put out the number, the updated numbers in terms of capital spend on IR2. I guess, has the scope changed at all? Are there any updated thoughts on how you think about the returns on that project potentially versus other projects, realizing that you'll probably get into this both later this year and next? Robert Goldstein : Well, obviously, the biggest change that you may be aware of is that there's a full casino amenities that's built. No longer just a hotel supporting IR1. And, so that's obviously, the biggest change is that. And I think you'll see it from the design there, it is laser focus on the premium mass segment. We believe this is a market that has grown to what $6.5 billion of GGR probably in '24. We believe we can easily get to $11 billion by quarter end. So this project reflects a lot of capital being directed at a very, very strong customer segment and a unique asset. It's a unique market that is stellar and it's unique. There's barriers to entry. There's a proven market. We'll guess who the customer is. We've been there for 14 years. So we feel very, very confident that these results are going to be terrific by we've told you before we expect IR1 to get to 2.5 billion and we believe this new building can make, in excess of $1 billion on top of that. So we're very confident that we've built the right thing in the market and its unique, location destination to our business. Like, you have a tested market, you know the competition, you know the government, you know the infrastructure, barriers to entry. So the biggest single change, obviously, is a full blown casino as opposed to just a hotel. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. That's it for me. Look forward to seeing it in November. See you. Operator : Up next, we have Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. Last week, investors heard a bit about some pressure on luxury spend from the Chinese consumer. I wonder if you could talk about what you might be seeing there and how much do you think how much overlap is that with, you know, your premium mass consumer? Robert Goldstein : Robin, let me just talk about that for a second. I think we're I think everyone should be impressed the resilience of Macao. We all know what's happening in China and the very confidence will return to a stronger place in the near future. But the fact is Macao is performing showing growth and strong growth, I think, despite the economic environment there. Hopefully, we'll see more, insight to the government's perspective on the economy in the near future. But unlike retailers, you're right, has struggled and we struggled as well with our top end retail, retail in general in Asia, there's no disputing until the LVMH numbers, [indiscernible] numbers, caring numbers. But it has not been a similar path for gaming in Macao. Macao is showing growth, double-digit growth in the quarter. It's very -- it's very exciting if this continues. I think it will. I think we'll exceed $30 billion plus next year. We're waiting for the day when the base mass determines. And so our current assets speak very well to the, I mean, the Londoner completion and the Venetian will be talking to each other. I think, creates two most impressive assets in the market by far making billions of dollars in the future for us. But the real kicker comes when the basement does return because, as you know, our assets are built for scale and built for, you know, huge throughput. So but even when that happens, the world turns very, very sunny for us. But in the interim, unlike retail, unlike other consumer spending, businesses, Macao is proving very resilient and very powerful, and we're grateful for it. And you saw the numbers coming out of the market numbers for October, looked awfully good for the industry where we saw the first weeks of October. So it's a very positive story relative to other businesses operating in China. Robin Farley : Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And maybe just one quick follow-up is, with some of the stimulus that was announced a few weeks ago, did that change your expectation for timing of recovery in the base mass? Or in other words, where should investors maybe look to see that show up if you, in fact, if you think, you know, it will show up? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : I think it's I was in Beijing two weeks ago. I think it, first of all, it was very well received by everyone to see the government stepping in. It is wonderful and hopefully continues. But I think it's too early to predict where and when and how and how quickly. Again, I think it was great to see is that before the stimulus, Macao continues to show strong growth. And with our product offering, they will participate in that. When this thing shows up, how it impacts the customer, we hope it would be sooner or later. It will be all segments, but I think time will tell. We have I don't think we have any insights. Grant or Wilfred, do you feel differently about that? Grant Chum : Yes. Rob, I think the main point here, which you referenced just now is that Macao GGR remains very resilient before any of these stimulus measures have the chance to take impact. And I think that's very clear in the premium segments. And I think any economic tailwind we get as a market from the stimulus measures over time, obviously, will help the other segments, in particular, I think, base mass and retail, which are two very important segments for us. So overall, we should acknowledge this Macao GGR, Macao Gaming is a very big out performer in the whole consumer universe in the region right now. And that's powered by the premium segment, where we are extremely well placed with the great products that we bring online. But of course, as the economy gets better, as some of these measures have positive impact over time, we obviously expect the other segments, which are also important to us, will follow through and give us a further boost to what these assets can actually deliver into 2025 and beyond. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Okay. Grant Chum : I'll add a couple of points. The first thing is that the economic stimulus measures introduced by China are still unfolding, but the directional development is welcoming. We have confidence in the Chinese Mainland's economic future and we'll continue to invest in Macao's future. The second point is that in 2024, Macao has been rated by the Chinese tourists as the most desired destination out of the Chinese market. So we see that Macao will stand to benefit once economic activities return to normal. Robert Goldstein : Well said. Robin Farley : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is live. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to go back to IR2 to start. Thank you for the additional just numbers and disclosure there. Rob or whoever is right, obviously, an increase in the casino scope and capacity and what's always been a supply constrained market is pretty interesting. Any details that you can provide there in terms of how many positions or what form some of the gaming expansion may take? Or imagine if it's too early, when might we look forward to hearing some additional details like that? Patrick Dumont : We're going to publish the final details, over the next coming months, but the idea is that it has, casino gaming in the podium and Sky Gaming in the tower. Look, our goal with this tower is to make it something very different. This is going to be the most important gaming and hospitality building in the world. It's going to be the best hotel in the world. That's our goal. The best service, the best experience, the best F&B. Our goal is to create something that is really extraordinary and helps address the Singapore market, which we know quite well now, has been consuming some of our highest end products, over the last 14 years. And so we're very aware of the market segments that we're addressing. And so we feel like this is a project that will be very accretive to our overall portfolio and create substantial value to us in the long-term. What I can tell you is that it's a very robust program. So it will have, great food and beverage, great other amenities. It will have a public access component. It will have a Skypark, as you can see, its own version of the Skypark. It will have MySpace. So it's going to be a very important, globally significant asset, for tourism, but it's going to be very specific to a very high end segment that we're dealing with today, and so hence the investment. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thanks, Patrick. And then as my follow-up, if I could just turn to Macao, obviously, it was encouraging to see a bit of the market wide recovery in visitation. And I was just wondering if somebody could provide a little bit more color on how sort of visitation played out through the quarter. I think as we look back, second quarter things were light and kind of little soft relative to kind of where we sit in 2019. Clearly, sequentially that improves. So just what was behavior like as things improved? And what were you seeing from sort of the customer patterns on the visitation front? Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Grant, do you want to take that? Grant Chum : No, I'll take that. Yes, thanks for the question, Shaun. Yes, as you rightly pointed out, visitation improved in terms of the recovery rate in third quarter as relative to second quarter. So we're up to about 93% recovery versus 2019 third quarter. And actually, August, the visitations exceeded 2019 levels. This quarter, it was primarily especially when you look at it on year-on-year basis, primarily driven by day trip visitor increase. And probably as a result of that, but probably I think as a general macro conditions didn't translate as much as you would have expected into the actual spending, especially in the base mass and the retail. So what we saw in the third quarter is actually continuation of the strength in the premium segments. We had better visitations, yes, but that didn't necessarily translate into the base mass business or help the retail business to any great extent. But it's encouraging to see the interest and desirability of consumers to come to Macao. Clearly, the Sheraton keys being 2,400 fewer rooms available versus the prior summer didn't help us, but also frankly didn't help the market as a whole because that's a very large amount of inventory to be out of the market. So overnight, as it is, that obviously hampered that segment. And overnight, visitors typically spend multiple times what day trippers spend. But like I think Wilfred mentioned, Macao remains very desirable as a tourist destination for the region. And I think it's encouraging to see that come through just in the volume of visitations for the quarter. Shaun Kelley : Thank you, everyone. Robert Goldstein : Thank you, Shaun. Patrick Dumont : Thanks, Shaun. Operator : The next question comes from Carlos Santarelli with Deutsche. Please proceed. Carlos Santarelli : Hey, guys. Basically, just one question, but maybe two parts to it. I don't know if Grant wants to take this, but just thinking about the cadence of rooms coming back online in Macao relative from where we are today, what the total room count will be acknowledging some regular rooms got compressed to suites come Golden Week of next year. And then kind of bucketing the rooms out of service and thinking about the impact they've had on a good slide that you guys have in your deck that kind of shows EBITDA share in 2019 of about 34% and that trending at roughly 30% kind of this year. How much of that 400 basis point delta do you think returns with the rooms coming back online? Grant Chum : Should I take it? Robert Goldstein : Yes, please. Grant Chum : Yes. I think on the construction and the delivery of the new rooms, I mean, first of all, I think the team has done a fantastic job in delivering the assets back the way they have by the end of September, where we opened a new casino, Londoner Grand Casino as well as the get licensed for 300 the first 300 suites in Londoner Grand. I think it's important to understand that in the fourth quarter, we actually go down further in the total number of keys available during the quarter versus third quarter because we will be losing the rest of the Sheraton rooms and we will be staying in terms of licensed new suites at this 300 number for pretty much the whole quarter. So we'll actually reduce further in terms of key count by about 600 to 700 rooms in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So it's really only until January that we start to get a significant uplift in the critical mass of new suites and we hope to be above 1,000 new suites by January or at least by Chinese New Year in January. And then it just ramps up from there until May or middle of the second quarter to the full inventory of 2,400 keys. And by then, we'll be back up to over 10,600 keys or just on the 11,000 thereabouts by the second quarter. Obviously, the room inventory being out by so much does impact our EBITDA and EBITDA share. And to your question on the prospect for the EBITDA share recovery, I think, we're very confident that Londoner Grand and the whole Londoner Macao will deliver as we roll out the what is really, I think, top product at unprecedented scale. This Londoner Macao will be 4,400 suite hotel with about over 60% of the keys being suites. There's really no building like it in our industry in terms of that scale of quality and the offerings it has between the F&B, the arena inside of the actual building. So we're very positive about how this will help to drive our EBITDA and ultimately our share of EBITDA as it ramps up and 2025 unfolds and hopefully with some of these tailwinds that we just referenced earlier in the call. So, yes, we are very excited about how this asset will deliver for us. And to Rob's point, between Venetian and Londoner Macao, I think you've got two amazing assets that's really going to deliver for us, but also deliver for our customers. Carlos Santarelli : I appreciate that. Thank you. Grant Chum : Thanks, Carlos. Operator : The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please proceed. Brandt Montour : Hey, good evening, afternoon everybody. So first question in Singapore, the ADR reported RevPAR, but ADR specifically of $900 was staggering. I'm just curious, I know there was a lot of rooms out, with sort of the trough. It seems like in terms of rooms out of service, when we look at that ADR, you know, I'm trying to figure out, was it is there compression happening in that ADR because there are rooms out or is that number sort of, illustrative of the quality and the sort of higher level product that, you know, that you're coming out with, for that asset? Patrick Dumont : The answer is yes. So, the first thing is you can see the pictures. Hopefully, you have a chance to actually see the rooms in person. The rooms are extraordinary. The design is fantastic. The service levels are incredible and we get that feedback from our customers. And so the ADR is a direct result of the market's view of the quality of the rooms after the renovation. And, hopefully, the entire building will be like that by the middle of next year. We're very proud about it. We've made a lot of strides. We've done a lot of work. The team there has been phenomenal. It's been our goal to make that the number one hotel, in Asia and the world. And so we've been working towards that. Been doing a lot of benchmarking work and trying to figure out how to get there, which is unusual for a property of this size. I think actually one of the things that will help grow that ADR further is when IR2 is open and we have an arena. That arena is going to be an incredibly powerful tourism driver for the overall complex. Having a 15,000 seat live performance venue with great technology, great viewing lines and a great experience is going to be very unique things. And so the ability to schedule that asset, to program it, will drive a lot of visitation, not only to Singapore, but to Marina Bay Sands and will help us drive ADR further. So we feel very strongly that this ADR is a reflection of some compression. Very fair. We took rooms out of our keys out of the building. But more importantly, it's really, something that points to the quality and the service levels of this, newly renovated building. And we think it will grow over time as more amenities are put in around it. Robert Goldstein : I think, to be fair to us, I don't think compression is that big a deal. In every market, there is extraordinary product people have said, gamers and non-gamers. This is that product. What's happening in Marina Bay Sands isn't just a compression. Sure, a few more or less rooms help you, but I believe demand is going to continue to soar once they experience the product. There's just nothing like it anywhere in terms of the room quality, the food and beverage product, any and all this hotel, the architecture, the public spaces. It's the place people want to stay. We have to get 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 keys, you can sell them all easily at price that will continue to grow. I think it's really a testament to the quality of product and the strong leisure demand and gamer demand in the market. And it's just going to get better and better because Singapore is that desirable. Infrastructure, government, accessibility, it's a very special place. So we built a building that's going to be, for many years ahead, the most desirable place for everyone to stay at. So rates should again, just go up and up. And gaming capacity will, you know, obviously grow more gaming demand, but it's a very different place than anything else in Singapore. Brandt Montour : Okay. Thank you for that. That's helpful. And then a question on Macao, on the arena. You know, we don't talk about the arena as much as we hear about the casino floor and the Londoner suites. And I wanted to hear, you know, your level of excitement about that, arena renovation. And specifically, you know, when we think about '25, is there a calendar associated with that where we would expect periods where you can look out now and say, okay. Well, this quarter this quarter has, you know, a great slate of events and where it will be a needle mover or if there's a lag associated with sort of getting it, you know, up to the place that you'd want it to be? Patrick Dumont : So the great thing about entertainment in Macao is that it's a very important part of our premium mass business. And we use it and we have used it successfully to drive premium mass visitation. And we have programs that help sort of leverage that asset. It's been very successful for us all over Asia in terms of scheduling live entertainment. But, you know, the venue there is really an incredible one. Great visionary move by Sheldon early on to build that arena. And, you know, the updating is going to make it, more powerful. And so I think we're very excited about the types of programs that we can run using it. And there will be a schedule and it will be within our control, and it will allow us to create more visitation and better spend at the Venetian and the rest of the property portfolio. But Grant or Wilfred, I don't know if you have any additional comments you'd like to add? Grant Chum : Yes, I think, we have referenced it in the deck, but we are progressing very well on the construction, the upgrade for the Venetian arena. And it will relaunch actually towards the end of November into December. And we already have the first events lined up in terms of entertainment, but also sports. So that would get start getting some traction actually even at the end of this year. But we also should note like Patrick referenced on the entertainment offer in general, with the Londoner arena, with the 6,000 seat Londoner arena, we have been programming very actively even during the downtime of the Venetian arena or especially, I should say. And we did around 17 shows in the Londoner arena during third quarter and many of these shows actually did help us in driving the traffic and the spend. So we're very excited to have the Venetian Arena fully upgraded. I think it's going to be great for entertainment, sports, MICE, events. So it's really serving multiple segments and boosting the diversification drive in Macao. I think with the great setup there with the VIP boxes, with the backstage, the locker rooms and obviously the state-of-the-art technology, I think is going to be basically like a new arena launching. So we are very excited about that. But another point to know is we will be programming both arenas and sometimes there will be shows concurrently in both venues on both sides of the Strip. So we're excited to see how that could help our business too. So, yes, you will continuously see us showcasing new events in the calendar. There's already three events selling tickets now towards the end of the quarter and we are looking forward to do some announcements on some more major events before the end of the year as well. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks, everyone. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Daniel Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. First question on Singapore on IR2. Can you talk us a bit about the regulatory landscape and outlook? Remind us maybe in terms of when the licensing goes through as it currently stands? And I assume you expect this to remain a duopoly market or maybe even better, but is there any expectation for how you think about gaming tax rates as you underwrite the returns on this building? Patrick Dumont : Yeah. So I think for us, the way we model this is that we have a, we basically have a moratorium on the changes in gaming tax, until the early 2030s. And I think for us, I think, you know, we view this investment as a very long-term thing and we'd like to believe that we'll continue to add value to Singapore and that we'll continue to be a good partner to the government and accomplish the goals in tourism that are necessary. So I think from that standpoint, we feel like it's a very stable operating environment. It's a wonderful place to deploy capital. It has been a wonderful place to deploy capital. We feel, as Rob referenced earlier, that there's a stability there and, you know, a very strong trajectory forward for us. So I think as we look at underwriting this, it's a very long dated investment, right? It doesn't open for six years, hopefully sooner, but we'll see. And that's obviously pending government approval, along with, you know, the final pros that we need to begin by the summer of next year. But we think about this as a very long-term thing, and we feel very excited about what we can build there. The gaming is a nice add, but there's also a lot of things that are going to drive tourism that would be very beneficial to us as well, like the arena, like the hospitality, like the food and beverage to enhance the overall appeal of the entire complex. So I think for us, look at this in a very long term way, we feel like there's very high barriers to entry there. I think right now, it seems like the feeling is that we're, it's a duopoly market for the foreseeable future, and we certainly hope it stays that way. But from our standpoint, we look forward to the opportunity to invest in scale, and that's what we're doing. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then just turning to Macao, the promotions obviously came down quarter-over-quarter. I mean, as we think about getting back to those mid to high 30% type margins in Macao, is this really a function of recapturing shares, seeing more of the visitation come back or at least kind of gaming oriented visitation? Or is this really kind of you need the market to grow to get back to those levels? Patrick Dumont : Well, I think the first thing is, for us to get to high, you know, to get to the high 30s, low 40s margin, we need revenue growth, and we need all the segments to return. You know, right now, some of our segments have not returned, particularly the base mass segment, to where they were pre-pandemic, and we are built for that. Our investment is one for scale. We have the ability to service the premium mass segment very well. The Londoner is an incredible product. The rest of our portfolio has incredible products as well. But if you look at the scale and the amenities that we have, everything from food and beverage to the bus terminals to the grand entryways to the theming, we're very much able to accommodate leisure tourists. And so for us, you know, that missing visitation, if you will, from 2019 and also, you know, the lack of the base mass play is impactful to us. So the way, the way we would get to the higher margins is through revenue growth. That being said, I have to hand it to the team there. They've been wonderful in terms of cost discipline and being disciplined in the way that they spend money to ensure that we maintain our margins up against the current revenue that we have. But I think as we look forward, our investments will ultimately drive, higher value visitation, in the long run. And we firmly believe that. We see that historically and we've experienced it in other markets and in this market, particularly when we do high value renovations. So I think for us, you know, as visitation continues to improve, hopefully, as the base mass market continues to improve and as we continue to get our premium mass segment assets back online, you'll start to see a normalization of revenue and then a normalization of margins. Grant, do you have any additional comments? Grant Chum : I think you covered it hopefully. Thanks. Daniel Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. Daniel Briggs : Thanks, Dan. Operator, do we have any additional questions? Operator : Yes. The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please proceed. Chad Beynon : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've been asked a lot about Macao, but I'm going to add one more to the stack here. So, obviously you and the other concessionaires went through the whole retendering process two years ago and we've gone through the checklist of items including your industry leading employment and other items. But with the new Chief Executive coming into his position in Macao, and I believe a month or so, is there anything that we should expect in terms of market focus, concessionaire focus or is it kind of business as usual as they transition through that? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Let me say we're always very focused on making sure we're doing our job with the government and adhering to the things we were asked to do. I don't believe that new Chief Executive will change that, but we will stay focused and listen very carefully to make sure doing our part. We always do that historically in Macao. And we've always been, I think, a leading company as far as investing in Macao and hearing Macao's principle. But I don't expect to see radical change at all. I think it's going to be business as usual for the most part. Wilfred, do you have an opinion on that? Wilfred Wong : Yes. I think the concession commitment maps out a long term development focus. So all six of us have thought very carefully and comprehensively what we want to do under the guidance of the Macao SAR Government. And I think the change of at the top will not have material changes to the directional change, because what has been emphasized so far is that Macao really aims to diversify. We should invest in non-gaming. I think these directions will remain. We just feel that as Rob pointed out that as long as we conduct our business as usual and listen very carefully to what the government has to say depending on what happens in the next few years, we should be able to continue to operate favorably in Macao. Chad Beynon : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then separately one of your global competitors was recently granted a license in the Middle East. They presented some pretty favorable investment returns to investors in the past couple of weeks. They also mentioned that they expect competition in that region from others. So is this a region that you continue to study or are there reasons why this would be a pencils down, investment opportunity as you think about it? Thanks. Patrick Dumont : I think we're always looking at new investment opportunities, for Las Vegas Sands. I think it's a market that we'll continue to study and look at and we'll see how it goes. Chad Beynon : Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Operator : The next question comes from Vitaly Umansky with Seaport. Please proceed. Vitaly Umansky : Hey, guys. How's it going? Look I think I have two questions. First one for Patrick. When we look at Sands China and kind of cash flows coming in, how are you guys thinking about distribution of that cash going forward? Obviously, there this future CapEx requirements under the retendering process. There's other expenditures that need to take place, but there's also an intercompany note that's still outstanding between LVS and Sands China. There's also I think investors looking at Sands China and thinking about can China can Sands China get back to being a higher dividend paying stock, the way it used to be in the past. So maybe for Sands China, how are you thinking about capital outflows? And then I think for LVS as a whole, with the announcement and kind of the CapEx layout now for Marina Bay Sands, how are you thinking about number one financing for MBS Phase 2? And also what does that mean for return of capital to investors of LVS? And then maybe the second question is around -- Daniel Briggs : Wait, that was one question. Vitaly Umansky : Sorry, sorry, guys. Daniel Briggs : Keep going. Patrick Dumont : Keep going, Vital. You're good. Keep going. Vitaly Umansky : Yeah, just a question around New York. What your current thinking and thought process is around the New York licensing process. Patrick Dumont : So, really appreciate the questions. A couple of thoughts. So first off, in terms of SCL, you know, I think SCL is performing incredibly well given the disruptions there and I think we'd like to believe that EBITDA will grow meaningfully over time, you know, as will our cash flow. And so, you know, in years past, part of the pandemic, SCL was very shareholder friendly in terms of dividends. And, as you can see that LVS is actually buying SCL stock, as we can in the market because we have a lot of conviction about the value of SCL equity as well as LVS equity as you can see by the buybacks at the LVS level as well. And I think as we think about SCL, we're very hopeful that it will be a dividend payer in the upcoming year. We think that that's a possibility and we'd like to believe that it's going to occur. But again, that's up to the board there. And I think the, in terms of the note, I'd like to believe that's also something that could be repaid to the parent level at some point and provide some additional, capital allocation flexibility for the parent co. And we'll see how that goes and be able to hopefully maybe buy some stock with it, if that's possible. So we'll see. But I think in the long term, we'd like to believe that SCL becomes a dividend payer again. We think that makes sense for the shareholders there. At the LVS level, we'd like to own more of it and you'll probably see us do a little bit more of that. But in the long run, we think there's going to be a very high quality return to capital program coming out of SCL assuming the trajectory of the business, given the investment we've made and our belief long-term in the market. I think at the LVS level, there's a couple of things that you've raised there. I think first and foremost, I think when we think about capital allocation, we think about growth. You know, our highest and best use of capital is new ground up development. So you see us doing that, both in Macao as part of some of our concessional renewal work as well as in Singapore along with this IR2 development that has just a panoply of great amenities, including which is going to be, what we believe, the best hotel in the world and an unbelievable arena. So, you know, we think these are great investments that will create a lot of growth and growth and cash flow for our company. So that leads to your next question, which is how do we finance this? And our goal is actually to follow what we've always said, which is, raise some cost efficient debt capital. It's one of the reasons why we like being investment grade name. It makes our cost of financing efficient for new growth developments and we'll look to do that. And, you know, if you think about the proportion of debt to equity, I think it's pretty consistent what we've talked about. You know, let's call it in the, you know, 35% context of equity, and the rest will be financed, given the debt capacity that we have at the MBS balance sheet. And the great news is that we've run a little leverage of level, full leverage level there with the anticipation of funding an IR2 development. And so now that's coming to be. So we're prepared for it and we look forward to the opportunity to work with our lenders to create that financing facility, to allow for it to be built. So I think as we move forward, you'll see, a delayed draw term loan at the MBS level to fund the construction with equity checks going in as well over time. Over the construction schedule, we actually have construction schedule will be provided. Again, it's kind of illustrative. It's something that is a rough estimate today, but designed to give people a sense of timing of cash flows. And that's actually on Page 46 of the deck if you want to get a sense of kind of what we're thinking. It may not exactly be this, but this is context, you know, from what we can understand and see today. And so our goal is to, in effect, create the flexibility to continue to invest in high growth opportunities, continue to pay a dividend and continue to repurchase shares at both levels. And, hopefully, we'll be able to do that, but that's our plan. And then I'll turn over to Rob for New York. Robert Goldstein : What was it, I'm sorry, it's a long, the question was on New York that was the issue itself? Vitaly Umansky : Yeah, Rob, just kind of what the -- Robert Goldstein : Yeah, New York, just refresh my memory. Vitaly Umansky : The capital allocation. Robert Goldstein : Was the question on New York in what regard? I didn't hear the whole question. Are you there? Vitaly Umansky : Rob, it's just about what the current, yes, from your end in terms of what the New York process is and where do you expect it to go from here because there's been delays. Robert Goldstein : Yeah, yeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah, so the thinking right now is that the license will be submitted sometime in I mean applications for licensure sometime in the spring of '25 with a decision. This morning, I was told probably the first quarter of '26, but they have to make a decision. We remain interested in the process. One fine, I've always been the biggest advocate for New York and other jurisdictions. The only concern I have these days is the ongoing strength of online gambling, which you can't ignore what's happening in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Michigan. And I think it's for the markets. But, you know, we build capital intense business buildings that require long-term perspective. And I must admit that there's got to be some kind of way of thinking about how the online impact would be, not where you are in the US. It's just a concern and it's something I've been looking at closely. I'd love to be in New York with the right capital structure and the right licensure process. But that's the newest wrinkle, as far as the process, New York itself has really changed. They're still talking late '25, early '26 for decision. I just my personal thinking has been influenced somewhat by the last six months as I see the growth of online gambling. So there's some to think about as we move forward in any market where online gambling is possible. You know, I think sometime in next year or two, you're going to see online exceed land based revenues in New Jersey, which is pretty exceptional. Vitaly Umansky : Rob, sorry, does that mean if New York, for instance, were to legalize online gaming that you would have to reevaluate what your proposal would be for New York? Robert Goldstein : It goes beyond that. My concern is we don't know what, you know, our buildings take a long time as you see that Singapore they take years to finish. I need some understanding of how the market any market thinks that online gambling anywhere you go. If you're going to spend, time, if Singapore legalize online gambling, you make a stop and think about IR2. If any market does legalize it to think, what does it mean to me in my capital investment? And I think that it's New York or Michigan or Florida any place that's online, it makes you stop and scratch your head. There's going to be some resolution of the issue. I'm not saying they'll tell you definitively, but you can't ignore that possibility when you see the impact of online in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan and probably the other four states are coming online. You can't ignore the, the impact on land based revenue. Vitaly Umansky : Yes, that makes sense. Thanks for the update. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Okay. The next question comes from George Choi with Citigroup. George, your line is live. George Choi : Thanks very much. So we were at the Londoner Grand a few weeks ago and noticed that the minimum bets at the baccarat tables there, were noticeably lower versus the Londoner Casino. I just wondered if that is temporary or does that signal any difference in market positioning between the two phases? Robert Goldstein : I think it signals you more rooms above that. I was there, I guess, 10 days ago or so. I think what you're going to see, George, over time is the Londoner like Venetian will become the most dominant players in the market. No questions asked about it. No change in marketing. Just need to complete the product, get the rooms done on top. There's a lot of people in the building, but you need to get the right premium mass customer to achieve the minimum bets you want to achieve. I stand by we've done this now for -- we show Londoner, I think, five, six, seven years that began with Sheldon, the Londoner process. It finally completes in the spring of '25. I remain completely steadfast to my belief that it's going to dominate that in Londoner and the Venetian will dominate the market. I have no concern whatsoever. And the minimum bets when you count them, you'd be very happy with them as getting rooms above the building above the casino. In any building in the world that is gambling, there's always a complete I mean having the rooms connected to the casino, having easy access is always an essential element of success. So Londoner while it's open, it's not going to achieve the same goals as Venetian or the Londoner one to have the rooms open. George Choi : That's very good color. And as a follow-up, when the Londoner is fully open next year, how should we think about the EBITDA trajectory going forward at the neighboring properties, the Parisian Macao? Robert Goldstein : There was a question how it affects other businesses? George Choi : Yeah. That's right. Robert Goldstein : Yeah, from my perspective and the team, and Grant may have a different take on. I've always said that I think Londoner and Venetian will be the one or two players or two and one players, each making $1 billion. My goal is $1 billion plus for each of those buildings and the rest of the portfolio will be, you know, another $1 billion plus. That's my goal for our company long term over the next few years. And but again as Patrick referenced and Grant and everybody in this call, we need to see return to more base mass gaming. You saw the differential between visitation and gaming. In the past, visitation was a complete predictor of gaming revenue. That broke rank [indiscernible]. We're seeing lots of visitation, but not the gaming to a company. And that's a negative. I mean, there's no hiding from the fact that it disappoints yet a bigger base mass tail. I have full faith that China will figure out its economy. It's too important to the world not to. And as China recovers and base mass recovers, that our company, SCL, LVS will be the biggest recipient of revenue, margin and growth in Macao. It's going to happen for sure. And as Sheldon used to say, day follows night, night follows day. China will get back to a better place. It will recover. The accountants will recover. Macao will continue to grow in the 30s and beyond. And someday, we'll get back to $3 billion plus EBITDA. And those two buildings will stand very, very tall. Does it negatively impact the Four Seasons? Not really. It's a stellar small product. The Parisian as well. I think we have a lot of confidence that in the aggregate, that portfolio is unique and they all speak to each other. We have the ability to market within the portfolio. So again as long as we get stronger, it doesn't mean others get weaker. It just means there's more strength in the market. But I would tell you that the real upside of this company will be the day when, yes, we'll do very well premium mass, but when that base mass recovers, that tail will drive us to a whole new level of opportunity. And that day is coming. George Choi : That's very clear. Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Enjoy your reports, George. The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed. David Katz : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Golden Week for a moment if I may. You know, I would say that, you know, we, the street collectively had a set of expectations going into Golden Week. And, you know, the result turned out to be, you know, quite a bit stronger than that. And for better or worse to where we get our information, how those expectations are set. I'm curious where yours were and, you know, whether Golden Week turned out to be materially better than, you know, what you were looking for and exactly what the drivers of that were please. Robert Goldstein : So as typical, you know, we'll talk about this in 92 days. We don't talk about current quarter, on the earnings call, but appreciate the question. David Katz : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we'll open the floor for questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours. Daniel Briggs : Thanks very much. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Dumont, our President and COO; Dr. Wilfred Wong, Executive Vice Chairman of Sands China; and Grant Chum, CEO and President of Sands China and EVP of Asia's operations. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making those statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We will refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob. Robert Goldstein : Thanks, Dan and thank you for joining us today. We'll begin with Macao. The Macao market continues to grow. Gaming revenue for the market grew 6% in Q4 of 2024 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Mass gaming revenue grew 5% in the quarter compared to one year ago. We believe the Chinese economy will grow and Macao market will grow as well. Gross gaming revenue in Macao should exceed $30 billion in 2025and continue to grow. The scale and quality of the assets we have built are second to none and our access position enables us to grow faster than the Macao market in every segment. Our business strategy remains clear and constant. We are investing in high quality assets that also have scale. We've designed our capital investment programs to ensure that we will be the market leader in the years ahead. Our approach will enable us to grow faster in the long-term, grow our share of EBITDA in the Macao market and generate industry leading returns on invested capital. Why are we so confident in our future success? In a competitive market like Macao, our assets give us a strong advantage. The scale and quality of the room inventory coupled with our retail, dining and entertainment enables us to tailor our offerings to attract the most profitable customer service. Turning to our results in Macao, we do have a solid EBITDA for the quarter despite having 20% fewer rooms available in Cotai than we will have once the Londoner is completed by the second quarter of 2025. We opened the Londoner Grand Casino in the last week of September and operating 315 Londoner Grand Suites during the quarter. We will introduce more Londoner Suites during the next two quarters. Today, as the Lunar New Year begins, we have approximately 1000 Londoner Suites and rooms in service. The full complement of 1500 suites 905 rooms will be in service by May of 2025 finally. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and nongaming revenue and market share of EBITDA. Our objective is to capture high value, high margin tourism. We have a unique competitive advantage in terms of the scale, quality and diversity of product offerings. Upon completion of the Londoner in May, our product advantage will be more pronounced than ever. Moving on to Singapore, another strong quarter of $537 million in adjusted property EBITDA mass gaming has reached $746 million a quarter, reflecting a 71% growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 28% growth in just one quarter a year ago. The results of Marina Bay Sands reflect the positive impact on our capital investment program and the growth of high value tourism. The growing appeal of Singapore as a destination is enhanced by the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar. As you complete the balance of our investment programs in the first half 2025, there will be considerable runway for growth. Thanks for joining the call. I'll turn over to Patrick before we go to Q&A. Patrick? Patrick Dumont : Thanks Rob. There's something I want to mention before we get started with the details of the quarter. The fourth quarter tourism to the Macao market was impacted by the celebration and events in December that marked the 25th anniversary of the Special Administrative Region of Reunification with China. Macao EBITDA was $571 million for the quarter. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $22 million. When adjusted for lower than expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin for the Macao portfolio of properties excluding the Londoner would have been 35.1% or down 230 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our turnover rents in Macao were $27 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2024 than the prior year fourth quarter. Our margins at the Londoner were directly impacted by the reduction in available room inventory during the quarter. We will have approximately 20% rooms and suites on Cotai by May of this year and approximately 47% more rooms at the Londoner as we complete the Londoner Grand renovation. Margin at The Venetian was 36.7% while margin at the Plaza and Four Seasons was 37.2%. We continue to expect margin improvement as our revenues grow, as we use our scale advantages to better address the unrated play in the market and as we focused on managing our costs including refining our reinvestment with optimized cash flow. As Rob mentioned, we are nearing the completion of our Londoner Grand renovation program. Upon completion, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. We expect meaningful EBITDA growth and margin expansion in the future. Turning to Singapore, MBS' EBITDA came in $537 million. Assuming expected hold on a rolling play, our EBITDA would have been approximately $2 million lower. The strong financial results reflect the impact of high quality investment in market leading product and growth in high value tourism. Had we held as expected in our rolling play segment, MBS' EBITDA margin would have been 47.2%. We will have substantially completed our $1.75 billion reimbursement program at MBS by May of this year. We are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of these new products. We expect growth in the future as we continue to attract high value tourism to Singapore with our enhanced product offering. Turning to our program to return capital to shareholders, we repurchased 450 million of LVS stock during the quarter and paid our recurring quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Our annual dividend will increase to $1 per share or $0.25 per quarter for the 2025 calendar year. In addition, we purchased approximately 250 million of Sands China stock during the quarter and in January of 2025, bringing LVS equity interest in Sands China to approximately 72.3%. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's capital return program to increase returns to shareholders in the future. Thanks for joining the call today. Now let's take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Carlo Santarelli : Hey guys, thank you. Patrick, obviously you guys have been active in the Sands China stock. And when you look at kind of the valuation of that stock today, coupled with the announcement of the dividend increase, is your thinking changed at all around the way you allocate capital, perhaps maybe being more advantageous looking forward with respect to the SCL shares? Patrick Dumont : Look, I think we really believe in the SCL story. We've been big investors in growth in Macao for years. And if you look at our investment program, it's designed to grow our business and our strategic advantages there. And we've been investing to create growth for 2025 and beyond in every segment. Look, our view is that we want to execute against our massive asset base there and I think for us, the way we show that is not only through growth, but also through acquiring more shares. We want to own more of SCL and you'll see us be active in the market over time to do that. We really believe in SCL. We think there's real value in the future in owning the shares there and so we're going to exercise against that thesis. Carlo Santarelli : Very good, thank you. And then if I could just follow up, as it relates to MBS, there's clearly been a lot of change in the property. All the rumor models, all the things that you've been doing over much of 2024 and in the fourth quarter, you know, clearly across the math side, whether it's drop revenue on the table side, drop revenue on the slot side, you guys saw a very nice acceleration of year-over-year growth when looked at relative to the 3Q. How much of that do you think is, I don't know, maybe exogenous or maybe and I don't want to say one-time, but a result of some other things going on in the market versus how much of that is the successes of kind of the capital you put in and the fruits of that? Robert Goldstein : One thing I would say Carlo, it's not a one-time event. It's an ongoing event that keeps accelerating. I think you're right. It's a good observation. I look at these numbers non-rolling win and slot win is a $3 billion dollar run rate. That's pretty astounding. And I think it's a few things that are in our favor. One is a very strong market, but also really great assets are coming to fruition. So when you invest heavily in something is that good a market, you get the right thing, right place, right time, it all comes together. It's not a one-time thing nor is it peaked. The final product will be there this summer. It's an amazing place. I think you've been there recently and it just keeps on going. But you're right, the acceleration year-on-year is truly exceptional. But I think we're just at the beginning of a huge growth surge in Singapore. It's not going to end. We're the right place, right time with right product. Patrick Dumont : Hey, one thing I do want to say is, the key thing about Singapore and you've heard Rob and me and the rest of the team talk about this on many quarter calls, the key thing about Singapore is about the quality of tourism. It really is an unbelievable market in terms of the value of the tourists showing up there and we've been very focused on investment in the highest quality of assets to match that high quality of tourism. I think for us this quarter validates the investment thesis and the growth that's available to us in this market because of the strength of what's going on in the catchment area. And so when you look at Singapore as a market, it's incredibly strong and desirable. There's a growing high net worth population, there's growing high value visitation, there's a lot of business activity there and there's continued investment in strong tourism infrastructure. So from that standpoint it's a very unique market and we really believe in it. We think the highest quality cash flow in our industry. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you both very much. Robert Goldstein : Thanks Carlo. Patrick Dumont : Thanks Carlo. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. This is [indiscernible] for Robin. I know you don't talk about the current quarter, but I was wondering if you could take a few minutes to give us your overall take on the Chinese consumer. What you are seeing in terms of bookings for the upcoming holiday and more importantly, do you feel there are macro indicators that the base consumer could return to pre-COVID levels in Macao this year? How do you see that recovery? And then I have a quick follow up. Patrick Dumont : So I think first off, I think we're still talking about a $30 billion GGR market. It's the largest gaming market in the world. It's been growing. It looks like it's going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. We believe very strongly the strength of this market. We've been investing into it for that reason. I think it's very hard for us to point to a specific indicator of the Chinese consumer that is an indicator for our business since we represent such a small level of penetration into our core market, which is China. And so, from our standpoint, we sort of look at the market. Would we do better with a stronger Chinese economy? I think that's an easy thing to say yes to, but I think overall we're very happy with the direction of our business, our investment and hopefully as things progress over time, we'll be the beneficiary of a stronger Chinese economy and see our investments produce more cash flow. Grant or Wilfred, do you guys have any other comments regarding this question? Grant Chum : Macao: Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Robert Goldstein : Macao: Macao: Unidentified Analyst : Thank you all. I just have a quick follow up. Could you share your latest thoughts on New York license? If iGaming, you know, could be legalized there two years into construction, let's say as an assumption, sort of your thoughts how that changes the return profile of a potential casino in that market? Robert Goldstein : You've asked and answered my concerns. First, I believe in New York as a very strong market which is under consideration those companies a long time. However, the iGaming possibility, to me in any market that has land based gambling and has sports betting, iGaming seems inevitable. And so I think you have to agree with your comment that sometime during the construction phase you could be faced with iGaming competitor which dilutes the value of the product. So that's our conundrum and you said it well. The results coming out of neighboring states like New Jersey or Pennsylvania or as far away as Michigan underscore that concern. So you've asked and answered the question. Great market, we'd like to be there. The caveat is how do you deal with the ongoing threat which appears to me to be inevitable in a lot of states, especially those that have land based properties coupled with sports betting. I don't know why you wouldn't have iGaming sometime in the future. So that's our concern as we look at that market. You're absolutely correct. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Robert and Patrick, I want to start with just the Londoner. Obviously some of the disruption timing probably came in a little bit differently than maybe everybody thought. But could you just walk us through your thoughts about kind of ramp-up from here and how we should think about it? It's a pretty big margin drag. I think it's pretty understandable given the impact of hotel rooms on margins. But just help us think about maybe your thought process behind how that property should ramp in the next couple of quarters if you could? Patrick Dumont : Yes, you know, I think it's really interesting because I have to hand it to the team in Macao. They did a phenomenal job this quarter being disciplined in our reinvestment actually generating this much EBITDA with that many rooms out. We are an inventory, a room inventory driven reinvestment model. So we base our reinvestment on the scale of our ecosystem, the diversity of amenities, the quality of room product, the quality of experiences. And so when you're down 20% of your inventory, there will be a meaningful impact into your productivity because we carry the expense base, right? Our second largest expense is payroll, and that doesn't change and so we had less inventory to sell in the quarter. There wasn't disruption, there was just less inventory. So, you know, credit to the team for creating the quarter that they did in this market, given the competitive dynamics. But I think now that we start to get these rooms back across the quarter, these 2,000 rooms, think about it, it's two thirds of a Venetian. When you think about the productivity of the Venetian resort, the Venetian Macao, and the room count that it has and the number of tables and the scale that it has, imagine if two thirds of the rooms were not available and that's the case with the Londoner. And so they were able to create this performance without that inventory. The good news is it's coming online. Some of it is online now, and the rest of it should be online by May, as we mentioned in our opening remarks. And that should position us well to get to our ultimate goal, which is to have two properties that have an equivalent run rate. And maybe one day the Londoner does better than the Venetian because of the key count. But I think the opportunity is there for the productivity to really increase now that the rooms are becoming available and now that we've completed this renovation, which in our mind creates one of the best properties in the history of our business. And we're not just saying that because we did it, we think it's really good. So I think from our standpoint, we have the Venetian, we have the Londoner, we have the Four Seasons, we have the Parisian, we have this high quality portfolio and getting these rooms back online will enhance our competitive positioning, but also allow us to grow cash flow and EBITDA, because we're carrying the expense anyway, and now we'll have the inventory to sell. So I think it was pretty meaningful, but I do want to give credit to the team there for the quarter they put up. Grant, do you have any comments? Grant Chum : Yes, Patrick, like you said, the room inventory was at the low point during the fourth quarter. Like we said last quarter, it reached the lowest point, around 8,700 keys in November and December. And for the whole quarter, we continue to have the 315 Londoner Grand Suites. And then shortly after the year end, we got license for further 700 suites and keys. And so for this Lunar New Year, we have at our disposal just over 1000 keys to use from now on. We expect that the continued ramp-up in rooms to continue throughout the first quarter and the first part of the second quarter culminating the goal is to have the full 2405 keys fully operational by May Golden Week and we believe we can achieve that. Construction wise, we're well on track. It's a matter of statutory licensing at this point. Shaun Kelley : Thank you both. And then maybe just as a quick follow up, going back to New York, Rob, we did notice that New York did not include the casino licenses or the downstate casino licenses in the state budget figures. So we were just kind of curious. Does this imply, you know, as it may, especially given the timing of the fiscal year, that the downstate process is slipping further, at least for, I think, the third license that many of us are very focused on here for LVS. Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Hard to say. I can expect that you are, but I don't know you're right or wrong. I think it wasn't a budget. It wasn't a budget. I don't really know the answer to that, Shaun to be honest with you. It's hard to determine what -- I keep hearing it's going to be this June for the determination of a license by year end. Again, as you're saying, it's hard to know because they haven't been clear about this for a long time. Have to wait and see with you. Shaun Kelley : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Robert Goldstein : Sure, Shaun. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live. Brandt Montour : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, everybody. So, follow up on Shaun's question on the Londoner in the Pacifico Casino floor, especially which I know you owned, were you -- sorry you opened in September, but without many hotel rooms above it, I have to imagine it was hard to activate that casino floor in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense on how you activate the casino floor and if 1,000 rooms would be enough natural foot flow to actually create a buzz and get that asset almost sort of all the way up and sort of producing before you can get the last batch or is it specifically correlated with how many rooms are open? Robert Goldstein : I'm just laughing because the question to me is pretty simply where you in our industry, whether it's Macao or Las Vegas or Idaho or you have sleeping room above you is where you get gambling below you. So it correlates. The more rooms, the more gambling. 1000 keys is still a lot of people, I think. Yes, it can create a buzz, but that buzz will obviously increase as you have more keys. So 2000 is better and 2400 is better than that is enough. Sure, it's better than having 300, but again to your point, it begins with only 300 this quarter, then goes to 1000 during Lunar New Year and eventually get this spring to 2400 I believe. And then of course you've got rooms adjacent to it under the same roof and other phase of Londoner. Plenty of rooms there, more than most hotels have in any place else. So I think the results will speak for themselves. This has been a long hard process for the team over there, but it's probably coming to a head and we believe, and will always believe that assets drive results. This asset is extraordinary and yes, we'll see some buzz in February, March, you'll see more in May, but we're in this for long haul and Londoner will be a world-class asset and take its place alongside some legendary performers, just like Marina Bay Sands did and Venetian did. Brandt Montour : Okay, that's super helpful. And then a follow up question would be on the Thailand opportunity. I know it's really early, but I'm sure you guys have done plenty of work so far on that market and maybe you could just talk high level about that opportunity versus your large coming second build out investment in Singapore and sort of how you think about those two markets vis-\u00e0-vis each other, and if they sort of are totally separate opportunities that wouldn't have to be considered in relation to each other? Patrick Dumont : So a couple of things here. So I think first off, Thailand is an unbelievable tourism destination. It has very desirable attributes, great culture, great food, just beautiful scenery. It's a great place to visit and I think it has a great opportunity to add destination resorts and create a very large-scale industry there. The great news is there's an enormous tourism base there already and it's separate and distinct from people who go to Singapore. Is there overlap? Sure. Do people go back and forth between Bangkok and Singapore all the time? Absolutely. Is there an argument that it actually just strengthens our ecosystem because people have more choice within our environment? There's an argument for that. Although I would say that, I think they're both different offerings. I think if you look at what we have in Singapore, it's specifically tied to the highest level of high value tourism. It's rarefied air when you look who's in that environment and the type of consumption that's there and the type of both business and leisure tourism that takes place. I think in Thailand, it's a completely separate market. I think there will be some overlap, inevitably because people are going to want to see it on both sides. But as a practical matter, given the population base, the visitation they have today and where people are coming from in terms of inbound tourism, it's a separate and distinct opportunity. And that's how we see it and we're excited about it. But there's a lot that has to be done, a lot that has to be learned before it's something that we can evaluate. That being said, it would be great for our industry and it'd be fair, great for LVS if it's possible. Robert Goldstein : Can I say one thing about your comment about that the mix of those two markets? Think about this for a second. There are about 4 billion Asian people, which I think is about 300 billion more than the entire United States. As I look out the window here in Las Vegas, there are more casinos in Las Vegas than there is in all of Asia. Okay? So my point is there is a whole lot of people in Asia, high propensity to gamble. I wouldn't worry too much about Singapore doing very, very well. There's just not enough capacity. [Indiscernible] used to say, like to build a strip in every Asian country if possible. The point being we'll do very well in Singapore for years and years to come. We'll make all kinds of money there, but Thailand is an extraordinary market and it will do very well. Again, Las Vegas must have, I don't know, 200 casinos. There are not 200 casinos in all of Asia. So the concern about cannibalizing, I think, is not necessarily even valid to think about. Four billion people in Asia are looking for a place to go. Thailand will do very, very well, but still will Singapore -- so looking on. Brandt Montour : Excellent. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Daniel Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to touch on Venetian. Last couple quarters, it looks like mass volumes have slowed a bit there. Can you maybe talk about a little bit what's going on with that property relative to some of your other properties in the market? And also I think the arena recently opened there. So, any kind of incremental, incremental details on how that's been trending? Patrick Dumont : One thing I do want to mention, I think the Venetian really is for us the benchmark in Macao and we're very focused on growing revenues in Venetian and maintaining margin there and generating a lot of cash flow and we think it has the capacity to do it. In the first half of the quarter, things were going great and things were accelerating. In the second half of the quarter, there was some disruption in visitation because of what I mentioned earlier on in the prepared remarks, which is the 25th anniversary of the handover. And so there were a lot of things going on in this quarter and one of the things that went on is that base mass was impacted most meaningfully by that event and by that 30-day period. And so, I would not necessarily look at this quarter as representative of the base mass run rate associated with The Venetian going forward. Grant, if you have anything else to add? Grant Chum : Yes, that's right. And I think with the premium mass, I think the business continues to be very strong there. Also, I think you have to consider that most of the lodges in Venetian, together with the Four Seasons, it plays as a complex for that segment. So, you can see how strong the Four Seasons Plaza was in the non-rolling segment this quarter, up 26% against prior year. So, I think you should look at it in a composite as patrons move around between the two properties. But the base mass as Patrick said was affected during the quarter. We had a very strong first half of the quarter and then it softened thereafter. As it regards to the Venetian Arena, we launched a fully upgraded arena in late November. We've had a few events, some of them more like a warm up event. During fourth quarter we had concerts and then we also hosted the NBA Legends game that accompanied our announcement of the strategic collaboration with the NBA over the next few years. So the facility gives us I think very strong scope to program content for our calendar, entertainment, sporting events, mice groups and at the same time we'll continue to use the Londoner Arena. And really this is another example of the scale advantage and the product diversity that we have. We've learned how to program the Londoner arena successfully. We'll be hosting some major concerts in the Venetian Arena as well as the NBA games in October in 2025. So, we'll have the full flexibility and benefit of having these two great venues for different types of programming and events. And we believe that it's going to support the growth of the business in 2025 and beyond. Daniel Politzer : Got it. That's helpful color. And then just a follow up. I think for the Londoner all in, you'll have invested around $8 billion. How do you think about I guess the return on this? Is this consistent with some of your other properties in the mid-19s? And if not why would that be? And then how do you think about the timing in terms of the ramp and do you need to see that base mass business come back in the market given that you've certainly invested in making this property a more premium mass centric? Patrick Dumont : Yes, so I think the key thing here to note is, depends on how long your IRR measurement period is. And so I think for us when we first opened the property it had a ramp-up period where if you sort of looked at it at peak it was at I think a billion one run rate of EBITDA. And so if you sort of drew your trend line off that it would be an unbelievable investment. Then events overtook that measurement and we realized we needed to reinvest and reposition which we did. So if you think of this as a 30-year asset, which we do and you look at the potential cash flow generation out of this asset given its positioning, its theming, its amenities and its structure which is not replicatable anymore in Macao, we feel like this is a very high return potential asset and that's why we put the capital into it. If you look at its structure, you look at the room count, you look at the organization of the casino floors, of the retail and of the amenities around it to support the activity of our patrons, there's nothing like it. Right? And so we feel like this asset will provide very high returns over time otherwise we would have done it. If the model didn't work, it wouldn't happened. But I think it depends on how you view the market and how long you view the asset to be running in this way. But we've done the major structural lift, so we think we're in good shape to carry this asset forward for years to come. Robert Goldstein : Again, one additional comment to Patrick's. I think you made a comment that's BMS [ph] centric I would disagree. It's market segment is open to everything. What makes these buildings so powerful like the Londoner innovation successful buildings in the world get everybody. They get the basement, the grind, the pre math because they have all kinds of capacity. They've got sleeping rooms, they've got retail, they've got entertainment and they've got just capacity. What makes it special versus some of our competitors, they don't have that scale capacity of lodging and gaming. This Londoner thing better have it all segments to get the numbers I want to see get to which is far beyond $1 billion. And I think the answer is, I think Patrick said it well, it's a time issue and how you view the market. Had we not fixed the Londoner it wouldn't be competitive [indiscernible]. [Indiscernible] Central couldn't withstand the pressure and face market. Londoner will not do well, do very well. They'll do well with not just premium mass, the base mass drawing everything it's going to dominate, just like The Venetian. Venetian didn't get there simply with high rolls, you get to, you walk in, it's all poker, there's base mass, there's all kinds of lodging, all kinds of retail, all kinds of food and beverage. That's how we modeled the Londoner. That's why it's going to be a billion plus dollar building when it gets fully operational. Daniel Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. That's really helpful. Robert Goldstein : Sure. Daniel Briggs : Thanks Dan. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live. Chad Beynon : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Rob, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was a decline in the turnover rent. It looks like I believe pretty much all of that may have been at the Four Seasons. The other properties in Macao and in Singapore had some nice increases year-over-year. So firstly, I just kind of wanted to ask about that if that was something related to maybe some VIP business that was there last year or anything structural in the property? And then secondly, I know the market and everyone are expecting visitation and GGR to be up next year. Is there anything in the model that would put a lid in terms of what's happening with retail given where the base is right now? Thanks. Robert Goldstein : Yes, I'm going to defer to Grant Chum, who should answer this question. Grant? Grant Chum : Yes, thanks, Rob. Yes, the turnover rent change is largely related to the Four Seasons Mall last year, or I should say 2023. That was a record year. That was an all-time high for the Four Seasons more in terms of retail sales coming out of that post-COVID spend. So when you look at year-on-year comparison, 2024 against 2023, the turnover rent is heavily impacted by the sales at the Four Seasons being down year-on-year. And there's nothing structural, there's nothing one-off about the 2023. I think it's just the way the sales evolved straight after the pandemic and of course the softening macro environment thereafter. I think we're strategically very well positioned for the retail sector. Over the next 18, 24 months, we are opening a number of very significant flagship stores across a number of the major brands. You've seen the first of these opening in November in Four Seasons with the Audemars Piguet AP House, the largest in Asia. That will continue in 2025 with some other major flagships and also significant store openings. So we feel that between now and end of 2025 you're going to see a further strengthening in the tenant mix and the product offering in the mall. And hopefully that positions us very well for the eventual recovery in the macro and the retail sales that will come with it. Chad Beynon : Great, thank you very much. And then back to the U.S. I know we talked about a few potential legislation positives or opportunities. Anything change in terms of your view on Texas, the timing of that and kind of where things stand down there. Patrick Dumont : So as we said before, we think Texas has a great potential as a market for our business, but there's really nothing to report at this point. The session just began and we'll see how it goes. Chad Beynon : Great, thank you very much. Daniel Briggs : Thanks, Chad. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Joe Stauff from SIG. Joe, your line is live. Joseph Stauff : Thank you. Good afternoon. Rob, Patrick, Grant. I had two questions on MBS, please. One, you know, where are you seeing the say the biggest early returns from your investments thus far. I'm wondering if it's more heavily weighted towards a particular metric. You know, longer stays, new customers, higher spend. And then my second question really is on a longer-term basis for MBS for the three towers as we think about the ramp in EBITDA, Patrick, you had mentioned Singapore certainly is rare fried air, but could you comment on longer term what these new investments and where you think the biggest opportunity is for you to ramp EBITDA? Patrick Dumont : So I really appreciate the question. I think for us Marina Bay Sands customer base is very diverse, diverse markets around Singapore who all want to do business in Singapore or all want to go there for leisure purposes. And the spending habits are very powerful and I think the biggest growth that you'll see is if you sort of look across our business, it's in every facet. You know, credit to the team there, they've done phenomenal work this quarter and utilizing the assets that were put into production and they still don't have everything in inventory. And so I think the key thing here is if you sort of look at our gaming growth, it's been fantastic, particularly on the non-rolling side, absolutely phenomenal. And in both segments in terms of slots and tables, but also on a rolling basis it's been very strong. I think the other thing is if you look at the non-gaming side, it's been extraordinary. If you look at the across-the-board things have performed incredibly well. We just had a question about retail in Macao, but if you look at the retail in Singapore, it's performed incredibly well and shown to be very resilient. So I think the offering there is quite strong, addresses the market properly and I can't really point to one thing to say that, it's the way to measure the investment. I think it's a very holistic approach. Rob earlier mentioned that we address all segments. I think in Singapore the market is filled with high value tourists and we really address with a variety of amenities something that's very unique and that experience in our ecosystem is not replicatable and so I think we get the benefit of that. And I think you see the results in our EBITDA this quarter and I think there's more to come. And I think when we get the rest of Tower 3 online and we get some of the other investments fully in the rooms completely done, I think you'll see the power of this building as people start to figure it out. Robert Goldstein : I think that building, have you been there? Have you seen that building? Patrick Dumont : Joe was there with us. Robert Goldstein : Okay. If you've been in the building, you see it, there's just nothing like it. And the epicenter of affluence in terms of it's got the room product, it's got the sweet buy, the food and beverage, it's got it all. And I think for people who can afford the experience and want to gamble, which is a lot of people in Asia, it's just a very unique product. It's going to capture all those people. It's also got a wonderful place to be which is Singapore itself. So, I think we're in the right place, right time to keep growing that and we measure obviously the profitability and the profitability is soaring, but I think you're just and the best is yet to come. I mean Singapore is just the beginning of its run. As Patrick alluded to, the quality of asset finishes, et cetera, are extraordinary and it's hard to replicate. So I think we have every confidence we're just beginning of this thing, not the end. It's not aberrational, it's just the way it's going to be. Singapore is an exceptional asset, A very strong market, lots of countries driving it and also it's the beneficiary of lots of great publicity and awareness of how people saw MBS. They see it on newspapers, magazines, the Internet. It's very powerful, a real brand to us. So I think you're at the beginning of an exceptional growth story in Singapore as the asset matures this summer. Again, I think the future is very, very strong. Joseph Stauff : Thanks very much. Robert Goldstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from George Choi from Citigroup. George, your line is live. George Choi : Thanks for taking my question. First of all, we noticed the introduction of some new baccarat side bets since late September in Macao. And would you please comment on how popular they have become and its potential impact on Holiday's longer-term. And I have a follow up after this. Thank you. Patrick Dumont : George, I got to tell you, they're very popular with me. I think they're great. Robert Goldstein : Unfortunately, you have to bet that much. [Indiscernible] everything. George, I think you know the story. I appreciate the question. It's a very, very powerful possibility. It's not a reality yet but the side bets as you know, are akin to parlay bets or you know, wages on the sports betting it's more of a profit, more of a long shot type bet which people gravitate to. Some people like it, the house advantage is much higher than the flatbeds, the usual bank player type player. So for the industry we're at the forefront of this, we want to offer those bets and hopefully the customers will come towards them. It's got great potential. It's early days yet. But as you know, this baccarat run is our primary business. It can be very, very powerful in the years to come if the customers decide to take, higher long run type bets because they do benefit the house. No surprise. There was an article recently, I think it was a journal about sports betting and parlay betting. It's akin to that. So we're hopeful that more people will partake in that. It helps drive the curve and it'd be very advantageous for those companies who are baccarat centric like Las Vegas Sands. Patrick Dumont : And just to sort of. Yes, I think the key thing here is it's early days yet and so I think our goal is to continue to evaluate how the market is adopting and actually choosing to utilize those bets, but we'll see. George Choi : Thank you very much. And obviously very encouraging to learn that you have 700 more suites at Londoner Grand open after the year end. I'm just wondering if you have opened any new premium mass capacity at the Londoner Grand? Patrick Dumont : On the gaming floor? George Choi : Yes. Robert Goldstein : Grant. Grant Chum : Yes, yes, we did. We just opened. Yes, just around the time of the Lunar New Year, we opened a new premium mass salon on level one of Londoner Grand. So we're obviously ramping up on the gaming side in sync with the room inventory. George Choi : Thanks for your comments. Robert Goldstein : Thanks George, as always I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line is live. Steven Wieczynski : Yes. Hey guys. Good afternoon. So Patrick or Robert, maybe even Grant, if we go back to the Londoner, obviously you have that coming back online over the next couple months and obviously your competitors in the market know that property is coming back online as well. So, you know, the question is, have you seen any changes in the promotional activity from your competitors in the market in anticipation of that property coming back online? Patrick Dumont : I think first off, I think we've mentioned this in the prior quarter's call. Macao has always been incredibly competitive and very promotional. And I think to the team's credit there, they've been very disciplined. You know, when we closed the P6 casino, there was some promo-ing there to move people around and we talked about that. But I think it's a practical matter. We're very focused on leveraging the assets that we invest in for the long term to drive customer visitation and patron experience. And I think for us the goal is to be disciplined in the face of this market, which by the way, is ever evolving. If you go back more than a decade, there were different segments that are in favor, different ways that people thought about those segments and invested against the opportunity and I think that's what we have today. I think we have a very competitive market as we've always had. I think people are investing against the segments in the way they think that will create the most profit for them. And I think for us, we're doing the same thing. But our model has been pretty consistent, which is about investment in product, investment in a great team, great service levels, and focusing on the way that we can drive margin and cash flow. Grant, do you have any other comments you'd like to add? Grant Chum : I think you said it well. I think we remain focused on EBITDA generation and the profit share. And if you look at the third quarter results, when all the results came out from all of the operators, I think those who gained revenue share didn't necessarily see that translate into profit share gain and I think we continue with our strategy. I think it remains competitive regardless of whether we're bringing Londoner Grand suites online or not. I don't think that changes. I think that's a constant. And so our constant is that our strategy remains leveraging our core products, leveraging the quality and scale of what we have and the coming online of the rooms and Londoner Grand is the perfect opportunity for us to really drive home that strategy. And we really look forward to having the full inventory in place and then from May Golden Week into the summer and for the rest of the year we hope to see that really deliver for us. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, thanks for that, guys. And then real quick, Patrick, you obviously brought up the President's visit in December. I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do this or not, but just wondering if you guys have some sort of estimate on what the potential impact, from his visit was on your properties, during that time frame. Patrick Dumont : Unfortunately, I really can't give you an estimate. All I can tell you is that there was a noticeable change. But the important thing is that we're looking forward to a grade 2025. We're excited about the opportunity. We feel really good about where our assets are positioned. We have a great team; we have great service levels and we're excited about what we can do now that we're finally getting all of our assets back in inventory. We're looking forward to it. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Patrick Dumont : Take care. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. If there are no other questions at this time, thank you ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
